<h1> Football cannot continue to be held to ransom by Covid – it is right to cut back on testing </h1>
<p> Unvaccinated footballers need to have their jabs or face consequences of not playing – or even not being signed by clubs </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Jason Burt <div>Chief Football Correspondent</div> <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:43pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>The <a>decision to end the twice-weekly PCR testing regime</a> and place a greater reliance on lateral flow tests is the right move and a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Already English Football League players no longer take Covid tests on match-days, in an attempt to prevent late postponements. Testing now only happens if a player shows symptoms.</p>
<p>The danger is that the disease will break into a team bubble, but we need to look at lowering the bar to return for asymptomatic players who test positive, while still shielding those who are vulnerable.</p>
<p>But that discussion, led by the club doctors and Premier League medical experts, has to take place.</p>
<p>The same will occur in other walks of life, and the medical protocols that exist in football mean that it can be in the vanguard and show the way for the rest of society and other industries. Football can be an example of how to make it work.</p>
<p>Among the players unavailable to play after testing positive, the vast majority are vaccinated and many are asymptomatic. Is their health really at risk and are they a threat to others, especially if they remain within their bubble?</p>
<p>Vaccination is not a panacea. It does not prevent infection. But the science shows that those who are fully vaccinated are far less likely to be seriously ill and also, crucially, the transmission rate to infect others is lower.</p>
<header> <h1> Ralf Rangnick struggling to ease tensions at freefalling Manchester United </h1> <p> With around a third of senior players eyeing the exit and morale low, there is a feeling of a club 'treading water' before another overhaul </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Ducker, Northern Football Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:36am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ralf Rangnick is facing a battle to quell dressing room unrest at Manchester United with confidence and morale on the floor and around a third of the senior squad open to leaving Old Trafford in pursuit of regular football or a fresh start.</p>
<a>“bunch of whinge-bags”</a> and midfielder Scott McTominay revealed that Rangnick had ordered the squad to sort out their poor body language on the pitch,
<a>defender Luke Shaw pointed to a lack of togetherness</a> and motivation in the wake of the Wolves debacle.
<p>But <a>Rangnick has so far struggled to drive improvement</a> in the five weeks since replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on an interim basis and inheriting a raft of problems from the former manager.</p>
<p>“Yes, he needs time, but again after the first game I haven’t seen a real shift in that confidence and those performances from individuals to elevate us as a team.”</p>
<h2>The players that want out - and those that can't get out</h2>
<p>Anthony Martial has been frozen out but told he will be going nowhere unless potential suitors agree to pay a loan fee and all of the France striker’s £200,000 a week wages.</p>
<p>As things stand, England goalkeeper Dean Henderson has been informed he will not be allowed to leave on loan this month.</p>
<a>Cavani has been told he will not be permitted to leave</a> this month because of his importance to the team. Lingard remains an outcast under Rangnick and Pogba is taking no chances with his fitness after two months out with a thigh injury. 
<h1> David Lloyd to be confirmed as commentator for Talksport after departure from Sky Sports </h1>
<p> Lloyd's departure from Sky, after 22 years, came after the broadcaster confirmed it was investigating Azeem Rafiq's 'closet racisms' claims </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Morgan, Sports News Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 1:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>David Lloyd is close to being confirmed as a commentator for Talksport radio after ending his 22-year role with Sky Sports following “closet racist” accusations raised by Azeem Rafiq.</p>
<p>Industry sources say the News Corp-owned station swooped for "Bumble" after he announced last month that "the time is now right" to move on. His departure from Sky came four weeks after the broadcaster confirmed it was investigating Rafiq's claims.</p>
<p>Rafiq has privately offered the former England head coach his sympathy over his departure, with friends of the former Yorkshire spinner insisting "he had not intended for this to happen".</p>
<p>Fallout from the Rafiq furore, meanwhile, will intensify again this month when the England and Wales Cricket Board face criticism from MPs shortly after the fifth Ashes Test is over.</p>
<p>The ECB and Yorkshire are expected to face the most severe criticism, but other counties are also expected to be scrutinised after Rafiq's evidence prompted other players to come forward.</p>
<p>During bombshell evidence to the committee in November, Rafiq broke down in tears as he described racism, bullying and “inhuman” treatment he faced at Yorkshire cricket..</p>
<p>However, some players at the club are said to be furious at what they deemed an indiscriminate cull, one that could nevertheless help lift the ban on the club staging England matches and lure back key sponsors.</p>

<h1> Hosting Six Nations in one country may be 'next best scenario', says Exeter Chiefs director of rugby Rob Baxter </h1>
<p> Baxter's desire to prioritise revenue over cancelling tournament comes with Wales understood to be considering playing home games in England </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Coles, Rugby Reporter <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:17pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>There is a limit of 500 spectators currently for outdoor sporting events in Scotland, set to be reviewed by the Scottish government in the middle of January. In Italy, outdoor stadiums will be limited to 50 per cent capacity from January 10.</p>
<p>Baxter added that clarity was needed regarding next week's Champions Cup fixtures and whether teams would be able to travel to and from France, after several Round 2 fixtures were postponed in December.</p>
<p>"We're just preparing for our home game against Glasgow, which we've got to make an assumption will go unaffected," added Baxter.</p>
<p>"For us it's the following week [away at Montpellier] when we need to know what our scenario is, so we can finalise our travel plans, but for other clubs it's a little bit more urgent than that, it's only a week away for them."</p>

<header> <h1> Hedge fund king Ken Griffin loses millions on British Airways bet </h1> <p> Billionaire hit by data showing omicron has not dented airline bookings </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Oliver Gill, Chief Business Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 1:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>One of the world’s wealthiest hedge fund managers has lost millions of pounds after shares in the owner of British Airways took off.</p>
<p>Ken Griffin, a Chicago-based financier worth more than $21bn (£15.6bn), placed a multimillion-pound bet against IAG just hours before new data revealed the omicron variant had not dented airline bookings.</p>
<p>Two of his funds hold a 1.66pc short position, a bet of about £130m, against the BA owner.</p>
<p>IAG shares<a> jumped more than 11pc on the first working day of the year</a> and made further gains on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The stock is trading at 160p, valuing the company at almost £8bn.</p>
<p>Mr Griffin's Citadel was not the only hedge fund to be hit by renewed optimism about fortunes of the airlines sector. </p>
<p>London-based Sandbar Asset Management amassed bets of £110m against the London-listed IAG, easyJet and Wizz Air on Dec 30.</p>
<p>A large Republican donor, Mr Griffin said he would bankroll the party’s candidate for the governorship of his home state of Illinois this year - a position held by another billionaire, JB Pritzker.</p>
<p>Last November he paid $43m for a copy of the US constitution at a Sotheby’s auction following a bidding war against cryptocurrency traders.</p>
<p>Airline stocks have risen after carriers said bookings were significantly higher than 12 months ago.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Ryanair said it had flown 9.5m passengers in December, up from 1.9m for the same month in 2020. </p>
<p>Wizz Air said on Tuesday it was flying at 80pc of pre-pandemic levels despite the impact of the new variant.</p>
<p>The easyJet chief executive, <a>Johan Lundgren</a>, has said he expects the budget airline to be back to normal this summer. Shares rose 2.7pc to 624p, roughly the same price as the start of 2021.</p>
<p>And in a further boon to the sector, the Government is to <a>stop asking passengers for pre-departure Covid tests</a> and will drop a requirement for a confirmatory PCR test if they test positive on their return.</p>
<p>The UK’s testing regime has been blamed by airline bosses for putting Britons off from flying.</p>
<p>Citadel declined to comment. </p>
<header> <h1> First-time buyers now face some uncomfortable home truths </h1> <p> Last year's 400,000 entry-level purchasers may have bought at the peak of the market </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>First-time buyer numbers hit a 15-year high in 2021, putting almost half a million on the property ladder. But those proud new owners will now have to grapple with the fact they likely bought at the peak of the market.</p>
<p>According to analysis by lender Yorkshire Building Society, first-time numbers hit an estimated 408,379 last year, marking a 16pc jump from the pre-Covid 2019 level.</p>
<p>The surge was fuelled by cheap mortgages on the back of low interest rates, the pandemic-induced race for space, the stamp duty holiday and a boom in lending from the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad (Bomad).</p>
<p>As banks withdrew low deposit lending en masse during the peak of the pandemic, Bomad stepped in to top up savings and contributed a record total of £9.8bn in cash in 2021, according to Savills estate agents.</p>
<p>“The [first-time buyer] growth has been unprecedented, some of the activity has been front-loaded, and much of it has been driven by one-off factors. We could see that unravelling,” says Kay Neufeld, of the CEBR.</p>
<a>rapidly rising inflation</a>, rising
<a>interest rates</a>, the cost of living crisis and the reversal of pandemic property trends are set to threaten the value of their homes.
<p>Forecasters expect the pace of the market to cool rapidly in 2022. In October, official data show the pace of national house price growth was 10.2pc but by the end of 2022, Halifax bank expects this to have fallen to 1pc.</p>
<p>The outlook gets even more gloomy: the Centre for Economics and Business Research has forecast a 1.1pc house price fall in 2023.</p>
<p>As house prices fall, interest rates rises and subsequent increases in mortgage costs will be key in creating the worst blow for first-time buyer affordability since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>There is also a looming risk that the rate rises could be far more steep. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s official forecaster, has a more extreme scenario forecast in which the Bank Rate rises to 3.5pc.</p>
<p>“It is definitely possible to see a scenario of a house price correction in five years’ time.”</p>
<p>Part of the risk also sits in the pace of the post-pandemic boom. Factors such as the stamp duty holiday pushed buyers to bring moves forward by several years, and this could trigger a subsequent drop in demand further down the line.</p>
<p>Frances Clacy, of Savills, says: “In three of five years, the market won’t be like last year. We are expecting that transactions will slow.”</p>
<p>Different groups of first-time buyers will be affected in different ways with the pandemic having deepened the wealth divide between those stepping on to the ladder and the shift to working from home changing the traditional path.</p>
<p>These buyers have made more long-term moves meaning they will be in a better position to ride out any turbulence in the market, she adds.</p>
<p>But first-time buyers who have purchased city centre flats will be exposed on several fronts. New-build flats are a key risk zone. </p>
<a>around 10 percentage points</a>. This meant that if local values had risen by 10pc, new-build home prices remained flat.
<p>In areas worst affected by the trend such as Leeds, where the <a>cladding crisis</a> has depressed the resale value of new-build flats, properties bought in 2000 have lagged the rising local prices by 40 percentage points.</p>

<header> <h1> Supermarkets face uncertain year after a bumper Christmas </h1> <p> The next 12 months will be challenging for the major grocery chains as inflation and rising costs hit consumers </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Laura Onita <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Supermarket chiefs have reasons to be cheerful going into 2022 after near-record spending over Christmas. </p>
<p>Sales hit £11.7bn in December, down just 0.2pc on the record-breaking same month a year ago during stringent Covid restrictions, according to early data from Kantar.</p>
<p>It came as shoppers flocked to buy sprouts and turkeys as supermarket prices rose at their fastest rate since the pandemic struck, adding another £15 to the average grocery bill.</p>
<p>A detailed picture of how grocers fared will be offered next week, potentially prompting profit upgrades.</p>
<p>Tesco is expected to be the demonstrable winner into 2022 after it outperformed major rivals over Christmas, achieving its highest market share in four years - of 30pc.</p>
<p>Marks Spencer, which sells its produce on Ocado’s website, is also tipped as an overall winner partly thanks to Britons’ penchant for premium food and drinks.</p>
<p>But as the festive season quickly fades, it is all to play for in 2022 as inflation bites and <a>cost pressures weigh on supermarkets’</a> wafer-thin profit margins.</p>
<p>For Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the UK’s two largest chains, the most meaningful opportunity could be the transitions of now delisted Asda and Morrisons and how they use leveraged ownership structures to become more competitive.</p>
<a>might struggle to pay their debts</a>, giving less wiggle room to reinvest - in an advantage for Tesco and Sainsbury’s.
<p>“We see the changing ownership structure of the UK grocery market as a key positive emerging over the coming year,” Jefferies analysts said in a recent note.</p>
<p>“Simply put, a different competitive landscape means that rising food consumer price index (CPI) is likely to be passed on rationally by the market as a whole.</p>
<p>“The resulting resilience of profit forecasts in 2022 and 2023 should be a key source of incremental investor interest at a time of soaring inflation.”</p>
<p>Asda’s search for a chief executive is ongoing after it drafted in the boss of Nisa, Ken Towle, to run its stores in the latest leadership shake-up. A new broom could bring a fresh strategy for the chain. </p>
<p>While rising food inflation is a looming threat for all, William Woods of Bernstein argues it could be a boon for the sector if passed onto the consumer.</p>
<p>“Inflation will further bolster Tesco and the discounters’ performance with strong value perception and strong private label offerings”, he says.</p>
<p>The <a>German discounters </a>backed by deep-pocketed owners may use the opportunity of consumers’ incomes coming under pressure, however, to seize further market share from traditional supermarkets.</p>
<p>Both Tesco and Sainsbury’s are running price match campaigns on hundreds of products, while Aldi and Lidl are more mature and opening fewer stores.</p>
<p>Separately, analysts have questioned the likelihood of <a>speedy grocery delivery apps</a> providing huge competition ahead, despite securing hundreds of millions of pounds to aggressively expand internationally in recent months.</p>
<p>Shore Capital said it expected the “bubble to pop” while Jefferies argues the on-demand apps “will remain a small part of the market" as established grocers grow their profitable online operations.</p>
<a>Amazon Fresh</a> would still remain a “niche offering” within Britain’s grocery market.
<p>Assuming average sales of between £2m and £3m per site, in line with rivals, the stores would only account for 0.5pc of total grocery sales.</p>
<p>“Amazon will struggle to develop organically a large chain, which addresses the bulk of shoppers’ needs,” says Jefferies’s James Grzinic.</p>
<p>“The UK planning regime would require Amazon to acquire a legacy operator to provide a scaled up grocery offering.”</p>
<p>In 2018 it was rumoured that Amazon would have 3,000 sites in the US by 2021 as opposed to the 30-odd branded food stores at present, industry observers point out. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Black argues that the absence of “new [cost] pressures” around freight and labour costs, including the shortage of HGV drivers, should ease in the second half of the year: “We look to 2022 with cautious optimism.”</p>
<p>A last-minute gift for supermarkets could come at the end of 2022 if England performs well in the World Cup.</p>
<p>Until then they must navigate an uncertain year ahead, nevertheless starting from a position of strength thanks to a bumper Christmas.</p>
<header> <h1> Sony joins race to develop electric cars </h1> <p> Japanese giant unveils new prototype despite lack of track record </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:31pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sony is gearing up to join the electric car race, with the Japanese electronics giant setting up a dedicated division despite never making a vehicle.</p>
<p>Kenichiro Yoshida, chief executive, said the company would launch Sony Mobility in the spring and “explore entry” into the industry.</p>
<p>Speaking at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, he also showed off a new prototype SUV in addition to an existing model it has been testing for just over a year.</p>
<p>Sony, best known for its PlayStation games consoles, cameras, movie studio and record label, has little heritage in making cars.</p>
<p>However, it has a lucrative business in image sensors that are likely to become increasingly important for safety features and ultimately self-driving technology, as well as making autonomous robots and drones.</p>
<p><a>Apple has been researching ways to enter the market</a>, while China’s Xiaomi and Huawei are also looking to develop their own vehicles.</p>
<p>Other tech companies have struggled, however. Google’s driverless car spin-off Waymo has said it does not plan to manufacture its own cars, while Dyson scrapped plans to develop an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Sony first unveiled a prototype vehicle two years ago, and began testing it in December 2020 on European roads.</p>
<p>It allows drivers to use their own sounds such as music or speech when accelerating and slowing down to replace the traditional noise of petrol-powered engines. </p>
<p>Sony is also testing 5G connections on its cars, which it said could allow them to be driven remotely.</p>
<p>Shares in Sony rose more than 4pc in Tokyo following the announcement, reflecting the insatiable demand for electric car stocks.</p>
<p>Sony has a long history of diving into projects that struggle to achieve traction, such as the Betamax video, Aibo robots and its MiniDisc music format that was quickly rendered obsolete by MP3 players.</p>
<p>However, the company was a leader in professional video in the 1980s with the Betacam and Hi8 formats, while its Trinitron televisions were long considered the best on the market. </p>
<h1> China’s zero-Covid strategy stretched to breaking point ahead of winter Olympics </h1>
<p> Despite mounting concerns over Beijing's draconian approach to coronavirus, there is little chance it will change tack any time soon </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Rees <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:13pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Basic food supplies and patience are running low in Xi’an after two weeks of lockdown.</p>
<p>For Chinese president Xi Jinping, who is expected to claim another five years in an unprecedented bid for a third term later this year, it is a faltering start to a crucial 2022.</p>
<p>Xi has not left China in two years as his regime seems to prioritise domestic issues over face-to-face diplomacy, but rumblings in Beijing and a sharply slowing economy could test his iron grip.</p>
<p>“The Covid strategy has on balance become problematic for growth,” says Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. </p>
<p>“Every new set of restrictions after a relatively mild outbreak reduces economic activity directly and, indirectly, weighs on people’s confidence and willingness to spend.”</p>
<a>China’s Sinovac vaccine is much less effective against omicron than rival jabs</a>, though there are hopes the shot will still hold up against severe illness. 
<p>But even if pressure from a stalling economy mounts, experts believe there is little chance of a shift in strategy, particularly before Xi’s presidential future is sealed. </p>
<a> including the Evergrande crisis,</a> climate change and deteriorating job prospects for university graduates. 
<p>The zero-Covid strategy helped China escape major economic damage in the early part of the pandemic by stemming infection rates enough to reopen, making it the only major economy to grow in 2020. </p>
<p>But the ultra-transmissible omicron ramps up the risk of stop-start restrictions and global spillover effects if ports and factories are shuttered again. </p>
<p>Craig Botham, China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says 2022 growth could slow to below 4pc in a plausible downside scenario where omicron gains a footing in the country and forces widespread strict restrictions.</p>
<p>“The pressure on the economy will mean [the government will] have to do something and that will mean, for example, increased government borrowing in 2022 so a lot more fiscal support.”</p>
<a>central bank cutting its key lending rate and banks’ required buffers of money</a>. Officials have vowed to unveil more support in recent weeks as the economy stuttered even before the growing threat of omicron.
<p>Economists warn this could stoke global inflationary pressures that are squeezing households in the UK, US and Europe.</p>
<p>Supply bottlenecks boosting prices have been worsened by Covid outbreaks causing factory shutdowns and congestion at ports from Los Angeles to China. Recent cases in the region have stoked fears of a repeat. </p>
<p>“When inflation is already elevated, it increases the risk that it becomes more persistent at a higher level.”</p>
<p>As China’s zero-Covid strategy threatens to spark tension over Xi’s grip and slam the brakes on 2022 growth, the wider global economy will also suffer.</p>
<header> <h1> Debt row risks wrecking Emmanuel Macron’s bid to transform the EU </h1> <p> The French president faces a major row with Germany as he tries to reform the eurozone </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tim Wallace <time> 5 January 2022 • 3:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Emmanuel Macron is fighting for his political life - and France’s presidency of the Council of the European Union could prove the ultimate weapon to cement a lead in the polls.</p>
<p>His turn to transform the EU’s agenda for six months offers Macron the chance to fill Angela Merkel’s void and lead Europe, ahead of facing the polls in April.</p>
<p>At the top of his wish list, however, is reform of the eurozone’s fiscal rules.</p>
<p>It sets the scene for a major row with Germany, the traditional guardian of financial stability, which has always insisted that the single currency had to be built on moderate debts and fiscal prudence.</p>
<p>While Berlin held firm in the face of protests in Greece during the sovereign debt crisis, it now faces pressure from more nations following the huge build up of debt through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Even before taking the reins of the rotating position, Macron called for <a>“more room for manoeuvre” on borrowing</a>, in a joint article written in the Financial Times with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.</p>
<p>Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, says the battle lines are already drawn, putting Macron at risk of derailing himself.</p>
<p>Reimposing the full fiscal rules, which have a clause for governments to borrow more in an emergency, in 2023 or beyond is hard to imagine, according to Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p>“The rules are already gone. Nobody believes they are going to come back in their original form,” he says, raising the possibility of more flexibility towards countries borrowing to spend on infrastructure or green energy.</p>
<p>The hope in Paris is that this is the best moment to set the agenda in favour of an important French demand, with support from Draghi and the new German Chancellor.</p>
<p>“The German government is quite aware of what is needed, how costly it will be to recover from the coronavirus crisis and to update all the industry in Europe to remain competitive against China or the US.</p>
<p>“But the German population, which is very attached to the zero deficit and is <a>very afraid of public debt</a>… can be difficult to convince.”</p>
<p>Even if Germany does yield, she warns Austria and the Netherlands might resist any change to the rules.</p>
<p>Borrowing regulations might be significant economically, but they are unlikely to get voters fired up for April’s election.</p>
<p>Macron will also need a quick win if he is to make the most of the coming months.</p>
<p>Schmieding predicts that will come in green energy, in which the EU wants to be seen as a global leader.</p>
<p>That could include <a>labelling nuclear power as green</a>, marking “a French success” in a matter of months. But even this is not conflict-free.</p>
<p>Much of the new action required to slash emissions will be expensive and time consuming, at a time when surging gas prices are hitting family finances.</p>
<p>But Vistesen warns that any steps to combat this cost of living crisis by slowing the energy transition, or going soft on gas and the associated emissions, will rile the Germans where the Greens are part of the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>If France tries to tweak the rules, they will face German accusations of “greenwashing”, he says. “This is going to be a massive debate in Europe in the next year.”</p>
<header> <h1> NatWest holds last-ditch talks to rescue energy suppliers </h1> <p> Ministers seek to avoid Treasury bailout of stricken energy firms with private sector loans </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Cahill ; Rachel Millard and Oliver Gill, Chief Business Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:11pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>NatWest is in talks with ministers over a rescue scheme for struggling energy companies as part of efforts to avoid a Treasury bailout.</p>
<p>The taxpayer-owned bank has been drafted into discussions aimed at helping to ease financial burdens on the industry, as fears mount that consumer bills will soar to £2,000 when the price cap increases in April.</p>
<p>Ofgem, the industry watchdog, is seeking to protect providers and the public after <a>26 suppliers went bust last year</a> in the face of soaring wholesale gas prices.</p>
<p>It has already set out plans to establish a private sector loan scheme to help providers cover the substantial upfront costs of taking on customers when rivals go bust.</p>
<p>However, the watchdog's own documents show that only one, unnamed, lender has signed up for this scheme in a sign of deep scepticism across the City. Major banks including HSBC, Santander and Lloyds have not committed to providing loans.</p>
<p>Industry leaders have said <a>energy price rises</a> are by far the biggest financial threat they face, with companies fearful they will be stung with up to £20bn of costs.</p>
<p>Wholesale natural gas prices climbed another 4pc on Wednesday to 236p per therm in the UK, far above their long-term average of about 50p per therm.</p>
<p>Prices have been pushed up by a global supply squeeze as societies reopened after Covid, with Russia accused of adding to the pressure by restricting exports to Europe.</p>
<p>Consumers in Britain have so far been spared from a surge in their bills because of the energy price cap, although this has had the side effect of triggering a wave of bankruptcies because suppliers were unable to pass higher costs on.</p>
<p>The cap will be increased to reflect average wholesale prices in April, with its new level due to be announced by Ofgem within weeks.</p>
<p>Energy bosses have warned the Government that a large jump in tariffs could wreck Boris Johnson's chances of reelection, and the taxpayer is expected to face pressure to stump up funding if City institutions refuse to step in.</p>
<p>Sources close to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng have continued to insist he was "sceptical of taxpayer support", but last night it emerged the Government was examining plans to extend a scheme offering households a £140 discount on bills.</p>
<p>A Whitehall insider said discussions on Wednesday between the industry and Mr Kwarteng were "constructive" and that the Government would continue to work with companies and Ofgem to find potential mitigations.</p>
<p>However, City sources warned that lenders will be reluctant to fund any rescue scheme unless their loans are guaranteed by the Government over fears that higher prices pose a long-term risk.</p>
<p>One investment banker even suggested that industry efforts to find a private sector solution are little more than a negotiating tactic to persuade the Treasury the only viable option is taxpayer help.</p>
<p>It is feared that more energy providers will go bust in coming months. Sky News reported on Wednesday that Together Energy could be insolvent within weeks without fresh funding.</p>
<p>A statement on its website says the company is "stable and very much operating business as usual".</p>
<p>"But it's always preferable to have more than one lender to do the job because there will be a competitive offer for companies - and the banks can share the risk between them.</p>
<p>"But this situation is entirely unprecedented and very unexpected for Ofem and the Government. The parties unfortunately seem to be making up solutions as they go along.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ofgem said: "We are continuing to work with the industry and several interested parties to deliver the proposals set out in the consultation last week."</p>

<h1> Michael Gove’s ‘only mistress was politics’, says estranged wife Sarah Vine </h1>
<p> Levelling Up Secretary's ex-partner reveals problems of being married to a politician, saying Brexit caused her ‘whole life to fall away’ </p>
<div> <div> By Danielle Sheridan, Political and Defence Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Michael Gove’s “only mistress was politics”, his estranged wife has said, as she addressed speculation about why their marriage ended.</p>
<p>Sarah Vine set out why the couple had agreed to separate after they announced last July that they were in the process of finalising their divorce.</p>
<p>Friends of the couple, who had been married for almost 20 years, have previously insisted that nobody else was involved in the split.</p>
<p>The news of their separation came soon after it was revealed that <a>Matt Hancock</a>, the former health secretary, was having an affair with Gina Coladangelo, his aide. </p>
<h2>Brexit caused a strain on couple’s marriage</h2>
<p>Mr Gove and Ms Vine have been married since October 2001, having first met two years earlier.</p>
<p>His separation from his wife later appeared inevitable after she failed to testify to the strength of their partnership when writing about Mr Hancock.</p>
<p>In an article for The Mail on Sunday, she said Mr Hancock’s “behaviour may be shocking, but given the context it is entirely predictable”.</p>
<p>In an interview with Tatler magazine, Ms Vine also spoke of the <a>difficulties of being married to a politician</a>. During their marriage, Mr Gove ran to be leader of the Conservative Party on two occasions.</p>
<p>“My ulterior motive throughout my entire life was to stop my husband being Prime Minister because I can’t think of anything worse,” she said.</p>
<p>Alluding to the impact of Brexit on her marriage, she said that her “whole life fell away”.</p>
<p>She said: “I didn’t speak to many close friends. And that was another huge strain on the marriage. Marriage can take strain, but it cannot take that much.”</p>
<h1> Border Force strike threat over Priti Patel’s migrant pushback plans </h1>
<p> Union says it is ‘totally opposed’ to Home Secretary’s scheme to halt Channel crossings using jet skis to turn boats back to France </p>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:03pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Border Force officers are threatening to strike over Priti Patel’s plans to turn back migrants’ dinghies in the Channel.</p>
<p>The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents some Border Force and immigration officials, said it was “totally opposed” to the “morally reprehensible” pushback tactics.</p>
<p>Border Force has yet to deploy the tactics, where <a>jet skis block and redirect migrant boats back towards France</a> when they intercept them in the Channel.</p>
<a>only be deployed when commanders deem them safe</a> to do so. She has also argued that the move is justified after the number of migrants reaching the UK last year tripled to 28,000.
<p>The PCS, which represents around 80 per cent of Border Force officials, and Care4Calais, a refugee charity, announced on Wednesday that they were taking the Home Office to court over the policy and had filed an application for a judicial review.</p>
<p>The judicial review will challenge the lawfulness of the policy, which the PCS argued “contravenes international law and is morally reprehensible”.</p>
<p>Even if the court application is unsuccessful, the union has not ruled out industrial action and officials refusing to carry out the pushbacks.</p>
<p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said: "The legality of the pushbacks policy is in serious question, and it is right that the court decides whether it is unlawful to turn back Channel boats.</p>
<p>"We cannot have a situation where our members could be open to potential civil and criminal action for implementing a policy that they do not agree with and know is not safe.</p>
<p>The union said its members who work for Border Force are “deeply concerned” the policy will be impossible to implement in a safe way, due to difficulties in assessing whether a boat at sea can be safely turned around.</p>
<p>Members may also be exposed to personal civil or criminal liability if the policy is deemed unlawful, the union claimed.</p>
<p>Clare Moseley, founder of the refugee charity Care4Calais, said: "The proposed policy deprioritises the UK's duty under domestic and international law to save lives at sea.</p>
<p>"It is for good reason that this duty is a cornerstone of International maritime law. If eroded, I fear it will enable the UK to devalue lives at sea.</p>
<p>"It risks opening the gates to the horrific scenes we are seeing in the Mediterranean."</p>
<p>The Home Office continues to explore various options in its bid to <a>halt crossings by thousands of people from France</a> aboard small boats.</p>
<p>Facing another year with thousands of crossings, the Home Office has invited businesses to an event later this month in the hope of gleaning new ideas on how to solve the crisis.</p>
<p>Attendees will be bound by a non-disclosure agreement and then invited to "share their innovative ideas, new approaches and potential solutions which can be legally deployable in the UK".</p>
<header> <h1> Kazakhstan protesters pull down statue of ex-leader in largest rallies since fall of Soviet Union </h1> <p> Russian military planes said to have landed in Kazakhstan to rescue former president Nursultan Nazarbayev </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Kilner <time> 6 January 2022 • 12:05am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Protesters in Kazakhstan fought deadly street battles with police, stormed government buildings and pulled down a statue of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, on Wednesday in what was essentially an overthrow of the country's unloved elite.</p>
<p>Analysts said several private jets had taken off from Nur-Sultan, the capital, flying ministers and oligarchs to safety in Europe.</p>
<p>The internal affairs ministry said that eight security personnel had been killed and more than 300 injured in the unrest, without giving details of civilian casualties.</p>
<p>As the government lost control to protesters throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, it shut down the internet but some videos still emerged showing chaotic scenes.</p>
<p>Videos appeared to show protesters arming themselves with automatic rifles. The government has described demonstrators as "terrorists" and said it had begun anti-terrorist operations.</p>
<p>Later reports said police had fired rubber bullets at protesters, who have also taken control of the country's biggest airport, outside Almaty.</p>
<p>The protests began on Jan 1 with the sudden doubling of the price of petrol in West Kazakhstan, the rebellious oil and gas heartland, a price rise linked to a relaxation of government subsidies.</p>
<h2>Officials caught off-guard by popular anger</h2>
<p>Analysts said that the Kazakh elite, and particularly Mr Nazarbayev, have been blinded by their hubris.</p>
<p>Joblessness and inflation are rising, rules imposed to counter coronavirus have been harsh, the healthcare system is near-broken and political plurality is skin-deep.</p>
<p>In one video shot from West Kazakhstan, a worker explained why he was demonstrating. "I have been living with nothing. I don't want to live like a slave for any longer," he said.</p>
<div> <blockquote><p>Protesters now storming the main government building in Kazakhstan’s largest city Almaty. pic.twitter.com/lemKcpILL8</p>— Patrick Reevell (@Reevellp) <a>January 5, 2022</a></blockquote> </div>
<p>In short the elite are accused of being more interested in gold-plating their international reputations, contacts and influence than they have been in raising living standards for ordinary Kazakhs.</p>
<h2>Fall of leader who was hired by Tony Blair</h2>
<p>At the top of this political system is Mr Nazarbayev, who hired Sir Tony Blair as an adviser for several years from 2011 and whose son-in-law paid the Duke of York an inflated price for a mansion in Berkshire in 2007. </p>
<p>Sir Tony featured in a promotional PR video in 2020 for Mr Nazarbayev, praising his leadership and saying Kazakhstan could look forward to its future with "confidence".</p>
<p>"Together we will overcome this black episode in the history of Kazakhstan," he said.</p>
<p>He added that Mr Nazarbayev had quit as head of the National Security Council. The significance of the resignation is difficult to overstate.</p>
<p>Although no longer the president, Mr Nazarbayev was still considered the real power in Kazakhstan. He met with foreign leaders and had the first and last word over foreign and domestic policies. </p>
