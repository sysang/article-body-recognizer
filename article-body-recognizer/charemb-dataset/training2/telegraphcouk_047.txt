<h1> Prince Andrew has not ruled out pay-off for Virginia Roberts Giuffre paid by the Queen </h1>
<p> A potential financial settlement in sex abuse case of 'at least' several-million pounds would avoid further damaging Royal family reputation </p>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 6 January 2022 • 12:18am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York has not ruled out making a financial settlement with his accuser in order to avoid further damaging the reputation of the Royal family, The Telegraph understands.</p>
<p>A potential pay-off for Virginia Roberts Giuffre could be “at least” several-million pounds and would be paid by his mother, the Queen.</p>
<p>Those close to him privately acknowledge that the judge’s comments during a “brutal” 75-minute hearing this week made very clear to which side he was leaning.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17, in London, New York and on Epstein’s private Caribbean island. Her civil claim is seeking unspecified damages.</p>
<p>Although the Duke has indicated to his team of UK and US-based lawyers that he wants to <a>fight the allegations and clear his name</a>, sources close to his camp point out that it is a US civil case being fought by US lawyers.</p>
<p>As such, the issue of settlement is “never off the table” for his legal team, led by <a>LA-based Andrew Brettler</a>, as 99 per cent of civil cases in America are settled out of court.</p>
<h2>The Queen offered support from her own private purse</h2>
<p>While in the UK court of opinion, a financial pay-off would be considered an admission of guilt, in the US, it has different connotations.</p>
<p>The Duke would argue that he simply could not put his family, specifically his 95-year-old mother, or the monarchy, under any more strain and wanted to shield them from further fallout.</p>
<p>The Queen has offered her support in the form of footing the bill for his substantial legal fees from her own private purse.</p>
<p>The funds are sourced from her annual income from her private Duchy of Lancaster estate, which recently increased by £1.5 million to more than £23 million.</p>
<a>Ms Giuffre lives in Australia</a>, and asking for a summary judgment, which would not be until after the discovery and deposition process.
<p>But the judge’s repeated interruptions and observations made during the dismissal hearing on Tuesday did not bode well, sources close to him admit.</p>
<a>Ms Giuffre had "waived her rights" to sue him</a> when she entered into the 2009 release agreement worth $500,000 with Jeffrey Epstein, but the
<a>judge appeared to disagree</a>.
<a>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan</a> unceremoniously rejected most legal points raised by Mr Brettler, telling him at one point: “With all due respect, Mr Brettler,
<a>that's not a dog that's going to hunt here</a>.” And another time challenging him with a sharp: “So what?”
<p>If the Duke were to opt to draw a line under proceedings before suffering any further blows, it would be Ms Giuffre’s decision about whether to accept a settlement.</p>
<p>However, those close to Prince Andrew believe that as the civil action always included a claim for damages it could therefore be resolved for money.</p>
<p>If it was designed to <a>permanently damage the Duke’s reputation</a> then that objective has already been met.</p>
<h1> Ghislaine Maxwell granted permission to request retrial after juror reveals childhood sex abuse </h1>
<p> 'Scotty David' admitted that he influenced the deliberations that saw Maxwell, 60, convicted and facing up to 65 years in prison </p>
<div> <div> By Josie Ensor, US Correspondent, New York <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:59pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A New York judge has allowed Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers to move for a retrial amid questions over whether a juror failed to disclose he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Judge Alison Nathan gave the defence a January 19 deadline to file a motion to vacate Maxwell’s sex-trafficking conviction and offered the juror in question a court-appointed lawyer.</p>
<p>Maxwell's attorneys told the Manhattan court on Wednesday that there were "incontrovertible grounds for a new trial" after the juror revealed that he used his experience as a survivor of abuse to guide jury deliberations.</p>
<p>“Scotty" admitted this week that he helped the jury reach a guilty verdict that saw Maxwell, 60, convicted and <a>facing up to 65 years in prison.</a></p>
<p>He also told jurors how he had waited until secondary school before telling anyone about his abuse, in an effort to justify why some of Maxwell’s victims may not have come forward earlier.</p>
<p>“When I shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,”<a> he told Reuters.</a></p>
<p>Separately, in an interview with The New York Times, a second juror described having been sexually abused as a child and said that they, too, had discussed the experience during deliberations.</p>
<p>The revelation, this juror said, appeared to help shape the jury’s discussions.</p>
<p>“We believe the law and the facts and are clearly on our side,” Christian Everdell, for the defence, wrote in a filing on Wednesday. “Ms Maxwell should not have to expend precious time and resources briefing other motions.”</p>
<h2>Questionnaire given to jurors asked about sexual abuse </h2>
<p>During jury selection, some 230 prospective jurors were given questionnaires asking, among other things, if they or anyone in their families had experienced sexual abuse, court records show.</p>
<p>In an interview with the MailOnline on Wednesday, juror "Scotty David" said he could not remember that question. “They don't ask your sexual abuse history," he said. "They didn't ask it in the questionnaire."</p>
<p>He then said, however, that he would have answered "honestly".</p>
<p>The US legal system allows both the prosecution and defence teams to veto candidates. In selecting 12 primary jurors, Maxwell’s team had 10 challenges and the prosecution six.</p>
<p>One potential juror was dismissed during the judge’s questioning, known as voir dire, after she told the court she informed her sister’s school of alleged sexual abuse her sister had suffered at the hands of a teacher.</p>
<p>“In the first instance it would likely form the basis for a motion to Judge (Alison) Nathan for a new trial,” she said.</p>
<p>There is precedent in the state of New York for a court to conduct a hearing into the truthfulness of a juror.</p>
<p>In the US v drug dealer Edward Langford, a 1993 case cited by New York prosecutors in their filing, a juror lied about previous convictions relating to prostitution. </p>
<p>In the Maxwell case, however, the nature of the abuse in question is strikingly similar to the charges faced by the disgraced British socialite, so it is possible the judge may take a different view.</p>
<h1> ‘Colston four’ walk free as jury finds no crime was committed in toppling statue </h1>
<p> Black Lives Matter activists argue successfully that they ‘prevented’ a hate crime by pulling down the bronze monument in Bristol </p>
<div> <div> By Gordon Rayner, Associate Editor ; Max Stephens and Danielle Sheridan <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:10pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Four Black Lives Matter activists who openly admitted toppling the statue of Edward Colston walked free from court after a jury agreed that they had committed no crime.</p>
<p>The three men and one woman - dubbed the Colston Four - were acquitted of criminal damage after opting for a jury trial and arguing that pulling down the bronze statue in Bristol and <a>rolling it into a harbour was justified</a>.</p>
<p>The verdict led to concerns that other protesters will be encouraged to take the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>Cabinet ministers expressed disquiet at the verdict, which follows the case of <a>six Extinction Rebellion demonstrators being cleared of similar charges</a> after allegedly attacking Shell’s London headquarters last year.</p>
<p>Amid warnings that the verdict amounted to a “green light for mobs”, MPs urged ministers to consider whether further changes to the law were needed.</p>
<p>However, lawyers and academics argued that the case was a "quintessential" example of the British jury system.</p>
<p>Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were <a>charged with criminal damage after being caught on CCTV</a> passing the ropes around the statue that were used to pull the statue down on June 7 2020.</p>
<p>The fourth defendant, Jake Skuse, 33, was accused of orchestrating the plan to throw it in the harbour.</p>
<a>funeral of George Floyd</a>, whose murder in the US by a police officer had triggered the protests.
<p>The prosecution claimed that it was “irrelevant” who Colston was, but the defence teams successfully argued that the presence of the statue constituted a hate crime in itself and that the four had been preventing a crime by removing it.</p>
<p>They also claimed that they effectively “owned” the statue, as it belonged to the people of Bristol and that they could not be convicted for damaging their own property.</p>
<p>After less than three hours of deliberation, a jury cleared them of the charges. The four appeared outside the court and declared their acquittal "a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history".</p>
<p>Whitehall sources said the verdict stunned ministers. </p>
<p>A source close to Oliver Dowden, the Conservative Party Chairman and former Culture Secretary, said he “thinks that people who commit criminal damage should be held to account regardless of the circumstances”.</p>
<p>The Cenotaph and a <a>statue of Winston Churchill have been vandalised</a> in the past by anti-racism protesters. There are now fears that extremists will be “emboldened” to attack any monument they dislike.</p>
<p>Supporters of the “Colston Four” said the verdict - which came at the end of a costly 11-day trial - had proved that the prosecution should never have gone ahead.</p>
<p>Julian Knight, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: “The events that happened in Bristol were clearly unacceptable and as a country we need to protect our heritage from mob rule.</p>
<p>“The fact that no one is going to be punished for the destruction of this statue is disquieting in terms of being able to protect our nation’s heritage.”</p>
<p>Tom Hunt, Tory MP and vice-chairman of the Common Sense Group, said ministers would now have to consider whether the legal system was functioning properly. </p>
<p>He said: “If you've broken the law and committed criminal damage, you should be punished. If the jury is a barrier to ensuring they are punished, then that needs to be addressed.”</p>
<p>"The result of this ruling will be that mobs will seek to tear down statues across the country - it gives a green light for mobs. This is unacceptable in a free society."</p>
<a>trial by jury is a ‘quintessentially UK right’</a>. He is, of course, correct – for the exact reasons demonstrated in Bristol."
<h2>We ‘rectified’ history, says defendant</h2>
<p>Calls for the Colston statue, classed as a listed building, to be removed began in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The city’s first black elected mayor, Marvin Rees, has said in the past that a lack of a “playbook” for removing statues by consent, especially when they are listed, had hampered previous campaigns.</p>
<p>Since the statue was brought up from the harbour bed, it has been <a>transferred to a museum</a>. </p>
<p>The Government has <a>strengthened laws against the illegal toppling of statues</a> and formalised the process of applying for their legal removal.</p>
<p>The defendants’ legal fees were funded partly through sales of T-shirts designed and donated by Banksy, the Bristol street artist.</p>
<p>The four defendants laughed as the verdicts were returned. There were cheers from a public gallery packed with their supporters at Bristol Crown Court.</p>
<p>The presenter of the television series A House Through Time had said that the Royal African Company had shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children.</p>
<p>Speaking after he was cleared, Mr Willoughby said: "We didn't change history, we rectified it.</p>
<p>"This is a victory for Bristol, this is a victory for racial equality and it's a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history."</p>
<p>Ms Graham said she was "overwhelmed" in the wake of the jury's verdicts.</p>
<p>"I'm just so overwhelmed, because it never felt like we'd get here,” she said. </p>
<p>“We just want to say thank you to so many people because we have never been alone in this journey, we have been so supported and we are such a small part of this really."</p>
<h2>Reaction to the verdict</h2>
<p>Chief Superintendent Liz Hughes, of Avon and Somerset Police, said following the verdicts: "This was an incident which attracted worldwide attention and which polarised public opinion.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we had a duty to investigate as the custodians of the statue, Bristol City Council, had not granted anyone permission to damage it.</p>
<p>"Following a thorough investigation, we submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service, who then made the decision to charge the four defendants with criminal damage.</p>
<p>"Having been presented with the evidence, a jury has now determined their actions were not criminal and we respect its decision."</p>
<p>Tom Wainwright, barrister for Mr Ponsford, said the felling of the statue had helped heal the wounds of slavery and accused the prosecution of inviting the jury to "pick open these wounds once more".</p>
<p>Liam Walker, for Mr Willoughby, told the jury their decision would "reverberate around the world" and urged them "to be on the right side of history".</p>
<p>Raj Chada and Laura O’Brien of Hodge Jones and Allen represented two of the four protesters - Mr Skuse and Ms Graham. </p>
<p>Mr Chada, head of criminal defence at Hodge Jones and Allen, said: "The truth is that the defendants should never have been prosecuted. </p>
<p>"It is shameful that Bristol City Council did not take down the statue of slaver Edward Colston that had caused such offence to people in Bristol and equally shameful that they then supported the prosecution of these defendants."</p>
<p>Laura O’Brien, senior associate at the firm, added: "Our clients acknowledge that this case is but a small part of the struggle against racism and the efforts to tell the story of slavery and its legacy with honesty. </p>
<p>"Our clients thank all those who have helped along the way, for many of them telling us their stories of pain and determination."</p>
<p>Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, barrister in the case, said: "This case demonstrates the fundamental importance of trial by jury. That is because juries represent the collective sense of justice of the community. </p>
<h1> How the ‘Colston four’ enlisted Banksy and Left-wing scholars to seal monumental victory </h1>
<p> Protesters admitted helping to topple statue in Bristol, but walked free from court with a declaration of victory for ‘racial equality’ </p>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, Crime Correspondent and Max Stephens <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When the statue of Edward Colston was ripped from its plinth and hurled into Bristol Harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020, many of the protestors involved were identified and rounded up by the police.</p>
<p>But while several of those quickly acknowledged their guilt, accepting police cautions, four demanded their day in court.</p>
<p>The “Colston Four”, as they came to be known, openly admitted their involvement in tying ropes around the 125-year-old statue, hauling it from its plinth and plunging it into the water. They insisted that they had committed no crime.</p>
<p>Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, and <a>Jake Skuse</a>, 33, argued that their actions had been justified because the statue was a hate crime to the people of Bristol because of Colston’s links to the slave trade.</p>
<p>While their defence may have seemed somewhat risky, their gamble to have the case heard before a jury, rather than magistrates, paid off on Wednesday when they <a>walked free from Bristol Crown Court</a>, having been aquitted of the charge.</p>
<p>As part of the defence case, Prof David Olusoga, the broadcaster and author, was called and spoke about the appalling conditions wretched African slaves endured more than 300 years ago.</p>
<p>Members of Bristol’s well-established black community also gave evidence about the impact that seeing <a>the Colston statue</a> every day had on their lives.</p>
<p>Cleo Lake, the Lord Mayor of Bristol between 2018 and 2019, also attended court to give evidence in support of the accused.</p>
<p>A well-organised publicity campaign in the city, supported by the famous graffiti artist Banksy, also meant those on trial were greeted by a large crowd of supporters at court each day.</p>
<p>Marvin Rees, the elected mayor of Bristol, did not condone the actions of the group at the time, but later said: “I’m not going to mourn the loss of the statue to the plinth.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, lawyers for the defendants said they should never have been put on trial, arguing that it was “shameful” the statue had not been lawfully removed by the city council earlier.</p>
<p>The decision to opt for a jury trial is thought to have cost the taxpayer more than £50,000, despite the damage to the statue estimated at less than £4,000.</p>
<p><a>The Colston statue</a>, which had sat on a plinth in the city centre since 1895, had been a divisive issue in Bristol for decades, but all lawful efforts to force its removal had failed.</p>
<h2>Protesters make a splash</h2>
<p>The catalyst that brought about its removal was a Black Lives Matter march on June 7 2020, which came in the wake of the <a>murder of George Floyd</a> in the US.</p>
<p>Just before 2.30pm, a group of protesters, including Mr Willoughby, Ms Graham and Mr Ponsford, approached the statue and began to attach ropes around its head which they had each come prepared with.</p>
<p>A group of about 14 people then <a>pulled it to the ground</a> while police officers at the scene looked on.</p>
<p>The statue was then rolled and dragged to the nearby Bristol Harbour by a group, including Mr Skuse, before being unceremoniously dumped into the water to loud cheers from the crowd.</p>
<p>A lengthy police investigation eventually led to nine people being interviewed, five of whom were offered conditional discharges, while four were charged with criminal damage.</p>
<p>None of the four defendants denied their role in toppling the state and, when they gave evidence, argued that their actions had been justified.</p>
<p>Mr Willoughby, who grew up in the multicultural Montpelier district of Bristol and works as a builder, argued that by damaging the statue, he had been preventing a crime because its very existence was an offence.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Liam Walker – who is in the same legal chambers where Sir Keir Starmer was once based – called Prof Olusoga, who described how between 3,000 and 20,000 enslaved Africans were shipped out of Bristol in appalling conditions.</p>
<p>Britain created a “slave society” in its colonies, with a legal code classifying Africans as less than human, Prof Olusoga told the court.</p>
<p>In addition, his legal team used the same argument as Extinction Rebellion activists who recently argued successfully that their conviction for blocking a road was a disproportionate infringement of their human rights.</p>
<h2>‘A lawful excuse to damage statue’</h2>
<p>Entering the witness box, Mr Ponsford, a carpenter, also argued that he believed his actions had been legally justified.</p>
<p>He told the jury: “I thought it was long overdue that the statue came down. I believe I had a lawful excuse to damage that statue, preventing further harm to the people of Bristol.”</p>
<p>Mr Ponsford also said he believed the statue had been gifted to Bristol people and therefore he could not be convicted of damaging something that partly belonged to him.</p>
<p>She said: “They’ve had long enough to recognise how much harm a statue of a slaver has in a multicultural city. After 100 years of dissent, somebody should have been listening.”</p>
<p>She added that she found the idea or a “murderer” venerated in the city was disgusting, adding: “It was an act of compassion and solidarity and not violence.” </p>
<p>Ms Graham said she believed that the act of pulling the statue down was “proportionate in preventing the divisiveness it was causing and should be a crime to glorify a man of such murderous calibre”.</p>
<h2>‘A victory for Bristol’</h2>
<p>Mr Skuse, who was raised in Little Stoke before moving to the St Pauls area of Bristol, also relied on the defence that his actions were preventing a crime.</p>
<p>He told the jury the statue was offensive, “like a racist piece of graffiti which the city council had failed to remove”.</p>
<p>“The people of Bristol wanted that down. If the council had done their job properly, this wouldn’t have happened,” he told the jury.</p>
<a>calling [Colston] a f—--g virtuous man</a> – sorry to swear. We didn’t change history, we rectified it.”
<p>Mr Willoughby continued: “This is a victory for Bristol, this is a victory for racial equality and it’s a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history.”</p>
<p>Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, the lawyer who represented Mr Graham, said: “This case demonstrates the fundamental importance of trial by jury. That is because juries represent the collective sense of justice of the community. </p>
<header> <h1> Holiday bookings bonanza beckons as Covid day two PCR tests scrapped </h1> <p> Moves to scrap omicron travel restrictions will be a major boost for Britons planning ski trips or winter sun breaks </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Travel firms prepared for a surge in demand for winter sun and ski holidays on Wednesday as Boris Johnson scrapped PCR and pre-departure tests in a move that will save families hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>Passengers will also no longer have to self isolate until they get a negative lateral flow test result. However, if positive, they will have to follow up with a PCR and self isolate for at least seven days until they test negative.</p>
<p>The moves - to take effect from 4am on Friday - will be a major boost for holidaymakers planning ski trips or winter sun breaks and the beleaguered travel and tourism industry.</p>
<p><a>Announcing the changes</a>, Mr Johnson said the restrictions were “no longer serving their purpose”.</p>
<p>“Now Omicron is so prevalent these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry,” he said.</p>
<p>After falls of 40 per cent or more in sales over Christmas, travel analysts including Skyscanner predicted an instant spike in demand similar to the 131 per cent surge in searches just hours after the restrictions were lifted in September.</p>
<p>“Today marks an important step towards learning to live alongside the virus, helping passengers and the travel sector look ahead to what will be an all-important spring and summer season.”</p>
<p>Willie Walsh, the former boss of BA who now heads IATA, representing international airlines, urged ministers to go further and “remove testing entirely for vaccinated travellers.”</p>
<h2>Removal of all travel testing ‘ultimate goal’</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated travellers will still have to pay for pre-departure tests, quarantine on their return to the UK and take PCR tests on days two and eight.</p>
<p>Other countries including Germany and Ireland are also beginning to lift travel restrictions with officials in France on Wednesday indicating that they would start to ease its border controls on arrivals from the UK.</p>
<p>Gabriel Attal, the government’s spokesman, said that <a>France would make it a “bit easier” to travel </a>to and from the UK, widening the official list of valid reasons for travel.</p>
<p>It is believed that rules will initially be eased for business travel with a further announcement expected next week, which could include holidaymakers. Currently all arrivals in France must have a “compelling” reason to gain entry.</p>
<p>France is the UK’s most popular ski destination, with hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers typically heading there at half-term.</p>
<h1> Strict Covid curbs ‘less effective’, admits Nicola Sturgeon as Scotland’s isolation rules relaxed </h1>
<p> First Minister's approach now more in line with England, as data show her tough measures failed to curb omicron spread </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon finally relaxed Scotland’s self-isolation rules and promised to rethink her Covid strategy on Wednesday after admitting her <a>hardline restrictions</a> were not as effective anymore.</p>
<a>with Boris Johnson’s</a>, Ms Sturgeon disclosed that her government will shortly unveil a blueprint for Scotland to live with the virus in the long term that would be “more proportionate and sustainable and less restrictive.”
<p>Fully vaccinated close contacts, including people living in the same household, will no longer have to automatically self-isolate for 10 days even if they test negative. Instead, they will be required to take a daily lateral flow test for a week.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon unveiled plans for a radical shift in strategy as the Office for National Statistic disclosed the proportion of Scots with Covid doubled from one in 40 to one in 20 in the final week of 2021, despite a flurry of new restrictions.</p>
<p>This compared to one in 15 in England, where Mr Johnson has refused to introduce similar measures and the figure has been skewed by the much higher case rate in London. Up to one in 10 people in the UK capital are thought to have had Covid.</p>
<p>Holyrood’s opposition parties and business leaders welcomed the relaxation of quarantine rules, which have worsened severe staff shortages caused by people having to self-isolate.</p>
<p>However, firms and sporting bodies challenged Ms Sturgeon to make clear what criteria would have to be met for her restrictions to be eased, including a “clear end date for the current working from home requirements”.</p>
<p>Strict limits on attendance at large events in Scotland, including football matches, were imposed on Boxing Day. Theatres across the country have also had to close their doors.</p>
<p>However, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the virus was “more widespread now than at any point in the pandemic so far”, which she argued had “extremely serious implications” for the NHS and other key services.</p>
<p>In a virtual statement to a recalled Scottish Parliament, she said that her continuing to use lockdown-style restrictions “won’t control transmission to the same extent as they would have with other variants.”</p>

<p> Staff shortage fears over new rules introduced to speed up Covid booster rollout, as teaching unions urge schools to impose tighter curbs </p>
<div> <div> By Robert Mendick, Chief Reporter ; Camilla Turner, Education Editor ; Gareth Davies, Breaking News Editor and Patrick Sawer, Senior News Reporter <time> 5 January 2022 • 10:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Unions are advising members they can stay off work for 28 days without a sick note amid growing fears that new rules to battle Covid-19 are fuelling absenteeism in the public sector.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs on Wednesday night called on the Government to drop a change to employment laws that allow workers to remain off work for almost a month without the need for a medical certificate.</p>
<p>In a separate move, teaching unions have told their members to ignore government guidance and introduce stricter Covid rules at school.</p>
<p>The UK’s largest teaching union has issued a “safety checklist” for schools, saying its recommendations are designed to “slow the spread” of the virus.</p>
<p>However, the advice of the National Education Union (NEU), which includes <a>a return of bubbles</a> and staggered break times, has been described by parents as a “pandemic straitjacket” for children.</p>
<h2>Union members notified of sick note changes</h2>
<p>Under the normal employment rules, employees could take a week off work without a doctor’s note, but that was temporarily increased last month to 28 days to free up GPs to <a>administer the vaccine booster</a>.</p>
<p>Unison, Britain’s largest public sector union, circulated the legal change to its 1.4 million members.</p>
<p>Unite, the second largest union, tweeted to members that “proof of sickness cannot be requested earlier than 28 days”.</p>
<a>one in 10 rail workers are off work</a> and operators have been moving to emergency timetables.
<a>Bin collections have been disrupted</a>, while there is increasing concern that pupils will be sent home in the coming days as a result of teacher absences.
<a>teacher absence rates</a> are likely to increase this term. He told the Commons that at the end of last year, about eight per cent of staff were off and “that is probably likely to rise”.
<p>A source told The Telegraph that headteachers were urging staff to “act with dignity” amid fears it could be a “green light” for some people to abuse the system.</p>
<p>Sir John Hayes, a Conservative MP and former minister, said: “That may have been necessary during the period where we were getting the booster out quickly, but we certainly need to review it as soon as possible.”</p>
<h2>Schools told to impose own Covid rules</h2>
<p>The Department for Education has told headteachers they may need to combine classes to redeploy teachers to cover lessons in order to <a>keep schools open</a> if staff sickness <a>spirals out of control</a>.</p>
<p>The document is also backed by the NASUWT union as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, whose members include teaching assistants and other school staff.</p>
<p>Family groups and MPs have warned that this “inflexible and militant attitude” is likely to keep more children out of the classroom.</p>
<p>The current government guidance states that <a>children should be off school</a> only if they have tested positive or if they are showing Covid symptoms.</p>
<p>However, the unions said that <a>pupils should isolate</a> if one of their family members has tested positive, and only return to school if they have received a negative PCR result.</p>
<p>“Where close contacts are unable to get hold of [lateral flow devices] due to supply issues, they should be supported to work from home for the isolation period,” it says.</p>
<p>Steve Brine, a Tory MP and former health minister, said: “This is the drip, drip of getting some people to the place they always wanted to be and it’s the kids who lose out.”</p>
<a>bubbles should be reintroduced</a>, saying that that schools should take measures to “minimise mixing, for example keeping groups as consistent as possible”.
<p>It added that teachers “should not routinely be expected to cover for absent colleagues, nor should they be expected to teach pupils who they have not been assigned to teach”.</p>
<p>It advised that break times and lunch, as well as the start and end of the day should be staggered, and any large in-person gatherings such as whole school assemblies should be banned.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, it emerged that Kensington Aldridge Academy, a secondary school in west London, is introducing detentions for children who do not wear masks during lessons.</p>

<header> <h1> Sky Brown is Britain's youngest Olympic medallist with bronze in skateboarding final - everything you missed overnight </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Pippa Field Tokyo and Charles Richardson (live updates) <time> 4 August 2021 • 2:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<li>Skateboarding: Teenage sensation Sky Brown claims bronze, Team GB's first medal of the day, in high-quality final</li>
<li>Women's hockey: <a>Team GB beaten by Netherlands in semi-final</a></li>
<li>Women's heptathlon: <a>Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls him with cruel calf injury</a></li>
<li>Women's 400m hurdles: Sydney McLaughlin of US follows Karsten Warholm's lead in men's race <a>and breaks world record</a></li>
<li>Sailing: <a>Hannah Mills wins historic gold with Eilidh McIntyre in women's 470 class</a></li>
<li><a>Ben Whittaker wins boxing silver</a> while <a>Jason Kenny through to last 12 of men's sprint</a> amongst other cycling</li>
<p>The historic bronze medal had barely been hung around her neck before Sky Brown, Britain's 13-year-old skateboarding star, was already planning her next astonishing trick - a twin sport bid at the Paris 2024 Olympics.</p>
<a>was already guaranteed as Britain's youngest summer Olympian</a>. And she further etched her name into the history books by
<a>becoming the country's youngest Olympic medallist </a>- aged 13 years and 28 days - with third in the women's skateboarding park competition.
<p>Brown, the recently crowned X Games champion, has a reputation for not holding back, in part by her desire to "push boundaries and show girls can do tricks that boys are doing."</p>
<p>Equally her father, acting as her chaperone in Tokyo on account of her age, helped ground her. "My dad said it’s just a contest, if you fall it doesn’t define you."</p>
<p>"I’m so stoked. I can’t believe it. It’s unbelievable. It’s like a dream," said Brown, who qualifies for Team GB through her British-born father.</p>
<p>Brown will celebrate her Tokyo success by "surfing a lot" and having "a party with my friends." A reunion with her nine-year-old brother, Ocean, and mother Mieko, who watched from America, is also high on the priority list.</p>
<p>"I honestly feel that accident made me stronger. That accident was pretty bad. It was a hard time for my parents and for a lot of people and coming back and getting the bronze is really cool."</p>
<p>Afterwards Stu said his daughter would be "straight back to school and doing the things that families do." He added that they would also "take her off social media for a little while."</p>
<p>Meanwhile Brown's team-mate Bombette Martin took her own slice of Olympic history, becoming the first park skater to drop in at a Games, eventually finishing 18th.</p>
<h4>Katarina Johnson-Thompson makes steady start in heptathlon </h4>
<p>Katarina Johnson-Thompson made a mixed start to the heptathlon at the Olympics but remains in contention for a medal.</p>
<p>The world champion has battled back from a ruptured Achilles she suffered in December and had downplayed her chances.</p>
<p>But she opened with a strong 100 metres hurdles, winning her heat in 13.27 seconds - her second fastest time ever.</p>
<p>In the high jump she cleared 1.86m - 12cm off her personal best - but was pictured having treatment between jumps and failed at 1.89m to leave her with 2138 points after two events, ahead of the 200m and shot put on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Defending champion Nafi Thiam jumped 1.92m to move 38 points ahead of Johnson-Thompson and 19 points in front of second-placed Erica Bougard of the USA.</p>
<p>Andrew Pozzi made the Olympic 110m hurdles final for the first time in his career.</p>
<p>The world 60m champion finished fourth in his semi-final in 13.32secs and had to wait to see if he would qualify as one of the fastest losers.</p>
<p>He reached the semi-finals in Rio five years ago and the 29-year-old admitted it was a nervous time to see if he made it through to Thursday's final.</p>
<h4>GB's hopes of defending Olympic hockey title ended by Holland</h4>
<p>Great Britain's reign as Olympic women's hockey champions ended at the semi-final stage in Tokyo as they were crushed 5-1 by Holland.</p>
<p>The Dutch emphatically avenged defeat in the 2016 Rio final, when Team GB goalkeeper Maddie Hinch's heroics during a penalty shoot-out ensured gold medal glory.</p>
<p>The last-four clash at Oi Hockey Stadium was their second meeting of the Tokyo tournament, with Holland having posted a 1-0 pool win six days ago.</p>
<p>And Hollie Pearne-Webb's team once again came unstuck as Holland never looked back following two goals in just over a minute during the second quarter when Felice Albers and Marloes Keetels struck.</p>
<p>Albers and Maria Verschoor added further goals during the third quarter, leaving Britain reeling from conceding four times in 19 damaging minutes, before Giselle Ansley netted a consolation, but Frederique Matla added a fifth late on.</p>
<p>It means that Hinch and company will play for the bronze medal at Oi Hockey Stadium on Friday, against Argentina or India.</p>
<h4>Sydney McLaughlin smashes her own 400m hurdles world record to take Tokyo gold</h4>
<p>The USA's Sydney McLaughlin broke her own world record to clinch the 400 metres hurdles gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old clocked 51.46 seconds having previously set a world best of 51.90secs to become the first woman to break the 51-second barrier in June.</p>
<p>Dalilah Muhammad was second in 51.58s - which also broke McLaughlin's previous record. The Netherlands' Femke Bol claimed bronze.</p>
<p>McLaughlin powered through in the last 20 metres to take the title and beat defending champion Muhammad having been third on the final bend.</p>
<p>It came after the men's 400m hurdles on Tuesday - already labelled one of the greatest races - when Karsten Warholm broke his own world record to win in 45.94s.</p>
<p>He took almost a second off his previous world best of 46.70s he set in Oslo at the start of July.</p>
<p>The USA's Rai Benjamin (46.17s) was second with Brazil's Alison Dos Santos (46.72s) third - with both coming inside Kevin Young's long-standing previous world record of 46.78s the American set 29 years ago.</p>
<h4>Alice Dearing makes history but cannot trouble podium in 10km marathon swim</h4>
<p>Alice Dearing made history as the first black female swimmer to compete at an Olympic Games, finishing 19th in the 10km marathon swim, as Ana Marcela Cunha, of Brazil, took gold.</p>

<h3> Sky Brown speaking to BBC Sport</h3>
<p>This is incredible - it feels unreal I'm so happy to be here - I'm blessed.</p>
<p>I was definitely bumped, I fell twice, that made the last run feel even better. All the girls are ripping it, it was insane, it was a super sick final.</p>

<p>Not the greatest day for the British pair of Mel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff in the singles strokeplay. The former finished two over par while the latter is one over through 14.</p>
<p>The leader is Sweden's Madalene Sagstrom who is five under through 13.</p>
<p>Ben Bloom writes from the Olympic Stadium, Tokyo: </p>
<p>If she can cling on to make the podium it would be a magnificent accomplishment. She'll be back for the shot put and 200m later on Wednesday.</p>
<div> <h3>That third run</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>What a third run that was from Sky Brown. Her first two were not clean.</p> <p>A reminder that she is just 13 years old. What courage.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>The run that sealed it</h3>
<h3>From Pippa Field, in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Yosozumi fails to improve her score and then Haraki, 12, potentially opens the door for Sky when she comes off her board early.</p>
<p>Okamoto goes big herself but can’t stick the last move. It’s an agonising wait for the score… Yosozumi is the champion, the first in Olympic history.</p>
<p>Hiraki, 12, is the youngest individual Olympic medallist for 85 years, ahead of Brown in bronze.</p>
<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3>
<div> <p>Okamoto cannot complete a clean run so Sky Brown claims the bronze medal!</p> <p>For a 13-year-old, that is remarkable. And 12-year-old Hiraki claims silver.</p> <p>Yosozumi wins gold, the other half of the Japanese double.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>It's 56.47!</p> <p>That puts Brown back into the bronze-medal position. Over to you Misugu Okamoto, who Brown has just displaced, for your third run...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Amazing. She's nailed it.</p> <p>What a run. We await the score... has she done enough for a medal or, whisper it, gold...?</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a><time>5:08AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Here comes Sky Brown's last chance for a clear run.</p> <p>She currently sits in fourth.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final</h3>

<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>It didn't last long! Sky Brown drops down to fourth as Japan dominate the podium spots. Misuku Okamoto scores 53.58 and slips into the bronze position.</p> <p>Pressure on Brown's third run, now.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Brown's missed the kickflip indy!</p> <p>It's all going to be on the third run.</p> <p>She remains in bronze-medal position, for now...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>4:55AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Kokona Hiraki scores 59.04 to leave herself narrowly second.</p> <p>Sky Brown up next!</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Will Sakura's run be beaten?</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>She is the only skater to register a score in the 60s today - and she currently leads.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>That's an improvement from Poppy Olsen, the Aussie, who puts the pressure on Brown by pushing up to fourth with a score of 46.04.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>A dispatch from Pippa Field in the searing Tokyo heat</h3>
<p>To gain a sense of how different this event is from normal Olympic finals, we’ve had the American skater introduced to the crowd while playing a small guitar and they’re all hugging each other pre and post runs.</p>
<p>Sky Brown, initially taking cover under an umbrella from the heat, was the first to congratulate Sakura Yosozumi when her Japanese rival laid down an incredible run, featuring back-to-back 540s, to score 60.09.</p>
<p>Kokona Hiraki, younger than Sky at 12, then scored 58.05.</p>
<p>The Brit was then up, putting in some great combinations before coming unstick on her kickflip indie towards the end. It still earned her 47.53 with two runs to go. This is tense. So tense. A big uptick in level from the heats. </p>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park final</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Sky Brown comes in with a steady 47.53 that leaves her in bronze-medal position, but with still a bit of work to do if she wants the top gong.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Bryce Wettstein shoots to the top of the leaderboard, scoring 44.50 with a unique, gritty run.</p>
<p>But the top four qualifiers still have not skated yet, although Sakura Yosozumi pulls off two backside 540 ollies.</p>
<p>And the Japanese's score is massive! 60.09, the biggest score of the day so far and now she is the new leader.</p>
<div> <p>Yndiara Asp - also of Brazil - follows her compatriot with a solid routine, but she falls just short, scoring 35.20.</p> <p>Poppy Olsen of Australia - with a judo air - makes a precise start but ends up falling from the board.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Dora Varella of Brazil gets proceedings underway with an impressive run, which is reflected by her score: 40.42.</p> <p>A nice array of tricks to kick us off.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Can Sky Brown do it? Britain's youngest Olympian, 13, could become Britain's youngest ever medallist. She finished second in the prelims and so is right in the mix.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Here comes the final.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>A dispatch from Pippa Field, in Tokyo</h3>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Good news for Pozzi as the second heat is a slightly slower one and none of the non-automatic qualifiers beat his time.</p> <p>He's still hanging in there.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <p>13.32secs for Pozzi, giving him a fourth-place finish.</p> <p>That might not be enough for one of the fastest loser spots, however, but it surely won't be far off!</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <p>It's very tight...</p> <p>Pozzi looked good midway through but faded a touch towards the end. He was not in the top two, however - I'm sure of it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>The first of three semi-finals, and Team GB's Andrew Pozzi has a chance of reaching the final.</p> <p>Here we go... Two go through automatically.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>2:59AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Athletics - Women's heptathlon </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>The high jump is under way and so far Katarina Johnson-Thompson has cleared all of her heights.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>2:58AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Want to know more about Sky?</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>If so, give this cracking piece by Pippa Field a read...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>From Pippa Field, Tokyo </h3>
<p>Sky will be one of 4-5 skaters battling it out for medals in the final. The others, really, will be making up the numbers.</p>
<p>Stand by, we could be set for a really historic next few hours.</p>
<h3>Sky Brown qualifies for the final</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>With one heat to play, sitting atop the leaderboard, Brown is guaranteed a spot in the final at 4.30am BST.</p> <p>What an achievement for the 13-year-old.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>From Pippa Field, Tokyo</h3>
<p>Even better for Brown in her second heat who scores 57.40 to further cement her place atop the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Even still, you sense she is still holding something back. Could she be saving the McTwist, a highly difficult trick never seen in competition before, for the final? It's a 540 spin with a flip included and looks damn cool </p>
<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park prelims </h3>
<div> <p>Another great run from Sky Brown.</p> <p>A couple of other bits added from the first: a noseslide and an amazing stalefish. A well timed fakie kickflip, too.</p> <p>And it's a 57.40! She extends her lead at the top of the leaderboard!</p> </div>
<h3>A dispatch from Pippa Field, Tokyo</h3>
<p>Sky, 13, has long said she wants to dial up the trick level to show other girls what can be done.</p>
<p>And she did not hold back at all there in her first heat, scoring 55.26 to move top of the leaderboard, ahead of Japan's Hiraki who is even younger at 12 years old. </p>
<p>Japan Air, 540 to finish, just some of the tricks she pulled out there. You can see by the height she gets out of the bowl how strong and powerful she is. </p>
<p>Brown has another two runs in the heats but set your alarms for the final. </p>
<p>Applause all round from her competitors; they knew that was good. </p>
<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park prelims</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>That is a really strong marker from Brown - and a great first run. So many tricks that had been previously unseen.</p> <p>And it's 55.26! That puts her top of the running heats leaderboard.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>2:27AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park prelims</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Here comes Sky!</p> <p>Oh, and her soundtrack is a bit of the Stone Roses. Glorious.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Skateboarding: Women's park prelims</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Madeleine Larcheron with a 32.34 on her first run to continue the high quality of this heat.</p> <p>Sky Brown still to come.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Skateboarding: Women's park prelims </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Oof!</p> <p>Yndiara Asp comes straight out with a 43.23 with her first run, putting her third in the overall leaderboard.</p> <p>A tough act to follow.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Moments away from Sky Brown dropping in for the first time at these Olympics for her first heat run, as Pippa Field writes from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Already Britain’s youngest summer Olympian, Brown has been the subject of plenty of discussions over what other long-standing records she could break later today if she medals in the final. </p>
<p>What is for certain, though, is that it is extremely hot here at the Ariake Urban Park, heading towards laptop-closing-down-in-protest territory.</p>
<h3>Athletics - Women's heptathlon</h3>
<div> <p><a>Katarina Johnson-Thompson</a> sits in seventh after the 100m hurdles.</p> <p>But it is a marathon not a sprint, remember, and times are more important than standings at this stage.</p> <p>The high jump is the next event.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Kokona Hiraki's score of 52.46 has not been beaten yet, with the Japanese skateboarder the only woman to have broken the 50-point mark.</p> <p>Sky Brown, the 13-year-old is up at 2.20am BST.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Women's golf, round one </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Bianca Pagdanganan of the Philippines continues to lead, two under through seven, but it's shaping up to be a round to forget for Team GB's Mel Reid. She is three over through seven.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Back over to the park now, where Sky Brown is due to compete in her heat in 30 minutes.</p> <p>Kokona Hiraki, of Japan, has shot to the top of the leaderboard with a fantastic run, scoring 52.46.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>That will do very nicely for KJT. Given how difficult her build-up has been, and the concerns about how her Achilles will hold up, a 100m hurdles time of 13.26sec will please her no end.</p>
<p>It is the second fastest time of her life - well down on the 13.09sec PB she set on her way to the world title in 2019, but rapid by most heptathlon standards.</p>
<p>The major questions will come in the high jump and long jump, when she has to push directly off her damaged foot. But as starts go, this was as good she could have envisaged.</p>
<p>A long, long way to go, but perhaps a medal is not out of the question.</p>
<h3>Women's heptathlon - Hurdles, heat one</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Team GB's Katarina Johnson-Thompson wins!</p> <p>She didn't need to win - it was just a heat - but she did, and doesn't that bode well.</p> <p>She ran in 13.27secs.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Women's heptathlon - Hurdles, heat one</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Team GB's Katarina Johnson-Thompson is up in the 100m hurdles heat in the women's heptathlon.</p> <p>Here we go!</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Pippa Field for Telegraph Sport in Tokyo</h3>
<p>A bit of a schism opening in this first prelim heat.</p>
<p>Yosozumi leads with 45.98, Varella second with 41.59, and Stoephasius third with 38.37.</p>
<p>Then it drops to Martin on 16.21 and Tapia Varas - who the BBC commentator just accidentally referred to as Tapas - on 9.73.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Martin gets the competition under way, registering a modest score of 14.40.</p> <p>That is followed up by an awesome run by Sakura Yosozumi, one of the favourites, who scores 42.50.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<h3>Swimming dispatch from Pippa Field, Tokyo</h3>

<div> <h3>Swimming - Women's 10km marathon</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>After almost two hours, the swimmers are at the home strait.</p> <p>Cunha still leads - and she is looking strong.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Swimming - Women's 10km marathon</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Cunha still leads with Van Rouwendaal in second and Kareena Lee of Australia in third.</p> <p>The medal fight begins!</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Swimming - Women's 10km marathon</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>The sprint begins!</p> <p>Cunha of Brazil now leads but Van Rouwendaal is really scrapping.</p> <p>Just over 500m to go.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Sharon Ned van Rouwendaal has moved into third with 1,200 metres to go, with Cunha now in second and Beck still leading.</p> <p>Twichell of the US, who led for most of the race, has slipped to fourth.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Leonie Beck of Germany has pinched the lead from Ashley Twitchell of the USA. Brazil's Ana Marcela Cunha is in third.</p> <p>One lap to go; nearly 8.5km down.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Swimming - Women's 10km marathon</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Dearing has dropped off the main group now, still back in 18th, so, almost definitely, there will be no medal for GB in Tokyo Bay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <p>The water has calmed down, it's less choppy, so there's one thing that has changed.</p> <p>Oher than that, it's as you were. The same leaders lead, and Dearing still sits in 18th.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Dearing still in 18th, more than 30 seconds behind leader Ashley Twichell of the USA.</p> <p>Ann Marcela Cunha of Brazil and Germany's Leonie Beck currently sit in second and third.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Still a little bit of a struggle for Dearing who's slipped to 18, but she is still a part of the leading pack, at least.</p> <p>The swimmers are now approaching the halfway mark.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Not going so well currently for Dearing - the only black swimmer in Team GB's squad - who currently sits in 15th place and trails the leader Ashley Twichell by 16 seconds.</p>
<p>About 4km of the 10 has elapsed, so plenty of time to go.</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Telegraph Sport's live coverage of day 12 at the Tokyo Olympics, where the women's marathon swim is currently underway.</p>
<p>A blazing sun. Drenching humidity. Choppy waters. Gusting winds. Two dozen bodies diving in together for two hours of swimming mixed with a stray elbow here, an occasional kick there.</p>
<p>Marathon swimming is as much a test of mental endurance as it is physical conditioning over a 10-kilometre course. The outcome is often decided by weather and water conditions, as well as strategy and a furious sprint to the finish.</p>
<p>The capital's heat and humidity has already affected other sports during the Tokyo Games. But no change was made.</p>
<p>Instead, organizers moved the start times up to 6:30 a.m. hoping to beat the heat. That's about 1 1/2 hours after sunrise in Tokyo, when the temperature is often already at 27 degrees Celsius and climbing.</p>
<p>The women's 10k is Wednesday, when the forecast calls for 33 degrees C and partly cloudy skies. Conditions for the men are expected to be a few degrees warmer with full sun on Thursday.</p>
<p>FINA, the sport's governing body, limits the upper water temperature to 31 degrees C for marathon swimming. By contrast, the upper limit for pool swimming is 28 degrees C.</p>
<p>The women's field in Tokyo includes defending Olympic champion Sharon van Rouwendaal of the Netherlands, 2016 silver medalist Rachele Bruni of Italy, and Alice Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain in the Games.</p>
<p>Also competing is five-time world champion Ana Marcela Cunha of Brazil; Anderson, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist; and Xin Xin of China, who was fourth in Rio.</p>
<p>Dearing made news before the Games with her bid to wear an extra-large cap designed specifically for thick and curly hair. FINA rejected the cap, citing no previous instances in which swimmers needed "caps of such size and configuration."</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Who does Meghan Markle think she is? </h1> <p> Genuinely. I’d be interested to know. Plus: the Stalin of Sesame Street, and the real scandal about Tory peerages </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Michael Deacon <div>COLUMNIST</div> <time> 9 November 2021 • 7:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Who does Meghan Markle think she is? I don’t mean the question rhetorically. It’s entirely sincere. Because I genuinely don’t know the answer. And I’m beginning to wonder whether she does, either.</p>
<p>According to reports, the California-based former actress has been <a>cold-calling American politicians, urging them to support a policy of paid paternity leave</a>. The politicians were, to say the least, somewhat bemused.</p>
<p>But she can’t be both of these things. Because members of the Royal family aren’t meant to lobby politicians. They’re meant to be above politics.</p>
<p>Any day now, it might well be your turn. Or indeed mine.</p>
<h2>The Stalin of Sesame Street</h2>
<p>“Big Bird,” she declared in disgust, “is a communist.”</p>
<p>Clearly Trump had worked out the real reason why The Count is always counting. He’s preparing the latest statistics on tractor production, or deciding how many capitalist running dogs to dispatch to the gulag.</p>
<p>We can only pray that the great Muppet uprising is stopped before the purges begin.</p>
<h2>The real scandal about peerages... they’re a rip-off</h2>
<p>On reading the allegations about “cash for honours”, the public will no doubt have been shocked and appalled. And rightly so.</p>
<p>In my view, Labour should steal a march on the Government by pledging to offer peerages at more reasonable rates.</p>
<p>“That is why, under a Labour government, we will make a peerage available to anyone who pays our party just £1.5million – 50 per cent lower than the Tories’ going rate.</p>
<p>“Our message is clear. Peerages shouldn’t just be for billionaires. They should be for ordinary, hard-working millionaires, too.”</p>

<h1> Parish churches are a ‘spiritual NHS’ – so why are its leaders so keen to sell them? </h1>
<p> With dioceses identifying up to 356 sites which they want to close within five years, if you love yours, it's time to fight for it </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Emma Thompson <time> 24 December 2021 • 11:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>So why are these sources of comfort and joy under threat at Christmas when we appreciate our parishes the most and young people return to be anchored</a>?
<a>Diocesan bishops seem detached from how badly needed the recently-launched Save The Parish movement i</a>s, and how many messages are posted on
<p>Not much faith, hope and charity here. Mind-numbing absurdities divert money, resources and energy away from their proper home – the parishes – to a distant, expensive, unloved hub.</p>

<p>Before we begin, I must issue an urgent warning. On Tuesday, I wrote a column about a certain California-based former actress. It prompted a polite request from a reader.</p>
