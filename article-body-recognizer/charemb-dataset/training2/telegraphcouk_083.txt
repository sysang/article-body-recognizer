<header> <h1> Why face masks could be doing our children more harm than good </h1> <p> Child development experts worry that long-term use of face masks on children might be inflicting psychological damage </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Luke Mintz <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<a>long-term use of masks on children might be inflicting psychological damage</a>. And it’s not just little ones who are affected. Teenagers, too, are having difficulties. “Everyone is hyper-focused about
<a>Covid,</a> but nobody’s really talking about mental health… how not being able to see facial expressions is affecting children,” says Andrea Sartor, a psychologist with
<a>The Private Therapy Clinic</a>, who previously spent six years working in schools.
<p>Even the World Health Organisation, usually bullish on mask requirements, says the need to prevent Covid needs to be balanced carefully against “psychosocial development” when considering masks for six to 12-year-olds. </p>
<p>In the UK, policymakers have thus far drawn a clear divide between primary and secondary schools. Whilst 11 to 18-year-olds will now be required to wear masks in the classroom, those rules don’t apply to five to 10-year-olds.</p>
<p>Teenage girls are likely to notice the biggest difference, Prof Scott says, because they “as a general rule are better [than boys] at reading subtle emotions”.</p>
<p>He stresses, however, that wearing a mask in a classroom is still preferable to being forced to stay off school altogether, which would happen to thousands of children if Covid is allowed to rip through schools unimpeded. </p>
<p>It is just one example of how the pandemic has transformed school life over the last two years. For the children's sake, we have to hope it ends soon.</p>

<header> <h1> I’ve exceeded the annual Isa limit, what should I do? </h1> <p> HM Revenue Customs will take a keen interest if the annual limit has been breached </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 6 December 2021 • 2:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>An unexpected bonus of having been through multiple national lockdowns is that it's given many of us the chance to save.</p>
<p>Expensive foreign holidays, meals out and shopping trips were all off the cards for large chunks of the past two years, although we have been able to indulge again since restrictions were eased.</p>
<p>With that in mind, an Isa - individual savings account - can be a great way to save any extra cash you have. There are several types of Isa including cash, stocks and shares, innovative finance and Lifetime Isas.</p>
<p>You can put money into one of each kind of Isa each tax year, and you do not pay tax on the interest earned on cash in an Isa or from capital gains from investments in an Isa.</p>
<p>But what happens if you pay too much in? Here is all you need to know about what to do if you exceed your limit. </p>
<h2>I have exceeded my Isa limit and accidentally put more than £20,000 this tax year. What should I do?</h2>
<p>Many people rush to fill their Isas each tax year, meaning mistakes can happen.</p>
<p>If you realise you have overpaid, the first step after spotting an error is to report it to HM Revenue Customs. You can do this by calling its Isa helpline on 0300 200 3300 from 9am to 6pm Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>However, even if you do not spot the error, HMRC will see it and make contact with you.</p>
<p>All the Isa information is reported from your provider to HMRC, which will ensure that you have not put too much into the tax-free accounts.</p>
<a>put money into one cash Isa</a> and one stocks and shares Isa. HMRC will identify which had the payment into it that breached the limit. It will then start the process of what it calls “repairing” the Isa – reclaiming that money.
<p>All investments in the Isa that were made after the limit was breached will no longer be eligible for tax exemption. They will be handed back to the investor.</p>
<p>In a cash Isa this process is simple, but in a stock and shares Isa it is a little trickier, as fund units or shares will have to be sold.</p>
<header> <h1> How to avoid the capital gains tax trap when downsizing </h1> <p> Homeowners can be liable if they move out early </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 13 December 2021 • 12:43pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Record house prices and a surge in demand for <a>detached family homes</a> mean many downsizing older homeowners will receive enormous windfalls <a>when they sell up</a>.</p>
<p>But the cash generated could be considerably less than they banked on. A capital gains tax trap means downsizers could have to unexpectedly fork out thousands of pounds if they move out of their properties before they sell. </p>
<p>Telegraph Money rounds up everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>How are downsizers being caught out?</h2>
<p>Homeowners are not required to pay capital gains tax on their "main" residence, because they will receive <a>private residence relief</a>. </p>
<p>Homeowners can nominate their main residence within two years from the date when they first acquired the additional property. They must nominate the property in which they spend the most time. </p>
<p>But people who leave their main property to live somewhere else can find themselves in a tax trap.</p>
<p>This means that people effectively have an 18-month period to sell their original home before the property starts to become liable for CGT.</p>
<p>For disabled people, or people resident in care homes, the final 36 months of their ownership will be tax free (on the condition that they do not have another private residence).</p>
<h2>How is CGT calculated after this cut off?</h2>
<p>To work out your potential liability, you need to compare the amount you initially paid for the property with the amount you are likely to get when you sell it. </p>
<p>The cost of any improvements made to the property while you owned it, such as a new bathroom or conservatory, should be added to your initial outgoings, as should stamp duty and legal fees. </p>
<p>You can deduct expenses like solicitor's fees from the selling price - use the amount of money which you actually end up receiving.</p>
<p>Your gain is the difference between your costs and what you will get when you sell. This will then be taxed in proportion to the period of time when the property was no longer your main residence, minus the final 18-month tax-free period.</p>
<h2>What does that mean in cash terms?</h2>
<p>For example, if you spent £300,000 buying your property in January 2000, including stamp duty and fees, and paid for £100,000 worth of improvements, your spend was £400,000. </p>
<p>If you then sold the property in December 2020 for £1m, after fees have been deducted, your capital gain was £600,000.</p>
<p>If you had moved into a new house two and a half years before you sold your original property, you would be liable for tax on 12 months’ worth of that gain.</p>
<p>In total, you owned the property for 252 months. So divide 12 by 252, and multiply this figure by £600,000. In this situation, you would be liable for tax on £28,571.</p>
<h2>How much money would you pay?</h2>
<p>The rate of CGT you pay on this remaining taxable gain would then depend on your other income for that year.</p>
<p>If you were a basic-rate taxpayer and the amount kept you within the basic income tax band, your gain would be taxed at 18pc. In this case, that would mean a total charge of £2,928.</p>
<p>If the amount meant you exceeded the basic tax band and became a higher-rate taxpayer, the difference would be charged at 28pc. </p>
<p>If you were already a higher-rate taxpayer, all of the gain would be taxed at 28pc. In this case, <a>a total charge of £4,556.</a></p>

<header> <h1> Jeremy Wade: ‘I self-published a book and lost my life savings’ </h1> <p> The fishing maestro on how one photo started his TV career </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Roz Lewis <time> 19 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Jeremy Wade is a television presenter and author, whose worldwide hit TV series River Monsters ran for nine seasons. Other shows include Mysteries of the Deep and Jeremy Wade’s Dark Waters. Jeremy, 65, is single and lives in Somerset.</p>
<h2>How did your childhood influence your work ethic?</h2>
<p>Quite strongly. My father was a parish priest in Suffolk, which is not something you go into for the money.</p>
<h2>What was your first wage?</h2>
<p>I remember being a farm labourer briefly. I think that was £14 a week.</p>
<h2>Was there a time when you didn’t know how you were going to pay the bills?</h2>
<p>Actually, it’s always been quite hard for me until very recently.</p>
<p>I lived in some ridiculously cheap places. I lived in a place in London in about 1980, where the rent for the entire house was divided up among however many people live there. And at one point, I think I was paying £2.40 a week.</p>
<p>It was barely habitable. There were no banisters, there were no floorboards in the bathroom, and there was no glass in my bedroom window.</p>
<h2>What were you doing before your TV career happened?</h2>
<p>I was a teacher briefly in my early 20s. That was my first regular job. When I was working in London, after I left teaching, I worked as a motorcycle messenger for a year too.</p>
<p>After I travelled to India in my mid twenties, I wrote and sold a couple of articles for fishing magazines. I had a glimmer of an idea that here was something I might possibly be able to make some money from, doing something that I quite enjoyed.</p>
<p>Having said that, one of the articles they paid £40, and the other one was £20, the latter for which I have yet to be paid.</p>
<p>I never really had any sort of sustained periods of work. I did get a job in an advertising agency, so the longest I worked apart from now was three and a half years.</p>
<h2>What has been the most lucrative part of your career so far?</h2>
<p>Well, I guess that would be now, although, obviously with Covid things slowed down.</p>
<p>Since this sort of unbroken spell of television, which we’re talking about 12 or 13 years now, financially things got better for me.</p>
<p>Annually, depending on whatever the contract is, my income is comfortably in six figures.</p>
<h2>How did you break into TV?</h2>
<h2>What was your best business decision?</h2>
<p>Personally, if I see somebody whom I admire, pushing some product, I’m just very disappointed in them and I would be disappointed in myself if I did that.</p>
<h2>And your worst financial decision?</h2>
<p>In 1992 I self published a book that I ended up financing with my savings from my advertising job. It didn’t do well and so my life savings were gone. I had 2,000 books that nobody wanted.</p>
<p>I spent three and a half years working, just getting back to where I started, selling those books in ones and twos to bookshops. But that book critically got picked up, and my name got out there.</p>
<h2>Do you have a pension or a financial strategy?</h2>
<h2>What are your priorities for the next 10 years?</h2>
<p>In theory, I could retire, but I don’t want to. In terms of working, I’m more concerned now with just doing the work that I want to do.</p>
<p>I’ve got a few stocks and shares, just a few thousand pounds that I inherited. I’ve got a house. I’ve helped family members with housing.</p>
<h2>What would you change about the financial world?</h2>
<p>I remember it being pretty hard when I was young, looking into the future thinking, “how on earth am I going to survive financially?” It’s the ever-increasing cost of housing – it’s getting harder and harder.</p>
<h2>Does money make you happy?</h2>
<p>I think it’s nice to have enough. Of course, I’m motivated by money and needing enough but I think beyond that, the work is more the motivation.</p>

<header> <h1> ‘I still get royalties from Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree’ </h1> <p> Brenda Lee on being a collector and the hardest lessons she's learned about business </p> </header>
<div> <div> By John Wright <time> 26 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Brenda Lee, 77, is the American singer who found fame in 1960 with I’m Sorry. She has sold more than 100 million records and Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree has become a Christmas standard.</p>
<p>She has had 19 UK Top 40 hits and was the fourth most successful recording artist in America in the 1960s after Elvis Presley, the Beatles (who opened for her in Hamburg) and Ray Charles.</p>
<p>Today she lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband.</p>
<h2>How did your childhood influence your attitude to money? </h2>
<h2>Was she surprised when you wanted a career in music? </h2>
<p>Well, I had been singing since I was three years old and both my mom and dad always said that one day I would be a star.</p>
<h2>What was your first job? </h2>
<p>Probably on a television station called WAGA-TV out of Atlanta, Georgia. I was singing. It was called the TV Ranch show with Jon Farmer and the TV Wranglers. I was about nine or 10.</p>
<p>My first big break was with Red Foley, out of Springfield, Missouri, when I was 10. He had a national television show called Ozark Jubilee and I became a regular on that. And that’s, basically, how it all started.</p>
<h2>How much were you paid?</h2>
<p>I never knew anything about that. My mother handled all that and my manager, Dub Allbritten. I never knew about money and I didn’t want to know. All I wanted to be was a singer.</p>
<h2>Are you a saver or a spender?</h2>
<p>I save it. It was the court’s jurisdiction. Any money that I made went into the court to be kept for me until I was 21.</p>
<p>Yes. We’ve invested in a lot of property and land, but we don’t dabble in the stock market.</p>
<p>No. My family makes me happy. My friends make me happy. It’s nice to not worry about money so much, but no I don’t think that’s what makes you happy.</p>
<h2>What have been your best and worst financial decisions? </h2>
<p>I think my best decision with money was letting somebody else handle it. And I’ve been lucky like that. My husband is a very astute businessman. He invested a lot in land and all the good stuff, and he owns his own businesses as well.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any glaring mistakes that we made, although, you know, we all spend too much sometimes.</p>
<h2>Do you still receive royalties after 60 years for all your hits and albums? </h2>
<p>Absolutely, yes we do: especially from Europe – you’re more loyal. It’s a blessing, that’s what it is. I’ve been very fortunate.</p>
<h2>What are the best and worst things you ever bought? </h2>
<p>I think the best I’ve done is help everybody that I can. I’m big on that.</p>
<p>I like to collect things. They call me Hector the Collector because I collect everything: jade, silver, Imari ware [porcelain] from Japan, Limoges and Wedgwood.</p>
<h2>Do you collect paintings? </h2>
<p>I do. Not that many. I didn’t get into paintings as much as I got into the other stuff. I do have some very old artefacts from Japan and Europe that are now worth tens of thousands of dollars that I paid hardly anything for.</p>
<h2>What started you on collecting? </h2>
<p>I think it started because, you know, we never had a lot when I was a child, just the necessities. There was no extra to buy anything trivial that you wanted. So I started buying stuff when I could.</p>
<h2>Have you splashed out? </h2>
<h2>What's the hardest lesson you've learned about business?</h2>
<h2>Is the music industry a good one to get into? </h2>
<p>It’s a completely different world out there now, music-wise. There are so many avenues of revenue that you don’t know about, and it’s hard to keep up with all of it.</p>
<p>Back when I started, I think it was more fun because all the entertainers loved each other.</p>
<p>We weren’t competing and we were all in the industry that we were trying to make better; and that doesn’t happen today.</p>
<h2>Do you feel hard done by over music streaming? </h2>
<p>I think that musicians should be paid. I think that’s their life’s work and that’s what they did and I think absolutely that they should be paid.</p>
<p>You do get paid less that way, but it’s OK. It all adds up and it’s wonderful that music after 60 years you’re still selling it; you’re making money.</p>

<header> <h1> Touker Suleyman: ‘I lost everything on a bad deal – even my home’ </h1> <p> The Dragons' Den star on his best investments and how he has entrepreneurship in his blood </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Roz Lewis <time> 2 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Touker Suleyman is a businessman and serial entrepreneur who has been on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den since 2015.</p>
<p>He has invested in fashion, retail and tech companies, as well as his property portfolio. He lives in London and has two daughters.</p>
<h2>How did your upbringing influence your attitude to money?</h2>
<p>My parents came from northern Cyprus in 1959 to the UK and they started a restaurant. I saw how hard they worked. I think I always had it in my blood to be an entrepreneur at a very young age.</p>
<h2>What was your first wage?</h2>
<p>When I was 19 or 20 I was an accountant earning £5 a week for a company called Ridley Co.</p>
<p>Eventually I got involved in buying clothes and my grandmother was selling them to a friend. That was my first entry into the fashion business. It went from there. That was when I was 21.</p>
<p>I made my first million very young, in the fashion business. By my mid-20s I was the chairman of two public companies, way out of my depth, when I lost everything.</p>
<p>I lost everything when I bought a company. I was very lucky that I had a family that could help me.</p>
<p>I had a house in Highgate that I sold to pay off the debt. Sometimes you need to go through life and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>I’ve focused on hard work, building my fashion businesses and building my property portfolios, and then eventually building my brands. And then my investments.</p>
<h2>What has been your best buy?</h2>
<p>I think the wisest thing I did, if I look back now, is that I made money in my fashion businesses and bought commercial property, which I still own and which has gone up tremendously in value.</p>
<p>I have two or three buildings in Fitzrovia [central London], which I think I bought in the 1980s.</p>
<h2>What has been your best business decision?</h2>
<p>I think setting up the Low Profile Group at the beginning. It is basically a property company today. Then we’ve got other businesses such as Hawes Curtis. We’ve spent the last couple of years restructuring.</p>
<p>We’ve got an amazing brand called Ghost London. We’ve just done a collaboration with Marks Spencer and that has gone through the roof and both parties are very happy. We also invested in and relaunched Finery.</p>
<h2>What about your Dragons’ Den investments?</h2>
<p>In the last series Peter Jones and I invested in Gener8 [a browser that allows you to make money out of your data] on a valuation of £600,000. It later issued shares at £10m.</p>
<p>I also invest a lot outside the Den. I do a lot of work with start-ups, which I give advice to and help open doors for.</p>
<p>I love what I do. I love a challenge. It’s not always about money. For me it’s about fulfilment; it is about achieving. It’s about helping others and listening to people.</p>
<h2>Are you a saver or a spender?</h2>
<p>A bit of both. I live in a nice home. I drive an electric BMW i3 car. I’m not a big spender. People who know me, since my 20s and now, know my lifestyle has never changed. I don’t have private planes or private yachts.</p>
<h2>What’s the hardest lesson you’ve learnt about money?</h2>
<p>Bamber Stores taught me a lot. I would say to people: “Never stretch yourself. Never borrow more than you know you can pay back. And cash is king; always have enough so you’ve got working capital for your business.”</p>
<h2>What are your priorities for the next five to 10 years?</h2>
<p>My priority is good health. In 2019 I had pneumonia and was given 24 hours to live. That was in April. In August I had another illness and was in intensive care and virtually died. So I have learnt the value of health. You cannot buy good health.</p>
<p>That’s where you put things into focus and you realise that it’s not all about money. It’s about looking after your health, looking after your family, looking after your friends. That’s what’s important.</p>
<h2>Do you also invest in the stock market?</h2>
<p>Within my pension fund, yes, I’ve got a portfolio of stocks. I’m a big investor in Marks Spencer. I’m a big believer that it’s going to come back very strong, because I’m involved in supplying it and dealing with it.</p>
<h2>Do you have a financial adviser?</h2>
<h2>What would you change about the financial world?</h2>
<p>There should be one currency across the world. This would allow the implementation of a minimum world wage more easily, thus helping to reduce poverty and inequality.</p>
<p>We know that in certain countries people are being used as slaves so that’s one thing that I am very conscious about.</p>
<h2>Does money make you happy?</h2>
<p>I think money is important to a certain point. We all need money to buy food and to pay our bills. But I don’t let it get to my head where it takes me over. Forty years ago I drove an Aston Martin and I thought I was a playboy.</p>
<p>I think as you get older you realise what’s important in life.</p>
<p>The new series of Dragons’ Den starts on Thursday at 8pm on BBC One</p>

<header> <h1> Rules relaxed on who can take out a 40-year mortgage </h1> <p> Eligible borrowers can now borrow seven times their income, compared with the usual five times </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Rachel Mortimer <time> 26 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Home buyers who fix their mortgage for four decades can now borrow seven times their salary, including those earning below average salaries. </p>
<p>Habito, a lender, has relaxed its borrowing rules for customers who earn more than £25,000 when applying for its long-term fixed-rate loan, which allows buyers to fix for up to 40 years. </p>
<p>The Habito One mortgage <a>launched earlier this year as the first of its kind</a> and lending is usually capped at five times a borrower's income. </p>
<p>Daniel Hegarty, of Habito, said: "We believe extending affordability will be particularly attractive to those who want to buy a home with lots of future potential, or for people who are expecting pay-rises over their careers."</p>
<p>"Also, they have chosen careers with decent stability and likelihood of progression." All borrowers must have at least a 10pc deposit and self-employed borrowers are not eligible. </p>

<header> <h1> British stock market enjoys new year boom – here’s what you should buy </h1> <p> FTSE jumps as investors bet on a quick recovery from the omicron variant </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sam Benstead <time> 4 January 2022 • 11:49am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The British stock market has risen by more than 1pc in 2022's first day of trading, amid positive signs the omicron variant may be less severe than initially thought. </p>
<p>Travel stocks led the gains, with British Airways owner IAG rising 9.5pc. Rolls-Royce was up 3.5pc in early trading, spurred on by the £53m sale of its Norwegian engine arm Bergen.</p>
<p>Commodities also gained ground, with oil firms BP and Shell up 3.6pc and 3pc respectively. Retailers JD Sports and Kingfisher also pushed higher.</p>
<p>Professional investors said shares in companies <a>sensitive to the economy</a> would perform best this year as the omicron variant burnt itself out and economic growth accelerated.</p>
<a>oil and gas sector</a> at the start of 2021 – advice that made investors 42pc – UBS, the bank, said it would be another good year for “cyclical” stocks such as oil companies, miners and banks. 
<p>Mark Haefele from the firm said: “<a>Economic growth</a> will be higher than normal in the first half of the year, so investors should buy companies that win from more economic activity.” </p>
<p>Laura Foll, a fund manager at Janus Henderson, also said <a>banks</a> and oil companies globally were in a strong position for 2022, particularly for <a>investors who sought income</a>.</p>
<p>“Shell increased its dividend by 38pc in spring 2021 and said future payouts would be based on that level. It expects dividends to grow by 4pc annually from now on,” she said. </p>
<a>Halfords</a> suggested that households would be willing to spend their extra savings despite
<a>high inflation</a>,” she said.
<p>TipRanks, which tracks stock market research, found that analysts were forecasting big returns from companies that had recently been hit by new restrictions linked to the omicron variant but were still good businesses that would recover.</p>
<p>Analysts said pub chain Mitchells Butlers, coach operator Stagecoach, caterer SSP and easyJet, the airline, could rise by 41pc, 34pc, 33pc and 24pc respectively over the coming year. </p>
