<p>Rupert Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall just became the new owners of a $US200 million ($280 million) cattle ranch in Montana, formerly owned by the billionaire Koch family.</p>
<p>The 90-year-old media tycoon bought the 340,000-acre (1375-square-kilometre) property, known as Beaverhead, said a spokeswoman, declining to comment on the price, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The ranch is in south-west Montana near Yellowstone National Park, and features elk, antelope and mule deer.</p>
<p>There’s also a 45-kilometre-long river for trout fishing and 25 homes. The ranch has nearly 7000 cow/calf pairs of a variety of breeds, according to Matador Cattle’s website.</p>
<p>Fred Koch’s son, Charles, who now runs Koch Industries, is one of the most significant donors in recent history to libertarian and conservative causes.</p>

<div>Should home sellers ‘Deck the Halls’ when listing at Christmas?</div>
<p>And while it’s a great look for the festive season, if you’re selling your home, experts say you might want to dial it down, just a bit.</p>
<p>Think less Christmas with the Griswolds from National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, and more classy Hallmark movie far removed from the festive season.</p>
<p>It may sound a little Grinch-like, but keeping your house styled less like a mall Christmas photo, and more like the everyday, will help with the longevity of the listing, Elyce Cinerari, a Melbourne-based stylist with Real Estate Stylists said.</p>
<p>Especially since many prospective buyers are now looking to prepare for Christmas, rather than for a property purchase, meaning houses might be on the market for longer than expected.</p>
<p>“My advice is no Christmas trees or lights,” Ms Cinerari said. “If the house is still on the market in February then it’s going to look strange.”</p>
<p>Home sellers should, however, focus on making their outdoor areas and pools appear enticing, as many buyers look for great outdoor areas during the summer months, she said.</p>
<p>Stylist and director of Bon Habitat Liz Montgomery agreed that a more “subtle Christmas vibe” is the way to go when trying to sell during Christmas, instead of taking the trip to tinsel town.</p>
<p>While some people are turning their homes into a winter wonderland, despite it being summer, agents say sellers should push back the timing of going over the top with decorations.</p>
<p>Place Estate Agents Gumdale lead agent Anna Dunne said she had been working with one of her Brisbane clients who are a family that loves Christmas.</p>
<p>“I had to push them back a little-bit from putting up their tree until the 16th of December,” Ms Dunne said.</p>
<p>Ms Dunne said the Christmas colours – particularly the dark greens and reds – can work against vendors trying to make their homes feel open, light and spacious.</p>
<p>“What it does because the colours are so dark, it closes the house up and makes it look smaller,” Ms Dunne said. “Space and light are really what sells a home.”</p>
<p>While many people were warning home sellers not to decorate for the festive season, in Sydney, agents were not as fussed.</p>
<p>Ray White Castle Hill selling agent Kael Sharp said he was not concerned when vendors decked the halls or made their home look like an Elf from the North Pole got loose with a sleigh full of baubles and tinsel.</p>
<p>“If we take the photos before Christmas and there is a tree or decorations in them, buyers will understand,” Mr Sharp said.</p>
<p>McGrath Bankstown’s Michael Ristevski said having yourself a merry little Christmas was not an issue when selling.</p>
<p>“I find that all the people [buyers] with different religions have no issue with Christmas, even if they don’t believe in it, they still get into the Christmas spirit when inspecting a home,” he said.</p>

<div>The most popular suburbs for home buyers in 2021</div>
<p>A string of Sydney suburbs have dominated a list of the most in-demand areas for Australian home buyers in 2021, but it was a Melbourne suburb that took out the top spot.</p>
<p>Annandale, in Sydney’s inner west, took out second spot – followed by nearby Balmain, then Bronte in the eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>For the year to date, all but three of the top 30 suburbs for average view per listing were in Sydney, with Lambton in Newcastle and Albert Park in Melbourne rounding out the list.</p>
<p>Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell was not surprised to see Sydney suburbs dominate the list, given the strong interest seen in Sydney property over the year as prices soared.</p>
<p>“Some of it is dreaming as well ... we often look towards premium areas to get ideas and have a sticky beak,” she said.</p>
<p>“It really ties into interest that surrounds The Block, which is like a marketing campaign on steroids, not just from serious buyers but sticky beaks wanting to know what those homes are like,” Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>“It’s a really wonderful lifestyle suburb to live in,” said Ms Dwyer, who noted interest in the postcode had picked up as buyers sought out more space and lifestyle locations during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Ms Dwyer, who sold one of the homes on this year’s season of the show, said The Block had heightened already strong interest in the suburb, and led to more demand from out of area buyers in Hampton and surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p>Launceston took out the top spot in Tasmania, as affordability constraints prompted more local and interstate buyers to look beyond Hobart – where house prices jumped more than 30 per cent over the year to September, Domain figures show.</p>
<p>Unley in Adelaide, Yarralumla in Canberra, and Fannie Bay in Darwin were the most in demand suburbs in their respective states and territories.</p>
<p>Back in Sydney, selling agent Tina O’Connor of Ray White Annandale was not surprised to hear the suburb took out the top spot in the Harbour City and second spot in the nation for average views per listing.</p>
<p>“Usually when we have a property on the market in Annandale, you would be getting about 200 email enquiries on those properties and quite a few phone calls as well,” she said.</p>
<p>Keyword searches for study, garage, balcony, courtyard and garden all increased in 2021, as did searches for homes with pools and properties close to the beach or water.</p>
<p>There was also a jump in regional living keyword searches, with dramatic rises in rural, acreage and farm searches as the rise in remote working and affordability constraints prompted more people to consider a tree change.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has forced us all to use our homes differently as we spent more time than ever in them and perhaps forever made a mark on our purchasing decisions, property wish lists and architectural trends,” Dr Powell said.</p>

<div>Best of the worst property listings for 2021</div>
<p>It’s fair to say 2021 was a wild year for real estate, and we’re not just talking about the crazy prices.</p>
<p>From houses that were built by mistake, to underwater blocks of land for sale, there were some absolute pearlers that hit the market this year, highlighting just how bonkers the property market can be, no matter where you live.</p>
<h3>The house that was falling off a cliff</h3>
<p>Lake Michigan, Wisconsin, United States.</p>
<p>Sold for: $US250,000 ($350,000).</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and so it was for this cliffhanger in Wisconsin, that found a buyer who clearly likes living, ahem, on the edge.</p>
<p>The listing described the house as having “sweeping Lake Michigan frontage” and, to be fair, it wasn’t wrong, although the property wasn’t quite up to code.</p>
<p>Set on 4.7 hectares of land with – no arguments here – beautiful views, the ranch-style house made headlines for its precarious position on the verge of falling off a crumbling cliff.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the property took months to sell. Whoever bought this place was expected to demolish and build something new, a little further back from the cliff.</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.</p>
<p>Listed for $US149,000 ($209,000).</p>
<p>This listing could have just been your run-of-the-mill dilapidated hovel, but instead the owner – a real estate agent, no less – decided to take the horror up a notch and include some creepy old dolls in the photos.</p>
<p>The effect was slightly terrifying but, in what can only be described as strong 2021 real estate energy, it worked: the property became the top listing on Realtor.com and sold after only one day on the market.</p>
<p>“I did it just to get the house some attention because the house was so hideous and horrifying,” he said.</p>
<p>It says everything about 2021 real estate that this place went under contract within a day.</p>
<h3>The underwater blocks of land</h3>
<p>Ontario, Canada, and San Francisco, United States.</p>
<p>Listed for: $C99,000 ($108,000) and $US75,000 ($102,000).</p>
<p>Property prices went crazy across the world this year but this was a new – quite literal – low: people selling blocks of underwater land.</p>
<p>The only thing more bizarre was the fact there were more than one of these listings on the market at the same time.</p>
<p>At the same time, a similar plot in San Francisco, United States, was up for grabs.</p>
<p>Set on half a hectare of tidal land, the vacant block was located east of Candlestick Point, underneath the famous San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>The listing read: “Seller is not sure if this tide land can be developed into a yacht harbor (sic), houseboat park, a pier or anything at all. Land is underwater”.</p>
<p>Both listings have now been taken down and it is unknown whether the blocks found buyers.</p>
<div><h3>The house that got built by mistake</h3><p>Apple Valley, California, United States.</p><p>$US309,000 ($417,000).</p><p>A house described as being “built by accident” in 2007 in the middle of a desert was listed this year.</p></div>
<p>Since then, the house has been destroyed by vandals and what possibly could have been a garage is full of graffiti; inside, the walls were ruined and fixtures and fittings ripped out.</p>
<p>But in 2021 no listing was too weird and every house has a buyer. The house is now under offer, according to the listing, and will hopefully get the start it deserved, 14 years later.</p>
<h3>London’s thinnest house</h3>
<p>Shepherd’s Bush, London.</p>
<p>Listed for: £950,000 ($1.7 million).</p>
<p>Not every strange listing has come out of the United States. Just most of them.</p>
<p>This five-level West London period home – reminiscent of the magical house that was invisible to neighbours and owned by Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies – made headlines around the world when it was listed in February.</p>
<h3>The unlivable Sydney houses with no kitchen or toilets </h3>
<p>Kensington, Sydney, and Strathfield, Sydney.</p>
<p>Sold for: $4.7 million and $5.5 million.</p>
<p>Sydney’s property market has been a force unto itself in 2021. These listings were not weird, strictly speaking, but it was more the prices they fetched at auction in June that were absolutely wild.</p>
<p>No kitchen, no toilet, crumbling ceilings: it was no problem for buyers, who were shelling out millions like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p>First was a house at 25 Duke Street, Kensington, that had no kitchen or toilet, let alone power or water, which sold under the hammer for $4.705 million.</p>
<p>One week later it was a house at 155 The Boulevarde, Strathfield, in Sydney’s inner west – with crumbling ceilings, cracked walls and a murky brown pool – that sold at auction for $5.5 million.</p>
<p>The fact it had been left empty for two years and occupied by squatters was no matter for Sydney house hunters. It sold for a massive $1.1 million over its reserve price.</p>

<div>Clearance rates plunge but home sharing fence with prison snatches $2.5 million</div>
<p>Future interest rate hikes and chatter that the red-hot market could run out of steam fuelled the almost unprecedented pre-Christmas sell-off, experts say.</p>
<p>But with the nation’s two biggest cities collecting their lowest clearance rates in months, buyers might finally be starting to baulk.</p>
<p>Only Brisbane bucked the trend, with 75 per cent of homes cleared at auction on Saturday, compared to 61 per cent this time last year.</p>
<p>In Sydney, a low 58 per cent clearance rate was collated (compared to 75 per cent this time last year) while Melbourne achieved 61 per cent – compared to 76 per cent 12 months ago.</p>
<p>For the NSW capital, it’s the lowest preliminary clearance rate since June 2020, according to Domain auction records.</p>
<p>Despite the drop, high-end homes across the city continued to fetch lofty sums, with a chic four-bedroom riverfront abode on an 822 square metre lot at 9 Viret Street, Hunters Hill, selling for $16.4 million, according to Domain records.</p>
<p>Nicholas Cowdrill, of McGrath Hunters Hill, sold the European-inspired home in conjunction with Tracey Dixon and said it was the fourth highest price ever achieved in the suburb as well as the top sale across all three cities on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The $5 million-plus market here hasn’t slowed down at all … the guy that owned the property built it 20 years ago,” Mr Cowdrill said.</p>
<p>“The purchasers had been looking for about 18 months for the right home and they weren’t going to let it go</p>
<p>“It was really a one-horse race. We had three registered parties and we met the reserve, so it was a great outcome for this size of land and house. It also shows the demand for houses in Hunters Hill.</p>
<p>At 36 Austral Street, Malabar, a home sharing a fence with the Long Bay Correctional Complex fetched $500,000 above its reserve in a remarkable auction that proved if the property’s hot enough, it doesn’t matter who your neighbours are.</p>
<p>“I guess it was because the land size is huge but the home does need a lot of work and the last family had been in there nearly 30 years,” Mr Brodie said.</p>
<p>“It’s also pretty close to the beach and it’s a good family spot, so while some people had some hesitation, at the end of the day it was a family that snapped it up.</p>
<p>“Bidding started at $1.6 million and it was just back and forth with no vendor bid, and it was mainly two parties.</p>
<p>Across Sydney, 665 auctions were reported on Saturday, with 208 withdrawn and 69 passed in. A total of 388 sold under the hammer for a total of just over $427.47 million.</p>
<p>“I think really it’s the last-minute rush for people who need to buy something … and they are grabbing what they can because they don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said.</p>
<p>“But most people tucked away their pens and paper for the year and a lot of this was the leftover stock … there’s still not a lot at the top end.</p>
<p>“What happens next year is going to depend on vendor confidence … but it’s been an exhausting year and I think the market has a lot to digest.”</p>
<p>“Two bidders fought hard for the keys to this charming and coveted property,” Mr Blackett said.</p>
<p>“It was a very well-attended auction in the park opposite the property next to the Royal Botanic Gardens and there was spirited bidding.</p>
<p>“The downsizing buyer was relieved and excited as the hammer went down.”</p>
<p>Ray White Cheltenham agent Kevin Chokshi said it was nothing short of a super Saturday for their agency, with buyers still throwing up their paddles across a record number of auctions.</p>
<p>Of those, a humble three-bedroom brick home at 51 Latrobe Street, Cheltenham, sold for $1.38 million under the hammer – just over the $1.25 million reserve.</p>
<p>“This is on the beach and closer to train stations, which a lot of downsizers like. And also there are still plenty of people out there who just want to get something before Christmas.</p>
<p>In Brisbane, a run-down cottage on a riverfront parcel at 371 Corso, Yeronga, claimed the city’s top sale of the day at $3.275 million, simultaneously smashing the suburb house price record for a knockdown home.</p>
<p>“It was a deceased estate and the homeowner had been there since day one. It was built in the ’60s and he had owned the land since the ’40s,” selling agent Sharon Wilson, of McGrath Annerley/Yeronga, said.</p>
<p>“We had 10 registered bidders, of which three were the major participators and a local family bought it. Bidding kicked off at $2.5 million and it reached reserve just prior to the goal — we got about $100,000 over.</p>
<p>“And the house is a knockdown. We had three private sales on the river here that all sold early to mid this year and they were all under $3 million, and they were better homes, with bigger land value.”</p>
<p>In Marsden, several homes went under the hammer in the oft-overlooked suburb, proving appetite is strong for Brisbane’s most affordable pockets.</p>
<p>“We settled eight properties in total yesterday … and that’s the most amount of properties I’ve ever sold at auction in a day. Prior to that, the record was six,” Ray White Marsden agent Rebecca Cuderman said.</p>
<p>“Marsden has had as bad as a wrap as it gets in the past but it’s probably seen one of the largest jumps in growth for us — and there’s still a hell of a lot of room to grow.</p>
<p>“From the high school being awarded number one (for the area) and infrastructure coming, it’s pushed up family home prices about 35 per cent.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ms Cuderman said 7 Elaroo Street, Marsden, achieved one of the top results of the day after the humble abode in need of a makeover collected $530,500.</p>
<p>“It was a really old home and it needed a lot of cosmetic work. The owners were very happy to sell it for $430,000 … but in the end we had 12 to 13 registered bidders and six of those were bidding.</p>
<p>“The guy who bought it is a footy player who is using it as an investment.”</p>
<p>Ms Cuderman said the suburb’s affordability had fuelled increased rates of buyer demand.</p>
<p>Throughout Brisbane, 106 auctions were reported, with 80 selling under the hammer for a total of just over $53.56 million.</p>
<div>Cult survivors seeking proceeds from Olinda house sale</div>
<p>Survivors of the cult The Family are seeking proceeds from the sale of a property in the Dandenong Ranges that was once home to the group’s leader, Anne Hamilton-Byrne.</p>
<p>A legal caveat has been put on the title of the 12-bedroom house and grounds at 1445 Mount Dandenong Road, close to Olinda village in Melbourne’s east, that has recently been up for sale.</p>
<p>The caveat was placed on the property by Leeanne Creese, a former resident of the house and a survivor of the cult.</p>
<p>She is the lead plaintiff in a class action brought by cult survivors against a Hamilton-Byrne-linked company and the executors of her estate.</p>
<p>Ms Creese declined to comment, but The Age understands the caveat relates to a financial interest in a share of the proceeds of sale that the survivors are seeking.</p>
<p>Ms Creese escaped the cult as a teenager, then gave testimony, alongside her siblings, that helped instigate a police raid in 1987 that freed other children from the cult.</p>
<p>The document says the defendants to the class action are the company Life For All Creatures Ltd — which is also the owner of the Olinda home for sale — and also the executors of Ms Hamilton-Byrne’s estate.</p>
<p>David John Munroe, Timothy John Mackay and Helen Elisabeth Ethel Buchanan are listed as the current directors of Life For All Creatures.</p>
<p>The house is currently listed as being “under contract”, meaning the seller has accepted an offer from a buyer, but the sale is yet to be finalised.</p>
<p>Ms Creese did not wish to comment. The Age attempted to contact the house’s vendors, Life For All Creatures.</p>
<p>While not commenting on this case, property law specialist Simon Libbis said a caveat would have to be withdrawn by anyone claiming the financial interest at the time of a property settlement.</p>
<p>He said parties “might receive funds owed, in return for the caveat being withdrawn at settlement”.</p>

<div>From Hollywood to Hawthorn: The stunning homes celebrities bought and sold in 2021</div>
<p>Some of Australia’s most famous faces bought and sold property in 2021 as the booming market attracted big-name buyers along the east coast.</p>
<p>Hitmakers and Hollywood stars called in investments or found themselves the ultimate family hangout from Byron Bay to the inner-city suburbs of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Here are 10 of the most significant celebrity transactions in 2021.</p>
<p>The singer-songwriter, also known as Toni Watson, is best known for her soulful pop songs like <i>Dance Monkey, </i>but she also made some big property moves over 2021.</p>
<p>That included selling her Mount Eliza mansion for $6 million in November after buying the property on Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula in early 2020 for $5.1 million.</p>
<p>The five-bedroom manse on a spacious block was bought by a local family.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one of Australia’s biggest stars, Kylie Minogue also proved to be an astute investor, after selling her Armadale investment property for $1.715 million.</p>
<p>When Kylie bought the two-bedroom home in Melbourne’s inner east in 1990 she paid just $185,000, making her a massive on-paper profit of $1.53 million.</p>
<p>Time will tell if the pop princess, also known as the Singing Budgie, will make a return to Australia to buy more property.</p>
<p>She told BBC2 in October that she was planning to return Down Under after spending much of 2021 in lockdown with her family here.</p>
<p>Kylie was not the only Minogue to dabble in the Australian property market in 2021.</p>
<p>Her sister and fellow pop star Danni Minogue bought an impressive four-bedroom spread in Hawthorn mid-way through 2021, paying $3.52 million.</p>

<p><b>Lleyton and Bec Hewitt </b></p>
<p>Tennis star and commentator Lleyton Hewitt and his TV-star wife Bec sold their Toorak mansion in November for between $15 million and $16 million.</p>
<p>The couple and their three children had lived at the property in Melbourne’s most expensive suburb for five years before putting it up for sale.</p>
<p>While it had plenty of luxury features, the one thing missing from the home was a tennis court.</p>
<p>The family have reportedly been looking to move to Sydney, where Bec grew up.</p>
<p>TV and radio host Andy Lee, one half of Hamish and Andy, set tongues wagging when he dropped a cool $8.5 million on a derelict Hawthorn mansion in November, well above the asking price range of $7 million to $7.7 million.</p>
<p>The home, built in 1876, had sat empty for 30 years and lacked a bathroom or kitchen, but it didn’t stop the host of <i>The Hundred</i> from snapping up the property which has riverfront views.</p>
<p>As well as his hosting duties in 2021, Lee and his partner Rebecca Harding adopted an adorable terrier puppy named Henri who has appeared in many of the couple’s social media posts.</p>
<p><b>Hamish Blake and Zoe Foster Blake</b></p>
<p>Andy’s radio and TV co-host Hamish Blake, meanwhile, completed a move from Melbourne to Sydney with his family in 2021.</p>
<p>Hamish and entrepreneur wife Zoe Foster Blake sold their luxurious Richmond digs in March for $7.435 million, records show. The sale happened just two weeks after the property was listed.</p>
<p>The glamour couple, who share two children, had already bought a mansion in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Vaucluse for $8.925 million in late 2020, allowing Foster Blake to be closer to her business Go-To Skincare.</p>
<p><b>Rachel Griffiths and Andy Taylor</b></p>
<p>Australian acting royalty Rachel Griffiths also made a move from Melbourne to Sydney, buying in the harbour city in 2021.</p>
<p>Griffiths and her artist husband Andy Taylor bought a designer terrace in Sydney’s inner city for $2 million after it was listed with a guide of $1.75 million.</p>
<p>The three-bedroom digs with no parking sold and settled in a beneficial trust owned by Taylor.</p>
<p>The couple had previously lived in Melbourne for seven years after returning from the US, where they were based while Griffiths was acting in TV series there.</p>
<p>Most recently Griffiths won the best supporting actress award from the Australian Film Institute for her role in TV series Total Control.</p>
<p><b>Rove McManus and Tasma Walton</b></p>
<p>Gold Logie-winning comedian and TV presenter Rove McManus and his film and TV-star wife Tasma Walton bought a Coogee home for $3.76 million in March 2021.</p>
<p>The home, which was sold as part of a deceased estate, seemed like a bargain for the couple who quietly sold their home in Bronte, a neighbouring beach suburb in Sydney’s exclusive east, for more than $14.5 million late in 2020.</p>
<p>The couple also own a home in Perth which they bought for $2 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Hollywood superstar Nicole Kidman was linked to the sale of a sub-penthouse in Sydney’s Milsons Point, which sold for $2.78 million earlier in 2021.</p>
<p>The sub-penthouse in the Latitude building was snapped up by corporate interests linked to Kidman and is a floor below another apartment Kidman reportedly owns.</p>
<p>Kidman now owns four apartments in the building including two penthouses, which have been turned into one mega apartment.</p>
<p>Those apartments and her Southern Highlands farm Bunya Hill are all held in company names, of which the current sole director and owner on paper is Annette Rechner.</p>
<p>Rechner is a supporter of the UTS mental health unit Kidman Centre, established by Kidman’s late father, Professor Antony Kidman.</p>
<p>Hollywood heartthrob Zac Efron joined the Byron Bay celebrity contingent in 2021, snapping up a block of land about an hour from the coastal city.</p>
<p>Efron, who starred in<i> High School Musical</i> and most recently <i>Down to Earth with Zac Efron</i> on Netflix, bought land in Glengarrie area of the Tweed Valley for $2 million.</p>
<p>Set on almost 130 hectares, the land offers a private retreat with rainforest, creeks, waterfalls and bushwalking trails.</p>
<p>Efron was also a property seller in 2021, receiving $A7.4 million ($US5.3 million) for the sale of a home in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>He had initially been asking for $8.2 million ($US5.9 million) for the two-storey home with four bedrooms. While the price fell, it was still well above the $4 million Efron had paid for the property in 2013.</p>

<div>Former Google CEO spends $90 million on vacant block</div>
<p>It would appear that when it comes to multimillion-dollar property, tech billionaires have similar tastes.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt, Google’s former CEO from 2001 to 2011, has just spent $90.5 million on a whopping parcel of Beverly Hills real estate owned by the late Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Known as Enchanted Hill, the sprawling property is widely regarded as one of the crown jewels of Beverly Hills real estate, with the 485,623-square-metre block boasting sweeping views out to the North Pacific Ocean and the Los Angeles basin.</p>
<p>The lofty figure will undoubtedly go down as one of the biggest real estate deals of this year, especially considering the 120-acre block is just land; there’s not a single mansion in sight.</p>
<p>That said, it’s still considered by many in the LA property scene to be somewhat of a bargain, considering Enchanted Hill originally had an asking price of $209 million when it first hit the market in 2018.</p>
<p>Not that Schmidt really needed the $100-million-plus saving — even though he retired from the Alphabet Group in 2020, he still has a net worth estimated to be around the $32 billion mark.</p>
<p>According to Mansion Global, Allen, who listed the winsome wedge of blue-chip real estate months before his passing back in 2018, had planned to build an estate on the vast block.</p>
<p>The Microsoft co-founder purchased Enchanted Hill back in the late ’90s for roughly $30 million.</p>
<p>At that time, the block had an equally large 20-room mansion on site, designed by Californian architectural doyen Wallace Neff.</p>
<p>Allen bulldozed the stately home to make way for his own slice of paradise, but sadly, he succumbed to a decades-old bout of lymphoma before that dream could be realised.</p>
<p>It’s not known what Schmidt will do with the elevated expanse of Beverly Hills real estate. However, the bona fide billionaire will most likely create a compound of his own.</p>
<p>And, while it’s all being built, Schmidt and wife Wendy could live in one of the other LA homes they’ve recently purchased.</p>

<div>The town where almost every home makes a profit, but not everyone wins</div>
<p>It’s not quite a sure thing, but it’s close: Bendigo home sellers are more likely to make a profit than anywhere else in the nation, new figures show.</p>
<p>Of the homes that changed hands during the September quarter in the regional Victorian city, 99.8 per cent traded for a paper gain, CoreLogic research found.</p>
<p>Bendigo’s market has jumped amid demand from a wave of tree-changers in the pandemic, as well as ultra-low interest rates and government grants that sparked demand from local buyers.</p>
<p>Home values rose 21.3 per cent during 2021, to a median $577,352, on CoreLogic data.</p>
<p>The growth has been welcome to sellers, who are then able to upgrade nearby, but also made it more challenging for some locals to save a deposit as the market runs away from them.</p>
<p>“There’s been this unbelievable change with land values which has snowballed to established properties,” PH Property director Brad Hinton said. “Most people [selling] have been pleasantly surprised at their results.”</p>
<p>First-home buyers bought up affordable blocks of land and took advantage of the $25,000 federal HomeBuilder grant and the $20,000 state First Home Owner Grant for regional properties, he said.</p>
<p>Combined with demand from tree-changers cashing in on the sale of their higher-priced Melbourne homes, and interest from investors, the market boomed.</p>
<p>Local buyers were having “a little bit of argy bargy” with out-of-area buyers, he added.</p>
<p>“There is an element of people getting out of Melbourne and coming back to their grassroots, or wanting a lifestyle change.”</p>
<p>The growth is welcomed by Bendigo Mayor Andrea Metcalf, who is pleased to see skilled workers arriving in the area, while trying to plan for a population that could nearly double in the next three decades.</p>
<p>But tree-changing Melburnians have a different idea of what is an affordable property compared to locals, she said.</p>
<p>She welcomed funds set aside by the state government to improve social housing in Bendigo, but said there was a broader need for more supply at lower price points.</p>
<p>There are opportunities for local developers to include some affordable housing in their projects, she said, or for owners of family homes to subdivide their blocks and build a villa unit with a garden that might suit downsizing retirees.</p>
<p>Over the longer term, she is looking for opportunities to clean up former mining sites and turn them into residential land, in partnership with state government.</p>
<p>For now, given the limited homes for sale, listings have been selling fast.</p>
<p>McKean McGregor principal Glenn Rea said pre-pandemic, properties could regularly take 120 days to sell, especially at the higher end of the Bendigo market.</p>
<p>“You put that property, now, in the mix, you’re having 30 or 40 inspections [and] eight to 10 offers,” he said.</p>
<p>The inspections had dropped off a little over the Christmas break, he added.</p>
<p>“You think about someone who’s grown up and lived in Bendigo and seen this sharp rise, it just seems too dear,” he said. “To the tree-changer and someone coming from metro [areas], it still seems exceptional value.”</p>
<p>First National Real Estate Tweed Sutherland principal Craig Tweed said values had risen “dramatically” over the past year and there was a lack of listings for sale.</p>
<p>Now, buyers looking for a modern home on a 600-square-metre block could expect to pay about $700,000 to $750,000 he said, although entry-level homes began at $450,000.</p>
<p>“We’re still affordable [compared to Melbourne],” he noted. “We’re an affordable market and we’ve been that way for a long time.”</p>

<div>Australia’s most searched property locations in 2021</div>
<p>It was a blockbuster year for bricks and mortar, as low stock levels and even lower interest rates fuelled a buying boom that saw the national median house price reach a record $994,579.</p>
<p>Almost every corner of the country shared in the property market’s success due to the emergence of buyer trends brought about by the pandemic, including tree changers and sea changers searching for serenity and space.</p>
<p>But a deep dive into Domain search data shows that while such trends did emerge, a more traditional approach to real estate was still at the top of buyers’ minds.</p>
<p>In fact, the most searched regions on Domain in almost every state and territory were inner-city enclaves, partly because populous areas remain desirable, according to Domain’s chief of research and economics Nicola Powell.</p>
<p>Despite all the hype around moving to small towns along the coast, the number one searched area in the state was Sydney’s eastern suburbs, where properties offer the best of both worlds by being close to the city and surf.</p>
<p>Dr Powell said while there was a marked city exodus in 2021, the majority of the population remained in the city for a range of reasons.</p>
<p>“We’ve got some beautiful areas within our cities, we have seen the increase in popularity of living regional and relocating, but clearly our cities are at the forefront of our minds when it comes to searches.”</p>
<p>The median house price in the eastern suburbs rose 27.4 per cent to $3.6 million in the year to September, on Domain data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the region’s median unit price rose 20 per cent to $1.26 million in the same period.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in NSW on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs</li><li>Sydney’s Inner West</li><li>Newcastle Region</li></ol>
<p>In Victoria, Melbourne’s north took out the most searched region - an area that is home to big homes on big blocks of land, a key factor in driving its desirability among buyers, according to Ray White’s chief economist Nerida Conisbee.</p>
<p>“The north is very popular. The north-east has a lot of big blocks and a lot of space and that perhaps reflects that, but it is also a bit more affordable than the eastern and south-eastern suburbs,” Ms Conisbee said.</p>
<p>“It might be reflecting better affordability but also that continued desire to have more space as has evolved through COVID.”</p>
<p>The median house price in Melbourne’s north-east region rose 16.3 per cent to $820,000 in the year to September 2021, on Domain data.</p>
<p>The median house price in Melbourne’s north-west region rose 6.6 per cent in comparison to $685,000 over the same period.</p>
<p>When it came to units, the median price in the city’s north-west rose 18.1 per cent to $570,000, while it rose just 0.2 per cent in the city’s north-east, to $531,250.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in Victoria on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Melbourne’s North</li><li>Melbourne’s Bayside</li><li>Melbourne’s Inner City</li></ol>
<p>It was followed by the regions of the inner south (another premium area) and Belconnen, the affordable heartland of the ACT, according to Dr Powell.</p>
<p>“You’ve got the upper end driving it, the inner north and inner south are premium areas with the largest land sizes,” she said. “Belconnen is the affordable heartland of the ACT.”</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in ACT on Domain were:</p>
<ul><li>Canberra’s Inner North</li><li>Canberra’s Inner South</li><li>Belconnen</li></ul>
<p>Buyers chasing affordability have helped Launceston take out the most searched region in Tasmania, overtaking the capital, which notched a new median house price record as well.</p>
<p>Hobart’s median house price rose 31.9 per cent to $698,212 in the year to September 2021, on Domain data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the median house price in the Launceston and North East region rose 32.4 per cent to $480,000 in the same period. And the region’s unit prices rose 27.1 per cent to $371,000.</p>
<p>“Launceston is much more affordable than Hobart … what that is reflecting is people searching elsewhere around Tasmania and Launceston being the second biggest city, it becomes the most obvious area [to search],” Ms Conisbee said.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in Tasmania on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Launceston</li><li>Hobart</li><li>Eastern Shore</li></ol>
<p>The Gold Coast took out the top spot in Queensland where buyers were searching for properties in the state this year, with roughly a quarter of inquiries coming from Sydney, Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>“That speaks to the interstate movers to those lifestyle locations. We cannot disregard the fact that we have seen an exodus in our two major cities, that was happening anyway and it was accelerated by the pandemic,” she said.</p>
<p>Gold Coast’s median house price rose 18.8 per cent to $820,000 in the year to September 2021.</p>
<p>The region’s median unit prices rose 14.1 per cent to $535,000 in the same period.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in Queensland on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Gold Coast</li><li>Brisbane’s City North</li><li>Sunshine Coast</li></ol>
<h3><b/><b>Western Australia</b></h3>
<p>The southern suburbs region of Perth topped the list in Western Australia, with buyers looking at properties anywhere from Fremantle down to Rockingham.</p>
<p>Perth’s South East median house price rose 3.7 per cent to $475,000, while the same area’s unit median slid 1.1 per cent down to $350,000 in the year to September 2021.</p>
<p>Perth’s South West median house price rose 1.1 per cent to $490,000, while the unit median slipped by 2.4 per cent to $400,000.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in Western Australia on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Perth’s Southern Suburbs</li><li>Perth’s Northern Suburbs</li><li>Perth’s Western Suburbs</li></ol>
<p>Buyers searched for properties in the north and north-east suburbs of Adelaide the most in the past year, with the area offering large homes on big blocks of land, a similar buyer trend seen in other states and territories.</p>
<p>The median house price in Adelaide’s north region rose 14.7 per cent to $438,000 in the year to September 2021, on Domain data.</p>
<p>The median unit price in the same region rose 7.4 per cent to $276,506 in the same period.</p>
<p>The top three most searched regions in South Australia on Domain were:</p>
<ol><li>Adelaide’s North North East Suburbs</li><li>Adelaide’s Western Beachside Suburbs</li><li>Adelaide’s Eastern Suburbs</li></ol>
<h3><b>Northern Territory</b></h3>
<p>Buyers were mostly drawn to the capital city as it remains the main jobs hub.</p>
<p>Darwin’s median house prices rose 28.9 per cent to $580,000 in the past year.</p>
<p>The region’s unit prices rose 24.2 per cent to $369,500 in the same period.</p>

<div>From truck driver to high-flying ‘fraudster’: The incredible tale of Bill Papas’ money maze</div>
<div><ul><li><a>White collar crime</a></li></ul></div>
<p>This was published 4 months ago</p>
<h1>From truck driver to high-flying ‘fraudster’: The incredible tale of Bill Papas’ money maze</h1>
<div><div><p>By Sarah Danckert and Charlotte Grieve</p><time>August 28, 2021</time></div></div>
<p>The manager from the country’s biggest pub landlord Australian Liquor and Hospitality was shocked.</p>
<p>Trevor Smith, ALH’s national food manager, had just taken a call from the group’s bankers at Westpac asking strange questions about loans ALH had with the bank to lease equipment from Sydney finance house Forum Finance.</p>
<p>This was all news to Smith. ALH used some equipment — organic waste digesters – from a Forum subsidiary, but ALH didn’t have a loan from Westpac to pay for it, and they didn’t have any leasing agreements in place.</p>
<p>He quickly asked to see the loan documents and the contracts.</p>
<p>Smith didn’t realise it at the time, but he had just stumbled across what is alleged to be one of the biggest bank frauds in Australian history by Forum Finance and its founder director, the volatile and charming Bill Papas.</p>
<p>A familiar pattern emerged as Westpac got word back from other customers, Coles, Woolworths, Veolia, Catholic Care and Scentre and Westrac which all had similar stories - the signatures on the documents were forged.</p>
<p>Australia’s oldest bank quickly suspected it was the victim of one of the country’s most elaborate bank heists.</p>
<a>where he remains with his girlfriend</a>.
<p>A cache of emails between the bank and its customers reveals the full-court press inside the bank as it contacted its customers to check the validity of the Forum contracts only to be told time and time again the contracts were fake.</p>
<h3>From truck driving to high-flying</h3>
<p>“He would talk about it, the fact he was driving wearing singlets a few months ago and he’s in business now, how his life had changed,” says one former associate.</p>
<p>Papas got his first break working with Sydney-based copier and printing outfit Camnet in the early late-1990s.</p>
<p>Camnet’s director Peter Petrovic remembers hiring and training Papas - a natural-born salesman, he excelled quickly to be promoted manager within only a couple of years.</p>
<p>Papas eventually left Camnet in the early 2000s and went on to work at another office leasing company, Upstream, where he enjoyed the work-hard, play-hard culture and further honed his sales craft and understanding of the world of leasing finance.</p>
<p>In 2011, Papas left Upstream to set up his own printer leasing company, Forum Group.</p>
<p>Like Upstream, Forum had a boisterous office culture. The group’s salesmen spent big on entertaining clients, wining and dining them on boats and helicopters.</p>
<p>Forum quickly moved from supplying printing equipment to a range of other business and supplies, including transport, solar solutions, high-tech bespoke technology solutions and waste management equipment through its fast growing Iugis business.</p>
<p>By 2016, Forum was a relatively large player in the equipment leasing business. It had a variety of businesses that all provided structured equipment financing deals to big businesses looking to lease office and other equipment.</p>
<p>Big banks like Westpac were central to Forum’s business model. Forum would supply equipment to Westpac customers. That equipment would be funded by leases that were paid for by loans from Westpac.</p>
<h3>Eyes on the ASX... or London’s AIM</h3>
<p>Another entity key to Papas’ listing plans was Autonomous Energy.</p>
<p>“He had this mini bank of $500 million and that’s how he could finance things in a more flexible way than anyone else could,” says one senior source who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>“That was a little bit compelling. Obviously, it was predominantly bullshit, but maybe he really thought he could do it.”</p>
<a>raced Audis</a> with his good friend Eric Constantinidis, a close relative of Paul Keating’s former piggery partner Achilles ‘Al’ Constantinidis.
<p>While Papas was taking a break in the summer of 2019-20, a senior consultant was tasked with finding a way to improve the group’s finance processes. The first step was to conduct an audit.</p>

<p>But when Papas returned from his holiday, he swiftly shut the entire project down. “That’s when Bill tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘it’s been good to know you’,” the person said.</p>
<p>At the time the consultant thought nothing of it. He noticed there was sensitivity around the group’s finances, but didn’t suspect it would be hit with fraud allegations just over one year later.</p>
<h3>The email chains detecting the alleged fraud</h3>
<p>The bank made those allegations after an intense investigation that involved several staff reaching out to clients to test the validity of contracts Forum had filed with the bank.</p>
<p>But Croome, the chief executive of Westrac, had never signed the documents.</p>
<p>Ryan Stokes, CEO of Seven Group Holdings which owns Westrac, told The Age and Herald this week that it was an unfortunate situation, but made it clear Seven would stick by its bankers.</p>
<p>“Westpac is a key banking partner of ours and our transaction bank and a longtime supporter of our group. They were quick to acknowledge this was not a Westrac issue.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very complex and unfortunate situation. Westpac have been great with us in that process and we work very closely to help support them through that with whatever they will require.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for ALH’s owner Endeavour Group said the group was aware of legal proceedings between Westpac and Forum and were assisting the bank in its inquiries, but emphasised that neither ALH or Endeavour Group were party to the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Piecing together the money trail</h3>
<p>As revealed by this masthead in July, a report prepared for the bank on Papas’ assets shows a huge amount of that money was spent on a range of personal and business items.</p>
<p>This included tens of thousands of private school fees, luxury car purchases, payments for yachts and other watercraft as well as first class international travel.</p>
<p>The splurge also included a host of overseas investments including <a>two seaside apartments in Thessaloniki</a> in Greece and investment of $15 million in Greek soccer club Xanthi FC.</p>
<p>Westpac and the other lenders’ case against Papas continues. Papas’ lawyers last month said he does not have enough money to return to Australia to attend court.</p>
<p>So far, the major bank and its advisers have only found about $100 million in assets and cash allegedly taken from Forum. The other $300 million is still missing.</p>

<div>Gavel-lanche: The year Sydney’s auction market went crazy</div>
<p>‘Staggering’. ‘FOMO’. ‘Extreme’: Observers and experts reached for the superlatives to describe the gavel-lanche of auction action across Sydney during the year.</p>
<p>Sydney’s auction market soared to new heights, with a shortage of homes going under the hammer and strong competition among buyers fuelling a bumper year of results - the likes of which had never been seen by many in the industry.</p>
<p>Amid all the health concerns and lockdown uncertainty of 2021, there has been one constant: the stand-out prices people have been prepared to pay for in demand homes.</p>
<p>The year started strongly with buyers out in force at auctions, after a turbulent 2020, and auction clearance rates in February and March hitting their highest monthly level since 2015, with eight weeks in a row of 80 per cent plus.</p>
<p>It was a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>A six-bedroom house in Woollahra sold for $6 million, and a whopping $1.5 million above reserve in March, while a Bondi Beach penthouse sold for $20.1 million - becoming the most expensive apartment ever sold in Australia.</p>
<p>“The beginning of this year was something we have never seen before in terms of demand and in terms of clearance rates,” said Nicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain.</p>
<p>Big results were still being achieved, with a three-bedroom waterfront unit in Elizabeth bay selling for $8.5 million, $2.5 million above its advertised price guide in May.</p>
<p>A Longueville house with water views and a dilapidated Strathfield house that had been occupied by squatters both topped their reserve price by more than $1 million the following month - on the last weekend before Sydney entered lockdown.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, 43 house hunters tuned in for the auction of an original-condition house in Grays Point, that sold for $1.9 million - almost $500,000 above reserve.</p>
<p>AuctionWorks chief auctioneer and director Jesse Davidson said the group had seen an average of 10.3 registered bidders at auctions in August when competition hit “dizzying heights”.</p>
<p>“There was pretty much one reason underpinning it; a complete lack of stock. Prices were growing at the rate of knots and buyers had FOMO [fear of missing out],” he said.</p>
<p>There was also an element of buyer fatigue, he said, with house hunters putting their property search on hold as the end of the year approached.</p>
<p>Those that did turn out to auctions increasingly started the bidding well below price guides, or waited for a vendor bid to open the auction, and a growing number of properties failed to meet seller expectations.</p>
<p>It’s been a “staggering change” from mid-year, Mr Davidson said, but noted the market was now moving at a more sustainable pace and that a clearance rate anywhere between 65 and 75 per cent, reflective of a buoyant market.</p>
<p>Mr Davidson’s team was booked solid in December, and he flagged high volumes looked set to continue into the new year - with the Sydney market likely to see its biggest start to the year in a long time.</p>
<p>“[However] it’s different now to three to six months ago, buyers are cautious and sellers are looking for prices well above what those buyers are prepared to pay,” Mr Pattaro said.</p>
<p>“It’s a more balanced market … sellers are still going to get good prices, competition is still there but buyers won’t be stupid about [what they are willing to spend],” he said.</p>
<p>Vendors who fail to sell their homes over the break would face increased competition in the new year as more homes come onto the market, and may need to lower their prices to sell, he warned.</p>
<div>Why this year’s Sydney property market is one for the record books</div>
<p>Space: the final frontier. Or, for those playing in the Sydney property market over the past year, the financial frontier. The biggest trend in pandemic-plagued 2021 has turned out to be the demand for more room in, and around, our homes.</p>
<p>“It’s really been the year when we re-imagined the space in our houses and apartments,” says Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell.</p>
<p>“We wanted to have areas in our homes where we could work and, spending so much time indoors during lockdowns, we wanted more living space where we weren’t all on top of each other.</p>
