<header> <h1> Help! I want to steal my 13-year-old daughter’s style – but she stole mine first </h1> <p> What happens when a 40-something is as enamoured by the Y2K revival as her teenage daughter </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alexandra Zagalsky <time> 28 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Shopping with my 13-year-old daughter is proving to be tricky. It's nothing to do with her: turns out I'm the pest because she's had enough of me 'hijacking' what she sees as her fashion style. </p>
<p>Noughties nostalgia is to blame, currently celebrated in the collections of retailers far and wide from niche labels such as Fiorucci and Blumarine, to online giants such as Boohoo, <a>Asos</a> and <a>Farfetch</a>.</p>
<p>Mother and daughter shopping is therefore one big throwback to the fun and frivolous days of my early twenties when clothes (my clothes!) riffed off a myriad of influences allowing trends to flourish in a wildly disruptive and discursive manner.</p>
<p>The early aughts were a time of fervent experimentation in fashion inspired by modern technology, which was flourishing at an unprecedented and feverish pace, inspiring all sorts of sartorial mash-ups. </p>
<a>Carly Aquilino</a> in her hilarious TikTok video, which became a viral sensation earlier this year and shows her mocking some of the more questionable outfits of noughties fashion including indiscriminate layering and "comedy wide belts".
<p>The fashion re-sale site <a>Depop</a> is currently seeing a huge spike in demand for vintage cargo pants and combat trousers, with a 70% increase in searches over the last six months.</p>
<p>I also recently indulged in a Fiorucci mini pink handbag complete with retro angels, which takes me right back to my clubbing days, when the only girl I wanted to be was Chloe Sevigny. I sort of still do.</p>
<p>"What if people think you've never actually come out of this style? It may look like you've been stuck in the year 2000 for twenty years," opined a close friend of mine. </p>
<a>Peachy Den</a>, a nascent Peckham-based label with heavy leanings towards my favourite fashion decade. "Millennial fashion is mischievous and playful and that's what we stand for," says brand founder Isabella Weatherby.
<p>"We are impacted by the sultry grunge mood of Y2k fashion like baggy trousers and tight tops. These silhouettes are all about frivolity and not taking yourself too seriously," she adds, which sounds like the perfect antidote to the pandemic era.</p>
<p>Melika Imoru, Head of Womenswear Design at ASOS, suggests that the current noughties flashback is going from strength to strength, too: “Social media, celebrity style and music have all played a part in the resurgence of YK2 styles. </p>
<a>Disrobed,</a> dissecting the influence of fashion on a wide range of social and geo-political issues, is, it turns out, also a massive noughties fashion fan too. Suffice to say, when she recommends a brand, I listen.
<a>Sex in the City</a>. I clearly had to have something, so I'm now the proud owner of a shiny black satin LBD from circa 2003.
<p>Depop's press team offered an interesting take on the question of Y2K fashion 'ownership', which makes sense of this stylistic regeneration. "It's an aesthetic that our core Gen Z community have been authentically adopting as their own. </p>
<p>Even if they were too young the first time around, it’s likely to have been their very first interactions with fashion, style or culture, personally or through older people around them,” they say.</p>
<p>Top UK sellers who are leading this aesthetic are Isabella Vrana and Susamusa. Bella Hadid is a big fan of Susamusa’s pieces, regularly pictured wearing her deadstock and vintage pieces from the 00s."</p>

<p>Styling is key, however, when it comes to the Cuban shirt. On first glance, it's zany appearance might feel like too much, but there's an easy style formula that means even the wackiest prints are made wearable.</p>

<header> <h1> The grown-up guide to wearing ‘cheugy’ slogan T-shirts </h1> <p> Gen-Z might have spoken, but we won’t be giving up our slogan tees any time soon </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Krissy Turner, Shopping editor <time> 31 May 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The cheugy fashion list features many an inoffensive but ‘mainstream and generic’ item. Thanks to its suits-all appeal, the humble slogan T-shirt has made the hit list. </p>
<a>which is why we’re opposed to giving it up</a> despite its new cheugy connotations. 
<p>If you’re still keen on sporting yours, there are however a few sartorial guidelines to note so that yours looks less cheugy and more chic:</p>
<h4>Do… always consider the slogan</h4>
<h4>Do… think about the rest of your outfit</h4>
<p>Serial slogan top-wearer Victoria Beckham always serves as a great example: she's previously paired hers with dark sunglasses, wide leg trousers and heels, leaving her top to be the focus of her ensemble. </p>
<h4>Do… go for a slick option</h4>
<p>Even when sporting it off-duty with a pair of jeans, considering the style of your slogan top is a must. Pastel shades, cartoon prints and flamboyant fonts are less slick, whereas a simple bold font in a plain colour is easily made chic. </p>
<h3>Four of the best slogan t-shirts to buy and wear now</h3>
<p>Solidaritè Feminine T-shirt, £95, <a>Bella Freud</a>; Slogan top, £6.99, <a>Zara</a>; Blue stripe T-shirt, £75, <a>Chinti Parker</a>; Sporty Rich T-shirt, £65, <a>Flannels </a></p>

<div> <div> By Krissy Turner, Shopping Editor <time> 28 July 2021 • 12:57pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Even as fashion editors, we’re not keen on throwing the term ‘style icon’ around. But anyone you ask will agree that Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis deserves the title.</p>
<p>The late first lady would have celebrated her 92nd birthday today, and is arguably this summer’s style muse. Here are the five trends that prove it. </p>
<div> <div> <p>Foundation flats, £157, Essen The Label; Tailored trousers, £210, <a>Asceno</a>; Laser cut shirt, £55, <a> Other Stories</a>; Sunglasses, £158,<a> Viu </a></p> <h4>The pearl necklace</h4> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Baroque necklace, £259, <a>Missoma</a>; Chain necklace, £22, <a>Estella Bartlett</a>; Tessoro necklace, £105, <a>Maria Black</a></p> <h4>The tailored trousers</h4> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Camel trousers, £59.95, <a>Massimo Dutti</a>; Beige trousers, £150, <a>Reiss</a> </p> <h4>The skirt suit</h4> </div> </div>
<p>Kennedy’s iconic red Christian Dior skirt suit gave us a look that’s just as feminine as a printed flowy midi dress, but has that power dressing edge that her personal style came to be synonymous with. </p>
<p>She made the elegant boucle two-piece her own in the 1960s - so much so that as we spot tweed suiting among the high street’s new-in collections, it’s hard not to be reminded of the former First Lady’s penchant for them. </p>
<p>Kennedy favoured a statement red or pink tweed, not entirely dissimilar to the offerings at LK Bennett, Maje and Sandro this summer. </p>
<div> <div> <p>Tweed jacket, £130<a>, LK Bennett</a>; Skirt, £60, <a>LK Bennett</a>; Jacket, £469, <a>Sandro</a>; Skirt, £219, <a>Sandro</a></p> <h4>The white jeans </h4> </div> </div>
<p>Barrel jeans, £95, <a>Whistles</a>; Cropped jeans, £59, <a>Arket</a></p>

<header> <h1> The 11 most stylish British labels to watch right now - and what to buy from them </h1> <p> London Fashion Week kicks off today so we’re celebrating fabulous British brands </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Krissy Turner, Shopping Editor <time> 17 September 2021 • 2:58pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>From the It knit, to modern gold hoop earrings, here are the brands to watch and the pieces you can shop… </p>
<p>What to buy now: One of the brand's latest designs - the Cassiopeia - combines cork and vegan leather for a tote unlike anything you've seen before. Cassiopeia bag, £432, <a>Mashu</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: The standout jacket is the yellow mac with a chic tan collar. Jackie jacket, £279, <a>Alexa Chung x Barbour</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: This sweet wrap cardi works on its own now, and under a blazer come winter. Ballet wrap cardigan, £209, <a>Crush </a> </p>
<p>What to buy now: These high-waisted flares are easier to wear than you might think. Pair with a denim shirt and tan ballet flats. Flared trousers, £138, <a>Reiss </a></p>
<p>What to buy now: Nothing will keep you as chic and cosy on the sofa like its Gaia robe. The Gaia robe, £195, <a>Kai Collective</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: A ‘curtain reveal’ is the way to wear your cardi this season, and this fine style is ideal. Cardigan, £195, C<a>hinti Parker</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: A colour-block bag is a must against a neutral coat in the cold months. Amelia bag with chain strap, from £175, <a>Florian London</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: You’d be hard pressed to choose between its comfy towelling or 70s-esque prints, but this quirky checkered print is fun and unique. Milly top, £75, and Dolly bottoms, £60, <a>Tona</a></p>
<a> final collaboration with the ever-stylish Jessie Bush</a>, which we predict will be a sellout, so it’s worth checking that out, too. 
<p>What to buy now: The Lorna pink striped knit, which offers a colourful twist on this autumn’s It jumper, which <a>we’ve already been waxing lyrical about</a>. Lorna knit, £95, <a>Kitri</a></p>
<p>Why it’s great: The family-run jewellery label Otiumberg always has a slick new collection up its sleeve, and combined with its impressive sustainable credentials, it's the perfect British jewellery label to invest in this season. </p>
<p>What to buy now: Its gold earrings are as timeless as they are modern, and these twisty hoops are the brand's latest design. Ribbon hoops, £190, <a>Otiumberg</a></p>
<p>What to buy now: Its signature seamless swimsuit. Sylvia swimsuit, £120, <a>Half Baked</a> </p>

<p>But will Gucci-mania manage to outdo the general Black Friday-mania at supermarkets on Friday morning? Quite possibly.</p>
<p>These days any Gucci thing is a most-wanted thing. Gucci logo socks sell for £145 per pair, belts for £300 - there is something for just about everyone. </p>
<p>It’s a <a>dark, dramatic story,</a> yet to put the brand’s name in lights via Gaga (wearing Gucci on the red carpet), Adam Driver and the rest of the A-list cast, only seems to have made us want it all the more.</p>
<p>If you’re already sitting on vintage Gucci items at home, the message from Vestiaire Collective is this; sell now, and cash in. Listings of Gucci items are also up 80 percent on last year.</p>
<p>And if you don’t yet own a vintage piece? Head to Asda, of all places, to find what might just prove to be a golden ticket.</p>

<p>That dress is retired (too many red-wine stains – I like to think Carrie would be proud). But what’s proven far more durable than a few wisps of blush-toned silk are the echoes of a TV show whose last new episode aired in 2004.</p>
<p>Maybe they will. Maybe they won’t. Maybe it doesn’t matter – we’ll always have the original. Here are seven ways Carrie and the show shaped our fashion that endure today.</p>
<h2>The one piece that can turn a formal skirt into daywear</h2>
<p>It’s simple: a T-shirt or vest top. Whether Carrie wears a distressed J’Adore Dior tee or a white men’s vest top with her A-line skirts, they always succeed in adding just enough low to the high to come out in an ideal middle.</p>
<h2>Print-clashing makes any outfit more interesting</h2>
<h2>Fur coats go with everything</h2>
<h2>The decorative potential of lingerie</h2>
<h2>Sometimes shoes are as good as therapy. Or almost as good.</h2>
<h2>Overdressing will get you everywhere</h2>
<h2>It’s ok to make fashion mistakes</h2>

<h1> I witnessed the real-life drama behind the House of Gucci film </h1>
<p> From family feuds to questionable business moves then a dizzying ascent, Gucci's '90s story was all drama – and I was there to see it all </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Lisa Armstrong <div>Head of fashion</div> <time> 24 November 2021 • 5:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>clever, witty, ridiculously handsome</a>.
<a>she orchestrated the murder of her ex and wound up spending 18 years in prison</a>.
<p>La famiglia Gucci is by all accounts, none too happy either, albeit not for artistic reasons. They’re allegedly “considering their next steps”. Ominous words in Gucci land. This opera has legs.</p>
<p>The House of Gucci is out on Friday</p>
<header> <h1> Gardening in July 2021: what to plant and tidy in your garden this month </h1> <p> From potting herbs to pruning roses, these easy jobs will keep you busy in the garden this month </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lia Leendertz <time> 28 July 2021 • 1:24pm </time> </div> </div>
<h3>Things to do in your garden in July</h3>
<p>Compost in hanging baskets quickly runs out of nutrients in summer, so now is the time to start giving your bedding plants a liquid feed once a week for continuing blooms. An all-over trim will get them back in shape if they’ve become leggy.</p>
<p>Common summer lawn problems: lawns that turn brown in dry weather haven’t died, they will green up as soon as rains come; flooded lawns can be damaged by being walked on, just keep off until the water drains.</p>
<p>Butterflies should be plentiful now, but if you are not seeing many in your garden try planting buddleias, valerian, liatris, hyssop and solidago in sunny, sheltered spots. For more ideas, the <a>RHS </a>has a good list.</p>
<p>Prune espaliered and other trained apple and pear trees now to take them back to the original framework, shortening side shoots to three or four leaves, and those that have been previously shortened to one.</p>
<p>I am always over-optimistic about how long summer will last, and have to force myself to “stop” my tomatoes after four or five trusses of fruit have set. Stop yours now: no more fruit will ripen fully, and summer will come to an end.</p>
<h4>Eye for an autumn bulb</h4>
<p>Ghostly autumn-flowering crocuses spring directly from bare earth at a time when everything is woody, and are all the lovelier for it. Plant creamy white Crocus ochroleucus around the base of trees now, from <a>Pottertons Nursery</a>.</p>
<a>Corseside Nursery</a> in Pembrokeshire offers a selection. 
<h4>Follow the scent </h4>
<p>If you long for a garden filled with scent, you can find inspiration in the Perfume Garden in the <a>Eden Project’s </a>Mediterranean biome. It is filled with roses, lilies, parma violets, jasmine, lavender, eucalyptus and more. </p>
<h4>Perfect potatoes </h4>
<p>Second-cropping potatoes will produce new potatoes in autumn and winter if planted now. Plant in sacks or buckets and move into a greenhouse in blight-ridden August and when frosts hit (<a>Thompson Morgan</a>). </p>
<p>Brussels sprouts and sprouting broccoli should go in this month. Everything is out to get them, so be paranoid or don’t grow them at all. Cover in close netting to keep out caterpillars and pigeons: at least 1m high and ideally 1.5m.</p>
<p><a>Plant Heritage</a> has launched a hunt for the nation’s lost plants, those once common and now feared lost from cultivation. On the list are Cedric Morris irises, four varieties of the Scottish Mylnefield lily, and more. </p>
<p>Auriculas look pretty shoddy now. This is as it should be: they don’t like summer. Place them in an airy, shady spot and let them sit it out. Give the smallest dribble of water morning or evening. They will come back to life in autumn.</p>
<p>Once strawberries are over, weed, clear straw and cut off old and tired foliage, then give the whole bed a mulch with something nutritious. Lift rooted runners and transplant them to new beds or pots to make new plants.</p>
<p>If you need to prune a stone fruit such as a cherry or a plum, this is the moment. They should never be pruned in winter as dormant cut surfaces let in silver leaf spores. Prune out branches crossing the middle of the tree to improve airflow.</p>
<p>Helwingia chinensis is an unusual Himalayan shrub for shade, with bunches of creamy flowers now. From <a>Hedgehog Plants</a>. </p>
<p>Saffron crocus is surprisingly easy to grow. Plant them for autumn flowers and harvest for those precious stamens (they sometimes take a year to settle in before flowering). Buy from <a>Suttons </a>and plant into a sunny and well-drained spot.</p>
<p>For an easy and peppery winter salad leaf, sow land cress now. It is like watercress but without the need to grow in water, funnily enough. Sow direct into pots or into the ground. Find seeds at <a>Organic Catalogue</a>.</p>
<p>Clematis struggle against slugs in my garden. As an insurance policy, now is the time to take cuttings to make more plants. Take several cuttings, each just above and below a leaf joint, push into a pot and keep watered.</p>
<p>There is still time for a late sowing of beetroot, carrots, lettuce and radishes, straight into the warm ground, for autumn crops. This is hatching time for the second generation of carrot flies, so new rows of carrots need to be covered.</p>
<p>Autumn-flowering nerines are often known as Guernsey lilies because the bulbs grow so well on that island. Plant your own bed now if you have a well-drained spot in full sun. 'Isabel’ is a deep pink cultivar from <a>Thompson Morgan</a>.</p>
<p>Give your wisteria some care for beautiful blooms next spring. Cut back long summer growths so that each holds just six leaves, then give the plant a good dose of water and a feed with a potash-rich fertiliser.</p>
<a>Harrod Horticultural</a>), which can be slipped neatly over the branches.
<p>Tie in all of your climbers’ long, soft new growths horizontally or lower. This slows down the sap flow and encourages the plant to put on more flowering growth. You will be rewarded with more flowers next year, if not before.</p>
<p>If your summer gardening involves continually battling with weeds, you may need more ground cover. Lamb's ears (Stachys byzantina), evergreen euonymus and Alchemilla mollis all do the job beautifully in my own garden.</p>
<p>Harvest French beans, courgettes, radishes, carrots, mangetout and potatoes when they are little and tender. They are far better than they will be when they reach “shop size” and this is the tastiest way to keep ahead of the glut.</p>
<p>As foxgloves, snapdragons, lupins and penstemons go over, cut back just those sections of the flower spike that have faded, taking care to leave any secondary laterals that may be growing. You may get a second flush of flowers.</p>
<p>I’ve kept my lilies in my greenhouse all spring and summer to keep them away from the lily beetles. Now it is time to move them outside, but I’ll be keeping up near daily inspections for larvae, and squashing them on sight.</p>
<p>This is a good moment to start a trough full of baby winter salad leaves. I’ve filled mine with peat-free <a>Dalefoot Wool Compost</a> for Vegetables and Salads, which is moisture retentive and specially formulated for edibles.</p>
<h4>Thin fruit trees for a plumper crop</h4>
<p>Sweet Williams make brilliant spring flowers, and need sowing in the next month. 'Nigricans’ is near black, which adds drama when grown among bright tulips. Buy the Biennial Seeds Collection from <a>Higgledy Garden</a>.</p>
