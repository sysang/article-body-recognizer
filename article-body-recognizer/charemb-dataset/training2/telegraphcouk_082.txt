<header> <h1> A bowl of porridge a day keeps the midlife spread away: the best foods to eat in your 40s and 50s </h1> <p> A study has found a daily serving of wholegrains - as well as several other foods - can help slow middle-aged spread </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Saffron Alexander <time> 14 October 2021 • 11:19am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The US researchers believe the wholegrains found in oats, as well as brown bread and brown rice, are the key to midlife weight loss. </p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that eating wholegrain foods as part of a healthy diet delivers health benefits beyond just helping us lose or maintain weight as we age,” says Nicola McKeown, one of the study's authors.</p>
<p>“In fact, the data suggests that people who eat more wholegrains are better able to maintain their blood sugar and blood pressure over time. Managing these risk factors as we age may help to protect against heart disease.”</p>
<a>maintain waist size</a> and reduce increases in the other risk factors. The presence of dietary fibre in wholegrains can have a satiating effect, and the magnesium, potassium and antioxidants may contribute to lowering blood pressure. 
<p>“Soluble fibre in particular may have a beneficial effect on post-meal blood sugar spikes.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors also found that nuts, chicken, seafood and yoghurt are among the foods you should be eating to avoid putting on weight as you age.</p>
<p>“We should not only emphasise specific protein rich foods like fish, nuts, and yoghurt to prevent weight gain, but also focus on avoiding refined grains, starches and sugars in order to prevent weight gain.”</p>
<p>The study also looked at whether eating certain foods as part of the same meal contributed to people's weight.</p>
<p>Eating foods linked with weight gain, such as red meat, with vegetables mitigated the weight gain.</p>
<p>Although dairy products such as cheese and milk didn't contribute to weight gain or loss themselves, when they were served with foods high in starches and sugar they were linked to weight gain.</p>
<p>“If you want to lose weight, the calories consumed need to be less than the calories burnt, which comes from a combination of your base metabolic rate and any exercise.</p>
<h3>What should you eat to avoid weight gain in your 40s and 50s?</h3>
<p>Fiona Hunter’s suggestions for keeping your weight down </p>
<p>Chicken: It is high in protein and low in fat. High-protein food helps you to feel fuller for longer so you should be less tempted to snack after a protein-rich meal and should feel fuller more quickly.</p>
<p>Seafood: This is also high in protein and low in fat. Fat contains twice as many calories as protein or carbohydrate, so food that is high in fat is also high in calories.</p>

<h1> Tony Adams warns football of future gambling 'epidemic' as well as gaming addiction </h1>
<p> The former Arsenal captain and Sporting Chance founder said gambling is a far more common vice among active players than alcohol or drugs </p>
<div> <div> By Sam Dean <time> 21 October 2021 • 8:04am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Tony Adams, the former Arsenal and England captain, has warned that professional football is facing a gambling “epidemic” and predicted that gaming addiction will be one of the sport’s next major issues.</p>
<p>The charity said last year that alcohol and drug addictions have been eclipsed as the most prevalent addiction for sportspeople, with almost half of its clients now receiving support for gambling problems.</p>
<a>Bryony Gordon’s Mad World</a> podcast (which you can listen to using the audio player below): “The new generation [of footballers] can’t consume the level of alcohol that I did, and play to that level. It is just not done now.
<p>“In rugby league you have got prescription drugs that are quite prevalent. In different sports, cocaine. But if you are talking about professional footballers, definitely their drug of choice is not alcohol when they are playing.”</p>
<p><a>Telegraph Sport revealed earlier this year that the Government</a> is likely to ban betting sponsors on shirts, amid growing concerns over gambling addiction in the UK.</p>
<p>Last month, Bolton Wanderers cut all ties with betting firms after issuing a statement acknowledging that lives are being ruined by problem gambling.</p>

<header> <h1> Treat drug addiction as a chronic condition, says head of government review </h1> <p> Prof Dame Carol Black tells The Telegraph’s Mad World podcast that approach would create a ‘much more stable society’ </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Gabriella Swerling, Social Affairs Editor <time> 22 October 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Drug addiction should be treated as a "chronic condition", the head of a government review has said.</p>
<p>Prof Dame Carol Black urged medical professionals and the public to consider and treat addiction like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis in an attempt to create a "much more stable society".</p>
<p>In 2019, Prof Black was appointed to lead a two-part review into the misuse of illegal drugs in England, analysing addiction policy, research and treatment.</p>
<p>The first report, outlining the current situation, was published in September last year. The final report was published in July and makes 32 recommendations, including for increased funding and the creation of a governmental drugs unit.</p>
<p>She told the podcast that alcohol was "just as dangerous" as drugs, adding: "If you look at the number of deaths it causes and the real harm it causes, it's another drug."</p>
<a>county lines drug dealing</a>. The report described underfunded treatment services and increased drug use. It also concluded that many problems were as a result of reduced funding and local commissioning practices since 2012.

<p>“Worse, it harmed both the mothers who were given the DES and their foetuses. We learned about the horrific effects thalidomide caused much faster because we could see them.” </p>
<p>DES, which was given as pills, creams and vaginal suppositories, is classified as an endocrine disrupting chemical, one of a number of substances that interfere with the endocrine system that controls the release of hormones in the body. </p>
<p>Sons of mothers who took DES may be more likely to suffer from testicular cancer, but the results are mixed. They are also at increased risk of testicular abnormalities including undescended testicles. </p>

<p>Was this really only 12 months ago?</p>
<p>One year on, nine billion Covid doses, including AstraZeneca, have been given worldwide. Ninety percent of over-12s in Britain have had their first vaccine and more than 80 per cent have had two doses. Thirty-three million boosters have been given.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated patients are up to 60 times more likely to need intensive care treatment, according to new figures from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre. </p>
<p>While the UK’s regulator has approved a Pfizer vaccine for children aged five to 12, and a handful of other countries have begun vaccinating this age group, the JCVI has so far only recommended it is offered to vulnerable groups.</p>

<header> <h1> What your back pain is telling you about your health </h1> <p> It may be a symptom of Covid's omicron variant but there are a host of other reasons that you could be in a lot of discomfort </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sharon Walker <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>New data from the ZOE Covid Study has revealed that lower-back pain is one of the eight tell-tale symptoms of the omicron variant of coronavirus. </p>
<h2>If you have lower back pain…</h2>
<p>The advice is to keep moving and take painkillers. “Nurofen (ibuprofen) is your best choice, paracetamol is ineffective,” explains Underwood. </p>
<h2>If your weight has been creeping up….</h2>
<h2>If your pain is worse working from home…</h2>
<p>The shift to home working has been <a>bad news for backs</a>. Without daily commute, we’re moving less and our home office set up can be far from back-friendly.</p>
<p>Osteopath Boniface Verney Carron, co-founder of the preventive health platform Oona Series, says that back pain is often down to postural issues and that most of us need to adjust our screen height, especially if we are working from a laptop. </p>
<p>He also suggests creating a backrest with a rolled-up towel tucked between the chair and lower back to support the lower spine.</p>
<h2>If your pain is triggered by bending and lifting…. </h2>
<p>You might have ruptured a disc. This is when a fragment of the jelly-like centre of the vertebra pushes out through the rubbery exterior. </p>
<h2>If you have a generally achy lower back that is relieved by sitting… </h2>
<p>If you have an achy lower back that’s triggered by long periods of standing or walking and relieved by sitting, you might need to work on your core strength.</p>
<p>Tight hip flexors – the muscles which attach the pelvis to the thigh bone – can add to the problem by increasing the curvature of the lower spine and upper back, leading to lower back and hip pain. </p>
<p>“These people require a strength training approach,” says Brown. “You need to work on core strength and hip mobility.” </p>
<h2>If you’re over 55 and your back pain is triggered by walking…</h2>
<p>“This could be neurogenic claudication,” says Brown.</p>
<h2>If you have shooting pain that radiates down one or both legs…</h2>
<p>“Keep moving within the limits of the pain and take pain killers. Anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation around the nerves, are probably your best choice.” </p>
<h2>If you have frozen shoulder or shoulder pain…</h2>
<h2>If you have osteoporosis…</h2>
<header> <h1> Eight of the best vegan protein powders to buy in 2022, from hemp to pea </h1> <p> From pea to hemp, plant-based powder comes in many flavours. Here's how to choose the best vegan protein shake to boost your performance </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan and Hannah Hopkins <time> 4 January 2022 • 2:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>One of the main criticisms of the diet, often veering into lazy stereotyping, is that vegans are energy-sapped individuals who can barely run 100 yards without fainting. </p>
<a>number of athletes and bodybuilders</a> switching to a plant-based diet suggests it can be just as effective for active individuals. 
<a>Mike Tyson,</a> the Williams sisters, UFC fighters, cricketers and footballers have all reportedly "gone green" — following the example of Popeye, who built huge forearms on a plant-based diet way back in the 1930s. 
<h3>Can I get enough protein from a plant-based diet?</h3>
<p>After speaking with several nutritionists, the general response was "yes, but..." The proviso is that vegans should plan meals carefully.</p>
<p>"You need a variety of different plant-based sources to make sure you're still getting all the essential amino acids", says Bethan Hamilton, registered associate nutritionist and National Educator for <a>Vega</a>. </p>
<a>Lily Soutter</a>. "Make sure you are focusing on the good-quality protein sources, like tofu, tempeh, beans, lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, nuts and seeds. When you combine them it almost makes a jigsaw puzzle and can help to make a complete protein."
<h3>Do I need a vegan protein powder supplement?</h3>
<p>While it's not set in stone - some will get enough protein from their diet - the experts agreed protein supplements could be beneficial, for both physically active and more sedentary vegans. </p>
<p>"For vegans they're really helpful," says Soutter, "as sometimes it can be hard to get enough protein within the diet."</p>
<p>"The amount of protein per 100g is going to be less from a plant base, which might advocate the use of a supplement. It would be physically difficult to increase protein intake by another way," adds Dr Collins. </p>
<p>If you're looking to build muscle on a plant-based diet but don't want to eat enormous plates of chickpeas and beans, a vegan protein supplement could come in useful. </p>
<a>protein powder</a>. "Protein is important for everyone, whether active or not. It helps the body grow, repair and maintain muscle tissue. Without muscle tissue we lose strength, bone health declines and our metabolic rate reduces," says
<a>Matt Roberts</a>, a personal trainer whose
<a>Mayfair gym makes its own protein-packed vegan smoothies and lunches.</a> 
<h3>When should I take my protein shake?</h3>
<p>While it seems that straight after a workout session is best, it can still be effective to take your protein shake beforehand - and even up to 24 hours afterwards.</p>
<p>"The hour after training is thought to be the best time," says Roberts. "This is because the muscles are in their most absorptive phase and any protein consumed will be best absorbed into muscle fibres, helping recovery and growth." </p>
<p>To Dr Collins, there isn't such a huge rush. "You've got plenty of time and opportunity from when you stop to when you next exercise to meet the requirement. There's no urgency to get it before you even get changed." </p>
<p>"As long as you're getting it one or two hours after the gym that's generally OK," counters Hamilton. "Because we eat protein so often we're constantly building and breaking it down. The actual timing is not as clear as it used to be."</p>
<h3>Are vegan protein shakes as effective as regular ones? </h3>
<p>This goes back to the debate on how complete a protein you're consuming. The best vegan protein powders are composed of a variety of protein sources, from pea and rice to hemp and algae.</p>
<p>While vegan protein is proven to be very effective, its efficacy may not be quite as high as whey, which has "been shown to be more effective than vegan protein", according to Roberts. </p>
<h3>The best vegan protein powders to make your shakes </h3>
<h2>1. Form Performance Protein chocolate peanut</h2>
<p>The packaging exudes health; it almost makes me want to ditch my polluted urban lifestyle and make for an Alpine commune.</p>
<p>The ingredients are wholesome: pea, brown rice and hemp protein - and algae, which according to Dr Collins is a "fairly complete protein". At 30g of protein per portion, and only 2g of carbs, it ticks the right boxes. </p>
<p>I have subsequently mixed it with water (good), and put a spoonful of it in my cereal every morning (very good). At £24 per 520g it isn't cheap, but it's my star pick nonetheless.</p>
<div> <div> <h2>2. Vega Clean Protein Vanilla</h2> <p>£26.99, Planet Organic</p> </div> </div>
<p>The Vega Clean Protein packaging had a muscle-building air to it, more so than the wholesomeness of Form. But we've all learnt not to judge a book by its cover; it's what's inside that counts. </p>
<p>And this protein was very tasty indeed. Mixed with almond milk, it was slightly less thick than the Form, and it wasn't too sweet. It tasted like a healthy vanilla milkshake.</p>
<div> <div> <h2>3. Purition chocolate vegan hemp</h2> <p>£12.99, Holland and Barrett</p> </div> </div>
<p>This was the first one I tried, and my protein-mixing knowledge was still in its infancy.</p>
<p>The packet advised to "blend with 250ml of your favourite milk". I only had coconut milk in the fridge, which isn't my favourite. It's too thick, giving the shake an overly-dense outcome - nothing a little water or a lighter milk wouldn't fix.</p>
<p>My first impression was its incredibly earthy smell, which I put down to the hemp - not unpleasant, mind. The flavour was lightly chocolatey, not as strong as some others, but pleasing nonetheless. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>4. Liberto organic dark chocolate with sour cherry</h2> <p>£12.45, Amazon</p> </div> </div>
<p>Here we go. Dark chocolate. Sour cherry. Organic? I like the sound of that. This is clearly one of the #wellness options. It ticks all the superfood boxes: chia, flax, maca and baobab. Pre-biotics? Tick. Pro-biotics? Tick. </p>
<p>The protein is varied, and in terms of quantity it's got 20g per serving, which is on the upper end of the spectrum</p>
<p>But what does it taste like? Pretty good, actually. It's distinctly sour, so ideal for fans of that sort of thing. I liked it best in a fruity granola.</p>
<div> <div> <h2>5. MISFITS Vegan Salted Caramel Protein Powder</h2> <p>£19, Amazon</p> </div> </div>
<p>The Misfits protein powder comes in chic, pretty packaging. The powder smells quite sweet, not unlike cookie dough.</p>
<p>I mix it with water, as per packet instructions. It's got quite a neutral flavour, not too strong, with just a hint of salted caramel. I imagine anyone but the anti-caramel brigade would find it pleasant enough. </p>
<p>But where it really shines is on ice cream - dairy-free or regular. Think of it as a healthier Horlicks alternative. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>6. Arbonne Essentials vanilla</h2> <p>£34.99, Amazon</p> </div> </div>
<p>The Arbonne Essentials vanilla protein powder came in a posh-looking cardboard box. The powder smelt inviting, and it mixed easily with water - no clotting, no grittiness. </p>
<p>The vanilla flavour was a little too sweet for my liking - thanks to the sugar - but not altogether unpleasant. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>7. Bio-Synergy Lean and Green mint chocolate</h2> <p>£34.99, Very</p> </div> </div>
<p>In the protein shake world, tub definitely implies muscles, at least to me. The protein content of the Bio-Synergy backs this up, with 21g per serving. It's also got a pretty complete protein profile: pea, rice, buckwheat. </p>
<p>It smells really nice, just like the ice cream of the same flavour. My main issue, though, is the foaminess after blending. It settles after a while, but it's not ready to drink as quickly as some others, unless you like foam. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>8. Nutristrength pea protein roasted cocoa</h2> <p>£29.99, Amazon</p> </div> </div>
<p>With smart, cylindrical, pea-covered packaging this is a promising protein. The colour of the powder is dark brown and it has a pleasing, deep cocoa smell.</p>
<p>I opt for oat milk and blend it, the resulting drink very dark and thick. It's not at all sweet, tasting a bit like very dark chocolate, which I like, though some may find a little bland. </p>
<p>Nutritionally, there's 21g of protein per serving, which is pretty good, and it's very low in fat and carbs. </p>
