<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Capitol was under siege. By Americans. </p>
<p>Here, he remembers some moments that stood out to him — moments that, so many months later, he is still processing as a photojournalist and as an American. </p>
<p>“The Capitol has been breached!” the Capitol Police officer shouted to lawmakers. Tear gas was in the Rotunda. “Get out your escape hoods and prepare to evacuate!” the officer said. </p>
<p>From the officers came loud commands: Evacuate. Now. Stragglers were not tolerated — members of Congress, staffers, journalists, all. </p>
<p>But the move to safety was not immediate. Because they didn’t know what was on the other side of the door. </p>
<p>You could hear the growl of the mob just outside. In the chamber, the officers were focused, their guns aimed. And I was trained on the door as well — with a telephoto zoom. </p>
<p>I kept steady and held tight on that spot.</p>
<p>When the breach of the Capitol was announced and evacuation began, it was a chaotic and uncertain process. Evacuate to where? The mob was on the other side of the doors.</p>
<p>After the evacuation order came, AP photographer Andy Harnik lingered and took many important images: lawmakers taking cover, and Capitol Police holding rioters at gunpoint. </p>
<p>The Capitol is where I work every day, and I am a familiar face to most police. When those on the chamber floor shouted up at me to get out, I told them I was fine and refused to leave. This is what we do: We stay and report.</p>
<p>The officer, in plain clothes, was Lt. Michael Byrd. Moments later, outside the House chamber, he shot and killed protester Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.</p>

<p>From that point on, I was the only journalist and the only person remaining in the balcony to witness the standoff in the House chamber.</p>
<p>After the lawmakers and press evacuated, those doors were secured. For another two hours, I was locked in. Then an FBI tactical team swept through and threw me out of the building.</p>
<p>The news went on, as it always does. </p>
<p>The result, if you will, was like a mosaic — views from different photographers all around the Capitol that composed a more complete picture.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed plenty of violence and upheavals before, coups and revolutions, when I was doing conflict coverage abroad, but I am still shocked to experience it here. It was Americans attacking America.</p>
<p>What I saw, and what my camera captured, during the standoff at the House chamber a year ago was this: a place where a line was drawn — with courage, duty and guns.</p>
<p>To do that, we have to be there.</p>

<p>“This decision was made with a heavy heart and a singular focus on student and community safety,” the union said in a statement. </p>
<p>However, district officials blamed the union for the late cancellation, saying despite safety measures, including a high teacher vaccination rate, “our teachers are not willing to report to work.” </p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about this decision but even more concerned about its impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our students and families,” the district said in a statement. </p>

<a>returned to class Monday</a> after a two-week winter break with COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations fueled by the omicron variant at record levels. School districts nationwide

<p>District officials said student attendance for the week was not yet available. </p>

<div><div><h1>Virus surge tests limits of primary health care in Europe</h1></div><div>By ARITZ PARRAJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>MADRID (AP) — Like many people, Alberto Pérez of Madrid used a home test to discover that his headache and cold-like symptoms were caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The nurse seeing me said that, because I had not lost my sense of taste or smell, I had the omicron variant,” said Pérez, 39, who works as an online game developer in the Spanish capital. “But how could she know?”</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by people wanting tests, requiring medication or needing certificates to excuse their absence from work, primary health care services in Spain are operating well past their limit during the current phase of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Family doctors are usually the first stop for health care in Europe. They and primary care nurses are viewed as vital to helping prevent sickness, keeping the pressure off hospitals and providing continuity of care.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<p>“You are left with the feeling that there are no resources, that they have no people, and that all they do is cover up the reality by sending people home,” Pérez said.</p>
<p>“Primary health care requires better funding and investment in all (OECD) countries,” she said, to ensure more staff, more training, better pay and working conditions, and a more flexible delivery of care.</p>
<p>Paloma Repila, a spokeswoman for SATSE, the biggest Spanish union representing nurses, said that fewer hospitalizations in the current surge mean that many people with milder symptoms are having a “brutal impact” on local health centers.</p>
<p>“Infection rates are so high that we are taking the pandemic out of the health care setting and we are asking people to be their own carers,” she said. </p>
<p>“Individual responsibility is great, but asking people to self-diagnose, to deal with their own medical leave and to be left without any follow-up by professionals, is extremely worrisome.”</p>
<p>In France, years of funding cuts to the public health system are blamed for shortages of doctors in rural areas.</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem in Italy, where general practitioners are feeling the weight of the latest surge as well as the burdens of increased paperwork to certify people are safe to return to work and school, officials say.</p>
<p>Repila, the Spanish union spokeswoman, said authorities should be worried about the consequences.</p>
<p>Health Minister Carolina Darias last week appealed for people to report their positive tests, even when they show no symptoms or if they decide to stay at home with mild ones. </p>
<p>Contact tracing, once viewed as a key to halting the pandemic, is something that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>Primary care has been out of the media and public attention for much of the pandemic, when most of the concern was focused on the capacity to cope with the flow of patients into hospitals and intensive care units.</p>
<p>But labor groups and professional associations say the problems began much earlier, the result of years of underfunding that has led to many temporary contracts for medical staff and poor health facilities.</p>
<p>After the 2008 European debt crisis, a conservative government in Spain imposed strict austerity measures that meant significant budget cuts for the public health system. Similar cuts occurred elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Spain’s center-left Socialist government last month unveiled a plan to improve the quality and accessibility of primary health care in the next two years. Critics said the move was overdue.</p>
<p>“There are no doctors or nurses and then we are left to deal with this on our own,” Pérez said. “How is that not linked?”</p>

<div><div><h1>Governor to pardon Plessy, of ‘separate but equal’ ruling</h1></div><div>By JANET McCONNAUGHEYJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Plessy v Ferguson case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ushered in a half-century of laws calling for “separate but equal” accommodations that kept Black people in segregated schools, housing, theaters and other venues. </p>
<p>Relatives of both Plessy and the judge who convicted him were expected to attend. </p>
<p>It spotlights New Orleans as the cradle of the civil rights movement, said Keith Plessy, whose great-great-grandfather was Plessy’s cousin — Homer Plessy had no children.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, this will give some relief to generations who have suffered under discriminatory laws,” said Phoebe Ferguson, the judge’s great-great-granddaughter. </p>
<p>The state Board of Pardons recommended the pardon on Nov. 12 for Plessy, who was a 30-year-old shoemaker when he boarded the train car as a member of a small civil rights group hoping to overturn the law.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Governor to pardon Plessy, of ‘separate but equal’ ruling</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Rabbi wounded in synagogue shooting sentenced for fraud</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<p>In Plessy, Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote for the 7-1 majority: “Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences.”</p>
<p>Justice John Harlan, the dissenter, wrote that he believed the ruling “will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the Dred Scott Case.”</p>
<p>That 1857 decision said no Black person who had been enslaved or was descended from a slave could ever become a U.S. citizen. It was overturned by the 13th and 14th Amendments, passed in 1865 and 1866.</p>
<p>“His one attribute was being white enough to gain access to the train and black enough to be arrested for doing so,” Medley wrote. </p>
<p>Five blocks of the street where he was arrested, renamed <a>Homer Plessy Way</a> in 2018, runs through the campus of the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, where the ceremony was to be held outdoors for COVID-19 safety.</p>
<p>Eight months after the ruling in his case, Plessy pleaded guilty on Jan. 11, 1897. He was fined $25 at a time when 25 cents would buy a pound of round steak and 10 pounds of potatoes. He died in 1925 with the conviction on his record.</p>
<p>Relatives of Plessy and John Howard Ferguson, the judge who oversaw his case in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, became friends decades later and formed a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights education.</p>
<div><div><h1>Virginia officials defend response to snowy gridlock on I-95</h1></div><div>By SARAH RANKIN and DENISE LAVOIEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>There were no reported deaths or injuries from the calamity on Interstate 95, but plenty of outrage from motorists, some of whom were stranded overnight Monday into Tuesday, posting pleas for help on social media. </p>
<p>“We all need to be clear that this was an incredibly unusual event,” Gov. Ralph Northam said at a news conference, adding that he could understand drivers’ “frustration and fear.”</p>
<p>Problems began Monday morning, when a truck jackknifed on Interstate 95 between Richmond and Washington, triggering a swift chain reaction as other vehicles lost control, state police said. </p>
<p>They mounted throughout the day as snow fell at a rate of up to 2 inches an hour, said Marcie Parker, a Virginia Department of Transportation engineer leading the effort to clear the interstate.</p>
<p>Lanes in both directions eventually became blocked across an approximately 40-mile stretch of I-95 north of Richmond. As hours passed and night fell, motorists posted messages on social media about running out of fuel, food and water.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden you could no longer see lines. It got a little scary there,” she said. </p>
<p>Slaughter said she soon came to a stop and she found out about the disabled vehicles on the radio and over social media.</p>
<p>“People were saying, ‘we’re running out of gas’ or ‘our kids are hungry,’” she said. </p>
<p>Meera Rao and her husband, Raghavendra, were driving home from visiting their daughter in North Carolina when they got stuck Monday evening. They were only 100 feet past an exit but could not move for roughly 16 hours.</p>
<p>Northam defended his decision not to activate the Virginia National Guard or declare a state of emergency. </p>
<p>Up to 11 inches of snow fell in the area during Monday’s blizzard, according to the National Weather Service, and state police had warned people to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary, especially as colder nighttime temperatures set in.</p>
<p>Crews worked throughout the day to clear the roadway, and traffic spilled out onto secondary roads, causing additional delays. </p>
<p>Officials never provided an estimate of the number of vehicles that tied up in the jam. Photos showed they numbered in the hundreds, if not thousands. </p>
<p>The storm also left passengers on an Amtrak train stranded in Virginia. Amtrak’s Crescent left New Orleans on Sunday on its way to New York and got stuck near Lynchburg on Monday morning, when downed trees blocked the tracks. </p>
<p>Passenger Sean Thornton told AP that Amtrak provided food, but toilets were overflowing and passengers were furious. Amtrak planned for the train to complete its trip once the tracks are clear. </p>
<p>Kelly Hannon, a spokeswoman for the transportation department, apologized to motorists for the I-95 logjam and said the department would take an “exhaustive look” at the incident.</p>
<p>Marvin Romero, who was driving home from a family vacation in South Florida with his daughters, ages 10 and 8, took a rather optimistic view of the situation, despite spending 20 hours and a long, anxious night in the car.</p>
<p>“To me, I see it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. How many people can actually say that they stepped on I-95, or they slept on I-95?” he said. “It’s hopefully a story that I can tell my grandkids one day.”</p>

<div><div><h1>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi’an</h1></div><div>By HUIZHONG WUJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The National Health Commission announced just 35 new cases in Xi’an, home to the famed Terracotta Warriors statues along with major industries, down from 95 the day before. </p>
<p>Health officials said they have basically achieved the goal of halting community transmission because the new cases were among people already quarantined.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The decline has continued since daily new cases topped 100, which had prompted officials to retain and in some cases tighten restrictions on people leaving their homes.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, however, are far more stringent than anything seen in the West, and have exacted a tremendous toll on the economy and disrupted the lives of millions of people.</p>
<p>News of people in Xi’an seeking urgent medical care who have been turned away at hospitals for not having current COVID-19 test results have spread online. </p>
<p>They included a pregnant woman who felt pains in her stomach on New Year’s Day but was not allowed into a hospital, according to a post by the woman’s niece that was shared widely on social media. </p>
<p>The woman waited outside the hospital on a pink plastic stool until she started bleeding. In a video taken by her husband which was circulated widely, a pool of blood was visible by her feet.</p>
<p>She was finally let into the hospital after medical workers saw the blood, but the fetus was already dead, the post said. </p>
<p>The AP was not able to independently verify the video. The woman’s niece did not respond to messages left on her social media accounts. </p>
<p>Authorities told Phoenix News that they are investigating the case. </p>
<p>Another city, Yuzhou in Henan province, was also placed under lockdown over the weekend after the discovery of three asymptomatic cases.</p>
<p>Only emergency vehicles are allowed on the roads, classes have been suspended and businesses catering to the public have closed for all but essential needs in the city of 1.17 million.</p>
<p>With the Beijing Olympics beginning Feb. 4, China is doubling down on measures to prevent any new outbreak that could affect the proceedings.</p>
<p>No fans from outside China will be permitted and most spectators are expected to come from schools, government offices and the military rather than the general public. </p>
<p>Underscoring the importance of the event, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Olympic sites around the capital on Tuesday, including the main media center. </p>
<p>China has vaccinated nearly 85% of its population, according to Our World in Data. The shots have helped reduce the severity of disease, although Chinese vaccines are considered less effective than those used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Officials haven’t given a specific date for the lifting of the lockdown.</p>
<p>At least two district Communist Party officials in Xi’an have been sacked for failing to control the outbreak, and a third, the head of the city’s big data management bureau, Liu Jun, has been suspended, Xinhua reported Wednesday. </p>
<p>That came after the city’s health code system that monitors movements and vaccinations crashed on Dec. 20 due to high traffic as case numbers were rising, Xinhua said. </p>
<p>China has reported a total of 102,932 cases nationwide, with its death toll remaining steady at 4,636. </p>
<p>This story has been corrected to show the population of Yuzhou is 1.17 million, not 1.7 million. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Long after most other lawmakers had been rushed to safety, they were on the hard marble floor, ducking for cover.</p>
<p>As danger neared, and as the rioters were trying to break down the doors, they called their families. They scrambled for makeshift weapons and mentally prepared themselves to fight. Many thought they might die.</p>
<a>an unprecedented assault on American democracy</a>. Along with a small number of staffers and members of the media, they remained in the chamber as
<a>Capitol Police</a> strained to hold back the surging, shouting mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
