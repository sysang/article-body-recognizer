<h4>Klein Karoo and Montagu</h4>
<p>Check in with Lauren and Louise at Vineyard Country House. If they’re serving dinner, stay put as Louise is an excellent self-trained cook. Alternatively, book at Simply Delicious, a short stroll away (0027 23 614 3483). </p>
<h4>Great Karoo and Prince Albert</h4>
<h4>Garden route: Wilderness</h4>
<p>Tim or Maureen will discuss dinner options and book your table (Joplin’s steakhouse is a must – unless you’re a vegetarian).</p>

<h4>Grootbos Private Nature Reserve</h4>
<p>A leisurely five-hour drive west brings you to the Grootbos Private Nature Reserve, home to two award-winning lodges, and famed for its extraordinary fynbos heathland, winter whalewatching, beach excursions and unrivalled ocean views. </p>
<p>Allow three hours for the drive back to Cape Town International airport. British Airways overnight flights direct to London depart between 6pm-9pm.</p>
<p>The temperate winter usually starts in June. Sunny days alternate with downpours which water the winter-flowering fynbos, including proteas, lilies and aloes.</p>
<p>From October to early December the coastline sparkles in the spring sun with the occasional bout of rain. This is when some of the best deals of the summer season are to be had.</p>
<p>The above itinerary can be arranged independently, but you may find it easier to employ the services of a tailor-made South Africa specialist. Telegraph Travel recommends Audley, <a>Kuoni</a> and <a>Trailfinders</a>. </p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to be someone who travels mindfully and respectfully but have never been very good at it. While I aspire to leave on time and in a state of calm, I rarely achieve either goal.</p>
<p>Being a road-trip kind of family, a destination like this is a departure for us. But after a year of living in uncertainty, the lure of a holiday where we won’t have to cook, clean, pack, unpack or drive anywhere is appealing.</p>
<p>My youngest prefers less-structured play, so was happy hanging out by the pool with other children from all over the world. At one point, I heard him chatting about religion with a group of girls of a similar age from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The beach club, which serves excellent cocktails, is a serene sunset-watching spot with cool linen hammocks; there is an impressive art collection to enjoy, including a temple housing a James Turrell work.</p>

<p>It was a very thin little book.</p>
<p>Australian history and geography were crammed into a brief period after lunch on Thursday. (Does anyone study geography any more? It’s probably been replaced by gender studies and colonial horror stories.)</p>
<p>Redback spiders were another venomous hazard, enjoying their traditional habitat under the wooden seats of all Australian outdoor privies. Perhaps the reason why so many of my contemporaries were constipated.</p>
<p>It was little wonder that my generation took the first opportunity to get out of Australia.</p>
<p>It was only after long expatriation and several marriages that I began to really love Australia.</p>
<p>So where would I, Mr Know-all, take you?</p>
<p>I invite you to recline in a deckchair, as I have, a thousand kilometres from the nearest shop, and gaze into the incandescent caverns of an enormous bonfire sending its sparks high up to mingle with the nebulae.</p>
<p>They call it ‘the Bush television’.</p>

<p>Tracey Emin has accused the Government of “coming to get her”, claiming officials accused her of going "AWOL" following her first holiday post cancer treatment.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old artist was diagnosed with "really rapid, really aggressive" bladder cancer last year. In April, she said that her cancer had gone following a series of major surgeries.</p>
<p>She captioned a photograph of herself with healthcare workers wearing PPE saying: “Covid test a great image to end the best holiday I’ve ever had in my entire life. I haven’t left my house since I came back.</p>
<p>“My PCR test was negative before I got on the plane and my test when I came back to the UK. <a>I’ve had both Covid jabs and my booster.</a></p>
<p><a>The Royal Academician went on</a>: “And before anyone starts throwing stuff at me, my priorities are health, education and art. The more scared people are, the less power we have to make decisions and change what is wrong.</p>
<p>“It’s fine being told what to do by people who know what they are doing. But not otherwise. Never.”</p>
<p>She now has a urostomy bag, which replaces the bladder and urinary system.<a> It is a "major disability"</a> because it needs to be emptied as frequently as every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS Test and Trace were contacted for comment.</p>

<p>When skiing first became popular, it was considered the realm of the aristocracy and celebrity film stars, and energetic sporty types who combined a love of adventure and mountaineering with the new thrill of sliding down fast.</p>
<a>St Moritz</a>, regarding the
<a>finest hotels</a>, restaurants and shops, along with the opportunity to see and be seen, to be at least as important as the slopes.
<a>party animals</a> to those who just want to ski hard. And there are also plenty of more
<a>wallet-friendly resorts</a> catering for those on a tighter budget.
<a>what makes a ski resort luxurious</a> is also now more of a movable, personal, feast. Designer shops and glittery nightlife might still be important for some, others might insist on secluded privacy, Michelin-starred restaurants or access to a
<a>helipad</a>. Or are fast lifts and five-star slope grooming paramount?
<a>luxury chalet</a> with cinema and private chauffeur perhaps, or a five-star
<a>hotel</a> with gourmet restaurants and acres of spa.
<p>Whatever the priorities, here are 10 of the most glamorous resorts on earth, whether for celebrating a special occasion, or just because…</p>
<a>Courchevel</a>’s five villages, officially simply called Courchevel, is the prestige place to stay in this
<a>intermediates</a> well. There are long easy green runs for learners to progress to, and arguably there is no better ski area than the
<a>huge</a> Trois Vallées for those keen to clock up the miles on immaculately groomed slopes.
<p>Five-star Barrière Les Neiges is decorated in luxurious mountain chalet style and has two restaurants serving Argentinian or classic French cuisine. The ski room is particularly deluxe.</p>

<div> <h2> Best for après-loving experts </h2> </div>
<div> <h2> Verbier, Switzerland </h2> </div>
<a>après ski</a> is concentrated in a relatively small number of venues around Place Centrale, the main lift base at Médran and the buzzing street between the two, and all the more exuberant for it.

<div> <h2> Best for under-the-radar intermediates </h2> </div>
<div> <h2> Lech, Austria </h2> </div>
<a>Oberlech</a> above the village, once the summer domain of shepherds and cow herds, has also grown almost into a resort in its own right, with huts replaced by expensive hotels. While many
<a>Austrian resorts</a> are well known for lively après ski, Lech best suits more sophisticated, cocktail-sipping types.
<a>intermediates</a>, and are unlikely to be overcrowded – Lech was the first resort in Europe to cap the number of day passes issued to 14,000 a day. There are also the linked pistes of
<a>St Anton</a> and Warth-Schröcken in the rest of the giant Arlberg ski area to explore – a total 305km.

<div> <h2> Megève, France </h2> </div>
<a>founded in 1916</a> by Baroness Noémie de Rothschild, who decided that France should have its own
<a>St Moritz</a>. It succeeded in attracting the rich and famous – in the 1950s French singer Sacha Distel was king, sharing bubbles with Yves Montand, Brigitte Bardot and Jean Cocteau among others.
<a>mountain restaurants</a> are also a highlight.
<p>Part of Sibuet’s stable of properties, five-star Les Fermes de Marie is a collection of restored timber chalets comprising cosy rooms and suites, two restaurants and the original cowshed‑chic Alpine spa, L’Altitude. </p>

<div> <h2> Zermatt, Switzerland </h2> </div>
<a>Switzerland’s</a> most famous resort also brings together every scenic Alpine cliché, from the world’s most photogenic mountain, the Matterhorn, to streets lined with a jumble of blackened, weathered, wobbly-looking chalets.
<a>intermediates</a>, while itinerary runs (avalanche controlled but not patrolled) and off‑piste challenges are the main attraction for
<a>experts</a>, especially those willing to ski tour or heliski. For extra mileage, Zermatt is linked to the slopes of

<div> <div> By Greg Dickinson, Senior Travel Writer <time> 16 November 2021 • 1:15pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When you received a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, you may have let out a sigh of relief. If nothing else, you would be able to go to your favourite holiday destination once again.</p>
<p>Alas, the latest twist (we didn’t actually think international travel was out of the woods, did we?) is that double vaccination may soon not be enough for us to head overseas. </p>
<p>“So I would just say, if you’re thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done.”</p>
<p>This echoes what Health Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested in recent weeks. A third dose, it appears, could be required for you to be classed as fully vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Will I really need a booster to avoid quarantine after my holiday… or is this another ‘nudge’?</h2>
<p>Remember when (at the height of the vaccination campaign) the Government said it would at some point roll out vaccine certificates for certain venues, and then, when it came to it, they did not?</p>
<h2>Will my vaccination status expire in foreign countries?</h2>
<p>Some countries are now placing expiry dates on vaccines. Austria and Croatia have issued a deadline of one year after the second dose; however, this has already been extended from 270 days, and could possibly move back again.</p>
<p>Switzerland and Vietnam have also issued one-year expiries on second jabs, and in Israel you must have received your second jab no more than six months previously in order to visit indoor venues in the country.</p>
<h2>Will double-jabbed Britons be restricted from entry to countries this winter?</h2>
<p>A senior aviation source told Travel Weekly that there is little risk of double-jabbed Britons being restricted from travel in the immediate future.</p>
<p>“Unless there is international alignment, it would cause all sorts of complexity. One would hope they wait until after the winter.”</p>
<p>They added: “The system feels pretty stable for now. We don’t sense any real concern from ministers. What would create an immediate reaction would be if a new variant appears anywhere.”</p>
<h2>If I am unvaccinated, will I need to get two or three jabs to become fully vaccinated?</h2>
<h2>Will we need to keep getting boosters to travel, ad infinitum?</h2>
<h2>When will the NHS app be updated to show boosters?</h2>
<p>While the third dose is not currently needed to travel anywhere, from December 15 this will be imperative for over 65s looking to prove their vaccination status in France.</p>
<p>It is also currently unknown if and when the whole population will be called up to receive a booster.</p>

<header> <h1> How strict vaccine rules are threatening to ruin family holidays </h1> <p> Travel requirements for under-18s vary widely around the world – here's what it means for your family holiday </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Featherstone <time> 19 November 2021 • 11:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Single or double jab entry rules. Tests to enter restaurants. NHS Covid passes that can’t be used by under-16s... the holiday rule quicksand could swiftly sink a family break this winter.</p>
<p>Rules can change at short notice, and age-specific protocols are often a forgotten factor – as Liddy Pleasants, managing director of Stubborn Mule, a family holiday specialist, explains. </p>
<p>“We have found that many countries announce their opening up for tourism without mentioning how their new regulations affect children,” she says. </p>
<p>“This is often added as an afterthought, frequently a week or two later. There can therefore be great fanfare about a country reopening, when in fact it may not be open at all for families.”</p>
<p>The Foreign Office may work to keep up with the ever-evolving Covid-related entry rules across the globe, but, as Pleasants points out, it can sometimes “omit reference as to how these affect children”. </p>
<p>“Our top tip is to ensure that you have checked and rechecked the advice with specific reference to children,” she says. </p>
<p>“Don’t rely on what you can find online (as much of this is out of date), but speak to a specialist operator who has experience of actually sending families abroad.”</p>
<p>Martin says: “My frustration is less with the UK Government and more with the inconsistency in regulations on vaccinations and testing from country to country.”</p>
<p>For Luckyn-Malone, the rollout of vaccinations to 16- and 17-year-olds will be welcome. Yet there are other hurdles of the UK system, and rapidly-evolving vaccine rules (such as a push for boosters) to consider.</p>

<h2>Your questions answered</h2>
<h2>What is the UK Government’s approach to vaccinating children? </h2>
<p>The NHS is offering the first dose of a Covid vaccine to 12- to 15-year-olds, but the majority are not being offered a second jab. From November 22, all 16- to 17-year-olds will be able to book a second dose. </p>
<p>There isn’t currently a set date for offering a second jab for children aged between 12 and 15. No vaccination has been approved for under-12s in the UK. </p>
