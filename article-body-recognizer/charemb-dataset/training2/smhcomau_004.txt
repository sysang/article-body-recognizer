<p>His father Ivan can also rest easy he has finally clinched a title as coach.</p>
<p>Speaking of Nathan, Ivan said: “It’s hard to put it into words. I coach him every day, when he’s your son ... to win a Clive Churchill, I couldn’t have written that story. It’s pretty cool.”</p>
<p>Co-captain Isaah Yeo would have had plenty of supporters for man-of-the-match honours with another enormous effort in the middle of the field. South Sydney No.13 Cameron Murray also smashed through more than 50 tackles and worked his heart out.</p>
<p>The Clearys cuddling wasn’t the only emotional moment after the final whistle. Penrith winger Brian To’o also proposed to his partner in the stands. She said yes.</p>

<div>NRL signs new $575m, five-year free-to-air broadcast deal with Nine</div>
<p>After months of wrangling, Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V’landys and NRL boss Abdo have extended the code’s deal with its long-term broadcast partner into a fourth decade worth $575 million.</p>
<p>Nine Entertainment Co, the publisher of this masthead, will continue to broadcast three matches per round and have exclusive rights to the State of Origin series and grand final. All three Origin matches will be played on Wednesday nights from 2023.</p>
<p>“For us to be able to get over $400 million per annum locked up in media rights in the new cycle is the highest the game has ever had.</p>
<p>Nine Entertainment Co will continue to hold radio and audio broadcast rights through its 2GB and 4BC platforms in Sydney and Brisbane respectively, which will include exclusive rights for the Sunday 4pm games.</p>
<p>The deal was announced to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Nine Entertainment Co lobbied for a return to Wednesday night for Origin matches, which saw a stunning growth in streaming numbers through the business’ Nine Now platform.</p>
<p>“COVID really accelerated the way people behaved in the context of digital and online. We’ve seen that in the ratings numbers across the group, but in particular with NRL and State of Origin.”</p>
<p>V’landys described it as an “exciting day for our fans”, with Nine Entertainment Co claiming it would offer “expanded broadcast, digital offerings and reporting of the NRLW competition”.</p>
<p>“This is more than a broadcast deal, it’s a partnership to grow rugby league using all of Nine’s media platforms – television, radio and print,” V’landys said.</p>
<p>The NRL’s subscription partner Foxtel brokered a revised and extended deal through to the end of 2027 during the COVID-19 suspension of the competition last year, which will now align with the deals of Nine and Sky Sports New Zealand.</p>
<p>The NRL will introduce a 17th team, the Dolphins, in 2023.</p>
<p>The 17-team competition will feature 12 more regular season matches in total across a 26-round season and more club games during the Origin period with at least one team to have a bye each round.</p>

<div>Idle Turbo to adopt same strict regimen to protect precious hamstrings</div>
<p>Tom Trbojevic was spared going to Melbourne in the off-season but will follow the same strict training regimen implemented by top hamstring specialist in the hope of enjoying a second successive injury-free campaign.</p>
<p>Trbojevic allowed himself to enjoy a proper off-season this time around, and said there would be no dramas starting from scratch with his hamstrings once he returns to Sea Eagles’ training on January 6.</p>
<p>Manly fans know if Trbojevic remains on the field in 2022, it could be the difference between failing to reach the finals and winning a premiership.</p>
<p>“I’ve enjoyed a proper break but did little running and nothing with my hamstrings,” Trbojevic told the Herald.</p>
<p>“I’ll be starting from the bottom in the new year and building my way up with fitness and the sprint program. There will be no dramas there.</p>
<p>“There was talk of me going back to see David in Melbourne, but instead I’ll continue to do a heap of testing with his team without having to head to Melbourne.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have been more relieved with the way they held up this year. I’ll look to do the same work again and hopefully have the same results.”</p>
<p>Trbojevic certainly had a year to remember with no shortage of awards, including the Dally M Medal and Wally Lewis Medal for being the best Origin player last year for the victorious Blues.</p>
<p>And while some fans will be wondering if Manly over-achieved in 2021, Trbojevic said it was not the case, and there were a few simple reasons they could go one better and reach the decider.</p>
<p>“Everyone is a year older and they have that experience of playing in big games now,” Trbojevic said.</p>
<p>“The younger guys will only get better and hopefully we can go that step further.”</p>
<div>Is Amone the man to solve the Dragons’ No.6 problem?</div>
<p>Amone, 19, admitted talking to young teammate Jayden Sullivan before the latter penned a three-year extension with the Dragons until the end of 2025, with the pair set to square off in the pre-season for the five-eighth position.</p>
<p>Both showed glimpses of their immense potential towards the end of last season despite the Dragons slumping to a club-record eight straight losses to finish the year.</p>
<p>But Corey Norman’s release - he has since announced his retirement from the NRL - has brought St George Illawarra’s future firmly into the present.</p>
<p>Along with Sullivan, fullback Tyrell Sloan and the Feagai twins, Mat and Max, Amone will be part of the nucleus of a squad desperate to play finals football for the first time since 2018.</p>
<p>Anthony Mundine, Trent Barrett and 2010 premiership winner Jamie Soward are among those to have worn the Red V’s No.6 jersey since the joint venture was formed in 1999.</p>
<p>Amone is tied to the Dragons until the end of 2023 - the same year in which Hunt’s massive contract ends - and already rival clubs are watching with interest as to how St George Illawarra juggle the futures of both he and Sullivan.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve just got to prove to him now I’m ready to play each and every game in the No.6 jersey. That’s the goal</p><cite>Junior Amone</cite></blockquote>
<p>“We grew up together and all had the same dream. We always talked about it. Seeing [Sullivan and Sloan] do it as well is a great feeling. But nothing is ever certain. If we can [stay together], we will.”</p>
<p>“He’s a great coach and he knows the way I play,” Amone said. “He keeps the structure we can play around, but if we see an opportunity he wants us to take it. He gives us confidence to back ourselves.</p>
<p>“I feel like we don’t need to look into what people expect of us [in 2022]. We know what we’ve got to do to be a better team.”</p>

<div>Who leaked photo is not the real issue in ill-considered Kikau snap</div>
<p>A couple of years ago, when the Bulldogs desperately needed a big fish in the player market, then-chair Lynne Anderson and chief executive Andrew Hill flew to the United Kingdom to speak to Luke Thompson.</p>
<p>Negotiations had been protracted and fraught, the tyranny of distance making it hard to read which way it would go.</p>
<p>After making their pitch and finally getting Thompson’s signature on a lucrative contract, they presented the English prop with a Bulldogs polo shirt.</p>
<p>While grateful, Thompson said he didn’t want to be seen it until he’d officially started at Belmore.</p>
<p>Viliame Kikau shouldn’t have put on a Bulldogs polo shirt after signing a life-changing deal to join Canterbury from 2023, with another year to remain on his Panthers contract.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs have launched an investigation into how the image leaked from a security camera and found its way onto social media within hours of Kikau agreeing to terms.</p>
<p>But the real issue is: why did they even ask him to put the shirt on in the first place?</p>
<p>Regardless of their motive, or how private they thought the setting, it was hard to see what the Bulldogs were actually trying to achieve by taking a photo of Kikau in their colours.</p>
<p>Gould’s arrival has energised a proud club which has been too bad for too long.</p>
<p>But how much will Kikau regret not having the courage to politely decline the offer to throw on a Bulldogs polo before needed?</p>
<p>Penrith coach Ivan Cleary was even forced to defend Kikau when addressing the media, and having to do so knowing he has to keep his star player’s head straight to maximise his value in the final year of his Panthers deal, like Matt Burton.</p>
<p>Fans can forgive, if not understand, players who game the NRL’s archaic transfer system, signing bumper deals with another club 16 months before they actually play for them.</p>
<p>But they won’t forget that grainy image of an NRL star wearing another club’s colours before he should have.</p>
<p>Kikau can thank his future employers for that - not the person who leaked it.</p>

<div>‘This is a good deal for the NRL ... they should be commended for it’</div>
<p>In March this year, AFL boss Gillon McLachlan told his club chief executives that his code would be receiving $475 million a year from TV income in 2023, while the NRL would be earning $300 million.</p>
<p>His prediction, if correct, would mean the biggest gap in TV revenue between the two codes, given that the past $2 billion-plus deals - when monies from pay TV and free-to-air were announced concurrently - were comparable.</p>
<p>However, 2023 was a convenient year for McLachlan to choose because the NRL did not have a FTA deal in place for that year, while the AFL had completed negotiations on both pay and FTA rights through to 2024.</p>
<p>The NRL’s FTA deal is $650 million, cash and contra, over five years, beginning 2023, at an average of $130 million a year. It includes the recently doubled TV rights income from New Zealand and increases in international broadcast rights.</p>
<p>Maybe McLachlan was one of the few who knew what V’landys had negotiated from Foxtel when he cited $300 million as the NRL’s total TV income in 2023. If so, he was being convenient with his accounting.</p>
<p>Based on his revelation about the AFL’s numbers in 2023, the NRL is less than $75m a year behind the AFL.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the NRL now has security of TV income (about two thirds of its total revenue) through to 2027, while the AFL deals with Foxtel and Channel Seven conclude in 2024.</p>
<p>Smith cited the recent NFL deal in the US, which doubled its rights to $13 billion a year without competition.</p>
<p>However, he conceded the NRL had done well, especially after two seasons where games were subject to blow-outs and a clear gap emerged between the haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>“This is a good deal for the NRL,” Smith said. “They should be commended for it.”</p>
<p>Smith also points out that AFL games are longer with more opportunities for commercial breaks and therefore advertising revenue.</p>
<p>“Another tribal team in Brisbane will help the NRL with ratings,” he said of the Queensland viewing audience which is extremely parochial in the teams it watches.</p>
<p>Nine confirmed it will be able to stream games on 9Now, a popular medium with millenials who demand the ability to access sport anytime, anywhere. Younger viewers will therefore be able to watch Nine games on mobile phones, computers and tablets.</p>
<p>A Nine press release said, “After securing the biggest ever BVOD audience in Australia for the 2021 grand final, 9Now will continue to be the premium destination for live streaming and catch up viewing...”</p>
<p>Nine also gains exclusivity of radio rights of NRL games through its Sydney stations 2GB and Brisbane’s 4BC. Abdo insists his deal making was never exclusively about money, claiming he sought consistency of promotion nationally.</p>
<p>Nine’s ownership of newspapers (the Herald and The Age), a national TV network and the premier radio stations should allow this, but there will be resistance in Melbourne, the home of AFL.</p>
<p>After all, long-term leaguies in the Victorian capital recall when the film The Man with Two Brains was being screened on Nine in Melbourne at the same time the rest of eastern Australia was watching the Storm.</p>
<div>‘I’ll back the brother’: Why Sonny Bill thinks Cooper can make it to the 2023 Rugby World Cup</div>

<h1>‘I’ll back the brother’: Why Sonny Bill thinks Cooper can make it to the 2023 Rugby World Cup</h1>
<p>“I’ll back the brother,” Williams told the Herald. “He just needs to keep working hard.</p>
<p>“Lote Tuqiri and Mat Rogers during the week said he was the guy. Guys with resumes have come out and supported him.</p>
<p>“Did you see the South African players showing the respect they did after the game to him?”</p>
<p>Williams could not be prouder of Cooper, who is now in the conversation of who should wear the Wallabies No.10 jersey at the next World Cup in France off the back of a superb showing against the Springboks on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, a stranger recognised Williams walking on a Sydney street and yelled out to him.</p>
<p>Williams wants to set the record straight.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Cooper was told by Queensland Reds coach Brad Thorn his services were no longer required, despite him still being contracted for the following season.</p>
<p>In the days afterwards, Cooper was lost. He was not in a good mental headspace, prompting Williams to convince him to get the next plane to Auckland.</p>
<p>For the next few months in New Zealand, Cooper was no longer a rugby player. He was ‘Uncle Quadey’.</p>
<p>Williams, renowned as one of the hardest trainers across both codes, put Cooper through his paces.</p>
<p>“For instance, we were having eggs on toast. Some people don’t even have eggs on toast. That’s the kind of conversations we were having.”</p>
<p>Williams watched Cooper’s brilliant performance on Sunday night like a proud father and for once, the shoe was on the other foot.</p>
<p>“It gave me that understanding of when my close ones would watch me play and play well, the satisfaction they would get.”</p>
<p>Despite attempts to make it back to the Wallabies through club rugby in 2018, and then a stint at the Melbourne Rebels, Cooper was not selected by Michael Cheika, a coach he later criticised after Australia’s 2019 World Cup quarter-final exit.</p>
<p>During that time, did Williams feel Cooper was hard done by?</p>
<p>“Now we’re here and he’s been given his chance. Who would have thought?”</p>

<h1>Zero scrum game: is it too late to save rugby union?</h1>
<div><p>By Tim Elliott</p><time>April 2, 2021</time></div>
<p>“A picture says a thousand words,” Hamish McLennan, RA’s chairman, told the media in the lead-up to the event. “It [the constant colour changes] shows the madness of our inconsistency.”</p>
<p>Most agree it’s a victory for good taste and sound judgment. But it is also, inevitably, a victory for nostalgia. Once again, to everyone’s relief, Australian rugby is going back to the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rugby is on the bones of its arse right now ... and what you’re left with is a bunch of huge men, who we don’t know, running into one another.”</p></blockquote>
<a>worth $100 million</a> over three years.
<p>Most importantly, the agreement involves a commitment to show a weekly Saturday night Super Rugby game on the Nine Network – the first time the competition has been given a free-to-air platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rugby has been through a lot, but COVID is an inflection point. It gives you the opportunity to restart.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“There are so many constituent parts,” says Marinos. “Creating pathways for the players, managing stakeholders, the sponsors, fans and the community game.”</p>
<p>I must look sceptical. “It’s a fantastic opportunity!” he says. “But it’s going to take time to fix. And it’s not going to be easy.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The parochialism and backward thinking are crippling rugby. It’s a self-made destruction.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Rugby connoisseurs claim the complexity of the game is part of its beauty; that rugby is chess to rugby league’s checkers.</p></blockquote>
<p>No fewer than eight recent RA and NSWRU office holders are Shore old boys, including current chairman, Hamish McLennan, recently departed CEO Rob Clarke and director Phil Waugh.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The whole episode painted a really ugly picture for the game right when what it needed most was positivity and cohesion.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear what such an investment would look like. “Do we do it at a competition level, do we include the clubs or not, do we sell a part of the Wallabies or the whole organisation? We have to figure that out,” says McLennan.</p>
<p>There’s a lot at stake. “We’re on the ground floor of a complete rebuild for rugby. But it’s taken a long time getting to this point, and it’ll take quite a few years to get out of it.”</p>

<h1>‘A brutal study in physics’: How do scrums and other rugby mysteries work?</h1>
<h2>With its rolling mauls, tight-heads, loose-heads and crooked feeds, rugby union is a language all its own. How might the uninitiated make sense of this code? And why do fans struggle to get to grips with it, too?</h2>
<div><h5>By Tom Decent and Iain Payten</h5><time>February 19, 2021</time></div>
<p>Rugby is, to put it mildly, a complex game. Its rule book runs to a staggering 162 pages, and that’s not taking into account the varied options for a referee adjudicating each rule.</p>
<p>The code’s terminology can seem like another language. In any one game, a commentator will mention scrums, breakdowns, rolling mauls, tight-heads, loose-heads, pod systems, crooked feeds, box kicks and short-arm penalties.</p>
<p>So, whether you’re tuning in or whether you’re just curious about the code, how do you navigate rugby? What’s a scrum? Can you cheat? What’s a breakdown? Rolling maul? Lineout? And who does what on the field?</p>
<h3><b>What is a scrum and why do they occur?</b></h3>
<p>Stripped back to basics, the scrum is a way of restarting play after a knock-on (when a player accidentally drops the ball on the ground in front of them), a forward pass or sometimes a penalty.</p>
<p>It is a pushing contest – between two packs of eight forwards. Some players are more important than others in a scrum. The three burly front-rowers are basically on the field to do that job. The other five forwards have supporting duties.</p>
<p>The attacking team aims to get the ball to the rear of their scrum and then to the speedy, creative players in the backline. The defensive team aims to push the attacking team backwards to win back the ball.</p>

<h3><b>So if it’s a pushing contest, does size matter?</b></h3>
<p>But size is only one thing. Scrums are also hugely technical, with expert coaches and analysts who train their forwards to combine tightly and push in the best way to exert the maximum collective force. It is a brutal study in physics.</p>
<h3><b>Why does the referee yell, ‘Crouch, bind, set’? </b></h3>
<p>It is far safer now – spinal injuries in scrums are now rare – but the downside is that scrums can take a very long time to set up and complete, particularly when they collapse and need to be re-set.</p>
<h3><b>Can you ‘cheat’ in a scrum?</b></h3>
<h3><b>Do Australian teams have good scrums?</b></h3>
<h3><b>What’s a breakdown?</b></h3>

<h3>How do penalty kicks fit in? And who has short arms?</h3>

<h3><b/><b>How does a lineout work?</b></h3>
<p>If a scrum is a pushing contest between forwards, a lineout is a catching contest. But with one team throwing the ball in, the contest should be largely removed if they do their jobs properly.</p>
<h3><b>What can go wrong at the lineout?</b></h3>

<h1>‘I thought, I can’t possibly stab these kids’: Kefu’s humanity in face of horror</h1>
<div><div><p>By Georgina Robinson</p><time>October 22, 2021</time></div></div>
<p>Some dates cast a long shadow over a life, punctuating its fortunes, directing its currents. Bestowing blessings and afflictions. For decorated Wallaby Toutai Kefu and family that date is August 16.</p>
<p>This year, August 16 was the day Madison turned 18. The Kefus - Toutai, Rachel, older children Joshua and Olivia, younger children Lucia and Isaac - planned to celebrate Madi with dinner and cake at home in Brisbane that night.</p>
<blockquote><p>There was blood everywhere at this stage, it was unbelievable.</p><cite>Toutai Kefu</cite></blockquote>
<p>“There was blood everywhere at this stage, it was unbelievable. The police that came in could not believe the crime scene.”</p>
<p>Kefu says it has changed the way they live. “We won’t be the same,” he says.</p>
<p>But Kefu is also referring to the emotional damage wrought by the events of that morning. The nightmares his children have, the tears that flood their faces at unpredictable moments, the insomnia.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I feel sorry for them. They’re not going to have the same life my kids are going to have. We should pray for them.”</p><cite>Toutai Kefu</cite></blockquote>
<p>“But no one died, we’re still alive. Those kids ... They’ve been brought up differently ... I feel sorry for them. They’re not going to have the same life my kids are going to have. We should pray for them.”</p>
<p>”I know about his fighting characteristics because I almost lost the lineout and lost the ball there (in the 2001 Bledisloe),” Wallabies second-rower Matt Cockbain told Fox Sports as Kefu was on the operating table two months ago.</p>
<p>“When I went for scans on the shoulder the guy said ’Only people in car accidents get this kind of [injury]. That guy must have hit you hard,” he says.</p>
<p>Afflictions and blessings. Madi was born at 11pm that night and the anticipation of holding his newborn daughter helped numb the pain when Kefu caught the early flight home alone the next day.</p>
<p>Friends of the Kefu family tell the Herald they are a strong mob. Full of life and love and humour. Finding the funny side is getting them through.</p>
<p>“We’re a normal family, there’s plenty of banter. We laugh about a lot of the stuff that happened that night, it helps us. We’re all going all right.”</p>

<div>COVID chaos as Wallabies test positive and Super Rugby under a cloud</div>
<p>Rugby Australia is trying to repatriate five Wallabies personnel caught up in the spiralling coronavirus situation in the United Kingdom as the Omicron outbreak threatens to throw next year’s competition schedule into chaos.</p>
<p>Four players and one staff member are in isolation in Cornwall, in south-west England, after testing positive to COVID-19 in the final week of Australia’s four-week spring tour. All five are double-vaccinated and asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Three of the five were due to take a day-seven test on Monday morning, with a negative result allowing them to fly home on day 10, subject to flight availability and further testing.</p>
<p>The other two, both players, tested positive in London on Friday and will not be able to leave the country until December 6 at the earliest.</p>
<p>With the Omicron variant circling and federal and state authorities scrambling to formulate and co-ordinate their responses, RA staff and the Rugby Union Players Association are watching events closely.</p>
<p>Eight other Wallabies involved in the aborted Barbarians match against Manu Samoa made it out of the UK, and Dave Rennie, who assumed coaching duties last week, flew back to New Zealand for Christmas with his wife and children.</p>
<p>In South Africa it was a different story, with two United Rugby Championship clubs, Munster and Cardiff, stranded with positive cases in their squads.</p>
<p>The late drama unfolded as officials back home grappled with contingencies for Super Rugby Pacific, the trans-Tasman and Pacific competition slated to kick off in February.</p>
<p>Under the three-stage reopening plans set out last week, visiting teams would face a seven-day isolation period for the forseeable future, making weekly fixtures impossible.</p>
<p>Rugby Australia officials said a working group was meeting this week to map out the options but both sides were hoping there would be some sort of clarification forthcoming from the New Zealand government.</p>
<p>The international schedule is also under a cloud, with England due to play a three-Test series here in July and the Rugby Championship to follow straight after.</p>
<p>Super Rugby Pacific has scheduled Australian teams playing in NZ in February and March and vice-versa for Kiwi teams. The second round as proposed would have all teams playing in Melbourne.</p>
<div>Magnificent sevens: Women and men shine in Dubai</div>
<p>Australia’s women sevens champions have gone back to back on the world series and the Aussie men have claimed silver in Dubai overnight.</p>
<p>The women beat Fiji for a second week in a row to claim back to back world series victories, while the men fell just short of a major upset against South Africa, going down 10-7.</p>
<p>The Aussie women’s team has only claimed back-to-back wins on the world series three times since it began in 2012.</p>
<p>Charlotte Caslick led the way for the women for a second week in a row, earning a nod for impact player of the tournament, while Faith Nathan was named player of the final with a dominant performance and the opening try for Australia.</p>
<p>Nathan, Madison Ashby and Lily Dick were standouts in the 15-0 victory, which Australia notched despite going down a player in the second half.</p>
<p>“I could do better but we got the win and that’s all that matters,” Nathan said. “It’s absolutely unreal, especially going back-to-back ... big ups to Fiji who frigging gave it to us, which is good.”</p>
<p>In the absence of reigning Olympic champions New Zealand, the women dominated across both tournaments, held back to back in Dubai to kick off the 2021/22 world series.</p>
<p>After a disappointing fifth place finish at the Tokyo Olympics, it was a rousing return to the international stage and an important win for coach John Manenti, who was forced to reapply for his job in the lead up to Dubai.</p>
<p>“If people are patient, you’ll see where this group can go,” Manenti told the Herald from Dubai.</p>
<p>“Defence led the way, with only 12 tries conceded in 10 games over two weeks, whilst we managed 53 tries for the better. Two weeks I won’t forget.”</p>
<p>It was a huge result for the Aussie men, who have not won a world series tournament since 2018 and have not made a final since the 2019/20 series.</p>
<p>The Tim Walsh-coached group dominated the knockouts, with a 24-12 win over Ireland in the quarterfinal and a 40-0 win over Argentina in the semifinal.</p>
<p>Australia held a two-point lead over the Blitzboks at half-time after Corey Toole scored, but South Africa’s player of the final JC Pretorius broke the Aussie defence in the dying moments to claim the win 10-7.</p>
<p>Coach Walsh was also asked to reapply for his job after a disappointing Tokyo campaign but will have done his chances no harm, with interest in his services from rivals Fiji and USA Rugby.</p>
<div>Arnold homecoming at risk as Wallabies stall on contract</div>
<p>Rugby Australia are in talks to bring home world-class Wallaby Rory Arnold but could miss the boat if the giant second-rower re-signs in France this week.</p>
<p>RA’s five-person recruitment panel met on Monday to finalise the organisation’s targets, with Arnold’s return to the Wallabies and Brumbies one of the top discussion points.</p>
<p>But with Johnson’s future role unclear as RA starts a cost-cutting revamp of its high-performance program, the 31-year-old has not received an offer and could be forced to re-sign with Top 14 club Toulouse if one does not materialise.</p>
<p>Rennie appeared to have referenced Arnold when he later defended the use of Giteau Law exemptions, saying the opportunity to use players who did not meet the 60-Test threshold for offshore selection could help lure some home.</p>
<p>The Herald can confirm Arnold, off contract at the end of June next year, is RA’s main target and is open to returning to Australia and the Brumbies in time for England’s three-Test tour in July.</p>
<p>But with Toulouse also keen to keep the 29-Test forward, who plays there alongside brother Richie, RA is in a race to free up money and secure him before he re-signs in the next week.</p>
<p>RA’s recruitment panel, consisting of Rennie, Johnson, chief executive Andy Marinos, Wallabies manager Chris Webb and contracting manager Nick Taylor, met on Monday to finalise budget and their top targets.</p>
<p>Multiple sources have indicated Johnson, signed at great expense in 2018, will be retained by the organisation in a modified role.</p>
<p>He is trusted by Rennie and the other Wallabies coaches and staff - most of whom he recruited - but not universally respected by players or player agents.</p>
<div>Johnson’s time at the top is over as RA plots massive reforms</div>
<p>The most powerful man in Australian rugby and a close ally of Wallabies coach Dave Rennie is on the hunt for a new job as a major high-performance shake-up gathers pace.</p>
<p>The role, which Johnson occupied for three years on $550,000 a year, will be replaced by a chief high-performance officer.</p>
<p>Johnson’s departure will be welcomed in some quarters but lamented by Rennie and his Wallabies assistants, most of whom he recruited and worked closely with during the past two years.</p>
<p>Johnson was also one of three Wallabies selectors and was said to be the most frequent dissenting voice at the table, watching training and often challenging Rennie on personnel decisions.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Johnson’s influence has been controversial at times. A Wallabies and Waratahs assistant coach, he worked overseas for almost two decades, returning home to a rugby landscape vastly different from the one he left.</p>
<p>Players see agents as useful middle men in the contract negotiation process, particularly when dealing with Japanese and European clubs. They do not trust Rugby Australia or their Super Rugby employers to act with their best interests in mind.</p>
<p>But Johnson is also victim of the desperate finances of rugby. Hired by Castle pre-COVID-19 to support the Wallabies with structure and oversight that would outlive the fortunes of various coaches, Johnson is too expensive for RA.</p>
<p>The organisation was bailed out by loans from World Rugby during the height of the pandemic and can no longer afford to have more than $500,000 of precious revenue tied up in one role.</p>
<p>Johnson’s pivot – it is yet to be determined whether he will stay on as a selector or in another supportive role – will be just the start of the changes if McLennan and Marinos have their way.</p>
<p>They are plotting a wholesale centralisation of high performance, streamlining coaching and athletic development roles, ending the warehousing of players in the major nurseries of NSW and Queensland, and centralising the contracting of players.</p>
<p>It will require approval by a vote of all member unions, a stumbling block that could yet scupper the reforms with Queensland and NSW holding the majority of votes.</p>

<div>‘It’s a swap’: Manenti to take charge of men’s sevens, Johnson departs RA</div>
<div><div><h5>By Sam Phillips</h5><div>Updated <span><time>December 10, 2021 — 6.31am</time></span><span>first published at <time>6.00am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Rugby Australia has appointed current women’s sevens coach John Manenti as the new men’s sevens coach, completing a remarkable swap with his predecessor Tim Walsh.</p>
<p>The Herald on Monday revealed RA had offered the position of women’s coach to Walsh, sparking tension between the pair and leaving Manenti in the lurch despite claiming back-to-back world series wins in the last fortnight.</p>
<p>Both coaches agreed to take on their new roles after the weekend’s tournament in Dubai.</p>
<p>“Through the review and analysis, we just felt Tim was better suited in that program. He’s had previous success with it and for where that program is now, we just believe he’s better suited there,” Marinos said.</p>
<p>Marinos conceded there were some “uncomfortable” conversations with Manenti, in particular, after the Herald informed him Walsh was set to be appointed in his place.</p>
<p>“The uncomfortable nature of it was because we were still having conversations with coaches when all the news broke,” he said.</p>
<p>“He’s been really good, and Tim’s been really good with dealing with the switch that we now need to put into place.”</p>
<p>RA on Friday morning also confirmed the departure of director of rugby Scott Johnson from the organisation.</p>
<p>He will be replaced by a high-performance director, who will be charged with driving greater alignment between RA and the Super Rugby franchises.</p>
<p>“We’ve gone through a lot of work on high performance and the structure, and we’re going to be restructuring that whole department.</p>
<p>“We don’t feel we need a director of rugby, we need a high-performance manager to come into that role.</p>
<p>Johnson said he was confident in the future of Australian rugby after his three years in the role.</p>
<p>RA will begin the search for Johnson’s replacement next week.</p>
<div>Rennie’s ref run-in apology leaves questions unanswered</div>
<p>They’re a scary bunch, the folks at World Rugby. With the power to wipe out a coach or player from the game for weeks, months or even years, it is a brave figure who holds the line in opposition to rugby’s global governing body.</p>
<p>It looked like Dave Rennie might be the one. The Wallabies coach was measured and calm in his criticism of ″⁣the system″⁣ last week after a controversial loss to Wales ensured his first spring tour in charge ended in failure.</p>
<p>Unlike his Springboks counterpart Rassie Erasmus, whose wild spray and online skulduggery overshadowed any valid point he might have had about World Rugby’s lack of transparency and consistency.</p>
<p>Rennie played the ball, not the man, being careful in his post-match comments to ask for accountability, rather than attack the television match official, Marius Jonker.</p>
<p>He made the mistake of using the word ″⁣horrendous″⁣ in his first comments, on the field straight after the full-time whistle, and it was for this - and nothing else - that he apologised over the weekend.</p>
<p>This was a good result for the Wallabies, who have killed their risk of having Rennie suspended or the case dragged out, Erasmus-style. But it is a shame for fans that World Rugby once again escapes scrutiny for poor officiating.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is coaches act in isolation, responding in the heat of the moment and in opposition to each other. They back down when it is presented to them that a fine or ban is coming.</p>
<p>But it was hard not to have sympathy for his broad points about World Rugby’s opaque and futile feedback channels. Like Rennie, Erasmus had tried going through the front door and he also decided it got him nowhere.</p>
<p>World Rugby has a duty of care to its match officials. But it also has to wise up to the compounding effects of poor officiating and a TMO that appears to be inserting itself more and more into Tests.</p>
<p>It is killing the game as a spectacle and eroding trust. Anger in South Africa in reaction to Erasmus’s ban was universal and should concern the governing body.</p>
<p>The Herald has been told in World Rugby’s response that point was not even addressed. Faith, or a modicum of it, must be restored.</p>
<div>‘I wasn’t on a good trajectory’: How Australian rugby’s bad boy turned his life around</div>
<p>When asked if he minds the current phase of his international career being described as a “second act”, James O’Connor cannot help but laugh. “Oh, I like that!” he says.</p>
<p>The Wallabies playmaker is 31 now, but it is not simply the passing years that have matured him.</p>
<p>It was a bleak period, but the intervening time has at least allowed him to understand how and why it happened.</p>
<p>Kyle Sinckler and Danny Cipriani have credited Saviour World with helping their careers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are always looking for that next high and, if it is not coming on the rugby field, you look for it off it.”</p><cite>James O’Connor</cite></blockquote>
<p>The culture at Sale, overseen by Diamond, was hard but helpful to O’Connor, who thrived on being able to channel his energy exclusively on his rugby, away from off-field distractions.</p>
<p>“I think it was because I was so far from home - my focus was fully on rugby but not in a way that it was too demanding or thinking about it too much,” he says.</p>
<p>“I found a really nice balance at Sale where I could train hard, I enjoyed life away from footie and I really enjoyed turning up for training every day.”</p>
<p>Not that everything was to the taste of a player who grew up on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>“A lot of the rugby was tough – I am not going to lie. Living up in Manchester, my last season at Sale, there were only two games where it was dry,” he says with another chuckle.</p>
<p>O’Connor gives more credit to another Englishman for this second period of success – Dave Alred, the performance coach perhaps best known for his work with Jonny Wilkinson, helping to transform him into a place-kicking fly-half.</p>
<p>“Dave has been unreal. He has helped redefine my whole game. When I went back to Australia, I was a centre and I hadn’t kicked a ball in years,” he says. “We literally started from scratch.”</p>
<p>Life is certainly now mellower for O’Connor, who has been back with Queensland Reds since 2019. He has recently bought a house in Queensland, and spends his time hiking and spear-fishing in the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>He is also happy to share his experiences with young players coming up behind him, and helping them avoid the pitfalls that lie in wait - especially on social media.</p>
<p>“I really enjoy working with youths and also keep speaking truth and connecting a bit deeper than the artificial stuff you see on social media,” he says. “It is like a highlight reel, it is not real life anymore.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s expectations are so high that when they don’t reach them people are depressed and anxious, they are comparing themselves to an illusion.</p>
<p>“A big part of my comeback was not just about playing but giving back to rugby because it has done so much for me. I have been going to schools and helping through youth programmes, that is where I feel most connected.</p>
<p>“My advice is play the game because you love it, not to become famous, not because of the money. Play the game because you love it and that is how the guys who last in the game for longer think.”</p>

<div>Why Australian rugby’s razor gang must cut with care</div>
<p>The last time a razor gang went to work on rugby, it ended in a blazing row at an Australian embassy.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, you say. Castle presided over one of the most bloated Rugby Australia budgets of the past eight years. The razor gang had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But they did. The seeds of the 2019 dysfunction were planted six years earlier when Castle’s predecessor Bill Pulver gutted head office and negotiated a player pay cut to keep the professional game afloat.</p>
<p>Make cuts with care. Johnson was not the best fit for director of rugby but that does not mean there is anything wrong with the role itself. It works in Ireland and at plenty of professional clubs in Japan and England.</p>
<p>There are two big money-making opportunities ahead for Australian rugby. The 2025 British and Irish Lions series and a potential 2027 World Cup at home.</p>
<p>If administrators get this next six months of planning right, then by the time the Lions arrive, RA could be in a position to start rebuilding the game. By 2027, it could be banking a small profit for future generations.</p>
<div>Hunter Paisami re-signs with Wallabies and Queensland</div>
<p>Wallabies centre Hunter Paisami has re-signed with Queensland and Australia through until the next World Cup in a major boost to Dave Rennie’s 2022 campaign.</p>
<p>With Rennie and Rugby Australia still processing the fallout from this year’s messy Giteau Law experiment, Paisami’s commitment means the Reds enforcer will be on hand when the Wallabies welcome England for three Tests in July.</p>
<p>Other key Test targets are still in play, including Brumbies prop and Wallabies captain James Slipper and France-based second rower Rory Arnold, who is in talks to return to Canberra.</p>
<p>But Queensland are shoring up their big guns for the next two years. Paisami, 23, joins James O’Connor, Taniela Tupou, Filipo Daugunu, Tate McDermott, Fraser McReight and Harry Wilson at Ballymore for the forseeable future.</p>
<p>Paisami has been a beneficiary of former Reds and Wallabies centre Samu Kerevi’s move overseas, claiming his spot in Dave Rennie’s Test line-up in 2020 when Kerevi was playing in Japan.</p>
<p>He has gone on to feature in 15 of the 20 Test line-ups Rennie has named over the past two seasons, making way for Kerevi during the Rugby Championship, but reclaiming his spot in the midfield against Japan and in Europe last month.</p>
<p>In only his second season of professional rugby, Paisami has built a reputation for brutal defensive hits and a strong ball-carrying game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Queensland Rugby Union has weighed into the debate over Rugby Australia’s centralisation plans.</p>
<div>Rugby year in review: Cooper’s comeback a golden moment in another controversial season</div>
<p>Rugby rarely fails to disappoint when it comes to headlines and remarkable storylines.</p>
<p>After the COVID-19 chaos of 2020, this year had plenty of drama on and off the field in a season that provided a little more stability.</p>
<h3>Word of the year: Giteau</h3>
<p>Scott Johnson, after three years as Australia’s director of rugby, has been squeezed out. His role is now defunct, with RA replacing it with a “chief high-performance officer”.</p>
<p>The Waratahs went winless in a season for the first time and sacked coach Rob Penney midway through the campaign. New coach Darren Coleman will need his chargers to show improvement, and fast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there wasn’t much joy for the Australian sevens teams at the Tokyo Olympics. The women’s and men’s teams bombed out in the quarter-finals against Fiji.</p>
<p>Marika Koroibete, Isi Naisarani and Pone Fa’amausili were also stood down from Bledisloe selection after a late-night hotel drinking session.</p>
<h3>Viral moments of the year</h3>
<p>Cooper’s match-winning penalty against South Africa will be played for years to come. The calmness he exuded after it went over was in stark contrast to his screaming teammates who couldn’t believe what they’d just seen.</p>
<div>Wallabies great David Pocock to run for the Senate</div>
<p>“Seeing the way Australia was represented at COP26 was really frustrating and, frankly, pretty hard to stomach. That really reaffirmed and highlighted the need for better political leadership.”</p>
<p>The 33-year-old rugby union great, who played 83 tests for the Wallabies and captained the side in 2012, hung up his professional boots last year, resolving to dedicate his time to fighting for more ambitious action on climate change.</p>
<p>He says Australians are being “failed on climate”, and sees independents as key to the solution.</p>
<p>Pocock has lived in Canberra since 2012 but running as an independent for the ACT, where voters have elected one Liberal and one Labor representative since 1975, involves a fair degree of aspiration.</p>
<p>To be successful, he will need to take a seat off either Labor’s Katy Gallagher or Liberal Zed Seselja in a field that includes constitutional law expert Kim Rubenstein, who is also running as an independent.</p>
<p>His environmental bona fides and high profile would make him an attractive candidate for the established parties, particularly the Greens, but he insists he does not want to be beholden to a party machine.</p>
<p>“The reason I’m running as an independent [is] to be able to represent my community and not have to toe a party line that’s out of step with what they want,” he says.</p>
<p>Pocock says Labor’s target is a “good step in the right direction” but declines to be drawn on how he would vote on the issue as a crossbencher, saying his focus is on consulting Canberrans on what they want from a senator.</p>
<p>Pocock’s progressive platform extends beyond climate change, including wanting to see a restoration of the ACT’s legislative rights, and a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to federal Parliament.</p>
<p>“The Uluru statement from the heart is just such an incredibly generous offer from First Nations Australians to actually begin the process of truth and reconciliation. I think it’s well overdue,” he says.</p>

<p>Nick Ryan has farewelled 13 players and a head coach from Sydney University Football Club since the end of the aborted 2021 Shute Shield competition.</p>
<p>Thirteen players from one club in Australian rugby’s third tier to clubs in Europe, Japan, the United States and Italy. That’s almost enough to populate a starting line-up.</p>
<p>It is against this backdrop, with players leaving in their late teens and early 20s, that Wallabies coach Dave Rennie and RA’s rugby committee are trying to modernise Australia’s eligibility rules.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly different from a lot of years ago when players went overseas at the end of their careers,” Rennie tells the Herald.</p>
<p>For a long time selection was simple. When players signed overseas they did so knowing they were surrendering any claim to the gold jersey.</p>
<p>By the time RA announced this year’s Giteau Law experiment, it was widely acknowledged the system needed tweaking. That its results were mixed has only muddied the waters for the rugby committee, with views varying on which way it should go.</p>
<p>Rennie rejects this position outright, both to protect the quality and marketability of Super Rugby and to protect high performance.</p>
<p>“There needs to be some limitation to it. The World Cup’s the ultimate and if you can pick wholesale from overseas then that may have an effect on the amount of guys who actually stay here and play,” he says.</p>
<p>“That’s the motivation to try to get some guys home, which means that if we’re picking some guys from a Giteau perspective, the numbers are smaller.”</p>
<p>Ryan, who has worked in Super Rugby and is now back at club level, believes a “whole of game strategy” is needed. Rennie agrees.</p>
<p>No ‘Kerevi Law’ in the pipeline then, to make sure Samu Kerevi, Australia’s peerless 38-Test centre, is on hand when England arrive for three Tests in July.</p>

<div>Derbies to be front-loaded in Super Rugby Pacific’s COVID reshuffle</div>
<p>Derby matches will feature in the first half of Super Rugby Pacific as New Zealand Rugby and Rugby Australia revamp the competition draw due to the latest threat posed by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Although several venues are still to be confirmed, the inaugural competition is set to be front-loaded with derbies in New Zealand and Australia through to mid-April. The draw may be released through official channels as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>The original draw for the competition had the opening round slated to start on February 18, and that is expected to remain. The Crusaders, who have always been scheduled to meet the Highlanders in Christchurch, will not have to alter their plans.</p>
<p>Venues for derby games aren’t expected to change and NZ Rugby and Rugby Australia are still hoping there will be one competition with the top eight teams qualifying for the playoffs over three weeks.</p>
<p>The final is still set for June 18.</p>
<p>The fresh 12-team competition will include Moana Pasifika and the Fiji Drua for the first time. The Fiji Drua will compete in the Australian competition.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s border is slated to open to vaccinated non-Kiwis at the end of April. Soaring Omicron cases rise in Australia, however, could make this deadline difficult to put in place.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the New Zealand Government announced plans to allow fully vaccinated Kiwis and residents to enter New Zealand from Australia, without requiring managed isolation, had been pushed back from mid-January until at least the end of February.</p>
