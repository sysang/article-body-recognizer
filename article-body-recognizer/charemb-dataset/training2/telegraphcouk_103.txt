<header> <h1> Chris Packham: ‘As it turns out, octopuses are complete escape artists’ </h1> <p> A hotel stay in Spain with an unusual guest set Chris Packham on a course to become a television conservationist </p> </header>

<header> <h1> Paul Young: 'I could be talked into backpacking in Vietnam or Thailand' </h1> <p> The prolific singer on driving in California, surfing on plywood and falling off stage </p> </header>
<div> <div> <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:00am </time> </div> </div>
<h2>Going abroad on holiday wasn’t in the running when I was a kid</h2>
<p>We’d go to Devon and Cornwall and stay in a mobile holiday home, in and around Newquay. We’d pony-ride and I was told I’d surf, but it was more like bodyboarding. My brother and I would lie on a plywood board and surf the waves.</p>
<h2>The first city I fell in love with was Paris</h2>
<p>I thought it was the best place in the world when I got famous and was travelling there a lot for work.</p>
<h2>When ‘Everytime You Go Away’ topped the American charts, I travelled around the United States</h2>
<h2>That spurred me on to take the family there on an RV trip in 1995</h2>
<a>Arizona</a>, New Mexico, the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly. At Elephant Butte, we hired boats and skied, and there were beautiful places with natural rivers to swim in.
<h2>My love for cooking comes from touring, specifically in New Orleans</h2>
<h2>Italy became a favourite country when I had success there</h2>
<p>Since I duetted with Zucchero on Senza Una Donna, it hasn’t really mattered where I am – if there’s an Italian restaurant I want to go to, I say my name and they ask, “The Paul Young?” – and that’s it.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to know if travelling with children following the latest rule changes.</p>
<h2>What are the rules for unvaccinated under-18s returning to England?</h2>
<p>Children aged 4 and under do not need to take any Covid tests before their journey to England. On arrival, they must quarantine until their parent or guardian receives their day 2 test result. </p>
<p>Those aged 12 to 17 must take a test in the two days before they travel to England, just as all adults do. This can be a lateral flow or PCR test. </p>
<p>Here we break down the specific rules for England depending on a child's age:</p>
<li>Do not have to take any Covid-19 tests for travel to England</li>
<li>Can be included on the passenger locator form of an adult they are travelling with, if they are staying at the same address</li>
<li>Must quarantine until their responsible adult receives their day 2 test result back.</li>
<li>Must take a day two PCR test after their arrival in England. The test must be taken on or before day two – arrival day is day 0. They must self-isolate until they receive a negative result.</li>
<li>Can be included on the passenger locator form of an adult they are travelling with, if they are staying at the same UK address</li>
<li>Do not need to take a pre-arrival Covid test to travel to England</li>
<li>Must take a day two PCR test after their arrival in England. The test must be taken on or before day two – arrival day is day 0. They must self-isolate until they receive until a negative result.</li>
<li>Must take a pre-arrival Covid test to travel to England, in the two days prior to the journey.</li>
<p>Other travel rules can differ for return to the devolved nations. It is advisable to check their government websites and the <a>UK's government advice</a>.</p>
<h2>Do any countries not permit entry to unvaccinated under-18s?</h2>
<p>A handful of countries have strict entry rules for children who aren't fully vaccinated. Among these are:</p>
<p>Requires 12-18 year olds to be fully vaccinated before arrival. Children aged five to 11 can enter Malta if accompanied by vaccinated parents or legal guardians, provided they show a negative PCR test carried out within 72 hours of travel. </p>
<p>Other nations have similar rules in place: check the FCDO page of the country to which you plan to travel for the latest guidance.</p>
<h2>What about rules on the ground when you’re on holiday?</h2>
<p>Other countries where such passes are a factor include: Switzerland, Greece, Germany, Austria, Italy, Cyprus, among others. Always check the entry rules of the country you are travelling to before committing to booking. </p>
<header> <h1> ‘Jewface’ row: Helen Mirren shouldn’t be playing Golda Meir, says Maureen Lipman </h1> <p> Jewish actress says the role of the former Israeli leader should not have been given to a gentile - a non-Jew </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Anita Singh, Arts and Entertainment Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Dame Helen Mirren has been drawn into the debate over <a>“Jewface” casting</a> after Dame Maureen Lipman said the actress should not be allowed to play Golda Meir.</p>
<p>In her latest film, <a>Golda</a>, Dame Helen portrays the Israeli leader during the Yom Kippur War of 1973.</p>
<p>Dame Maureen said that the part should not have been given to a non-Jew, and told the Jewish Chronicle that she was uncomfortable with the casting.</p>
<p>“With that I disagree, because the Jewishness of the character is so integral,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m sure she will be marvellous, but it would never be allowed for Ben Kingsley to play Nelson Mandela. You just couldn’t even go there.”</p>
<p>A publicity image for the film showed Dame Helen transformed through prosthetic make-up to play Meir, who served as the fourth prime minister of Israel from 1969-74.</p>
<a> told the Telegraph last month</a> that she “probably shouldn’t” have played a Jewish mother in Channel 4’s Friday Night Dinner because she is a practising Christian, albeit one with Jewish ancestry.
<p><a>Patrick Marber</a>, the playwright who recently directed <a>Sir Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt</a>, takes the opposite view.</p>
<p>He told the Jewish Chronicle that he hated the idea of “lived experience” <a>being critical to casting decisions</a>.</p>
<p>“I really want us Jews to fight our corner, but to not be exclusive and excluding. I want us Jews to be liberal-minded and generous.</p>
<p>“I think a gentile can play a Jew and a Jew can play a gentile. I don’t like it when someone plays a Jew and gets it wrong. [But] I don’t like quotas. I don’t like laws. I think we should be better than that, we Jews.”</p>
<p>Elliot Levey, who is currently playing a German Jew <a>in Cabaret in the West End</a>, said: “The notion of people showing their papers to authenticate Jewish ancestry in order to justify playing a Jewish role is a dystopian nightmare.”</p>
<p>“Right now, representation matters. It has to also finally matter for Jews as well, especially Jewish women.”</p>
<p>Her previous films include Woman in Gold, the true story of Maria Altmann, an Austrian-American Jewish refugee who fought to retrieve family heirlooms stolen by the Nazis.</p>
<p>In The Debt, she played a retired Mossad agent. While promoting that film, she was asked by the New York Times if she might be “a secret Jew” yet to discover her heritage.</p>
<p>The actress also joked that her “love of sparkle” might be an indication of hidden Jewish roots.</p>
<p>Dame Helen has Russian heritage - she was born Ilynea Lydia Mironoff, and her father changed the family name by deed poll several years later.</p>

<header> <h1> When is the next Covid travel update, and what rules can we expect to change? </h1> <p> Costly and stressful testing requirements could be reduced or even scrapped in this week’s travel update </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Featherstone <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:42am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The UK’s tougher testing stipulations have been in place since December 7; an update is due on January 5.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in the Covid update on January 4 that booster vaccines are likely to be needed for travel to many countries within weeks.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said the travel requirement was likely to become "the norm" very soon, adding that it would be "very much to people's advantage" to take up the jabs.</p>

<a>tightened their borders</a> following the discovery, and spread of, omicron. 
<p>It should also be noted that travel rules are not necessarily UK-wide. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can decide on differing regulations. That said, they have largely remained the same across the four nations.</p>
<h2>What changes can we expect in the latest update?</h2>
<p>Pre-departure <a>tests for travel to the UK</a> could be axed following the January 5 update.</p>
<p>A number of senior figures in the Government are pushing for this test requirement to be dropped, with ministers insisting that the rapid spread of the omicron variant has made it <a>pointless</a>. </p>
<p>Day 2 PCRs, and the requirement to self-isolate until testing negative, could also be reconsidered. </p>
<h2>What are the current rules? </h2>
<p>All travellers aged 12 or over must take a <a>Covid-19</a> test (this can be a lateral flow) in the two days before travel to the UK, regardless of vaccination status. Children under 12 are exempt from this test. </p>
<p>Arrivals aged five or over must take a PCR test on or before Day 2. Under-18s and fully vaccinated adults must self-isolate at their accommodation until they receive a negative result (they can leave to take the test). </p>

<div> <div> By Emma Beaumont, Assistant Content Editor and Greg Dickinson, Senior Travel Writer <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:31pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The testing rules for fully vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK have been eased in the latest travel review.</p>
<p>The news follows the removal of all 11 countries from the red list last month, meaning no arrivals are currently subject to a 10-day stay in a quarantine hotel. </p>
<p>More hurdles remain for the unvaccinated, who must take a pre-departure test, enter a 10-day quarantine on return, and take two PCR tests. Some countries will also impose a quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know about international travel, from testing requirements to paperwork and quarantine.</p>
<h2>Which countries can I travel to?</h2>
<p>The UK Government has removed the 11 countries placed on its travel red list. If you are fully vaccinated you can currently travel to any country or territory without having to enter quarantine for 10 days on your return.</p>
<p>If you are not fully vaccinated, you must enter 10 days of self-isolation on return to the UK, with two further tests on days two and eight. The only country that unvaccinated Britons can return from, without quarantine, is Ireland. </p>
<h2>Are all countries letting in Britons?</h2>
<p>All countries have their own requirements on testing, vaccination certification, quarantine and other documentation. Many nations are welcoming Britons, although some have border restrictions prohibiting Britons from entry. </p>
<p>As the omicron variant continues to spread countries are tightening rules at their borders – France has banned all non-essential travel from the United Kingdom, while Austria has made a Covid booster mandatory for entry.</p>
<p>Check the destination’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) <a>page</a> to find out if you can go.</p>
<h2>Do I need to take a test before I travel?</h2>
<p>This depends on the destination. If there is a requirement, it is typically a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before travel/arrival – some countries, including the US, also accept rapid tests. </p>
<p>Many countries accept a vaccine certificate instead of proof of a negative test. Check the destination’s FCDO <a>page</a> before you go. </p>
<h2>Do I need to take a test after arriving home?</h2>
<a>Test to Release</a>, you can take a second test on day five to exit quarantine (if your result is negative), but will still need to take the further test on day eight.
<h2>What are the rules for under 18s?</h2>
<p>Some other countries have imposed bans, quarantine or other stringent rules on unvaccinated children and teenagers. <a>Read about them all here</a>.</p>
<h2>What paperwork do I need for travel?</h2>
<p>Some countries will also request vaccination certificates, or proof of a recent negative test result, in order to enter indoor venues like bars and restaurants – such as France and Italy.</p>
<p>To return to the UK, you must fill in a <a>Passenger Locator Form</a>. Make sure you have a code for your day two test booking, otherwise you will not be able to submit the form.</p>
<h2>What travel insurance do I need?</h2>
<p>Most insurance companies offer some degree of Covid cover. Check our <a>Covid insurance guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>I live in another country, can I enter the UK?</h2>
<p>It depends where you live, and whether you are vaccinated or not.</p>
<p>The UK recognises vaccines administered in other countries including the 27 EU states, certain non-EU European states, plus the United States, Canada, and a number of other long-haul destinations. </p>
<p>All arrivals will however still need to take a pre-departure test, as well as a test on day two and isolate until a negative result is confirmed (more details above). </p>

<header> <h1> Red list countries: which destinations have been removed? </h1> <p> All 11 countries have been dropped from the red list, ending the need for travellers to hotel quarantine on their arrival in the UK </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lucy Aspden, Content Editor and Emma Beaumont, Assistant Content Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:36pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The UK Government removed all 11 countries from the travel red list in December 2021.</p>
<p>All unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and then self isolate for 10 days at home, as well as taking day two and day eight PCR tests.</p>
<p>While no countries are currently subject to hotel quarantine, ministers will not abandon the concept of a red list due to concerns it could be needed in the face of any future variants.</p>
<p>A fine continues to enforce the testing system for other arrivals from non-red list countries. Travellers arriving from any country could be fined £500 if they do not have a valid test result.</p>
<header> <h1> How will Covid travel restrictions affect my winter sun or ski holiday? </h1> <p> UK testing requirements have been eased. Here's what the latest rules mean for holidays </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Beaumont, Assistant Content Editor ; Hazel Plush and Greg Dickinson, Senior Travel Writer <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:05pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The winter holiday season was thrown into disarray with the emergency of the omicron variant. However, the UK Government has now rolled back the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the highly contagious variant. </p>
<p>And for anyone hoping to travel into the UK from sub Saharan Africa this Christmas, all 11 countries were dropped from the red list last month, ending the need for travellers to enter hotel quarantine on their arrival in the UK.</p>
<p>However, France continues to ban UK citizens or residents entering for non-essential reasons, meaning thousands of British travellers have had to rethink skiing holiday plans.</p>
<a>testing requirements</a>. Spain is no longer accepting unvaccinated British tourists. Austria now requires proof of vaccination, a booster and a negative PCR test in order to visit.
<p>Here is everything you need to know about how the latest travel restrictions could affect your next holiday. </p>
<h2>What are the new rules for testing?</h2>
<p>Anyone who tests positive must then take a confirmatory PCR test and isolate for 10 days – fully vaccinated travellers can cut this short if they take a negative lateral flow test on day six and seven of their isolation.</p>
<p>The rules are unchanged for the unvaccinated, who must take a pre-departure test, enter a 10-day quarantine on return, and take two PCR tests. Some countries will also impose a quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals.</p>
<h2>What are the latest red list travel rules?</h2>
<p>South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Angola and Nigeria have been removed from the red list. </p>
<p>This means that anyone arriving from these countries will no longer be subject to hotel quarantine restrictions. </p>
<h2>Have any other countries imposed new rules?</h2>
<a>France imposed a ban</a> on all British arrivals visiting the country for non-essential reasons. Germany also introduced a ban on UK arrivals on December 19, but it has now been rescinded. 
<h2>Are countries reintroducing lockdowns?</h2>
<p>Yes. A fourth wave of Covid-19 <a>has prompted further clampdowns across the Continent</a>. Austria had been put in temporary national lockdown amid a rise in Covid-19 cases, but this has since been lifted for the fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>As of December 19, <a>the Netherlands went into a strict lockdown</a> – with the closure applying to all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places.</p>
<p>Slovakia, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic are among the countries to clamp down on freedoms for unvaccinated visitors and residents. </p>
<h2>I am nervous about my winter holiday, what can I do?</h2>
<p>If you have booked a winter, holiday, you may still be feeling nervous about what the omicron variant could mean for your getaway.</p>
<p>France announced a <a>travel ban</a> for all non-essential travel from the UK, following the omicron wave. As only French citizens will be allowed from Britain, many holidaymakers are having to postpone or cancel their winter ski trips.</p>
<p>Since midnight Saturday 18 December (France time) or 11pm on Friday 17 December, people have been unable to travel for touristic or professional reasons.</p>
<p>What's more Austria has also tightened its restrictions on Britons. Arrivals must show proof of a second vaccine dose, a booster jab and a PCR test taken within 48 hours of departure.</p>
<p>There are <a>some ski resorts which remain open to British travellers</a> – so if you're looking to book your trip to the slopes, look at travel to one of the following countries below.</p>
<p>Switzerland: Travellers hoping to visit Switzerland must show proof of a full vaccination certificate, as well as a negative test result taken no more than 72 hours before travel.</p>
<p>The US: Fully vaccinated Britons are welcome to travel to the US (under 18s are exempt from needing to be double jabbed) but they must present proof of a negative test.</p>

<h1> The forgotten country that's home to some of Europe's best skiing – and still open to Britons </h1>
<p> With France closed and rules tightening in the Alps, this could be the winter to discover skiers’ secret, Slovakia </p>
<div> <div> By Peter Hardy <time> 30 December 2021 • 10:53am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Very simply, our Prime Minister had just announced without any prior warning that any returning traveller to the UK must provide a negative Covid test – not less than 48 hours old – before arrival in Britain.</p>
<p>My thoughts turn instead towards Eastern Europe, which as a ski destination in general, I have repeatedly slated over many years in these pages. I am not a huge fan.</p>
<p>The Wall came down 32 years ago and the post-Soviet despondency of broken lifts and hand-me-down equipment has long been consigned to history. But in reality, many of these resorts have never truly moved on with a new mindset. </p>
<p>There is, however, one resounding exception: the resort of Jasna in Slovakia.</p>
<p>Don’t be deterred by the resort’s rather over-honest assessment of its impeccably prepared pistes: less than 50km. The majority of Alpine resorts continue to wildly inflate their figures.</p>
<p>Dragon’s Lair whole chalet costs from €546pp BB, including ski rental and resort transfers. Half-term (Feb 13 2022) apartment prices for a family of four (children under 12 years) start from €531pp, including dinner. </p>

<p>But while we slumped before the adventures of Phileas Fogg, a simple question of intrigued wanderlust probably emerged more than any other: “Around the world in 80 days without a plane, eh? Could that really be done these days?”</p>
<p>It’s still worth looking into more closely, though, because we might as well dream about travelling again. So, around the world in 80 days, 2022-style, without taking a plane: how hard can it be?</p>
<p>There, done. Very much estimated cost of the journey in 2021 (assuming there was no pandemic, and with a modest daily spend, and including the pint): £5,174. Get saving.</p>

<h1> Another new Nordic airline is helping bring back low-cost long-haul flights </h1>
<p> Norse is the latest in a clutch of new airlines making post-pandemic transatlantic travel more affordable – with UK-US flights set for 2022 </p>
<div> <div> By Emma Featherstone <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Long-haul travel is ready for a resurgence in 2022. International tourist arrivals in July-September 2021 remained 64 per cent below the same period in 2019, despite the widespread roll out of vaccinations and the reopening of most borders. </p>
<p>The bosses of a clutch of new low-cost, long-haul airlines are banking on such pent-up demand.</p>
<a>Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority</a>. Its first flights from Oslo are set to depart this spring.
<p>“We are now one important step closer to launching our attractive and affordable flights between Europe and the US,” said its chief executive and founder Bjørn Tore Larsen as the accolade was announced.</p>
<p>Norse is planning UK-US flights for later in 2022. </p>
<p>Budget challengers are already lined up, however, including <a>Icelandic airline PLAY</a>, which put UK-US flights on sale last month. So what sets Norse apart from the competition? Here’s everything we know so far.</p>
<h2>Where will it fly to? </h2>
<p>The start-up carrier will kick off its operations with flights from Oslo to the US. However, it plans to start routes from the UK to the States later in 2022. </p>
<p>US Department of Transportation records show that it will fly to smaller American airports, including Fort Lauderdale, New York Stewart and Ontario in California. These routes were previously popular for Norwegian Air (more on this below).</p>
<p>Norse will be focusing solely on long-haul connections. Indeed, the word ‘Atlantic’ in its name certainly hints at a dedication to services between Europe and the United States.</p>
<h2>What does the fleet look like?</h2>
<p>Norse is to run 15 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The same set of planes were used by Norwegian, which announced in January 2021 that it would be scrapping its budget transatlantic routes.</p>
<a>told Telegraph Travel</a> last year that the airline had secured the planes “at about half the lease rate [of that paid by Norwegian], which is a significant cost reduction.” 
<p>Among the Norse fleet, 12 planes will have 56 premium economy seats and 282 economy seats. The remaining three aircraft will have 32 premium economy spots and 259 economy.</p>
<h2>How much will flights cost? </h2>
<p>This is still to be revealed. PLAY’s standard one-way ticket from London to the US is £169, but, unlike Norse’s offering, comes with the catch of a layover in Iceland. </p>
<p>Norse’s destination airports may also prove more attractive to British holidaymakers (PLAY is flying to Boston and Baltimore, initially). </p>
<p>JetBlue, another airline to launch transatlantic routes during the pandemic, has London to New York flights from around £500 one way. </p>
<h2>What can you expect on board? </h2>
<p>Mr Larsen told Telegraph Travel in September that Norse would “offer attractive and affordable flights to the leisure traveller and the cost-conscious business traveller.”</p>
<p>It will not offer any lie-flat business class seats, he confirmed at an aviation conference last month. </p>
<p>The connections between Norse and Norwegian (senior figures from Norwegian have been involved in the launch of Norse) offer further clues. </p>
<p>When Norwegian started its UK-US flights back in 2015, food, drink, blankets and headsets all came with an extra cost.</p>
<p>A premium economy ticket with Norse is likely to offer a roomier seat, some complementary food and drink and perhaps a more generous luggage allowance.</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on the Government to reduce the<a> Covid testing</a> burden on holidaymakers when international travel rules are reviewed on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Some travel industry insiders are calling for pre-departure tests to be scrapped entirely and day 2 PCR tests to be downgraded to rapid tests, with rules requiring arrivals to self-isolate until they receive their result to end.</p>
<p>Travel consultant Paul Charles tweeted that though he expected the requirement to take a test before returning to the UK be axed, arrival test rules should also be eased. </p>
<p>“These particular measures kill off inbound business and leisure travel and still cost a small fortune on top of the trip itself. LFT (lateral flow) tests are good enough,” he wrote.</p>

<h3>Boris Johnson holds press conference as daily cases exceed 200,000 for first time</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson is holding a coronavirus press conference alongside Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser.</p>
<p>It comes after a record number of cases were recorded, with 218,724 infections logged on Tuesday, although this was subject to reporting delays over Christmas and New Year.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said there was "nothing in the data" at this point to justify any further restrictions beyond the current Plan B measures.</p>
<h3>A further 1,200 flights cancelled in the US</h3>
<p>Staff shortages and bad weather on the US East Coast meant airlines scrubbed more than 1,200 flights on Tuesday, down on the 3,200 cancelled on Monday.</p>
<p>Southwest Airlines alone cancelled more than 300 flights, or 10% of its schedule. </p>
<p>About 2,700 US flights were cancelled on Saturday and a similar number were grounded on Sunday. Thousands more were delayed. In all, about 20,000 US flights have been scrapped since Christmas Eve, according to FlightAware figures.</p>

<h3>Germany lifts ban on UK arrivals – but France refuses to follow suit</h3>
<p>A reminder that Germany today lifted its mandatory quarantine for all UK arrivals, introduced last month in response to the rapid spread of the omicron variant. With omicron now dominant in Germany, the measures were deemed unnecessary. </p>
<p>Vaccinated Britons can now enter Germany with no need to isolate, but those who are not jabbed must still quarantine for 10 days (or five days with a negative test). </p>
<p>But France, where omicron is also dominant, continues to ban all British tourists – a move that is causing consternation in the country's ski resorts. </p>
