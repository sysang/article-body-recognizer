<p>NFL coaches are taking precautions beyond the league’s COVID-19 protocols to help ensure players are available for games.</p>
<p>The league and the NFL Players Association revised protocols on Tuesday, reducing isolation time for players who test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic, including unvaccinated players, to five days from 10.</p>
<p>The league also has implemented restrictions on players eating together, limited number of occupants in the weight room to 15, and is requiring masks be worn by all players and staff indoors at team facilities.</p>
<p>As teams fight for playoff berths and positioning, the virus forces them to tackle another opponent.</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers (8-7) were among the teams who chose to meet virtually Wednesday. </p>
<p>“Our team, we all don’t prefer Zoom,” Niners coach Kyle Shanahan said. “People know what’s at stake with the chances of us losing guys for these games, so it wasn’t a hard issue at all going Zoom.”</p>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles (8-7) had quarterbacks and specialists meet virtually but other position groups met in person. </p>
<p>The league is encouraging even fully vaccinated staff and players to avoid public areas including restaurants, bars and social gatherings. It’s not a mandate but it’s another extra step some team leaders will emphasize.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings (7-8) got back running back Dalvin Cook from the COVID-19 list on Wednesday after he missed a loss to the Rams.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians turned the team over to assistant Harold Goodwin after he tested positive on Tuesday. The Buccaneers (11-4) placed cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting on the COVID-19 list on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos, who started a wide receiver at quarterback last season due to COVID-19, are isolating practice squad QB Anthony Gordon, and are holding virtual meetings. </p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills (9-6) have been holding virtual meetings for a couple weeks, and coach Sean McDermott has held most practices outdoors, where players are considered less susceptible to transmit the virus.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken about as many precautions as you can take,” McDermott said. </p>
<p>The Tennessee Titans (10-5) protected practice squad QB Kevin Hogan but aren’t quarantining other quarterbacks. They have 11 total players on the COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>While the league and the players’ union have worked together to update protocols to ensure the season is played uninterrupted, teams know taking extra measures is helpful even though it’s not optimal.</p>
