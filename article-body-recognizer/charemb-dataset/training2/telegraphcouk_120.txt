<h1> Kieran Trippier agrees to join Newcastle United as Saudi money triggers January shopping spree at St James' Park </h1>
<p> Atlético Madrid full-back to become Eddie Howe's fist signing since the manager joined Newcastle United following recent Saudi takeover </p>
<div> <div> By Luke Edwards <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Kieran Trippier will become the first signing of the new Saudi Arabian era at Newcastle United in an excellent start to their transfer window.</p>
<p>The size of the fee has been the source of some confusion and although Newcastle have claimed the cost is just £12 million that figure will rise in the summer when add-ons obligations are met.</p>
<p>One of these is an extra payment if Newcastle avoid relegation – money the club's hierarchy will be more than happy to pay given the devastating impact relegation would have.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old is likely to be the first of six new faces to arrive for Howe with a left-back, two centre-backs, a central midfield player and a striker also wanted.</p>
<p>“We are close on a few things, but this is football and you never know what is going to happen until they are actually signed.”</p>
<p>One of the next targets will be Everton full-back Lucas Digne. <a>The Frenchman has fallen out with Everton manager Rafael Benítez </a>and Newcastle are hoping that deal could progress quickly.</p>
<p><a>Newcastle are also considering a bid for Diego Carlos</a>, the Sevilla centre-back, as they look at alternatives to Sven Botman. </p>
<p>Botman had been first choice, although Lille are reluctant to sell and informed the Magpies he was not for sale earlier this week.</p>
<h1> What Newcastle have to do in the January transfer window to stay in the Premier League </h1>
<p> A shortlist was finalised in December and the club are now working through it with first, second and third choices for each position </p>
<div> <div> By Luke Edwards <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:08pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Newcastle United have been planning for this month almost from the moment the takeover by a Saudi Arabian consortium was completed at the start of October.</p>
<p>But what are Newcastle looking to do this month and where does Howe want the squad to be improved?</p>
<h2>A sensible start to build a solid base</h2>
<p>Newcastle have agreed <a>to sign England international Kieran Trippier</a> from Atlético Madrid, with the full-back poised to become the first signing of the new era.</p>
<p>Howe has worked with Trippier before, signing him from Manchester City’s Academy when he was manager of Burnley and the two have an excellent relationship.</p>
<p>It is not a showbiz signing, but it is a statement of intent and shows common sense is behind much of the recruitment strategy.</p>
<h2>A mobile ball-playing centre-back and rock alongside him</h2>
<p>Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandes and Fabian Schar are all similar players in that they are vulnerable against players running at or in behind and are slow to turn.</p>
<p>This has forced Newcastle to play a deep defensive line, usually with two defensive midfielders in front of them to offer maximum protection. All three of the above are also in their 30s and are not getting any better with age.</p>
<p>Howe does not want his team to play like that but in opening them up into a more expansive, attacking game, Newcastle have conceded far too many goals. It was a problem Rafa Benitez and Steve Bruce both wrestled with before him.</p>
<p>The plan is to change that, with Howe looking for a centre-back who is good on the ball and can carry it out of defence as well as one who is dominant in the air and is a good organiser alongside him.</p>
<p>Sven Botman of Lille was one of their first choice targets and still is, but the <a>French club are reluctant to sell the highly-rated Dutchman</a> and have said this week that the 21-year-old is not for sale at any price.</p>
<p>That is a blow, although the deal is not entirely dead as the player is keen on the move and Newcastle could see if a firm bid of £30 million changes their mind. At the moment, though, it seems unlikely. </p>
<p>If Trippier was the priority, Newcastle are also very keen to sign a new left-back who is equally good going forward.</p>
<p>Jamal Lewis’ improvement under Howe boded well before his hamstring injury and this has perhaps lessened the sense of urgency, but Newcastle are still actively pursuing players in this position.</p>
<p>Digne, though, is available to buy after falling out with Benitez at Everton and it could make sense to both clubs given a replacement for him has already been signed, <a>in Vitaliy Mykolenko</a>, on Merseyside.</p>
<p>However, since the takeover, targets have become more ambitious and although it is not being pursued at this stage a loan deal to bring Georginio Wijnaldum back to Newcastle from Paris St-Germain could be looked at later in the window.</p>
<h2>A striker to ease pressure on Callum Wilson</h2>
<p>Newcastle probably possess the best centre forward of all the teams fighting relegation, but Wilson’s body is fragile and the 29-year-old is facing at least a month on the sidelines with a calf injury.</p>
<p>Newcastle were willing to let Dwight Gayle leave this month before that injury but sources have told Telegraph Sport that the loss of Wilson means it is now certain Newcastle will sign another striker this month.</p>
<p>Manchester United know that <a>Anthony Martial wants to leave</a>. Could Newcastle persuade the France international to help them out in a relegation battle? It would be a long shot but not entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>However, of all the positions Newcastle need to fill this is the one they had not planned for as rigorously so targets are likely to be more fluid as the market evolves.</p>
<header> <h1> Antonio Conte: I understand why Harry Kane wants trophies - it is important for top players </h1> <p> Conte also believes he was brought to Spurs to send a message and calls on the club to back him in pursuit of titles </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matt Law, Football News Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It should be no surprise that Antonio Conte, a man who has built his entire career and reputation on winning, understands that Harry Kane needs to add a trophies column next to those for his appearances and goals.</p>
<p>In Conte’s belief, it is <a>why Spurs chairman Daniel Levy hired him</a> - to make a statement that the club want to win - but the Italian has also warned that his appointment must be backed up by similar acts of intent.</p>
<p>Conte won 14 trophies as a player and has lifted nine as a manager, and clearly believes Kane will live to regret it if he does not finish his career with the silverware to match his talent.</p>
<p>“I think this is important, this is important. And we have to try to build a situation (at Tottenham) where we are all involved and to try to create a situation that we can be competitive to try to win.</p>
<p>“For sure, at the moment, I think there is an important gap with other teams. I see many, many teams more ready now to win titles at this moment. But we have to work and we have to try to improve in every aspect.”</p>
<p>Kane appeared unhappy and disinterested after returning late for pre-season training under former head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, but the arrival of Conte has revived him with the England captain scoring three goals in his last four games.</p>
<p>Conte believes his appointment was intended to send a message to players such as Kane, but knows that alone may not be enough.</p>
<p>Kane’s short-term future had been resolved by the time Conte took over from Nuno, but the 52-year-old admitted that he followed the summer saga after initially turning down a Spurs approach to succeed Jose Mourinho.</p>
<h1> Romelu Lukaku hit with fine despite apologising to Chelsea fans and team-mates </h1>
<p> Chelsea forward, who is expected to lose at least £325,000 in wages for his secret interview, said it was up to him to 'restore fans trust' </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Sport <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Thomas Tuchel has confirmed that Romelu Lukaku has been fined for his controversial interview, despite the club’s record signing issuing grovelling private and public apologies and insisting he always wanted to return to Chelsea.</p>
<p>Having been left out of the head coach’s squad for the draw against Liverpool on Sunday, it is expected that Lukaku’s fine will be at least one week’s wages, around £325,000.</p>
<p>“This is what we prove now, but something happened, and he will be fined and, of course, he needs to accept it.”</p>
<p>Other than <a>apologising in private during his meeting with Tuchel on Monday,</a> Chelsea released a video of Lukaku apologising directly to the club’s supporters on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Lukaku said: “To the fans I'm sorry for the upset that I've caused. You guys know the connection I have with this club since my teenage years, so I totally understand you guys being upset.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it's up to me now to restore your trust and I'll do my best every day to show commitment on the training ground and in games to make sure we win games.</p>
<p>“And also to the manager, my team-mates and the board, I apologise, because I think it was not the right moment, also.</p>
<p>“And I want to move forward from this and make sure that we start winning football games and make sure that I start performing for the team in the best manner.”</p>
<p>Lukaku insisted that he is committed to Chelsea, following his £97.5million move from Inter Milan, but conceded he had not been clear enough about that during the interview that caused so much anger.</p>
<p>“I was on a mission to come back since I left, so I totally understand the frustrations of the fans. But now it's on me to make sure my commitment is at 100 per cent and I will do that in every game.</p>
<p>“My club was Chelsea, everybody knows that from being 10 or 11 years old I said I wanted to play for Chelsea. There were clearly images when I came on my school trip that I said I wanted to play for Chelsea.</p>
<p>Asked if Lukaku was his first-choice signing, Tuchel said: “Yes, of course. First choice is always about what’s possible and what’s not possible, and what is a good fit.</p>
<p>“It was the perfect fit and it still is, and we have to prove it, I have to prove it, he has to prove it. Let’s say the spotlight got a bit brighter on him now.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you can assume that we spent this amount of money and we bring all this effort while having major doubts or having second thoughts, or having him on the list in place number four.”</p>

<header> <h1> Michael Carrick viewed as a future Manchester United manager despite ending 15-year spell </h1> <p> Plus, Jim White explains why United might come to regret letting Carrick leave Old Trafford </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Mike McGrath and James Ducker, Northern Football Correspondent <time> 3 December 2021 • 2:19pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Michael Carrick has been viewed as a future Manchester United manager at Old Trafford following his unbeaten spell as caretaker which ended after the victory over Arsenal on Thursday.</p>
<p>Carrick, 40, announced his departure after the final whistle of the third match in charge, bringing an end to his 15-year spell at the club as a five-time Premier League winner as a player and a coach. </p>
<p>Following Solskjaer’s dismissal, he oversaw the Champions League victory over Villarreal, a draw at title-chasing Chelsea and the thrilling 3-2 victory over Arsenal, which was watched by <a>newly appointed interim manager Ralf Rangnick.</a> </p>
<p>“It certainly hasn’t put me off, no,” said Carrick ahead of the Manchester United game. “But at the same point I’m not suddenly desperate to become a manager. </p>
<p>Among the players of Carrick’s era, Frank Lampard started at Derby County before getting appointed at Chelsea, while Steven Gerrard has landed the Aston Villa job after a spell at Rangers. </p>
<p>Carrick revealed in interviews after <a>the Arsenal win</a> that “loyalty to Ole is a little bit of a factor” and that he also wanted to spend time with his family after going straight into coaching after retiring as a player. </p>
<p>He informed United’s first-team staff of his decision at lunchtime on Thursday but waited until after the game to tell the players as he did not want any distractions ahead of the Arsenal game. </p>
<p>“We are grateful for the steady leadership Michael has shown through this period of managerial transition, and, while he is now stepping away from day-to-day involvement, he will always be welcome back as a legend of the club.”</p>
<p>Manchester United may have bet their chips on the wrong interim manager</p>
<header> <h1> Ralf Rangnick's tactical revolution is not working at Manchester United – this is why </h1> <p> There is a chasm between Rangnick's words and what his team currently produces </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Daniel Zeqiri <time> 4 January 2022 • 12:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ralf Rangnick's strong tactical ideology makes him different to the archetypal interim manager but Manchester United are struggling to grasp and execute his concepts after five attempts in the Premier League.</p>
<a>draw at relegation candidates Norwich and Newcastle.</a> Many were forecasting maximum points from a soft batch of fixtures.
<p>Changing the ethos and philosophy of a team takes time, but that is the one commodity an interim coach does not have.</p>
<a>Luke Shaw ventured into similar territory</a> when he described United as 'not together' on the pitch against Wolves.
<p>Aside from a positioning his players in a 4-2-2-2, why is Rangnick struggling to leave his mark on United's football?</p>
<h2>Little evidence of famed high-pressing</h2>
<p>Asked about pressing, Rangnick told the Coaches' Voice: "It's about putting the other team under pressure, no matter how high up [the pitch]. The higher up the better, but wherever the ball is, we try to win the ball back."</p>
<p>Asked about United's pressing post-Wolves, Rangnick said: “We didn’t press at all. We tried but we were not able to get into those pressing situations."</p>
<p>Wolves were able to complete 77 of 85 passes in their own defensive third at Old Trafford, playing out under little stress.</p>
<p>"The way they press, we prepared to try and understand, when we have the ball we try to understand which men will be free," manager Bruno Lage said.</p>
<h2>Not-so-perfect 10s and the Fernandes problem</h2>
<p>A feature of Rangnick's 4-2-2-2 system is role of the 'double 10s', players who start in wide midfield when the team is defending in shape and then occupy pockets of space behind the strikers in possession.</p>
<p>With Paul Pogba out, who would be a prime candidate to play the left-sided 10, United have a shortage of players who are comfortable with the defensive and offensive demands of these roles. Juan Mata would be perfect, but sadly it is not 2012.</p>
<p>United's shape at Newcastle when they played 4-2-2-2 throughout. Note the positions of Rashford (10) and Fernandes (18) in the narrow, 'double 10' positions (attacking right to left):</p>
<p>United's best spell against Wolves came after they changed system to play with a back three and wing-backs, with Fernandes floating behind two strikers and hitting the bar with their best chance.</p>
<h2>Full-backs exposed to opposition width</h2>
<p>Lage said: “If you look in the first half, when they are defending and trying to block - I saw it from the bench - they have [Edinson] Cavani trying to block Ruben, Cristiano Ronaldo trying to control [Conor] Coady and the wingers inside.</p>
<p>“So the space is outside. That’s why Semedo and Marcal had a lot of chances and a lot of ball in the first half and the boys found those spaces."</p>
<p>Wolves' most successful pass combination was from central midfielder Ruben Neves to Semedo, with Neves' right foot finding his wing-back 13 times. All but two of those passes were in the United half.</p>
<div> <div> <p>Targeting the flanks will be a strategy repeated by United's upcoming opponents. Wolves sent almost 50 per cent of their attacks down the right flank, United's left.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Wolves' wing-backs were not just a problem in and of themselves, but stretched the pitch and opened up spaces inside for Daniel Podence and Trincao to receive the ball.</p>
<p>In this move, Wolves are attacking with five players across the pitch, as so many teams do in the Premier League. The width of Semedo and Marcal keeps Shaw and Wan-Bissaka honest, allowing Wolves to keep on out-numbering United centrally. </p>
<p>“They’re playing with four or five central midfielders and we had problems to control that part of the pitch," Rangnick said. </p>
<h2>Lack of central midfield quality</h2>
<p>Regardless of who coaches United, they will need better central midfielders who can pass the ball metronomically and offer some control. Scott McTominay and Fred are potentially reliable squad filler but should not be first choice. </p>
<p>Rangnick wants his teams to attack in a direct fashion, using a countdown clock on the training pitch to challenge his players to score within 10 seconds of regaining possession.</p>
<p>"We hate square passes, back passes, just having the ball ourselves doesn’t make sense,” Rangnick told the Coaches' Voice about his RB Leipzig side.</p>
<p>Which sounds very exciting but, to return to the point above, you need a team adept at controlling transitions when these riskier passes inevitably lead to ceding possession.</p>
<p>United's midfield did not specialise in ball retention to begin with, but trying to play at a faster pace seems to be coming at a cost.</p>
<p>Of the five Premier League games this season in which United have misplaced the most passes, three of them have come under Rangnick.</p>
<p>It raises the question of whether United, as they did in the second half against Wolves, should shift the emphasis of their team away from central areas by switching to a back three and wing-backs.</p>
<p>A change from 4-2-2-2 looks in the offing if these problems continue, but would that damage Rangnick's authority? </p>

<p>Student activists come in for a lot of flak these days. Personally, though, I think we should try a little harder to understand why they behave the way they do. Because they deserve our sympathy.</p>
<a>a proposal to create a “blacklist” of visiting speakers</a>.
<a>only to find her appearance cancelled just half an hour before she was due to speak</a>, after objections from Left-wing students.
<p>All these developments are troubling. Ultimately, though, I don’t think it’s the students themselves who are to blame. It’s whoever encouraged them to go to university in the first place.</p>
<p>In my view, it’s time we ended this cruel practice of sending morons to university. As for the activists who are already there, the kindest thing we can do is to expel them all at once. They’ve suffered long enough.</p>
<p>“Michael, I was willing to forgive your sins/ But you kept forgetting to put out the bins/ I hope you don’t think that’s an unfair critique/ But now our food waste won’t be picked up till Friday week.”</p>
<p>Or: “Michael, I thought that we were meant to be/ But you load the dishwasher so inefficiently/ Tupperware has to go on the top rack/ While larger items should go at the back.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t bear thinking about. She could probably get an album out of my socks alone.</p>
<p>It’s nothing personal. The same goes for every winner of this prize. If you accept an award for being contrarian, you’re clearly not a true contrarian.</p>
<p>At which point, the organisers should burst into a thunderous standing ovation, and upgrade his prize to a lifetime achievement award.</p>

<p>“Themis”, as this extraordinary device is called, was unveiled at Dubai Design Week. And apparently, it sounds an alarm whenever anyone in the vicinity makes an offensive remark or joke.</p>

<p>Last week, I turned 41. I had a lovely day, thank you for asking. My wife took me for tea at a cat café. I’d never been to one before, but the cats all seemed delighted to see me. Still, that was no surprise. Cats love old people.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, it baffles me whenever I see an article proclaiming that 60 is the new 40. As far as I’m concerned, 40 is the new 60.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no one has yet said it to me. Then again, maybe that’s because I’m not.</p>

<p>Take doors, for example. According to the French, doors are feminine (la porte). But what’s feminine about a door? I suppose some of them do have knockers. But then, they also have knobs. </p>
<p>Admittedly, some of our spellings may take a little getting used to (“bough”, “though”, “cough”, “through” and so on). But at least we don’t think cars have breasts.</p>
<h2>HMRC has become a nagging nuisance</h2>
<p>Perhaps tax-payers in the north of England should all email the Prime Minister to warn him that their new high-speed railway line is due, and threaten to fine him £100 each if it’s late.</p>
<p>Yes, specifically gay ones. Ms Stewart – who identifies as bisexual, and recently announced her engagement to a female screenwriter – describes the programme as “a paranormal romp in a queer space”.</p>

<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Is it time for the old to stop mocking the woke? </h1> <p> So says the headteacher at a leading private school. But the campaign for ‘social justice’ is not simply about ‘being kind’ </p> </div>

<p>I don’t know whether the President of the Girls’ School Association ever reads these Way of the World columns. But I’d better hope not. Because I fear she would deeply disapprove.</p>
<p>Still, even if we disagree with Mrs Price’s remarks, they are certainly significant, for one reason at least. She says that “times have changed”, and she’s absolutely right.</p>
<p>In the past, after all, headteachers used to order the young to show more respect to the old. Now, it appears, headteachers order the old to show more respect to the young.</p>
<p>Oh, and stop calling young people “snowflakes”. It might hurt their feelings.</p>
<h2>Are good manners ‘unsafe’ now?</h2>
<p>And that, apparently, was it. That was the remark that had made the students “feel unsafe”.</p>
<a>a book</a> containing views with which the activists disagreed. And as far as they were concerned, it amounted to the same thing.
<h1> Why does the Left think abolishing prisons will create a crime-free utopia? </h1>
<p> Their vision of a socialist world shows the cleverest people can believe the silliest ideas... but at least Fletch would have been happy </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Michael Deacon <div>COLUMNIST ASSISTANT EDITOR</div> <time> 24 November 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Imagine if each episode of Porridge – Ronnie Barker’s sitcom about life in prison – had begun as follows:</p>
<p>“Two weeks’ gardening, plus recommended attendance of a victim-offender mediation workshop.”</p>
<a>The Right to Sex</a> (August).
<p>This goal may seem a touch perplexing, but I think we have a duty to try and understand. So I’ve been reading the latest abolitionist books, in the eager hope that all would become clear.</p>
<p>Essentially, their argument goes like this. Prisons don’t work. Partly because <a>so many ex-cons reoffend</a>, but mostly because they fail to tackle the real cause of crime. Which, according to Left-wing abolitionists, is capitalism.</p>
<p>Becoming Abolitionists, though, reassures us that they would seldom be needed. “In the rare case that a murder would happen, it would shock our communities, the entire world…”</p>
<p>Mocking these utopians may seem like shooting fish in a barrel. But it’s worth remembering: they aren’t random idiots shouting at pigeons in the park. They’re highly educated and critically-acclaimed intellectuals.</p>
<p>As history so often shows, though, the cleverest people can believe the silliest ideas.</p>

<p>This week saw an exciting new twist in the war against history. A statue of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, was removed from New York City Hall because of his links to the slave trade.</p>
<p>An intriguing decision. Because if Jefferson is now considered beyond the pale, surely other monuments to him should be removed as well.</p>
<p>For example: Mount Rushmore.</p>
<p>Presumably, therefore, Lincoln should be removed from Mount Rushmore too. So that’s all four presidents. The whole thing will have to go.</p>
<p>Then, if for any reason those four figures turn out to be problematic too, the chisels can swiftly be used to carve out another four instead.</p>
<h2>And curse Sir Walter Raleigh</h2>
<p>In the 1960s, the Beatles were accused of glamorising LSD. These days no one minds about that. We’re only shocked by their use of tobacco.</p>
<h2>Why the ‘nu’ variant has a new name</h2>
<a>the latest Covid variant</a> will be called “omicron” (the Greek equivalent of the letter O) rather than “nu” (the Greek equivalent of the letter N). A wise decision. Calling it “nu” would have been disastrous.
<p>Imagine. It’s spring 2022, and a White House aide bursts into the Oval Office to see Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“Mr President, sir, I’ve got bad news about Covid. There’s a new variant.”</p>
<p>“Of course there’s a nu variant, dumbass. It’s been around since November last year.”</p>
<p>“No, sir, I’m not talking about the nu variant. I’m talking about the new variant.”</p>
<p>“No, sir, you’re thinking of the nu variant. Whereas I meant the new variant. As in, a variant that’s new. And I’m afraid the nu variant is nowhere near as bad as the new variant.”</p>
<p>“The new variant isn’t as bad as the nu variant?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, sir.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>“Aw, jeez. And people say I’m incoherent.”</p>
<h1> Ignore France’s silly ‘advice’ to Britain on migrants. Here’s a much better idea </h1>

<p>It is of course very thoughtful of Monsieur Darmanin to give us the benefit of his wisdom. All the same, I hope he will elaborate on his proposal. Because to me, at any rate, it doesn’t seem entirely clear what he means.</p>
<a>Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD</a>.
<p>Does Sir Mick have SAD? I certainly hope not. Because SAD doesn’t just cause a general feeling of gloom. It also weakens the sex drive. Which, for admirers of Sir Mick, would be a concerning development.</p>
<p>Think about that fact for a moment. It’s awe-inspiring. The man is superhuman.</p>
<p>It would be a great shame, therefore, if he were to lose interest in having more children. This country’s birth rate is already <a>alarmingly low</a>. Without the heroic efforts of Sir Mick, we’ll never get it back up.</p>
<a>Julius Caesar</a>, for example, are warned that the plot “centres on a murder”, while those about to study
<a>A Tale of Two Cities</a> – set during the French Revolution – are warned that it “contains scenes of violence, execution and death”.
<a>Kidnapped</a> informs readers that the novel contains “depictions of kidnapping”. It might be argued that, in this particular case, the title already acts as a trigger warning, but these days you can’t be too careful.
<p>I wonder whether they’ll add a trigger warning to <a>War and Peace</a>. On the one hand, it contains depictions of war. But on the other, it also contains depictions of peace, so perhaps those balance it out.</p>

<h1> Christmas may be at risk, but things could be worse – just look at the EU </h1>
<p> We need to put our own troubles in perspective, because many of our neighbours are having it a whole lot tougher, even without omicron </p>

<p>But never mind. We are where we are. And, although Christmas may be at risk, I think we should look on the bright side.</p>
<p>After all, things could be worse. We could be in the EU.</p>
<p>I say this not to gloat or to mock. Far from it. I say it purely to put our own troubles in perspective. Because the sad truth is, many of our neighbours are having it a whole lot tougher. And that’s even without omicron.</p>
<a>the rioters in Brussels last week</a>, who protested against restrictions by throwing missiles at police, attacking cars, smashing windows and setting bins on fire. In desperation the police resorted to water cannon and tear gas.
<a>grimly declared that by spring everyone in Germany would be “vaccinated, cured or dead”</a>. (I assume this was meant as a warning, although it sounded oddly like a threat.)
<p>“But I don’t want the vaccine. I’ve read terrible things about it online. I’m scared it could kill me.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sir, but we cannot offer you an assisted suicide unless you’re fully protected. Please – it’s for your own good.”</p>
<p>So there’s a comforting thought. However dicey things may seem in Britain right now, we aren’t quite at that stage yet.</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Going green has driven the Scots Nats nuts </h1> <p> Plus: what Keir Starmer can learn from Liz Truss... and a simple plan to clear up the Christmas confusion </p> </div> </div> </header>

<a>reports Glasgow’s Herald newspaper</a>, an environmentally conscious party activist called on her colleagues to take a stand against all nations that produce oil.
<p>“Boycott countries that take more fossil fuels out of the ground,” she cried. “Don’t visit the countries, don’t buy their goods.”</p>
<p>A noble aim. Readers may, however, have identified a potential drawback. It would require Scottish nationalists to boycott Scotland.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there may be a simpler alternative. Even as we speak, some enterprising nationalist may be conducting research to prove that in fact the hated oil was never Scotland’s in the first place.</p>
<p>Personally, I suspect that Westminster put it there. It’s just the sort of thing it would do.</p>
<p>Still, you never know. Tory MPs might like the sound of a Thatcher tribute act. After all, they were happy to elect a Churchill tribute act.</p>
<h2>Clearing up the Christmas confusion</h2>
<p>Thankfully, in order to end the confusion and provide much-needed clarity, the Cabinet has now agreed the following guidance for the festive season.</p>
<p>1. Your Christmas party may go ahead, provided that it is adequately ventilated. Suitable venues include a wind tunnel or the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>2. Kissing under the mistletoe should be done via Zoom.</p>
<p>3. Doing the conga is permitted, as long as everyone has a scotch egg.</p>
<p>4. You are entitled to invite vulnerable elderly relatives round for Christmas lunch. For their own safety, however, they should be seated alone in the garden.</p>
<p>5. If possible, celebrate Christmas in Downing Street. It’s totally safe, no restrictions apply, and no one will find out what you got up to till a year later.</p>
