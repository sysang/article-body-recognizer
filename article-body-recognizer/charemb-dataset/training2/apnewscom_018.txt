<div><div>In this courtroom sketch, Annie Farmer testifies on the witness stand during the Ghislaine Maxwell sex abuse trial, Friday, Dec. 10, 2021, in New York. A photo of Maxwell appears on a screen at foreground.(Elizabeth Williams via AP)</div></div>
<p>All were drawn into Jeffrey Epstein’s orbit as teenagers and now have also testified as key accusers in the sex-abuse trial of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>The first three women testified as Jane, Kate and Carolyn — first names or pseudonyms intended to protect their privacy. The last was Annie Farmer, who took the witness stand using her real name.</p>
<p>Here is what they said during two weeks of testimony for the government, which rested its case Friday. The defense is set to begin its own case next week:</p>
<li><div><a><h4>'Substitute camera' sketches Ghislaine Maxwell trial beats</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Prince Andrew effort to toss sex assault suit hits roadblock</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Document Prince Andrew claims prevents lawsuit is released</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Judge orders charges dropped against Epstein jail guards</h4></a></div></li>
<p><a>Jane spelled out an alleged pattern</a> of deception by Maxwell that would be echoed by the others. She said she was 14 when she met Maxwell and Epstein at a music camp where Epstein was a benefactor.</p>
<p>Maxwell showered her with attention in a way that left her vulnerable the moment she was first instructed to follow Epstein into his pool house in his Palm Beach, Florida estate in 1994, she said.</p>
<p>When he began to sexually abuse her, “I was frozen in fear,” she said. “I’d never seen a penis before.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors wanted evidence that Maxwell was a direct participant. Jane gave it to them by claiming Maxwell and Epstein fondled her together.</p>
<p>Like the others, <a> Kate recalled Maxwell praising and encouraging</a> her, before Epstein sexually abused her during interactions that started in the early 1990s when she was 17. </p>
<p>But there was a twist to her testimony when the judge ruled in favor of defense arguments that she shouldn’t be allowed to testify about details of any sexual contact with Epstein.</p>
<p>Kate still may have struck a blow for the government with her account of an interaction with Maxwell after a sexual massage with Epstein.</p>
<p>Maxwell “asked me if I had fun” and told her: “You are such a good girl.”</p>
<p>A key role for <a>Carolyn was to provide testimony</a> about what prosecutors called “a pyramid of abuse,” allegedly encouraged by Maxwell.</p>
<p>While 14, she was one of several underprivileged teens who lived near Epstein’s Florida home in the early 2000s. Word spread that he was offering $100 bills for massages.</p>
<p>When an older schoolmate offered an introduction, Carolyn said she took the bait. She testified she made her age known, but that didn’t dissuade Maxwell and Epstein, she said.</p>
<p>Epstein, she said, masturbated and fondled her “every time” they got together. He also wanted her to bring along “any friends that were my age or younger,” she said.</p>
<p>She said found a friend for a threesome with Epstein. When it was over, “I was paid $600 and my friend was paid $300.” Why? “Because I brought her.”</p>
<p>She would learn that she hit her expiration at age 18 when Epstein, rather than hire her for massages, asked her to bring younger girls.</p>
<p>“And that’s when I realized I was too old,” she said.</p>
<p>Feeling helpless, she made an excuse to go to the bathroom and hid there, thinking she “wanted to be in there long enough that this situation would be over,” she said.</p>
<p>Farmer pushed back. Her goal all along, she said, was to see Maxwell “held accountable for the harm she’s caused.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Who was Jeffrey Epstein, and what’s the impact of his death?</h1></div><div>By DAVID KLEPPER and JIM MUSTIANAugust 11, 2019 GMT</div></div>
<p>His death sparked questions about whether the alleged victims will have a full chance at justice, though U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said the federal investigation into allegations that Epstein ran a sex trafficking ring remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Berman noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at Epstein, and what comes next:</p>
<p>Epstein, 66, was a hedge fund manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Prisons said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center early Saturday.</p>
<p>Staff tried to revive him, and he was transported to a local hospital for treatment. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr said he was “appalled” by the news.</p>
<p>Epstein had previously been injured <a>with bruises to the neck</a> while in custody, though it was not clear if those were self-inflicted or the result of an assault.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice will investigate his death.</p>
<p>WHAT WAS THE NEW CASE AGAINST HIM?</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over the 2008 plea bargain. They accused him of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.</p>
<p>A conviction could have put him in prison for 45 years.</p>
<p>At the time of Epstein’s arrest, prosecutors said they found a trove of pictures of nude and seminude young women and girls at his $77 million Manhattan mansion. They also say additional victims have come forward since the arrest.</p>
<p>WHAT HAPPENS NOW FOR HIS ACCUSERS?</p>
<p>Sigrid McCawley, an attorney representing one accuser, said in a statement that “the reckoning of accountability begun by the voices of brave and truthful victims should not end” with Epstein’s death.</p>
<p>Another accuser, Jennifer Araoz, who came forward after the new charges were filed, said she was angered by Epstein’s suicide. Araoz alleged that Epstein <a>raped her in his New York mansion</a> in the early 2000s when she was 15.</p>
<p>“We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed the pain and trauma he caused so many people,” she said.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — The British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted Wednesday of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by the American millionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Prince Andrew effort to toss sex assault suit hits roadblock</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Document Prince Andrew claims prevents lawsuit is released</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Judge orders charges dropped against Epstein jail guards</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Judge: Prince Andrew can't halt lawsuit with domicile claim </h4></a></div></li>
<p>One of her victims, Annie Farmer, said she was grateful the jury recognized Maxwell’s “pattern of predatory behavior.” </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams praised the victims who testified against Maxwell after experiencing what he called “one of the worst crimes imaginable.”</p>
<p>No sentencing date was set.</p>
<p>The defense had insisted Maxwell was a victim of a vindictive prosecution devised to deliver justice to women deprived of their main villain when Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019.</p>
<p>Her brother, Kevin Maxwell, said the family believes she will be vindicated on appeal. “We firmly believe in our sister’s innocence,” he said in a written statement. </p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutors called 24 witnesses to give jurors a picture of life inside Epstein’s homes — a subject of public fascination and speculation ever since his 2006 arrest in Florida in a child sex case.</p>
<a>expected to be “blind, deaf and dumb”</a> about the private lives of Epstein, a financier who cultivated friendships with influential politicians and business tycoons, and Maxwell, who had led a jet-setting lifestyle as the favorite child
<p>Pilots took the witness stand and dropped the names of luminaries — Britain’s Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump — who flew on Epstein’s private jets.</p>
<p>Jurors saw physical evidence like <a>a folding massage table</a> once used by Epstein and a “black book” that listed contact information for some of the victims under the heading “massages.”</p>
<p>There were bank records showing he had transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell, his longtime companion — onetime girlfriend, later employee.</p>
<p>But the core of the prosecution was the testimony of four women who said they were victimized by Maxwell and Epstein at tender ages.</p>
<a>Kate, then 17, said Maxwell</a> asked her if she’d had fun and told her: “You are such a good girl.”
<p>Maxwell made all the arrangements, Carolyn told the jury, even though she knew the girl was only 14 at the time.</p>
<p>Jane said in 1994, <a>when she was only 14,</a> she was instructed to follow Epstein into a pool house at the Palm Beach estate, where he masturbated on her.</p>
<p>Two charges, including the lone count on which Maxwell was acquitted, applied only to Jane. </p>
<p>“I was frozen in fear,” she told the jury, adding that the assault was the first time she had ever seen a penis. She also directly accused Maxwell of participating in her abuse.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s lawyer asked Jane why it had taken so long to come forward.</p>
<p>“I was scared,” she said, choking back tears. “I was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn’t want anybody to know any of this about me.”</p>
<p><a>The last to testify, Farmer described</a> how Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch and how Epstein unexpectedly crawled into bed and pressed himself against her.</p>
<p>Maxwell, <a>who turned 60 on Christmas, </a> vehemently denied the charges through her lawyers.</p>
<p>Still, <a>she declined to take the risk of testifying, </a> telling the judge: “The government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt so there is no reason for me to testify.”</p>
<p>“The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did,” one of Maxwell’s lawyers, Bobbi Sternheim, emphasized to the jury. “But she is not Jeffrey Epstein and she is not like Jeffrey Epstein.”</p>
<a>called as a witness Elizabeth Loftus,</a> a professor who has testified as a memory expert for defense lawyers at about 300 trials, including the rape trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.
<a>prodded jurors to work quickly</a> to avoid the potential of a mistrial caused by sickened jurors.
<p>The legal fights involving Epstein and Maxwell are not over.</p>
<p>Maxwell <a> still awaits trial </a> on two counts of perjury.</p>
<p>Following the Maxwell verdict, Giuffre released a statement through her lawyers, saying, “I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Who is the real Ghislaine Maxwell: Epstein enabler or pawn?</h1></div><div>By DANICA KIRKA and TOM HAYSNovember 28, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Now, after a life of both scandal and luxury, Maxwell’s next act will be decided by a U.S. trial.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, prosecutors in New York will argue that even as she was sipping cocktails with the likes of Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Maxwell, 59, was secretly abetting Epstein’s crimes with girls as young as 14.</p>
<p>A key question for jurors: Was Maxwell an unwitting pawn of Epstein’s manipulations or an opportunist who knew all about his sex crimes?</p>
<p> Ian Maxwell says his sister is being railroaded by a U.S. criminal justice system intent on holding someone responsible for Epstein’s crimes.</p>
<p>“And she is paying a heavy price, a blood price for that,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Along the way he married, fathered nine children and was twice elected to Parliament. He also earned a reputation for boorish behavior and bullying subordinates.</p>
<p>Ghislaine was Maxwell’s youngest child, born on Christmas Day 1961. Her brother Michael was severely brain damaged in a car accident just days later at age 15, although he lived for another seven years.</p>
<a>Robert Maxwell fell off his yacht</a> — the Lady Ghislaine — in the Canary Islands and died in what some saw as an accident and others a suicide. Investors would discover his wealth was an illusion: He had
<a>diverted hundreds of millions of pounds</a> from his companies’ pension funds to prop up his empire.
<p>Soon after her father’s death, Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed sitting next to Epstein during a memorial at the Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p>John Sweeney, a longtime U.K. journalist and creator of the podcast “Hunting Ghislaine,” told the AP he believes that “after the monster her father died, she found a second monster.”</p>
<p>“Robert Maxwell stole hundreds of millions of pounds from people who were dependent upon his good word; Jeffrey Epstein turned out to be a darker figure, a worse human being,” Sweeney said.</p>
<p>One of those was with Epstein, a onetime teacher who built his own fortune on the back of contacts like the former CEO of the parent company of lingerie retailer Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p>In sworn testimony for an earlier civil case, Ghislaine Maxwell acknowledged that she had a romantic relationship with Epstein but said she later became his employee, tasked with things like hiring staff for his six homes.</p>
<p>Years of civil litigation followed, in which women accused Epstein and Maxwell of sexual abuse. Prosecutors in New York revived the case and charged Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019, but he killed himself in jail before he could face trial.</p>
<p>Maxwell was just protecting herself from the press, her lawyers said in court papers — a notion U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan rejected.</p>
<p>She said she never saw Epstein getting massages from anyone under 18 and that no one ever complained to her that Epstein demanded sex.</p>
<p>“Never,” she declared.</p>
<p>With Epstein gone and no apparent recordings of alleged incidents that occurred two decades ago, the trial will likely hinge on the women’s allegations and Maxwell’s denial.</p>
<p>A jury will soon decide who it believes.</p>

<div><div><h1>RB superstar R. Kelly convicted in sex trafficking trial</h1></div><div>By TOM HAYS and LARRY NEUMEISTERSeptember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>He faces the possibility of decades in prison for crimes including violating the Mann Act, an anti-sex trafficking law that prohibits taking anyone across state lines “for any immoral purpose.” Sentencing is scheduled for May 4.</p>
<p>One of Kelly’s lawyers, Deveraux Cannick, said he was disappointed and hoped to appeal.</p>
<p>“I think I’m even more disappointed the government brought the case in the first place, given all the inconsistencies,” Cannick said.</p>
<p>Several accusers testified in lurid detail during the trial, alleging that Kelly subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage.</p>
<p>For years, the public and news media seemed to be more amused than horrified by allegations of inappropriate relationships with minors, starting with Kelly’s illegal marriage to the RB phenom Aaliyah in 1994 when she was just 15.</p>
<p>His records and concert tickets kept selling. Other artists continued to record his songs, even after he was arrested in 2002 and accused of making a recording of himself sexually abusing and urinating on a 14-year-old girl.</p>

<a> docuseries, “Surviving R. Kelly,”</a> helped make his case a signifier of the #MeToo era, and gave voice to accusers who wondered if their stories were previously ignored because they were Black women.
<p>“To the victims in this case, your voices were heard and justice was finally served,” Acting U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis said Monday.</p>
<p>Gloria Allred, a lawyer for some of Kelly’s accusers, said outside the courthouse that of all the predators she’s gone after — a list including Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein — “Mr. Kelly is the worst.”</p>
<p>At the trial, several of Kelly’s accusers testified without using their real names to protect their privacy. Jurors were shown homemade videos of Kelly engaging in sex acts that prosecutors said were not consensual.</p>
<p>The defense labeled the accusers “groupies” and “stalkers.”</p>
<p>Kelly’s lawyer, Cannick, questioned why women stayed in relationships with Kelly if they thought they were being exploited.</p>
<p>“You made a choice,” Cannick told one woman who testified, adding, “You participated of your own will.”</p>
<a>keeping a gun by his side</a> while he berated one of his accusers as a prelude to forcing her to give him oral sex in a Los Angeles music studio; Kelly
<a>giving several accusers herpes</a> without disclosing he had an STD; Kelly
<p>Of 14 possible racketeering acts considered in the trial, the jury found only two “not proven.” The allegations involved a woman who said Kelly took advantage of her in 2003 when she was an unsuspecting radio station intern.</p>
<p>Other testimony focused on Kelly’s relationship with Aaliyah. One of the final witnesses described seeing him sexually abusing her around 1993, when Aaliyah was only 13 or 14. </p>
<p>Aaliyah, whose full name was Aaliyah Dana Haughton, worked with Kelly, who wrote and produced her 1994 debut album, “Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number.” She died in a plane crash in 2001 at age 22.</p>
<p>Kelly had been tried once before, in Chicago in a child pornography case, but was acquitted in 2008.</p>

<div><div><h1>Harvey Weinstein found guilty in landmark #MeToo moment</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL R. SISAK and TOM HAYSFebruary 24, 2020 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein was convicted Monday of rape and sexual assault against two women and was led off to prison in handcuffs, sealing his dizzying fall from powerful Hollywood studio boss to archvillain of the #MeToo movement.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old Weinstein had a look of resignation on his face as he heard the verdict that could put him away for the rest of his life. The charges carry up to 29 years behind bars.</p>
<p>Weinstein’s lawyers said they will appeal.</p>
<p>Sentencing was set for March 11. The sexual assault charge carries up to 25 years in prison, while the third-degree rape count is punishable by up to four years. </p>
<p>In addition to the three women he was charged with attacking, three more who said they, too, were attacked by Weinstein testified as part of an effort by prosecutors to show a pattern of brutish behavior on his part.</p>
<p>The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sex crimes unless they grant permission, as Haleyi and Sciorra did.</p>
<p>In the case of the unidentified woman he was accused of raping, the jury acquitted Weinstein of first-degree rape, which requires the use of force or the threat of it, and found him guilty of third-degree rape, which involves a lack of consent.</p>
<p>After the verdict, jury foreman Bernard Cody was asked as he left court how the deliberations were for him personally and responded: “Devastating.” He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Weinstein now faces charges in Los Angeles. In that case, announced just as the New York trial was getting under way on Jan. 6, authorities allege he raped one woman and sexually assaulted another on back-to-back nights during Oscars week in 2013. </p>
<p>The New York trial was the first criminal case to arise from a barrage of allegations against Weinstein from more than 90 women, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Salma Hayek and Uma Thurman. Most of those cases were too old to prosecute.</p>
<p>“If he heard the word ‘no,’ it was like a trigger for him,” his rape accuser testified.</p>
<p>One woman said that when she laughed off his advances, he sneered, “You’ll never make it in this business. This is how this industry works.”</p>
<p>Like Haleyi, she sent Weinstein friendly and sometimes flirtatious emails, such as “Miss you big guy” and “I love you, always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call.”</p>
<p>Rumors about Weinstein’s behavior swirled in Hollywood circles for a long time, but he managed to silence many accusers with payoffs, nondisclosure agreements and the constant fear that he could crush their careers if they spoke out. </p>
<p>Weinstein was finally arrested in May 2018, seven months after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed his alleged misconduct in stories that would win the Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>Among other men taken down by the #MeToo movement since the scandal broke: news anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, actor Kevin Spacey and Sen. Al Franken.</p>
