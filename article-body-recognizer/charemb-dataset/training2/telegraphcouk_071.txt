<header> <h1> The story of the first 'modern' electric vehicle </h1> <p> It’s 25 years since GM launched its controversial yet acclaimed electric car, the EV1. Even back then it felt significant </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 1 January 2022 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>I watched Chris Paine’s controversial 2006 documentary Who Killed The Electric Car? again last night, along with its mischievous 2011 sequel, Revenge Of The Electric Car, which portrays Elon Musk struggling to get Tesla off the ground.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, however, GM was a mighty research and development organisation, conducting its own highly advanced projects and sponsoring others.</p>
<p>It was 4.31 metres long, 1.77 metres wide and weighed 1.4 tonnes. The range was 78 miles in the old Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test, but only 55 miles in today’s updated EPA test. </p>
<p>The single AC induction motor delivered 137bhp at 13,000rpm and 110lb ft, and drove the front wheels through a two-stage step-down gear. In the interest of battery range, top speed was limited to 80mph, with a sub nine second 0-60mph time.</p>
<p>In addition, the body control allowed too much roll in corners and the electrically-powered steering was overassisted and without feel. </p>
<p>With such a limited range, the instrumentation showing the battery’s status (via green bars) wasn’t accurate enough, either. The chap who paid the lease admitted that more than once he’d run out of charge. </p>
<p>There are plenty who think that GM buried its epochal battery-car project, particularly after a consortium of car makers subsequently brought a legal action which crushed the Carb zero emissions requirements. </p>
<p>The EV1 was a polarising car; those who loved it really loved it, although as Barry Winfield wrote in Car and Driver magazine in 1997, it was “a vehicle that makes sense for very few people”.</p>
<p>These days General Motors produces the battery-electric Bolt, which was recently praised to the skies by President Joe Biden, while the Volt is a rather forgotten misadventure.</p>
<p>The engineers were modest to a fault, pointing out that current lithium-ion battery tech and solid-state control systems are different, and that there wasn’t a lot to learn from the EV1 which could speak to the modern breed of electric cars.</p>
<p>Hum, have we learned nothing from history?</p>

<header> <h1> Blenheim Palace to charge car drivers more in bid to become carbon neutral </h1> <p> Plan is to offer 'deep discounts' to visitors who arrive by public transport in an effort to 'weaponise' the estate against climate change </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Daniel Capurro <time> 1 January 2022 • 7:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Blenheim Palace plans to charge car drivers higher entry fees in an attempt to encourage eco-friendly journeys as part of the Duke of Marlborough's pledge to make his estate carbon negative.</p>
<p>Dominic Hare, the chief executive of Blenheim, told The Telegraph that the estate wanted to go further than an “arbitrary” net zero target and to see how much carbon could be sequestered in its grounds.</p>
<p>The UK’s per capita carbon emissions are around 5.4 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Mr Hare said the drive behind the plan came from the Duke and his family, explaining: "The Duke has always been passionate about the countryside and the carbon benefits of that, and George, his son, is even more so."</p>
<p>If the estate did nothing, said Mr Hare, the "next duke after the next duke" would look out on an estate of "parched soil" and ask "what on earth was grandaddy, daddy, doing leaving me this?"</p>
<p>The estate is going further than many heritage organisations, by including so-called “scope three” indirect emissions in its target, which counts things such as carbon dioxide produced by visitors driving to the Oxfordshire estate.</p>
<p>Emissions from visitor transport account for almost three-quarters of overall carbon emissions linked to the estate, according to Blenheim’s own figures.</p>
<p>Mr Hare said it was “wrong” to exclude such emissions from their net-zero targets, given that “we have a business model built on attracting people to come quite a long way to come and visit Blenheim and spend money”.</p>
<p>“If they can't reduce their emissions we can help them do it,” he said.</p>
<p>While the route from Oxford City centre to the palace can be done easily using public transport, with one of three bus routes to Woodstock in operation every 30 minutes, it can prove more of a challenge when journeying from London.</p>
<p>Mr Hare said that the estate had begun trialling the idea in early 2020, but had to scrap it after just three weeks when the pandemic drove people away from public transport. </p>
<p>Last winter, the estate planted 280,000 trees, while they are working with neighbouring farmers to make regenerative practices more widespread in the local area.</p>
<p>Mr Hare said they were also looking at ways of greening Blenheim Palace itself, including the possibility of a lake-source heat pump powered by solar electricity to provide heating for the 18th-century English Baroque masterpiece.</p>

<h1> How Mercedes cracked the holy grail of electric driving with the EQXX's 620-mile range </h1>
<p> The prospect of 1,000km between charges puts Mercedes ahead of Tesla in the race to make EVs as practical for longer journeys as a diesel </p>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It’s almost as slippery as a penguin, with a shape inspired by a drop of water, but it’s the 1,000km (620 miles) range of the latest Mercedes-Benz concept car, the Vision EQXX, which is capturing the headlines.</p>
<p>“The technology programme behind the Vision EQXX will define and enable future Mercedes-Benz models and features,” says Markus Schäfer, the company’s director and chief technology officer.</p>
<a>EQS large electric saloon</a> with a 453-mile range, which was launched last year, but this one is half the size and weighs 30 per cent less.
<a>solid-state and lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) cells</a>.
<p>This is a dedicated unit consisting of the electric motor, transmission and power electronics, which uses a new generation of silicon carbides and is based on the power electronics used in the <a>Mercedes-AMG Project One hypercar</a>.</p>
<p>With just 201bhp powering a vehicle weighing 1.75 tonnes, performance is relatively modest, although the 0-62mph acceleration time of 7sec means the EQXX is no slouch.</p>
<a>the remarkable Mercedes C111</a> have spats fitted over the rear wheels to smooth the airflow, but the design department didn’t want spats.
<p>“It was one of the epic stories of the development,” says Jasmin Eichler, director of future tech.</p>
<h2>Heating and ventilation</h2>
<p>As well as using recycled steel, aluminium and alloy martensitic steel in its underbody structure, the body panels are a combination of glass- and carbon-reinforced plastic.</p>
<p>In this case, however, Mercedes development engineers and HPP forged what seems to be a useful relationship even if Eva Greiner describes it as “two teams working at a high level as sparring partners – it was fun”.</p>
<p>Whichever way you look at it, this concept marks an important Rubicon for the existing smoke-stack motor industry as it struggles to find an answer to the unstoppable advance of firms such as Tesla. </p>
