<h1>Kazakhstan welcomes Putin's Eurasian Union concept</h1>
<p>Governments in the West may have read with alarm that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wanted to build a Eurasian Union out of the former Soviet bloc but in Kazakhstan the news was welcomed.</p>
<div> <div> <span> By James Kilner </span> <time> 06 October 2011 • 8:20am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev first mentioned the concept of a Eurasian Union during a speech at a Moscow University in May 1994, less than three years after the breakup of the Soviet. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>But despite massive investment from the West and more recently China, the old ties to Russia remain strong as Roman Vassilenko, head of press and information at the Kazakh foreign ministry, explained. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"Kazakhstan and President Nazarbayev personally have always stood for closer economic integration with Russia and other countries of the former USSR," he told the Daily Telegraph. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"The Eurasian Union that President Nazarbayev first proposed in 1994 is envisaged as a mutually beneficial union of mutually respectful partners." </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Kazakhstan is already an enthusiastic member of the customs union with Russia and Belarus that Mr Putin sees as the launch pad for a more integrated Eurasian Union. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Most analysts, though, don't expect Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which are both rich in natural resources, to join a Russia-lead economic union. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Dosym Satpayev, an Almaty-based analyst, said he thought that Mr Putin's real motive behind creating the customs union and potentially the Eurasian Union was political. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"The Eurasian Union is important for Russia at it will let them remain strong in international affairs," he said. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In contrast he said that Mr Nazarbayev's aims were driven by a desire for access to the Russian market and to give Kazakhstan more options. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"This will show everybody that he is able to pick from a lot of partners," Mr Satpayev said. "This is a position of strength." </p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1>Nursultan Nazarbayev: the shepherd’s son who became Kazakhstan's Emperor</h1> <p>A profile of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan.</p> </header>
<div> <div> By Praveen Swami and Richard Orange <time> 01 December 2010 • 8:00am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>“There will be no festivities on my birthday,” <b>Kazakhstan</b>’s president told administrators in March. “That's an order.” </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Folk performers, dancers and opera singers entertained the president's guests. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Later this week, world rulers will be gathering again, this time for<b> <a>a summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) – under Mr Nazarbayev’s chairmanship</a>. </b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Nazarabayev, the son of a shepherd who started life as a steelworker, has come a long way. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Like many other modern Central Asian leaders, Mr Nazarbayev’s started out as a Soviet apparatchik. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In 1984, he became chairman of Kazakhstan’s Council of Ministers, and went on to serve as the first secretary of the Kazakh Republic’s Communist Party’s first secretary from 1989 to 1991. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>Mikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the Soviet Union, made him Kazakhstan’s head of state in April 1990, after three days of rioting which followed the appointment of Gennady Kolbin, an ethnic Russian, to that position. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In December 1991, Mr Nazarbayev became independent Kazakhstan’s first – and so far only – president, winning 91.5 % of the vote in an uncontested election. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>There’s little doubt Mr Nazarbayev has some real successes to his credit. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a single decade, per capital GDP has risen from $700 to over $8,000. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Kazakhstan avoided the wars and chaos which scarred other post-Soviet Republics, and gave up its nuclear arsenal – once the fourth-largest in the world. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Though the country is located next to regions profoundly troubled by jihadist violence, Islamism has been kept under control. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Nazarbayev has been helped by his country’s enormous resources. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The ninth-largest country in the world, Kazakhstan holds enormous reserves of oil and gas, as well as gold, manganese and coal. It is also the world’s ninth-largest producer of uranium. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Perched on the Europe-Asia divide, it borders both Russia and China, as well as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan – and is a key element in the long-term energy and trade plans of the entire region. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>China is making multi-billion dollar investments in roads and pipelines to tap those resources, and wants to lease millions of acres of farmland. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>India signed a major uranium deal with the country last month. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Even Iran hopes to build a trade-boosting rail corridor – though its relationship with Mr Nazarbayev, whose government recently ordered six naval ships to protect its interests in the Caspian, have been troubled. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Some believe Mr Nazarbayev is preparing to step down from office before elections due to be held in 2012. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This summer, Kazakhstan’s parliament, in which every elected seat is held by the ruling Nur Otan party, passed legislation proclaiming Mr Nazarbayev “first president and leader of the nation.” </p> </div> </div>
<p>The laws grant him the right to intervene in policy after he retires – a little like Lee Kuan Yew, who served as “minister mentor” after he retired as Singapore’s prime minister, having served from 1959 to 1990. </p>
<div> <div> <p>Kazakhstan’s parliament also<b> <a>enhanced Mr Nazarbayev’s immunity from prosecution, and protected his family’s properties</a>. </b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Rozakul Khalmudarov, a senior Kazakh politician, also said the laws make it an offence to damage statues of Mr Nazarbayev, or to “distort facts in the biography of the leader of the nation.” </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The regime’s critics claim oil revenues are being frittered away. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>More than $10 billion has been spent on transforming what was once a rural backwater in the steppes into a modern city – the second-coldest capital, it is sad, after Ulan Bator in Mongolia. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Much of the money, opposition leaders allege, has been pocketed by Mr Nazarbayev and his political cronies. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Some of the most shocking allegations came from his former son-in-law, and Kazakhstan’s former ambassador to Austria, Rakhat Aliyev. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>There has been no independent corroboration of these claims, though Transparency International recently reported Kazakhstan was among the most corrupt countries in the world. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Nazarbayev announced a “holy war” against corruption. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Poll data, however, suggests most Kazakh citizens support the status-quo. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In April, a Gallup survey showed that 91% had a favourable opinion of Mr Nazarbayev, up seven per cent from a poll conducted in May 2009 and 4 per cent from one in October 2009. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>There is little doubt, though, that Mr Nazarbayev’s family has done well in the Kazakhstan he built. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>His oldest daughter, Dariga – Mr Aliyev’s ex-wife – owns substantial banking stocks, and once held control of the Khabar TV network. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Her younger sister, Dinara, is also a businesswoman, with a fortune Forbes magazine estimates at $1.1 billion. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The youngest daughter, Aliya, a lawyer by training, chairs the advisory board of a Kazakh real-estate firm, and owns a wellness centre and a nightclub in Almaty. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Put together, Russia’s New Times magazine estimates, the family’s assets are work around $7 billion. </p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1> Britain calls for a re-run of presidential elections in Belarus </h1> <p> Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says fresh elections needed after "despicable" vote-rigging by President Alexander Lukashenko </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Colin Freeman <time> 5 November 2020 • 6:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Britain has called for fresh elections in Belarus, following the "despicable" vote-rigging actions of President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab highlighted findings by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) which he said "exposed the fraud at the heart of the presidential elections" in August.</p>
<p>The UK has already imposed sanctions on Mr Lukashenko and his allies following the election and the brutal crackdown on protests which followed.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office said the OSCE report found overwhelming evidence that the elections were falsified and "massive and systematic" human rights violations.</p>
<p>Mr Raab said on Thursday: "We pushed for this independent investigation and it has exposed the fraud at the heart of the presidential elections and the despicable actions taken by Lukashenko's regime to suppress the Belarusian people.</p>
<p>"New elections which are free and fair must now be organised, and those responsible for the violence against demonstrators held to account."</p>
<p>The sanctions were in response to the torture and mistreatment of hundreds of peaceful protestors in custody.</p>

<h1>Ukraine's Maidan protesters: 'The revolution is not finished yet' </h1>
<p>Ukraine's two revolutions are polar opposites on the ideological spectrum – Donetsk is pro-Russian and anti-Western, the Maidan is the exact reverse</p>
<div> <div> By David Blair <time> 23 April 2014 • 6:10pm </time> </div> </div>
<a><b>Ukrainian</b></a> nationalist movement, were clear and adamant. "The revolution is not finished yet," said Andriy Tarasenko. "And the aim of the revolution is to break the old system."
<div> <div> <p>These two revolutions are polar opposites on the ideological spectrum – Donetsk is pro-Russian and anti-Western, the Maidan is the exact reverse. Yet both upheavals complement and feed off one another. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Members of Maidan self-defence forces march along the street in central Kiev on April 23 (REUTERS)</p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>The birth of the "Donetsk People's Republic" came in reaction to the fall of Mr Yanukovych's pro-Russian regime. Meanwhile, Kiev's protesters now cite the separatist takeover of Donetsk as a reason why they must stay in the Maidan. </p> </div>
<p>Mr Tarasenko told The Telegraph that Ukraine's new postrevolutionary government was no better than the old regime. "No matter what nameplate you see on a cabinet door, the system of management in the country has not changed by one iota," he said. </p>
<div> <div> <p><sup>A woman comes out of the tent with a basket of Easter goodies at the protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev April 19 (REUTERS)</sup></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>As someone who held two cabinet positions under the old order, Mr Yatsenyuk is regarded with deep suspicion by the Maidan. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Tarasenko was candid that the continuing protests were designed to shape every decision. The government was "frightened" of the Maidan, he said, and the demonstrations were the "only way of influencing power". </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>At the height of the revolution in February, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians would gather in Maidan. Today, only a core of permanent protesters are left, some of them hardline nationalists clad in camouflage fatigues. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>As for the accusation that Pravy Sektor had killed three pro-Russian activists in the eastern town of Slavyansk on Sunday, Mr Tarasenko described this as "propaganda" and part of a smear campaign by the Kremlin. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In the Maidan, the remaining protesters say they have no intention of going home. Today, Kiev's equivalent of Trafalgar Square has become a theatre of fury with the entire political class. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Ivan Svechnikov, 20, has been there since December. Wearing green camouflage and a white crucifix, he describes himself as a member of a "self defence" unit. He carries an air pistol stuffed inside a black stab vest. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"The people who are in government now were with the government before and we don't trust them," said Mr Svechnikov. "They are trying to run the same regime but in a different way."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Asked whether Mr Yatsenyuk should now be removed from power, he replied: "Yes."</p> </div> </div>

<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Who is Ibn Khaldun, Boris' favourite 14th century Tunisian sage and economic guide? </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Tom Rees <time> 19 November 2019 • 7:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson is drawing on a 14th century Tunisian scholar and the humble olive for inspiration ahead of next month’s election.</p>
<p>Not only has Ibn Khaldun been called the greatest Arab intellectual ever but many believe the historian and sociologist was hugely influential in shaping economics and free marketeers some 600 years later.</p>
<p>“Our instincts are to try to cut tax where we can, but only because we think that there are some taxes that you could obviously cut and see an increase in yields.”</p>
<p>The prime minister is not the only fan. Khaldun’s other admirers include <a>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg</a> and, crucially, economist Arthur Laffer, an adviser to US president Ronald Reagan and the creator of the Laffer curve.</p>
<p>Laffer, who acknowledges he borrowed his idea from Khaldun, proposed that no tax revenue would be made with rates at either 0pc and 100pc. </p>
<p>Laffer sketched out the concept on the back of a napkin for Reagan and the tax cuts became the heart of the president's supply-side economics. Despite its huge influence, the theory has drawn much criticism from economists. </p>
<p>Stuart Adam, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, explains: “It is theoretically possible that cutting taxes can raise revenue, the <a>Laffer </a>curve is a real thing that exists. </p>
<p>“The question is always cutting which tax from what rate to what given what circumstances.”</p>
<p>He says there is “no way on earth” that cutting corporation tax in the UK could currently lead to higher revenues. </p>
<p>Adam explains: “It is much more likely that cutting corporate tax from 60pc to 59pc will raise revenue than cutting it from 20pc to 19pc will raise revenue. </p>
<p>“The lower the rate is the less likely a tax cut will pay for itself. That’s just how the maths of it works.”</p>
<div> <div> <p>That is not to say that the idea is without any merit. Analysis by the IFS in 2014 found that increasing the top rate of income tax would raise little additional revenue.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Some believe that lower revenue from stamp duty was caused by George Osborne raising the rate on more expensive homes.</p>
<header> <h1> Tory Covid rebels deal hammer blow to Boris Johnson's authority </h1> <p> Leadership challenge has 'got to be on the cards' after PM suffers worst revolt of premiership as backbenchers ignore plea on virus curbs </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor ; Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor and Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent <time> 14 December 2021 • 10:32pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson suffered the worst Parliamentary rebellion of his premiership after scores of Tory MPs ignored a personal plea to support the introduction of Covid passports.</p>
<p>Some 100 Tory MPs, including two tellers, voted against legally requiring events with large crowds to check attendees for proof of vaccination or a negative test. This is close to half of the party’s backbenchers.</p>
<p>The rebellion dwarfed the previous record under Mr Johnson, which came last December when <a>55 Conservative MPs opposed a new tiered lockdown system.</a></p>
<p>The vote came less than an hour after the Prime Minister had sought to convince rebels to back his <a>Plan B restrictions</a> by addressing the 1922 Tory backbench committee.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson used the face-to-face meeting to urge his fellow Tories to do the “right thing” in the face of the <a>rapid spread of omicron</a>.</p>
<p>But one MP was heard exclaiming “wow” when the scale of the rebellion on Covid passports, one of four changes approved on Tuesday, became clear in the Commons chamber.</p>
<h2>Questions over Boris Johnson’s leadership following Tory rebellion</h2>
<a>depth of support in his leadership</a>.
<p>Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said after the vote that a leadership challenge in the new year was now possible.</p>
<p>"I think that's got to be on the cards. He's got to realise that he's got to change,” Sir Geoffrey told Sky News.</p>
<p>The Commons revolt also heaps further pressure on the result of the <a>North Shropshire by-election on Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The safe Tory seat was won by 23,000 votes by the Tories two years ago but is at risk of falling to the Liberal Democrats, after Owen Paterson <a>resigned when he was found to have broken lobbying rules</a> - allegations he denied.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson’s supporters, who have consistently rejected suggestions of a leadership challenge as hyperbole from a core of frustrated Tory MPs, noted that nobody resigned from Government over the Covid passports vote.</p>
<p><a>There had been speculation</a> that as many as a dozen parliamentary private secretaries - MPs who act as the “eyes and ears” of Cabinet ministers in Parliament - could resign, but in the end none did.</p>
<p>During the 11th-hour attempt to limit the rebellion, the Prime Minister assured Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee that he was not minded to announce new restrictions beyond Plan B measures, despite the rapid spread of omicron.</p>
<p>Downing Street sources also stressed that Mr Johnson was hoping the combination of Plan B restrictions and a <a>dramatic scaling up of the booster jabs</a> would be enough to tackle the case surge coming.</p>
<h2>Possibility of more restrictions to combat omicron</h2>
<p>However, there were signs elsewhere across the Government - both among ministers and scientific advisers, as well as in the devolved administrations - that more restrictions may well be needed given the sharp increase in omicron cases.</p>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, urged Scots to <a>limit their gatherings to no more than two other households</a> during the Christmas period - though the guidance would not apply to Christmas Day gatherings or similar.</p>
<p>Eluned Morgan, Wales’s health minister, urged people to take lateral flow tests before going to Christmas gatherings and did not rule out tougher measures before Dec 25.</p>
<p>Government officials working on Covid policy in Westminster are looking at a range of possible measures to limit omicron’s spread, according to multiple government sources involved.</p>
<p>One would see <a>social distancing rules</a> return for pubs and restaurants. Another would see social gatherings capped, such as a return of the “rule of six” that barred big groups.</p>
<p>The number of daily cases hit 59,610 on Tuesday, with the total over the last seven days up more than 40 per cent on the previous week. Cases are likely to pass the record 68,053 set on Jan 8 if omicron continues to rise as expected.</p>
<p>There were a swathe of cancellations in the West End on Tuesday, with shows such as The Lion King and the Life of Pi called off as productions were hit by Covid infections.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats leader, Labour shadow chancellor, Labour shadow transport secretary and Labour shadow education secretary have all tested positive for Covid-19, it emerged on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, delivered a downbeat assessment of the situation to Cabinet and Mr Johnson told ministers to expect a "huge spike" in infections.</p>
<p>Prof Whitty said a "significant increase in hospitalisations" from omicron was likely to be seen and rejected suggestions that the omicron wave in South Africa had peaked.</p>
<p>Sajid Javid also warned that an omicron surge could “overwhelm” the NHS - arguing that even if the variant was mild, the speed of its spread could cause a jump in hospitalisations</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister, had earlier <a>caused confusion by wrongly saying there were 250 people in hospital</a> with omicron when the latest figure was actually 10.</p>
<a>NHS national booking system is due to open to all over-18s</a> on Wednesday, having opened to people over 30 on Monday.
<p>However, the British Medical Association warned that restrictions would be needed in January, even if the booster target was met.</p>

<header> <h1> ‘No worries’ makes 2022 banished words list of annoying phrases </h1> <p> Critics say it is meaningless and insensitive, but Australians - who coined the saying - argue it has been misunderstood </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sam Hall <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>For many, “no worries” is simply a casual way to reassure someone that it was not too much trouble to help them.</p>
<p>However, the phrase has made it onto a university's list of banished words for “misuse and overuse”.</p>
<p>Lake Superior State University (LSSU), in Michigan, said “no worries” belonged on its annual list because it was incorrectly used as a substitute for “you’re welcome” after someone says “thank you”.</p>
<p>Opponents of the phrase said it was insensitive. “If I’m not worried, I don’t want anyone telling me not to worry,” a contributor to the list explained. “If I am upset, I want to discuss being upset.”</p>
<p>Despite its “meaninglessness”, academics said, the term is recommended as one of the auto-replies to emails by Google Assistant.</p>
<p>For fans of the expression though, its place on the list is a sign it has been misunderstood. For many, it represents the friendliness of the culture in Australia, where it is especially common.</p>
<h2>‘No worries’ helps smooth awkward conversations</h2>
<p>“‘No worries’ is a great example of how people smooth awkward moments in conversations,” said Dr Ruth Page, reader in applied linguistics at the University of Birmingham.</p>
<p>“So far from being ‘meaningless’ like the LSSU site suggests, it’s a valuable form of politeness for keeping interaction friendly.</p>
<p>“The thing about ‘no worries’ is that it doesn't literally mean you've got no worries. We use the phrase ‘no worries’ to downplay the risks involved in something.</p>
<p>“There are even memes that play on the fact that when people say ‘no worries’, they actually quite often mean that they are anxious about something.</p>
<p>“Different countries and cultures have different norms for how they express politeness. American English tends to be particularly high in these, so they use politeness norms to smooth their interactions much more."</p>
<p>Willem Hollmann, professor of linguistics at Lancaster University, said he disagreed with the view that “no worries” was incorrect English.</p>
<p>“Different communities have different customs and different norms,” he said. “And this happens to be an expression that is well-accepted in Australian English, particularly in informal contexts.</p>
<p>“I couldn't really see many Australian speakers using this expression in formal writing, but in an informal context, this is quite widely acceptable.”</p>
<p>Andrew Hall, from Brisbane, expressed his agreement, saying: “Literally all situations can be categorised as either ‘no worries’ or ‘a bit of a worry’. From split pants to nuclear meltdown.</p>
<p>“There is no need to change this status quo.”</p>
<h2>Banished words list aims to ‘protect’ language</h2>
<p>Despite the frustration it has obviously caused to some, “no worries” finished runner up this year to the phrase: “Wait, what?”</p>
<p>These two words should not go together under any circumstances, according to nominators and the contest judges from the LSSU English department, because the two-part halting interrogative is “disingenuous, divergent and deflective”.</p>
<p>Over the decades, the university has received tens of thousands of nominations for the list, which now totals more than 1,000 entries.</p>
<p>“Not a single of the many nominators of ‘no worries’ came from Australia. All nominators of ‘no worries’ listed their addresses as being in the US.”</p>

<p>Common sense or counterintuitive? An act of financial folly or a sound emotional investment? Psychologists believe it might be just the ticket in these turbulent times. </p>
<p>Anticipating a holiday has been proven to boost mental health. Zoning out at your desk to visualise that Japanese cherry blossom, trekking to Machu Picchu or whale-watching off Cape Town generates a feelgood factor well worth a few delayed emails.</p>
<p>“Over and above going on the break itself, if you're travelling with someone, whether they're friends or extended family, you can reinforce that excitement by talking about activities you want to do and bonding over it.”</p>
<p>“We talk a lot about the value of memories around holidays and the joy you get reflecting on the special things you did,” points out Langcaster. “But there’s a lot of benefit in looking ahead as well.”</p>

<p>Why should we pretend otherwise? What’s so wrong with asserting grown-up rights? Cue pantomime boos from the bring-your-baby-or-miniature-dachsund-or-emotional-support-Boston-fern-to-work millennial brigade.</p>
<p>Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has <a>launched a review of the rules</a> and I trust progress will be made to support MPs whose second job is being parent, rather than paid lobbyist or Virgin Islands lawyer.</p>
<p>How sad. Shocking. But not so very surprising. Sometimes those mothers who make the least noise need the most help.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Sussexit is the result of a princely sense of humour failure </h1> <p> Megxit evolved from Brexit but Prince Harry and his wife Meghan do not see the joke from their Montecito mansion </p> </div> </div>

<p>As any fool knows, but obviously not crosspatchy Prince Harry and his Missus, the secret to good comedy is - TIMING! Just as the key to great headlines is - RHYMING!</p>
<a>A classic neologism that, crucially, rhymes with Brexit</a>.
<a>Santa Barbara celebrity enclave of Montecito</a>, where Harry and Meghan live in a £12 million mansion it hasn’t. Now it has been renamed Sussexit.
<p>Shrill arguments and peevish complaints over “Megxit” undermine the ongoing battle for justice, something this giddily high-net worth pair are constantly banging on about.</p>
<p>The BBC may have felt they had to ditch Megxit. The rest of us will Sussexit and see.</p>

<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Help! I’m Team Boris, married to Team Jenny </h1> <p> My instinct is to tiptoe away from the PM’s pronouncements, but amid the omicron fuss, I find myself unexpectedly standing with him </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 1 December 2021 • 2:25pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>“WHAT do you mean you’ve invited a few people round? Who are these people?” my spouse demands.</p>
<p>“Friends. Our friends,” I reply.</p>
<p>“How many?” he challenges.</p>
<p>“Five,” I fib.</p>
<p>“Five including us or five in addition to us?” He is shining the Ikea desktop lamp straight into my eyes, as I squirm, tied to a chair in the utility room.</p>
<p>“So seven people in all? That’s not a few. That is a superspreader event. I will play no part in this madness! No part, I tell you!”</p>
<p>Perhaps you can tell, as I gently draw the blinds on this intimate marital exchange, that the chill winds of dissent are whistling through Woods Towers these days and not just because I’m a Radio 4 woman and he’s a Radio 3 man.</p>
<p>Oh no, the internal divisions – the family fissures – run much deeper than tussles over the respective merits of Petroc Trelawny and Mishal Husain.</p>
<a>who has suggested we should curb unnecessary socialising</a> to slow the spread of the
<a>omicron Covid variant</a>. Her expertise stems from the fact she is a scientist.
<p>Boris is the politician making a Peppa Pig’s ear of running the country, who has rubbished the idea of curtailing Christmas parties. His expertise stems from the fact he is a bon viveur.</p>
<p>What’s peculiar about our battle lines is that chez nous I’m the one Maureen Lipman would generously describe as the ‘ologist, shouting out the answers to organic chemistry questions on University Challenge.</p>
<p>I understand enough quantum physics to know it’s silly nonsense. And I once adopted a calico cat and called her Solenoid.</p>
<p>But I can’t cut back on human interaction. Generally speaking, my instinct is to tiptoe away from Prime Ministerial pronouncements, but here I find myself unexpectedly standing with Boris.</p>
<p>My husband stands with Jenny from the Block. The science block, obviously, where elaborate worst case scenarios are conjured up on a daily – hourly – basis.</p>
<p>If we have learnt one thing from the pandemic (apart from that there’s no need to stockpile loo roll) it is that scientists very often – and sometimes very vigorously – disagree. Even those on the same committee.</p>
<p>My esteemed spouse is mustard keen to follow the science, wherever it may go. As long as that science leads him straight back indoors, that is.</p>
<p>He couldn’t warm to Dr Jenny more if she had come round and summarily bolted our front door from the outside.</p>
<p>Her words are now an incantation. In fact, I might hack them into the wood with my unused cocktail swizzler before I succumb to the effects of social deprivation.</p>
<p>My heroically self-contained husband doesn’t crave company the way I do. Quite often he doesn’t even crave conversation.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a criticism, rest assured he regards this observation as being somewhere between a fact and a compliment. How much worse to be a needy chit-chatterer. Apparently.</p>
<p>No wonder I can’t countenance pulling out of Christmas parties or putting the kibosh on my forthcoming soirée.</p>
<p>I’ve offered to make guests conduct lateral flow tests at the garden gate as they arrive. He’s still not convinced. I think he’d prefer an al fresco transmissibility seminar à deux with Dr Jenny.</p>
<p>We acknowledge it takes a village to raise a child. So, it transpires, my marriage needs five (or so) friends to thrive and survive. I just never imagined one would be Boris.</p>
<h1> A snog at Christmas? I hadn’t thought about it in years... but yes please </h1>
<p> Government threats to something as basic as festive fun beneath the mistletoe are terribly bleak – unless you’re leading the country </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 2 December 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Huh? She may as well have outlawed wassailing, sacked the Lord of Misrule and banned the French Feast of the Donkey for all the sense she makes. Let’s hope for her sake she doesn’t attempt a take-down of the Ashen Faggot. Awkward.</p>
<a>I owned up to being an omicron agnostic who is married to a pasta-hoarding survivalist</a>, one whose zealous determination to stay home and save lives (mostly his own) is beginning to border on the unseemly.
<p>Which of us is right? A rhetorical question, because ask two politicians and you’ll get three answers. But there’s method in the madness.</p>
<p>Quite some time ago, we learned that mixed messaging, far from being a regrettable by-product of genuine disagreement in the highest echelons of clown school, is in fact a deliberate strategy by this Government.</p>
<p>It’s deeply cynical. But also successful. Does the end justify the means? Once trust is lost in democracy and the honourable (sic) members we charge with representing us, it leaves a dangerous vacuum behind.</p>
<p>It’s an undignified cop-out on the part of Government. But attempts to shame them and specifically name them are pointless.</p>
<p>Just as the Work and Pensions Secretary urges us not to snog under the mistletoe, Boris can’t wait to lead the conga. </p>
<p>So where do we draw the party line this Christmas? What I say is that, when it comes to choosing a dance partner, as long as he’s got a negative lateral flow test in his pocket, I’ll be pleased to see him.</p>

<p>There’s more. “What do you call an entitled young person with an over-exaggerated sense of social injustice who listens to Mumford Sons?” A folky wokey.</p>
<p>An entitled young person with an over-exaggerated sense of social injustice who appreciates the literary merits of one long or stressed syllable followed by one short or unstressed syllable?” Trochee wokey. (Bit niche? Educate yourself.)</p>
<p>It’s quite addictive and, despite my parlour sales pitch, great for car journeys. What do you call an entitled young person with an over-exaggerated sense of social injustice who likes their eggs sunny side up? That would be a yolky wokey.</p>
<p>An entitled young person with an over-exaggerated sense of social injustice with a frog in their throat? Croaky wokey.</p>
<p>And finally (for now), what do you call a Conservative Prime Minister who is demonstrating an over-exaggerated sense of social liberalism due to his wife’s influence? A Carrie-wokey.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you. I’m here all week; try the veal. It’s definitely the least wokey dish on the menu.</p>

<header> <h1> 25 festive trips for the ultimate family day out in December </h1> <p> After last year's disappointing Christmas, now is the time to fully embrace the season's festivities </p> </header>

<p>Are you sitting uncomfortably? Then I’ll begin with a thoroughly dispiriting festive travel update: this December, we’re being held hostage by omicron. </p>
<p>Is Die Hard a Christmas movie? You heard. I repeat: is Die Hard a Christmas movie? Think before you answer, because if I’m not mistaken it’s time for us midlife muthas to be a bit more Bruce Willis. </p>
<p>Clearly this is not the pre-festive season we wanted any more than Die Hard was the Christmas movie we expected. But it has become a much-loved classic we took to our hearts – and the same can be true for this December to Remember.</p>
<p>No need to Die Hard if we all try hard; to stop feeling restive, to start being festive and to make the best of all the pre-Christmas excitements on our doorstep. </p>

<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Just like the Duchess of Cornwall, I’m a proud Archers addict </h1> <p> As the radio soap marks its 70th birthday, us superfans are more deeply invested than ever in the goings-on in Ambridge </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 8 December 2021 • 6:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Tum-ti tum-ti tum-ti tum/ Tum-ti tum-ti tum tum. </p>
<p>By now you are either entirely bewildered, in which case I suggest you quietly slip out the side gate of Ambridge Hall and mind you don’t get waylaid by Constanze and Salieri (they’re llamas, do keep up). </p>
<p>Incidentally I would like to remind my husband (an Archers agnostic) that I want the aforementioned tune played at my funeral; the rustic Sunday omnibus version with the accordions mind, not the souped-up weekday muzak.</p>
<p>Oh and did you know this gloriously familiar piece is called Barwick Green and was originally a maypole dance written in 1924 by Yorkshire composer Arthur Wood? Just saying, Your Royal Highness.</p>
<p>And so we can get a little (ahem) competitive in a bid to emphasise our superfan credentials. Apologies, Ma’am.</p>
<p>Other high profile Archers aficionados include Prince Charles, Stephen Fry, Fiona Bruce and even Hollywood A-lister Ewan McGregor. I salute them all.</p>
<p>Even in the 1970s there was more to the programme than showcasing the latest agricultural developments. It was the personal stories, the vicissitudes of village life that kept us coming back for more – and still does.</p>
<a>National Domestic Abuse Helpline</a> from February 2015 to February 2016, which it attributed to the ‘Archers effect’.
<a>The Helen Titchener (née Archer) Rescue Fund</a> – with proceeds going to
<a>Refuge</a>. Within 48 hours more than £98,000 had been donated.
<p>Helen’s trial saw her walk free. But the trauma remained for several years. For all of us.</p>
<p>“These aren’t real people,” she explained to him, gently. “They are fictional characters in a radio show.”</p>
<p>“Thank God,” he responded. “I was thinking you were the most awful, meanest people I had ever met.”</p>
<h1> Graternity leave is just as important as being able to work from home – and long overdue </h1>
<p> It's about time that employers realised that striking a life-work balance isn’t the sole preserve of the young </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 9 December 2021 • 6:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>To graternity and beyond! What splendid news that grandparents are to be given a week off when a new grandchild is born. It’s inspired, empathetic and makes savvy economic sense.</p>
<p>But then the scheme has been introduced by Saga, which specialises in goods and services for the over-50s. The bosses there grasp the importance of retaining experienced, mature staff who understand their customer base.</p>
<p>But graternity leave is also acknowledgement of the generational ties that bind, that being a grandparent is an important role and that striking a life-work balance isn’t the sole preserve of the young.</p>
<p>Much is made of the quest by millennials for impactful benefits (whatever they are), peer-to-peer collaborative engagement, permission to bring in their French bulldog and free ceremonial grade organic matcha tea.</p>
<p>Their main priority however is shared by all demographics; flexible working. What precisely that entails will look very different seen from the perspective of a Baby Boomer versus a Generation Z-er.</p>
<a>the Government’s advice that we should once again work from home</a>, with accounting and consulting firm
<a>PwC leading the charge by asking staff to use “personal judgment” to determine what they do</a>.
<p>Newborns however, are notoriously short-term in outlook. Which is why grandma needs time off straight away to bring calm to chaos and grandad can do his bit by taking over the nursery drop-offs for older siblings.</p>
<p>Firms who want their workers to feel like they’re valued members of one great big family need to remember each of them is a precious part of a small one.</p>
<h1> Finally, Sex and the City got something right about female friendship </h1>
<p> After Samantha’s unceremonious exit from the group, Carrie and co are feeling bitter – And Just Like That... their response rings true </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 9 December 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>They are older.</a> But possibly not wiser. Each woman is (ostensibly) slap bang in the middle of her happily ever after. But new agonies and anxieties have replaced the search for Mr Right.
<p>Carrie is married to Big and they are unrealistically, irritatingly smoochy a decade on. Despite being a former sex columnist she is bombing as a guest on a hipster sex podcast because she’s too old, too slow and too darn cis-gender vanilla.</p>
<p>And then there’s sexpot Samantha. Except there isn’t. After a well documented, highly public feud with Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall declined to return to the show that made her name.</p>
<p>How would the producers tackle that one? Would a blonde-wigged Tina Fey simply turn up with a precipitous cleavage and the pool boy in tow, and just style it out?</p>
