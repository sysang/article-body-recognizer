<p>As first-home buyers flooded back into the market in 2020, they were suddenly washed back out again by the pricing tsunami, with investors diving in to take their place.</p>
<p>Many could dip their toes in early in 2021 only because of the bank of mum and dad.</p>
<p>“Parents were ‘gifting’ their children cash for their deposits rather than going guarantor,” says Marcus Roberts, founder of mortgage brokers Brighter Finance.</p>
<p>“There were reports earlier this year that parental contributions were averaging more than $89,000, which is an increase of nearly 20 per cent in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>“Other versions of this see parents allowing their children to pay zero rent or pay significantly discounted rental rates on properties owned by the parents.”</p>
<p>At times, it was hard for anyone to keep up, as Sydney registered the fastest annual pace of price growth on record, reaching a median house price of $1.5 million, with apartments exceeding the landmark $800,000.</p>
<p>Today, residential property now sits as the biggest asset class in Australia, worth an incredible $9 trillion, with 38 per cent of that within NSW.</p>
<p>While in the 1970s, a house cost seven times the average salary, it will now set the regular buyer back by 12.5 times their median yearly income, according to the latest ANZ CoreLogic Housing Affordability Report.</p>
<p>Sydney home buyers will need to save for more than 16 and a half years to amass a 20 per cent deposit for a home after this year’s 30.4 per cent rise in prices.</p>
<p>“But everything everywhere is becoming unaffordable, and, for many first-home buyers, that Australian dream of buying their first house is getting further and further out of their grasp, which is troubling.</p>
<p>“For a lot of others, their mortgages are blowing out too with the cheap cost of money.”</p>
<p>At the top end of the market, prices increased even faster, with the settlement on sales of new apartments at Barangaroo cementing the CBD harbour foreshore’s place as one of the top prestige addresses in the country.</p>
<p>“Then a new record was set by a mystery buyer who bought the top three levels of Lendlease’s tower One Sydney Harbour for $140 million,” she said.</p>
<p>“That shocked property watchers,” Macken says. “As did the sale of Rosemont just a few weeks later at $45 million by Margot, Lady Burrell, although this was more understandable given the size of the estate.”</p>
<p>The north shore clocked up a $24 million sale in Northwood, the upper north shore a $16 million sale in Killara, and $8.38 million was paid for a property in Sandringham in Sydney’s south.</p>
<p>“And we have such a shortage of properties compared to cities like Sydney and Melbourne … prices will continue to go up as people discover how great life here is.”</p>
<p>Many people also bought holiday homes with money saved by not travelling, with a recalibration of high-end values in traditional weekender areas such as Palm Beach, Dural and the Southern Highlands.</p>
<p>“They’ve been re-evaluating their lives and want a more relaxed time and a village lifestyle in places like Exeter or Burrawang.”</p>
<p>As for 2022, most experts agree that the pace of price growth is likely to slacken as a great deal more supply comes online, adding to record numbers of back-to-back listings.</p>
<p>“So in summer and autumn there will be better buying conditions, and people who missed out before might have more chance next year,” says Dr Powell. “Demand will certainly slow down.”</p>
<p>That will come sooner rather than later if interest rates rise towards the end of 2022 or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) tightens regulations still further.</p>
<p>As of last month, buyers’ borrowing capacity needs to be assessed at 5.5 per cent instead of a loan rate of, say, 2.5 per cent, and that could be tightened further still.</p>

<div>‘Doesn’t make sense’: Trophy home ripple effect spreads across Sydney</div>
<p>When a waterfront house in Palm Beach sold in November for about $27 million it excited locals, and shocked property watchers, given it was the most expensive house sale in the state outside the eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Christie’s International’s Ken Jacobs. “It might have made sense before the Harbour Bridge was built, but it doesn’t make sense now.”</p>
<p>Mr Jacobs said Sydney’s ultra-prestige values have soared in the almost 10 years since 2013, placing Sydney firmly on the international trophy home map.</p>
<p>“But what the experts from afar don’t realise is that it’s not NSW’s trophy market performing at that level. It’s just homes in a tiny pocket of the east.”</p>
<p>Byron Bay’s booming holiday home market saw a house on Wategos Beach sell for $22 million a year ago, just months after Jen Hawkins set a Northern Beaches record in Newport at $24.5 million.</p>
<p>“Maybe the gap is narrowing and that comes from younger money entering the market, but it’s also coming from a more decentralised idea of what makes a top suburb,” said prestige valuer Paul Donovan, of Pontons.</p>
<p>Mr Donovan points to the recent sale of a house opposite Bronte Beach for $23.388 million as a case in point.</p>
<p>Tamarama’s house record has also cracked the trophy market with a $25 million sale, and an oceanfront block of five apartments sold for $29.2 million.</p>
<p>Mosman came close to securing a sale of almost $40 million this year when the Iluka Road residence of investment banker Steve Bellotti was listed with Atlas’ Michael Coombs.</p>
<p>The price difference from one side of the harbour to the other isn’t lost on buyers. Mr Coombs said before the pandemic he would be lucky if 10 per cent of his buyers came from the eastern suburbs, but that had risen to 25 per cent.</p>
<div>Sydney’s most contested swamp inches closer to sale</div>
<p>Staffers conceded at a community briefing in November that the properties would still be inundated by 30 to 50 centimetres of water in a one-in-100 year storm event. Seven properties would need to be built on concrete piers.</p>
<p>A council staffer told Haberfield Association president Vince Crow that the council had to approve the drainage works or it would leave itself open to litigation by the Defence Department.</p>
<p>Only four parties who bought lots at the 2001 continue to hold their options over the land, with all the rest rescinding their offers in the intervening years.</p>

<div>‘It’s going to annihilate our view’: War over boarding house</div>
<p>That’s because directly behind them on Billyard Avenue, the long-standing landowners are planning to erect a six-storey, 29-room boarding house that would block views from the Pomeroy up to at least the third floor.</p>
<p>The properties were the subject of an old dispute over the removal of several Norfolk pine trees, which ended up in court in 2015.</p>
<p>Roula Sfeir, who moved into the Pomeroy just 18 months ago and lives on the second floor, was “absolutely devastated” about the boarding house proposal.</p>
<p>Plenty of Sydney personalities have bought into the Pomeroy, including the building’s architect Susan Rothwell, Bruce Sutton of the Sutton Motors empire and Lisa Keighery, widow of Marcs founder Mark Keighery.</p>
<p>Skye Leckie, widow of the late David Leckie, settled on her Macleay Street-facing unit just weeks ago, while the penthouse is owned by former liquor entrepreneur John Piven-Large.</p>
<p>“We’ve both been pretty successful and if we can give back a little bit – this sounds like a tired old cliche – we’re happy to do so,” he says.</p>
<p>Mr Pooley then commissioned a huge banner saying “TREE KILLERS” and attached it to his roof, facing the Pomeroy building. “We’ve become firm enemies with Pomeroy ever since,” he says.</p>
<p>But he hastens to add that if he wanted revenge over the felled trees, putting up a six-storey boarding house was “a very expensive way of doing it, mate”.</p>
<p>Not leaving anything to chance, the Pomeroy’s residents have appointed a sub-committee of the owners’ corporation to take up the fight, and hired a lawyer, architect, town planner and heritage consultant.</p>
<p>The committee’s leader, veterinarian Raoul Wanner, who lives on the third floor, said the planned development would be particularly devastating for residents on the ground level.</p>
<p>Ms Rothwell, the Pomeroy architect, said residents had requested view-loss montages, and she was holding fire until she saw them. “Views are funny things, you can’t really assess them until you get the information.”</p>
<div>Where buyers splashed the most cash on sea changes last year</div>
<p>City dwellers poured cash into coastal property amid last year’s lockdowns, and the trend is showing no signs of slowing amid the Omicron outbreak.</p>
<p>When measured by the areas with the highest total value of sales in 2021, according to CoreLogic figures the most popular regional town in NSW was Port Macquarie on the Mid North Coast.</p>
<p>For regional Victoria, Ocean Grove topped the list for highest total value of sales, while on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, families flocked to Buderim, which is set back a touch from the beach but still offers the same lifestyle.</p>
<p>And as corporate Australia again sets up the home office amid the Omicron outbreak, real estate agents are fielding continued demand for seaside retreats.</p>
<p>“The volume of buyers we’re seeing is just huge,” Port Macquarie-based Michelle Percival, principal of Percival Property, said.</p>
<p>“As soon as the property goes live on the internet it’s like a flood – it’s a flood of enquiries, it’s a flood of buyers.”</p>
<p>Port Macquarie recorded almost $714 million in total sales over the 12 months to September, across 887 transactions, with a new median house value of just over $844,000 by November last year, CoreLogic data showed.</p>
<p>Many buyers are moving from Sydney, Ms Percival said, or regional NSW or Brisbane, and are looking for home offices and ocean views.</p>
<p>“They always need a good base to live or to come home to or to be able to be locked down in – I think that’s never going to leave people now,” she said.</p>
<p>“People have realised they can spend more time with their family, they can be just as productive at home as they can be in the office.”</p>
<p>Tree-changes were also popular, with total sales in Orange reaching $619 million and Bowral $505 million.</p>
<p>But further south, Melburnians flocked to Ocean Grove, with a sharp rise in enquiries after each lockdown.</p>
<p>The seaside town recorded more than $485 million in total sales in a year, across 466 transactions, to hit a median house value of $1.18 million, CoreLogic found.</p>
<p>“It’s been the strongest it’s ever been,” Fletchers Bellarine’s Liam Rock said.</p>
<p>“Each time Melbourne went into lockdown and then came out, that’s when it ticked along.”</p>
<p>With plenty of buyers, most homes are selling under competition, some within a couple of days or a week, he said.</p>
<p>Talk of rising interest rates could slow price growth, but there are plenty of potential buyers at open homes for now, he added.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down.”</p>
<p>Further along the coast, Torquay was also a popular spot, recording more than $400 million in sales, while Highton in Geelong reached $347 million.</p>
<p>South East Queensland has been drawing interest from southern buyers since the pandemic hit, despite border restrictions that have made in-person inspections an intermittent prospect.</p>
<p>Buderim on the Sunshine Coast recorded the highest total sales for a regional area in the state, at almost $748 million across 746 transactions, with a median house value of nearly $1.05 million.</p>
<p>Ray White Buderim’s Ellen Lorenz has seen interest from across NSW and Victoria, as well as remote workers leaving Brisbane for a lifestyle change.</p>
<p>The market is hot, with plenty of buyers taking up the available listings.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy really,” she said. “It’s been great for Buderim as a whole.</p>
<p>“We do still have quite a lot of stock compared to this time last year, it’s just that buyer demand is higher and it’s been snaffled up quickly.”</p>
<p>Families like the area as it offers large land sizes and a quiet lifestyle within 10 minutes of the beach, Ms Lorenz said, adding it has the feel of a country town plus sought-after public and private schools.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, holiday favourite the Gold Coast was also popular, including Hope Island (near $689 million), Broadbeach Waters ($577 million) and Surfers Paradise (over $468 million).</p>
<p>Even in virus-free Western Australia, the towns that clocked the highest value of sales were largely weekender escapes down the coast from Perth.</p>
<p>Dunsborough topped the list at $226 million, followed by Margaret River at $207 million, Australind at $165 million and West Busselton at $138 million.</p>

<h3><a>Planning restrictions, not investors pushing up prices: housing affordability chair</a></h3>
<p>Liberal MP Jason Falinski says some of the biggest factors pricing young and low-income people out of the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets tend to relate to supply rather than high demand.</p>
<div>‘We’re conning young people’: The double whammy trapping first home buyers</div>
<p>Renters are facing a double whammy of rising rents and soaring house prices, combining to make it harder to get a foot on the property ladder.</p>
<p>It now costs $50 a week more than it did a year ago to rent the median house in Sydney, Domain figures released last week show, while apartment rents rose $20 a week.</p>
<p>Sarah King was saving hard to buy a home and then her rent shot up by about $100 a week.</p>
<p>“My husband and I had a really serious savings plan,” the 40-year-old said. “We’ve had to reduce it the last few months since we’ve moved, because of increasing costs.”</p>
<p>Ms King and her husband, 43, managed to pay a deposit on an off-the-plan home last month but are still saving towards the stamp duty bill which is due when it settles next year.</p>
<p>They were given notice to leave their Potts Point apartment mid-last year and faced a competitive market, eventually securing a Bondi rental for about $100 more a week.</p>
<p>“Getting into the property market is important to us so that we have something of our own,” she said. “It’s been that balance for years of perpetually renting and not being able to save enough for a home deposit.”</p>
<p>Like many Sydneysiders, she is grateful for a modest gift from her mother and, like a growing number of young people, she looked for a way to boost her savings when bank deposits pay scant interest.</p>
<p>Ms King works as the head of advice and client care at online investment adviser Stockspot and used the service herself to invest.</p>
<p>“We’re helping a lot of clients save for a house deposit by investing, it’s hugely popular,” she said.</p>
<p>The Australia Institute chief economist Richard Denniss said it was an “enormous challenge” to try to buy a home in the face of rising rents and rising property prices, highlighting the tax concessions on offer to investors.</p>
<p>“No one should be surprised that investors who are bidding up the price of houses are substantially increasing the rents they’re charging. That’s the plan,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think house prices are too high and it would be good if they went down, but no politician wants to say that out loud because two-thirds of Australians either own a house or are paying one off.</p>
<p>“We’re conning young people. We’re pretending we’re trying to solve a problem, but for two-thirds of the Australian population, they don’t feel a problem.”</p>
<p>Mr Denniss called for reform of the capital gains tax discount – a position now rejected by both major political parties – and for policymakers to reconsider the complete exemption of the family home from capital gains tax.</p>
<p>He also suggested a rethink of public housing.</p>
<p>“Defence Housing Australia, for example, provides low-cost housing to tens of thousands of defence force personnel. Why couldn’t we do that for teachers, nurses and aged care workers?”</p>
<p>Mortgage broker Aaron Christie-David is seeing first-home hopefuls trying to save while a chunk of their incomes go towards rent and house prices rise.</p>
<p>To fast track a deposit, more and more buyers are getting gifts from the Bank of Mum and Dad, he said.</p>
<p>Buyer’s agent John Carew is also seeing parental assistance as a “really common” feature of the market now, as Baby Boomers bring forward their transfer of wealth to priced-out offspring.</p>
<p>Some potential buyers are living with family to cut costs, but both scenarios – living at home or looking at the size of their rent bill every month – motivate potential buyers to find their own place, he said.</p>
<p>“There does seem to be a bit of upward pressure on rents now in Sydney,” the Mayfield Property Buyers founder said. “They say, ‘rent money’s dead money, we just want to get into the market’.”</p>

<div>Bye bye borders, hello buyers as visitors to Queensland purchase homes</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Victorian and NSW residents sick of lengthy lockdowns rented Queensland accommodation in their droves, and now many have chosen to buy homes in the Sunshine State.</p>
<p>“There was always that question of whether they would remain, or would move back to their state or territory of origin.</p>
<p>“But we’re nearly two years down the track, and we’re seeing a significant amount of those people staying here. In many cases, those renters are now buying in Queensland.”</p>
<p>Since Saturday morning, interstate travellers have not needed a border pass or a negative test, and the unvaccinated have avoided quarantine.</p>
<p>With domestic borders fully open, the future of the state’s tourism and real estate industries is suddenly looking brighter.</p>
<p>Ms Mercorella said January was historically a quiet period for property agents, but demand from interstate buyers remained high.</p>
<p>The strongest demand was coming from NSW and Victoria and, with the border rules gone, this was expected to increase, according to the REIQ.</p>
<p>“Queensland offers affordability compared to Melbourne and Sydney, the state also has liveability - particularly in the throes of COVID when people are looking for a better quality of life,” she said.</p>
<p>Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said the recovery for the tourism industry would not be quick.</p>
<p>“The outlook has changed, but there are still a few twists and turns in front of us – the increase in Omicron infections keeping people at home and the staff challenges that have emerged,” he said.</p>
<p>“But we have a very strong future ahead. What we have to offer is more valued than it has been in the past – open spaces, open water, clean air, and a diversity of experiences.</p>
<p>“The recovery will certainly be at a variety of speeds, there will be consumer hesitancy to travel too far from home, so it will take a little bit of time, but I think the future is bright.”</p>
<p>A Brisbane Airport Corporation spokeswoman said there was no significant increase in interstate flights arriving at the weekend with the eased border restrictions, and a travel boom was not expected until the wave of Omicron infections subsided.</p>
<p>“There was more of an increase in domestic passengers pre-Christmas than there is at the moment, so it is very much a case of slowly improving passenger confidence while still dealing with the pandemic [and] Omicron.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said the health response to the virus went hand in hand with the state’s economic response.</p>
<p>“We have seen the economic benefits that have come to our state - 100,000 jobs created since the pandemic started. It is just in the last quarter that NSW and Victoria have got back into positive job creation,” he said.</p>

<div>Investa inks lease deal of the year as office markets steady</div>
<p>Major landlord Investa Commercial Office Property Fund has inked one of the significant deals of the year to retain insurance giant Aon in Sydney after leasing markets were hard hit by the pandemic and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Aon has signed for a five-year term over 7236 square metres starting in late 2022. The deal will include keeping the well-known signage at what is known as the Maritime Trade Towers complex.</p>
<p>The deal is seen as one of the most significant for the Sydney market this year as it began and ended in the shadow of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Michael Cook, group executive property, said retaining Aon was a major objective for the firm during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The deal was completed by Investa’s Liam Stewart and Colliers Frank Sassine and Dean Bracken.</p>
<p>“Business confidence held up during the most recent lockdown, while labour market surveys showed the majority of organisations were seeking to increase headcount,” Mr Ballantyne said.</p>
<p>For Melbourne, JLL head of office leasing Tim O’Connor said despite the positive net absorption result in the third quarter, leasing market sentiment remains challenging in the CBD.</p>
<p>“However, the lifting of restrictions on leasing inspections has started to improve activity, and we expect enquiry levels will increase over the latter part of 2021 and into 2022,” Mr O’Connor said.</p>
<div>Big investors chase stable childcare assets</div>
<p>The Agosta family is expecting to reap more than $30 million from the sale of three new Nino childcare centres in Melbourne, two of which are still under construction.</p>
<p>The portfolio, focused on the north and the north-eastern suburbs, is only the second to hit the market this year.</p>
<p>The first, a 12-centre portfolio developed by Allaf Property, sold this week for $98 million to Home Consortium’s ASX-listed HealthCo Healthcare Wellness real estate trust.</p>
<p>CBRE, Burgess Rawson and Savills handled the transaction which is an indicator of how highly regarded childcare investments have become.</p>
<p>“Childcare centres have become the new bank; COVID and recessionary-proof in terms of avoiding disruption, heavily subsidised by the Commonwealth and featuring long leases with built-in increases,” CBRE’s Sandro Peluso said.</p>
<p>Mr Peluso, along with Jimmy Tat and Marcello Caspani-Muto, are also running the Nino portfolio expressions of interest campaign.</p>
<p>The three centres are located at 27 Livingston Street, Ivanhoe, 2 Whiteleaf Drive, Mickleham and 162 Elevation Boulevard in Craigieburn.</p>
<p>The Mickleham centre opened this week while the other two should be ready for the pitter-patter of tiny feet in February next year.</p>
<p>When fully operating, the portfolio will return an estimated annual income of $1.55 million.</p>
<p>By the time the new centres open, there will be 16 Nino Early Learning Adventures centres across Melbourne. The agents have sold 12 of them for a total of more than $200 million.</p>
<p>Blazer Clothing founder Peter Murray is expecting at least $40 million for his Cremorne landholding.</p>
<p>It’s the second large parcel of prime Cremorne land to hit the market this month.</p>
<p>Mr Murray amassed the 3538 sq m site at 31-53 Cremorne Street over the past six years. Records show he bought 33-37 from the Schwartz family in 2018 for $10 million and 33-37 from Micheal Gannon in 2015 for $2.875 million.</p>
<p>The state land registry reveals Mr Murray put a caveat on number 31 in April.</p>
<p>Teska Carson agents Matthew Feld and Luke Bisset are handling the sale.</p>
<p>Last month, former Porsche dealer Alan Hamilton listed a large portion of the historic Bryant May match factory with expectations of more than $80 million.</p>
<p>Cremorne, dubbed “silicon Yarra”, has become home to numerous technology companies including Seek, MYOB, REA Group, Carsales and Domain.</p>
<p>A local developer has snapped up an 1100 sq m development site in Toorak, paying $7.4 million.</p>

<p>JLL agents Josh Rutman, Nick Peden, Tim Carr and MingXuan Li handled the deal.</p>
<p>Mr Peden said the buyer, who beat competition from off-shore groups, is planning to complete the permitted project.</p>
<p>Hotel developers Renzella group are offloading another of their hotels, this one in St Kilda, and should make more than $20 million on the deal.</p>
<p>Formerly the Bayside St Kilda, the property in the heart of the seaside suburb at 63-73 Fitzroy Street, near the corner of Jackson Street.</p>
<p>The three-level property is on a large 1924 sq m site, with 40 studio apartments, eight shops and a large car park out the back. The rooms were converted into six-12 months leaseholds last year when tourist numbers dried up.</p>
<p>Records show the Renzella’s Morraine Nominees bought the hotel for $2.55 million back in 1988 when Fitzroy Street last sported a seedy atmosphere.</p>
<p>The owners rode St Kilda’s wave of gentrification and then weathered the doldrums that followed with a sea of overseas tourists.</p>
<p>The property has a permit for a five-storey residential development designed by Cactus Architects on the car park. There is a three-level limit on the street frontage.</p>
<p>It’s half a kilometre to the beach and close to the new Victoria Pride Centre. Gurner’s luxury redevelopment, St Moritz, is around the corner.</p>
<p>Teska Carson agent Luke Bisset and Michael Ludski are handling the expressions of interest campaign which closes on November 10.</p>
<p>The pair sold Renzella’s South Yarra hotel in August for $22 million.</p>
<p>An investor has snapped up a strata office occupying half of level 11 and the rooftop of 343 Little Collins Street, paying $2.14 million.</p>
<p>The deal for the 208 sq m office and 164 sq m rooftop reflected a yield of 4.9 per cent and sold at $10,288 a sq m - quite a premium for the central CBD and really an indication of the development potential of the rooftop.</p>
<p>Colliers agents George Davies, Anthony Kirwan and Alexander Leggo negotiated the transaction, fielding five offers and 100 enquiries.</p>
<p>The property is leased to the Clinton Institute on a five-year lease returning $105,400 a year in rent.</p>
<p>The buyer is understood to be keen to develop the rooftop down the track.</p>
<p>The Colliers team also sold a level 1 of 362 Little Bourke Street last week for around $3 million. The 325 sq m office sold on a 14-day settlement.</p>
<p>Coming up, JLL is marketing level 7 of 21 Victoria Street, a building on the corner of MacKenzie Street overlooking the Carlton Gardens.</p>
<p>JLL agent Nick Peden, who is selling the property with Mark Stafford, Tim Carr and MinXuan Li, is expecting offers in the low $2 million range for the office.</p>
<p>Former auto-dealer Gary Lechte is selling the freehold of Bayside Chrysler Jeep Dodge in the heart of Frankston.</p>
<p>The 11,200 sq m property at 126-130 Dandenong Road comes with a lease to ASX-listed Eagers Automotive and returns more than $1.13 million a year in rent. It’s expected to fetch more than $20 million.</p>
<p>CBRE agents Nathan Mufale, David Minty, Scott Hawthorne and JJ Heng are marketing the property which is set amid a long strip of car yards in central Frankston.</p>
<p>“The offering spans several titles, with the owner acquiring the collection of assets over several decades. Opportunities of this scale in major activity centres are highly sought after and never found,” Mr Mufale said.</p>
<p>Records show the property was purchased by Mr Lechte’s Frankston Properties in 2001 for $3.35 million.</p>
<p>The landmark gateway site has recently been rezoned to Commercial 2 which allows for a range of future development potential.</p>

<div>Lendlease and Keppel REIT take $327m punt on North Sydney office growth</div>
<p>Global property giant Lendlease and Singapore-based Keppel REIT are taking a large bet on the growth of the North Sydney office market with the purchase of a $327.7 million tower development.</p>
<p>Ms Shirley Ng, deputy chief executive of Keppel REIT, said the deal will boost her company’s assets under management to $S9 billion across 11 properties in Singapore, Australia and South Korea.</p>
<p>“The investment will also see Keppel REIT expand strategically into North Sydney, a major commercial district with positive leasing dynamics,” she said.</p>
<p>It will expand Lendlease’s exposure to the area through its construction of the NSW government’s Victoria Cross metro station project.</p>
<p>Tom Mackellar, managing director of Lendlease development, said the strategic acquisition supports the diversification of the group’s commercial product offering and “unlocks prime floor space for our customers in North Sydney”.</p>
<p>“The Blue and William development will cater for our customers looking for high-quality office design on a smaller scale,” he said.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the pandemic, the area has recorded its third consecutive quarter of positive leasing demand in the third quarter of 2021, with new and refurbished buildings continuing to drive leasing activity.</p>
<p>In the Knight Frank Australia’s 2022 Outlook Report, chief economist Ben Burston said the pent-up demand for office space in 2022 would boost absorption rates and drive market recovery.</p>
<p>But he said the recovery will take place against a backdrop of an ongoing debate on workplace dynamics and uncertainty over businesses’ exact space requirements post-pandemic.</p>
<p>He added that new developments would be in demand as tenants would want offices designed to offer flexibility to attract staff away from home in the post-pandemic environment.</p>
<div>How to end a fixed-term lease early</div>
<p>Terminating a fixed-term lease can be a costly decision but, whatever your reasons for doing so, experts say the No.1 rule is to give plenty of notice of your intention to vacate.</p>
<p>The first step is to put in writing your plans to break your lease as soon as possible to help minimise disruption between the old and new tenant, according to Stone Real Estate ACT property management director Amanda Tehle.</p>
<p>However, Ms Milillo said her advice would always be that a tenant checks their lease agreement, as well as the governing body websites for information, because the length and terms of leases in some states could vary.</p>
<p>Readvertising the property for rent is a common cost for tenants choosing to vacate early, as well as a letting fee, which could be between one to two weeks’ rent.</p>
<p>Belle Property head of property management and escapes Melinda Cotton said tenants considering breaking their lease should carefully consider their decision.</p>
<p>“It’s not always wise to go to a higher rental property,” she said. “Tenants think, ‘Yes, I can afford to do it’, but don’t take into account if something were to happen.”</p>
<p>“Be careful about your reasons for moving into a property and give yourself a little wiggle room, financially.”</p>
<h3>Tips for terminating a lease</h3>
<li>Put the notice in writing (email is acceptable)</li>
<li>Include the full address of the property</li>
<li>Include details for the reasons for terminating the lease (particularly if related to specific grounds for termination detailed in the rental agreement or state rules)</li>
<li>Include the date you intend to vacate the property and a statement that the lease will end on that date</li>
<li>Give the landlord as much notice as possible, ensuring the notice period is adequate according to rules in your state</li>
<li>Request confirmation from the landlord or agent that the notice has been received</li>
<h3><b>State by state guide to breaking a lease</b></h3>
<p><b>ACT </b>Tenants in the first half of a tenancy agreement will incur a maximum fee of six weeks’ rent, and if the agreement is in the second half, it’s a maximum of four weeks’ rent.</p>
<p>“The penalty, though, can be shortened if we find a tenant in, say, week three of that six-week period. You would only pay up to the day prior to the new tenant starting,” said Ms Tehle.</p>
<p>If a new tenant moves in during that period, landlords may charge administrative costs, such as advertising fees, from the vacating tenant up to a maximum of one week’s rent.</p>
<p>Minimum notice periods depend on the reason for terminating the fixed agreement.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the ACAT website, or read The Renting Book, the guide to rental laws in the ACT</li></ul>
<p><b>NSW </b>For leases entered into on or after March 23, 2020, break fees are regulated and based on the stage of the agreement. The set fee payable is:</p>
<li>four weeks’ rent if less than 25 per cent of the agreement has expired;</li>
<li>three weeks’ rent if 25 per cent or more but less than 50 per cent of the agreement has expired;</li>
<li>two weeks’ rent if 50 per cent or more but less than 75 per cent of the agreement has expired;</li>
<li>one week’s rent if 75 per cent or more of the agreement has expired.</li>
<p>In certain circumstances, such as hardship, domestic violence or moving into social housing or aged care, tenants can break a fixed-term agreement without penalty by providing 14 days notice.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the Fair Trading website where you can view a sample termination notice, or get in touch with the Tenants’ Union of NSW</li></ul>
<p><b>Western Australia </b>Tenants who terminate a fixed lease early may have to pay rent or other reasonable costs (such as advertising) incurred by the landlord until a new tenant is found or the original tenancy period expires.</p>
<p>Tenants affected by family violence may terminate a tenancy agreement with seven days’ notice.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the Consumer Protection website</li></ul>
<p>If a tenant breaks a lease before the end date without proper reasons or a notice to terminate, they are responsible for paying rent until a new lease starts or until the end date of the lease, whichever happens first.</p>
<p>The owner must make reasonable attempts to try to find a new tenant, and the tenant will have to pay any advertising costs charged to the owner.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the Consumer, Building and Occupational Services website</li></ul>
<p><b>Northern Territory </b>Tenants who break a fixed-term lease will be liable to pay the loss of rent for the remainder of the lease or until the property is re-let, and may also have to pay fees such as advertising costs to the real estate agent.</p>
<p>Tenants should give landlords or agents as much notice as possible to arrange a new tenant before their departure date.</p>
<ul><li>For more information visit the Northern Territory government website</li></ul>
<p><b>Victoria </b>Tenants don’t have to pay a penalty for breaking a lease but they do have to cover costs such as re-advertising the property, and if the property is rented through an agent, a re-letting fee.</p>
<p>A rental agreement may include fees for breaking the agreement. If there are fees listed, the agreement must indicate the reason for the fees.</p>
<p>Tenants experiencing severe hardship can apply to VCAT to break a lease without paying fees.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the Consumer Affairs website or the Tenants Victoria website</li></ul>
<p><b>South Australia </b>Tenants who break a fixed-term lease are responsible for costs related to re-letting the property.</p>
<p>Landlords can claim loss of rent until the property is re-let, as well as advertising and re-letting fees charged to the landlord by an agent.</p>
<p>Formulas developed by the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT) must be applied to all advertising and re-letting costs. If the tenant breaks the lease in the first quarter of their lease term, full costs can be claimed.</p>
<ul><li>For more information, visit the South Australia government website</li></ul>
<p>Tenants experiencing excessive hardship may make an urgent application to QCAT for an order terminating the agreement, however, QCAT may still order compensation to be paid.</p>

<div>‘A landlord’s market’: Big drop in rentals signals tough times for tenants</div>
<p>Rental vacancy rates around Australia continue to be low and will probably tighten further over 2022, with a new report signalling good returns for investors but terrible tidings for tenants.</p>
<p>The number of vacant properties nationally has shrunk from 54,000 dwellings in December 2020 to 37,000 in December 2021, a 31 per cent reduction, which will further serve to depress the rental vacancy rate.</p>
<p>Compared to those, Sydney has a higher vacancy rate of 2.6 per cent, although much less than the 3.7 per cent recorded in December 2020, while Melbourne has the country’s highest rate overall of 3.2 per cent, down from 5.2 per cent.</p>
<p>“The smallest markets seem to be the ones most affected,” Dr Powell said. “Anyone trying to secure accommodation in Hobart is having huge problems, and especially those on lower incomes. It’s now been tight for some time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s better news for tenants wanting to live in Ku-ring-gai in the north, where the vacancy rate sits at 4.2 per cent, Canterbury in the south-west where it’s 4 per cent and Parramatta in the west at 3.9 per cent.</p>
<p>In Melbourne, the vacancy rate is down 2 percentage points from the peak of December 2020 following the extended lockdown. There were just over 16,000 estimated vacant rentals at the end of last month.</p>
<p>In the Melbourne CBD, the area worst hit by the pandemic where the vacancy rate almost reached 14 per cent last year, that’s now shrunk to 4.5 per cent.</p>

<div>The city where house rents are growing fastest in Australia</div>
<p>Rental prices for Brisbane houses have again skyrocketed to record heights, with new data revealing the Queensland hot spot outpaced every other capital in the country for annual growth last year, with experts warning there’s more to come.</p>
<p>For the Queensland capital, it’s also the biggest quarterly price jump in 15 years, with unit rents also rising by $10 over the past three months to reach a record high of $420 per week.</p>
<p>Brisbane is more expensive than Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth for house rents, with Canberra remaining the nation’s most expensive hub for tenants.</p>
<p>The report sums up a bumper year for Brisbane, with unprecedented rates of interstate migration fuelling record property price hikes that led to several suburbs across the city joining the million-dollar-median house price club.</p>
<p>Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell said the rate of migration, particularly from working families, placed pressure on the house rental market, and suggested the March 2022 quarter would likely mark yet another price milestone.</p>
<p>“Tenants could be staring down the barrel of weekly house rents of $490 or $500 over the next quarter,” Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>“We’re now in the busiest change period of the year and landlords can re-negotiate and they will be moving their rents to market rate.</p>
<p>“And with the international border re-opening hanging over our property markets, and with it the volume of overseas migrants moving into Australia … it’s going to place further demand on our rental and sales market.”</p>
<p>Dr Powell said all regions across Greater Brisbane climbed to record high house and unit rents over the December quarter, with a record rent price gap also clocked between house and unit asking prices.</p>
<p>“Families in their prime working years are the biggest demographic in terms of positive net influx into Brisbane and they want a family home,” she said.</p>
<p>The report further revealed that house rents in the Queensland capital’s inner-city east region are now the most expensive, after prices climbed 3.2 per cent to $640 per week.</p>
<p>“At this time of year, you usually have tenants moving out leading up to Christmas, so maybe per 500 properties you’d have two or three per cent available for re-let but that’s now basically zero,” Mr Curtain said.</p>
<p>“So there’s the domino effect … but also there’s the need for people to have accommodation that has greater flexibility than normal … somewhere they can work, live and entertain from.</p>
<p>“And with the explosion of the current COVID variant, we’ve seen even greater numbers of inspections for both sales and rentals [for spacious family homes].”</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic sparking a lifestyle shift towards bigger homes with a backyard, Domain data released last week showed Brisbane’s inner-city region claimed the nation’s largest monthly decline in vacancy rates over December.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of Sydney investors and a lot of people from the Sunshine Coast. Their property prices have increased dramatically, so they are looking to invest here.</p>
<p>“The fact that development has been put on hold means I think we’re going to definitely see a supply issue and a shortage of new properties being built which will increase if we get international students back in soon.”</p>
<p>The Domain December Rental Report revealed houses in Greater Brisbane’s Moreton Bay North region collected the largest quarterly rent rise of 12.5 per cent (or $50) to $450 per week.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, units in Logan’s Springwood/Kingston region topped the list for affordability, after prices remained stagnant at $285 over the quarter.</p>

<div>Melbourne house rents the nation’s cheapest despite record high</div>
<p>House rents in Melbourne have hit record highs, despite the Victorian capital’s economy enduring six COVID lockdowns and international migrants kept out of the local market by closed borders.</p>
<p>Released today, Domain’s December 2021 Rental Report shows that house rents jumped by 3.5 per cent, or $15 per week, over the December quarter, to a median $445, beating the former record set in December 2018 of $440.</p>
<p>Unit rents also rose by a more modest 1.4 per cent over the quarter, or $5 per week, to a $375-per week median, some $55 lower than the record set right before the full impacts of COVID were felt.</p>
<p>Though house rents are at a record high in Melbourne, they were still the cheapest of the capitals around the country, with other cities - including Adelaide - outstripping the rise.</p>
<p>Investors selling their homes to owner-occupiers, the resumption of short-term travel and a shift in tenants to more affordable inner-city rentals had seen the rental market tighten across the city.</p>
<p>Domain data showed the strongest performing regions were on the Mornington Peninsula, in the Inner South, the Outer East and the North West, where house rents rose over the quarter and the year.</p>
<p>Unit rents rose across all but four regions. The beleaguered inner-city market saw unit rents rise by 1.3 per cent over the quarter to a median $380 per week, pointing to signs of a recovery despite the lack of international students.</p>
<p>Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan said the rise in rents was “surprising” but that supply and demand for rentals was becoming more balanced as excess stock was snapped up by more people moving out of home.</p>
<p>Tenants are starting to see the market tighten and competition grow, with Melbourne renter Kris Mannix and his housemate struggling to find a rental after receiving notice they needed to move last year.</p>
<p>“We lived in an apartment block and our landlord was moving back in so we got told, ‘you got to get out’,” Mr Mannix said.</p>
<p>“We probably did 10 to 15 inspections, and we’d apply, and I think we only heard back from one, and it was a little two-bedroom place.”</p>
