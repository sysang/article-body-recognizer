<h1> How to plant climbers: A beginner's guide to planting clematis, roses and more </h1>
<p> Every week, Telegraph gardening expert Helen Yemm gives tips and advice on all your gardening problems whether at home or on the allotment </p>
<div> <div> By Helen Yemm <time> 22 June 2021 • 7:58pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Whereas in nature climbers use other plants to achieve often limitless heights, in a garden many of us plant them on walls and fences, to clamber over pergolas and up various free-standing structures. Here are some points to consider:</p>
<li>Space: Plant climbers at least 45cm away from a fence or wall to ensure they have enough root room/moisture. Be aware, particularly, of what is planted on the other side of fences (conifers? laurels?) that will provide damaging competition.</li>
<h3>Three things to avoid</h3>
<li>Don’t be tempted to shoehorn a needy, greedy climber into a strip of bad soil between a wall and path. It will probably die, and if by some miracle it doesn’t, it may end up blocking the path.</li>
<li>Beware of planting the most rampant clematis (C. armandii, C. montana) in a small space.</li>
<li>Many climbers are disappointing when grown in containers. There are some exceptions (e.g. compact clematis bred for the purpose), but most do best with deep cool root runs and even moisture, both hard to guarantee in a container. </li>
<p>We have a large rose bed that over the last five years has become inundated with a dark green, bristly grass. I am constantly digging it out – an utterly thankless task. Have you any ideas as to how I can get rid of it?</p>
<p>AG, Kent – via email</p>
<p>Your accompanying picture shows a nasty grasslike weed, field woodrush (aka Luzula campestris) that spreads by stolons (runners) and seed.</p>
<p>This will gradually make the soil less acidic and boost the organic content of your poor soil, thereby improving the roses as well as, hopefully, smothering the woodrush out of existence.</p>

<h3>Shrubs that never get going</h3>
<p>Another cause of yellowing and unhealthy-looking leaves is magnesium deficiency, corrected by a soil drench or foliar spray with magnesium sulphate (as in Epsom salts).</p>
<h4>2. Lack of water and/or nutrients</h4>
<p>An overnight dripping hose during droughts might hit the spot, too.</p>
<p>While some shrubs thrive in semi-shade, those that don’t will let you know by producing long, skinny shoots and fewer flowers. Small, young shrubs may need to be found more suitable, sunnier homes.</p>
<p>For shrubs that may have been happy once but have, over time, become overshadowed by other plants or trees, a partial solution might involve the pruning back or the raising of canopies of neighbouring offenders.</p>
<h4>Old, out-of-shape shrubs</h4>
<p>Nearly all old shrubs will produce new green shoots from ground level or from brown wood. But there are some exceptions: for example, slightly tender flowering evergreens such as hebes must be treated with caution.</p>
<p>The solution is to cut back their outer growth first in late spring, to allow the visible lower inner growth to toughen up and eventually take over.</p>
<p>Prune your repeat-flowering bush roses (hybrid tea, floribunda, and modern shrub roses, including English roses) in late February and March.</p>
<p>The same basic technique (obviously modified) applies to roses trained as standards. Clear up, feed and mulch afterwards.</p>
<h3>How do I stop my geraniums growing leggy?</h3>
<p>Hilary Webster – via email</p>
<h3>From playhouse to potting shed</h3>
<p>Gill Platt has ambitions to turn a part-glazed, octagonal, wooden, former garden playhouse into a greenhouse/potting shed to store overwintering dahlias, begonias, etc, as well as to nurture plug plants.</p>
<p>She asks what kind of heating would be needed – she doesn’t care for the idea of a paraffin heater and asks if it would be a good idea to install electricity.</p>
<p>Installing an electrical supply into a greenhouse or outhouse is fine, but there are certain regulations (easy to find online), and the work has to be signed off by a qualified electrician.</p>
<a> twowests.co.uk</a>) would be sufficient to keep the wooden shed frost-free, and would also make it an ideal place to overwinter tubers and other things that are not quite hardy (including dormant fuchsias, pelargoniums and so on).
<p>She needs to consider, too, that the changes in temperature all the to-ing and fro-ing would involve would be bound to affect their growth adversely. Maybe a simple cold frame outside would provide a good halfway house.</p>

<header> <h1> Top tips for fences and hedges - and how to avoid common mistakes in the garden </h1> <p> Plus an expert guide for tackling an acanthus with mildew and restraining a passionflower </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Yemm <time> 26 August 2021 • 11:50am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Many of us have decided that the time is right to tackle our gardens and outdoor spaces but don't know where to start. The solution to creating your own green oasis, however, might be simpler than you think.</p>
<p>Telegraph gardening expert Helen Yemm has given her top tips and advice for tackling your boundaries by using fences and hedges to create the perfect spot.</p>
<p>So, whether at home or on the allotment, take a look below to ensure that you avoid some of the most common mistakes.</p>
<p>Covering fences has its problems. If you must have climbers:</p>
<li>Don’t expect any of them to magically shinny, unaided, up a sheer 1.5m fence just to reach 30cm of trellis attached to the top of it. Slatted fencing, while being admirably windproof, is not very climber-friendly either. Therefore:</li>
<li>Summer jasmine and so-called evergreen honeysuckle are particularly difficult, top-heavy plants for clothing fences. Neither flowers well after hard pruning (which they will eventually need). Check my planting suggestions for pergolas, below.</li>
<p>If you are planning wildlife-friendly hedges, or are lucky enough to have them already:</p>
<li>Leave an access path if they back a border, so you can more easily gain access to cut hedges, prune climbers and support/fiddle around with back-row plants.</li>
<li>Buy a tripod ladder (with an adjustable front leg) for hedge cutting. Get one a size up from the one you first thought of.</li>
<li>Cut hedges every other year to a point lower than the height you like them to be, so that cuts in between times are into soft growth.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to also take some lower growth out of hedges, to encourage fresh growth that will help maintain their bulk.</li>
<li>Spare a thought for your own and your neighbours’ eardrums and use quiet battery power: I have had a Bosch AHS 52LI trimmer (with a spare battery as a backup), for several years and it is still going strong.</li>
<h3>An acanthus with mildew</h3>
<p>For two years, since it was planted, my Acanthus mollis has failed to make the kind of statement I expected in my admittedly rather shady garden. How can I persuade it to work?</p>
<p>Rosy Williams – via email</p>
<p>Be sure to keep the plant well watered in hot, dry weather. Prevention of mildew is far easier than a cure, so a second spray with fungicide a few weeks after the first may be a sensible idea.</p>
<h3>How to keep a passionfruit tidy</h3>
<p>There really isn’t a right or wrong about this. While it generally does not die back in winter, a mature passionflower of this kind gradually starts to produce, as it ages, less greenery from its lower half and more from its extremities.</p>
<p>It did, although admittedly it flowered and fruited rather later than it would have done if it were treated more cautiously.</p>

<p>Moving to a new garden in later life gives you a chance to ask different things from your outdoor space than perhaps you did when you and your family were younger.</p>
<p>Unlike clearing out the clutter accumulated in a house that you have lived in for many years, at least leaving a garden is a matter of deciding what you might take with you – the rest is left behind for the next owners to deal with.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you have to be realistic, though, and realise a plant is not going to survive the move, or the conditions will be completely wrong, so, as with that family home, you just have to say goodbye: there’s another chapter ahead.</p>
<h2>Peter and Rose Hargreaves moved from Somerset to Clifton, Bristol: ‘The old house was a big place to leave and lock up’</h2>
<p>The Hargreaveses bought the Georgian town house, which is a short walk from their son, daughter and grandchildren, two years ago and moved from Chew Magna in February.</p>
<p>And as Mr Hargreaves concludes, “I went round to have a look at the old garden about six weeks ago – and I didn’t want it back.”</p>

<h2>A downsizer’s guide to energy-efficient design</h2>
<p>Confined to a terrace or patio? There is much you can grow in pots, including herbs and vegetables; the bigger the pots, the less bending down and watering you will have to do.</p>
<p>Grow bulbs such as daffodils that will come up every year, so have to be planted only once, says Jo Thompson. They are just as cheery as one-time-only tulips.</p>
<p>You can never have too much seating: raised beds and terrace walls can double up. Make sure there is somewhere in the shade as well as the sun.</p>
<p>A table can double up as a worktop. Evergreens planted nearby, such as daphne or viburnum, will not only be low-maintenance and provide year-round form, but pump out scent on a winter’s day.</p>
<p>If there is a choice between a hedge and a wall or fence, take the last two, says Thompson. Then you don’t have to worry about cutting it back every year, or bringing in someone to do it.</p>

<p>Though climatically tender in the UK, strelitzia – I now see – is in spirit more evocative of resilience.</p>
<h2>How to grow bird of paradise</h2>
<p>The bird of paradise makes a fantastic year-round indoor conservatory plant, but can be grown outdoors in the UK during the summer and brought inside for winter.</p>
<p>Grow in a good-sized pot, as both commonly grown species of strelitzia – S. reginae and S. nicolai (the latter is white-flowered) – become large plants. Soil-based compost is best, incorporating grit for drainage.</p>
<p>A room with lots of bright, warm sunshine.</p>
<p>Moisten foliage using a mist spray in summer, and repot into fresh compost in spring. Water more sparingly during the winter, allowing the soil to dry before replenishing.</p>
<p>Sowing Roots is at the Garden Museum, London, until Feb 20 2022 (gardenmuseum.org.uk)</p>

<p>Repeat customers include Kew and fellow botanical gardens across the UK, national plant collections and RHS Wisley.</p>
<p>He told John, the owner’s son, that to landscape the site would take a lot of work.</p>
<p>Peter bought the site for £32,000, taking out a mortgage on the cottage and a bank loan for the land.</p>
<p>Peter decided that the best way to succeed was to fill a niche in the market by stocking rare plants.</p>
<p>“I didn’t actually visit Italy until 1994. I went outside at 5am and the sun was rising over Rome, and I burst into tears because it just felt like I’d come home. My heart belongs in Italy,” he says.</p>
<p>If Peter is the creative brain, Jo, 44, is the lynchpin, who, in between being a mother, keeps it all running smoothly.</p>
<p>“I’m the driving force, Jo comes along behind, picking up all the pieces,” says Peter. Their income derives from plant sales and they survive because they propagate most of what they sell and offer a vast range.</p>
<p>“A lot of small nurseries would ­specialise in one plant, but when that fell out of fashion, </p>
<p>would fail. So I made the nurseries feel like a garden centre without actually being one,” says Peter.</p>
<p>Lockdown was tough, but they ­survived because most of the staff were on furlough, and they sold plants online.</p>
<p>“Why not? Isn’t it much nicer to get married in your own chapel than someone else’s?” says Peter. They have been asked many times to use the chapel as a wedding business, but have refused.</p>
<p>“Not everything’s about money, you know,” says Peter.</p>
<p>He and Jo are delighted to win the RHS award. “I also find it very humbling, because we just do what we do here, and if people like that, then that feels good,” says Peter.</p>
<p>While Jo admits that Peter’s passion for constant change is an advantage in that returning visitors enjoy seeing new things, it can also be a source of friction.</p>
<p>“I don’t like change, but I just have to go along with it,” says Jo.</p>
<p>“Jo and I are opposites,” admits Peter. “Which is just as well, because if we were alike it would be chaos.”</p>
<p>He says he changes things to improve their quality. “For me, my favourite bit of all this is the idea to do something that I’ve not yet done.”</p>
<p>So, I ask Jo, what’s next on the agenda?</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Peter won’t tell me that. He just changes something while pulling the rug from under my feet,” she says.</p>
<p>Peter claims that he is being propelled by a greater force: “I just follow my passion. I am but a spade in the hands of God.”</p>

<header> <h1> How Brexit and Covid changed the gardening industry </h1> <p> The British horticulture industry has weathered Covid and the early days of Brexit – but is it facing clear skies or storms up ahead? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Appleby <time> 18 December 2021 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<h2>In six words, what has 2021 been like?</h2>
<p>Successful, demanding, uncertain… shortages, delays, inflation. And one more: complicated.</p>
<h2>What were the high points?</h2>
<p>This year’s gardening boom echoed that of the previous year: during March-May 2020’s lockdown, three million people, looking to better their mental and physical health (or maybe they were just bored), started gardening.</p>
<h2>…and the low points?</h2>
<p>Brexit restrictions on EU workers entering the UK resulted in a labour shortage, so crops such as daffodils – up to one-third of stems this spring – were left in the fields unpicked.</p>
<h2>Have we seen the full impact of Brexit yet?</h2>
<h2>Will I notice any differences at my local garden centre?</h2>
<p>Prices will be higher – the cost of transport, raw materials and labour (you get the picture) are all up because of worldwide demand post-Covid. (Or Brexit, depending on whether you’re a Remoaner or not.)</p>
<h2>Is there sunshine ahead?</h2>
<p>Allotments are also in demand and all products related to grow-your-own are popular, thanks to greater interest in wellbeing and food security.</p>
<p>Social media sharing of urban houseplant jungles has helped bring a new generation of millennials into gardening. The big question is, how long will these gardening newcomers last in a post-lockdown world?</p>
<h2>Will gardening be more or less important next year?</h2>
<p>This is where it gets political. Gardening has risen up the political agenda due to its increasing importance to the public for physical exercise and mental health during lockdown.</p>
<p>But while the garden industry has had a short-term boost, in the longer term a lack of workers means that filling the import gap will be tricky. There were 1.17m job vacancies in the UK in the three months to October.</p>
<p>However, critics such as Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee chair Neil Parish MP says the result will be more imports of food and plants – the opposite of what Brexit was supposed to be about.</p>
<h2>Impending government policy that affects gardeners</h2>
<p>This is what biosecurity crackdowns on plant imports involve:</p>
<li>Phytosanitary certificates – documents issued in the country of origin that prove the consignment is biosecure</li>
<li>Pre-notification – you must give the responsible authority advance notice each time you import regulated plants and plant products from the EU to Great Britain</li>
<li>Document checks – an inspector examines official certifications and documents (these take place away from the border)</li>
<li>Identity checks – an inspector confirms that the content and labelling of the goods match the information provided in certifications and documents</li>
<li>Physical checks – an inspector checks the health of the plants, the consignment’s packaging, means of transport and labelling, and will help you with any other tests you may need</li>

<p>There is a temptation (which I fall into most years) to think that in winter the garden goes to sleep and growth stops so we can forget about some of our routines.</p>

<header> <h1> The hidden planning permission you need to build in your garden in 2021 </h1> <p> It is worth knowing what planning permission you need before you knock down a wall or dig up a pool </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Bunny Guinness <time> 23 December 2021 • 12:04pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It is not uncommon that garden makeovers or alterations need planning approval or listed-building consent before they go from paper to plot.</p>
<p>And, since 2020, enforcement officers have been inundated with complaints from a public who, having spent more time around their home territory, reported far more issues related to <a>home and garden improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Some improvements are being made without necessary consents: sheds morph into home offices; new tree houses roost in branches; privacy screens shoot up; outdoor entertaining areas, complete with sheltering structures, colonise back gardens.</p>
<a>extent of a development</a> and therefore whether it has gained immunity from enforcement action.
<p>But it is often not clear exactly what needs permission, and indeed according to one of my local planning enforcement officers, in many instances planning legislation is by no means black and white.</p>
<p>When householders are suspected of not having the right consents before building, feelings can get extremely heated, with vitriol often expressed on social media and local WhatsApp groups.</p>
<p>I have heard cases of newcomers objecting to neighbours’ planning applications and being lambasted by the village worthies for doing so, despite the fact that the proposals potentially affect the incomer’s property.</p>
<p>One of my clients bought a field intending to extend their garden to have extra lawn, but they were ordered to stop the regular mowing of it as this meant it was no longer in agricultural use.</p>
<p>In another case the owners were refused permission to create a garden on their adjoining paddock so they built a vegetable garden and greenhouse on it, which was deemed to be acceptable as this qualified as horticultural production.</p>
<p>If you have developed something without permission, you can be made to remove it unless you have had 10 years of unbroken use.</p>
<h2>The planning permissions you need</h2>
<p>Boundary heights for gardens are fairly clear in planning law. You can make a boundary fence 2m high unless it is adjacent to a highway; then 1m is your limit.</p>
<p>In many appeal cases such as these, both sides produce a written statement and then a judgment is made – although about 70 per cent of the cases are settled on the side of the planning authority.</p>
<p>With the restrictions on boundary-fence heights you can well understand the huge popularity of pleached trees to hide neighbouring eyesores.</p>
<p>These trees, grown with a straight clear trunk and a canopy that begins some distance above ground so that it does not spread across precious garden space, can be trained so that their leafy part starts and finishes exactly at the required points.</p>
<p>Tennis courts need planning permission for several reasons, according to consultant <a>Mark Jarman</a>, who specialises in planning work related to tennis courts and swimming pools.</p>
<p>If a court is to be within the curtilage of a listed building then it may, but not necessarily, need listed-building consent too, but only if there is an impact on the listed structure.</p>
<h2>Garden sheds, wildlife pools and treehouses</h2>
<p>Garden sheds and home offices are usually within permitted development rights as long as they are not bigger than 15 sq m, not used for sleeping in, and do not take up more than 50 per cent of the garden.</p>
<p>Wildlife pools can be construed as engineering works – again, it is all about scale and the amount of earth being moved. As ever, do check with your local planning officer first.</p>
<p>It can be tricky to determine whether tree houses need planning permission or not. If you are planning to build a large structure for your children, then it is pretty straightforward that you do.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you keep them more than 2m from the boundary and generally restrict the height to 4m it might not be necessary. In many cases though I usually get clarification from the planners before we finalise the design.</p>
<p>If you are intending to pave your front garden and the area is larger than 5 sq m, the paving is to be of an impermeable material such as stone, and the subsequent rain run-off will not be absorbed in the garden, you will need planning permission.</p>
<p>Usually it is easy to direct the rainwater run-off into adjacent beds or grass areas, so very often permission is not required. Generally this is the case in the majority of existing front gardens.</p>
<p>Many people have complained that getting any information from their planning officers has been extremely difficult during the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Tip for before you start construction</h2>
<li>Always check with the local planning office if you are unsure whether you need planning or listed-building permission – it can be a grey area. In my experience planning officers are very helpful.</li>
<li>Check that the whole garden is within your domestic curtilage. If some is not, then you will not automatically have permitted development rights on the parts that are not in this category.</li>

<header> <h1> A beginner's guide to planting fruit trees in your garden </h1> <p> Winter is actually the prime time for planting, as trees lay dormant and are less likely to be stressed by the process </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tom Brown <time> 20 December 2021 • 12:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Apple and pear trees can be grown in many shapes; the most common are listed here.</p>
<a>very heavy or chalky ones</a> may need a few wheelbarrows of
<a>well-rotted compost</a> or manure forked in to help things along.
<li>Pick a spot in your garden that has a good amount of sunlight for most of the day, away from roots of large trees. If planting against a wall, pears favour a south-facing wall and apples will be happy with east-and west-facing aspects.</li>
<li>Before planting, I recommend plunging the roots or root ball into water for two hours and cutting back any damaged roots on bare-rooted trees.</li>
<li>If your tree comes as a bare root specimen (ie lifted from growing in the open ground, sold without soil around its roots), support it with a vertical stake driven into the ground to the side of the main trunk.</li>
<li>If your tree is in a pot, then drive the stake into the ground at a 45-degree angle, with the tip into the prevailing wind. For both methods, the height of the stake should be just below the lowest branch of the tree.</li>
<p>Very few apples are self-fertile, meaning that they cannot produce fruit from their own pollen. The majority need a pollination partner (this explains why lone fruit trees often produce poorly).</p>
<h2>Shapes for fruit trees</h2>
<li>A free-standing tree, as seen growing in a lawn or border, which can be viewed from all sides and has a canopy (a good option for beginners).</li>
<li>Cordons, which are usually when a single stem is encouraged (through pruning) to grow at a 45-degree angle against a wall. This allows trees to be grown in a small space (more of a challenge to train). </li>
<li>Espaliers are a form of pruning, usually against a wall, where we encourage a central stem with a series of well-spaced, horizontal branches and the growth is restricted to retain the shape (again, more of a challenge). </li>
<li>Step-over trees are often used to line a path. A central stem is trained to knee height and then a single horizontal stem is trained left and right to form a tree that you can “step over”.</li>
