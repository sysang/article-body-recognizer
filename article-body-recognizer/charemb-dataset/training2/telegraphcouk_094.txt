<h3>Why masks could be on planes forever</h3>
<p>Telegraph Travel's Oliver Smith has offered a New Year prediction: masks will remain on planes for a long time to come.</p>
<p>It’s that time of year when overconfident journalists make predictions. So here’s mine. Masks will remain a requirement for flying, not just for the rest of 2022, but for many years to come – and maybe even forever. </p>
<h3>Scrap testing rules for UK-bound passengers, urge travel firms</h3>
<p>The travel industry is calling on the Government to remove all testing requirements for international travellers, writes Gareth Davies.</p>
<p>Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and Airlines UK said research they commissioned into travel restrictions found domestic, not international, restrictions would be the only way to reduce the spread of omicron.</p>
<h3>China to test 13 million in city of Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>The city of Zhengzhou ordered its nearly 13 million residents to take Covid-19 tests Wednesday after a handful of cases were detected, as China fights to stamp out virus clusters ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Everyone in Zhengzhou must be tested to "thoroughly uncover infections hidden among the public", the city's government said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>The city has detected 11 cases in recent days.</p>
<p>The mass-testing order came as case numbers in the locked-down city of Xi'an fell to their lowest in weeks, with officials saying that outbreak had been "brought under control".</p>
<p>Xi'an's 13 million residents have been under stay-at-home orders for the last fortnight.</p>

<h3>Ireland axes tests for arrivals</h3>
<p>The Irish government is scrapping requirement for people to provide a negative PCR or antigen test to enter the country, reports Independent.ie. </p>
<p>Government sources told the news site that tests are longer needed given that omicron accounts for more than 95pc of Ireland's cases. </p>
<p>Passengers will still need to show their proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid, or a negative PCR test taken before departure.</p>
<h3>Thailand considers new Covid curbs</h3>
<p>Thailand is considering measures such as limiting large gatherings and banning alcohol sales in restaurants to discourage customers to avert a wave of infections, a health official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The country reported 3,899 cases on Wednesday, up from an average of 2,600 daily cases towards the end of last year, and the omicron variant itself has tripled from last month's holiday period, government data showed.</p>
<p>If measures like wearing masks and regular testing were not followed, infections could reach the "tens of thousands in the next two weeks," Sumanee Watcharasin, a spokeswoman for the country's coronavirus taskforce, said.</p>
<p>She said the government will decide on new curbs on Friday and also review the suspended "Test Go" scheme that allowed vaccinated arrivals to skip quarantine.</p>
<p>The quarantine-free programme for foreign passengers was halted on December 21, although travellers can still visit the island of Phuket through the Sandbox Scheme.</p>

<p>The low-cost carrier welcomed 9.5 million passengers in December 2021. </p>
<p>This was up from just 1.9 million year on December 2020, but down on the 10.2 million carried in November 2021.</p>
<p>Last month, Ryanair lowered its forecast for December traffic from between 10-11 million to 9-9.5 million, because of tighter travel restrictions imposed amid the rise of the omicron variant.</p>
<h3>Covid outbreak hits cruise ship in Italy</h3>
<p>Dozens of passengers were taken off a cruise ship in Genoa, Italy, after testing positive for Covid.</p>
<p>Some 45 guests disembarked the MSC Grandiosa this week in Genoa.</p>

<h3>Canada asks regulator to probe maskless party on Sunwing flight</h3>
<p>"I am aware of the reports of unacceptable behavior on a Sunwing flight," Alghabra said.</p>
<p>The Toronto-headquartered leisure operator said by email that the behavior of a group of passengers on the private charter flight "was unruly and contravened several Canadian aviation regulations as well as public health regulations." </p>
<p>Sunwing said it has cancelled the group's return flight to Montreal scheduled for Jan. 5 as a result of the carrier's investigation and due to a refusal by the group to accept all terms of carriage.</p>
<h3>'Travel bans and restrictions don't prevent infections coming into the UK'</h3>
<p>"I don't need to take any tests to travel from London to Edinburgh by train, where I mix with lots of people, so why should it be any different to travel from Brussels to London by train?</p>
<p>"Testing should only be done when I'm back in the UK and planning to visit relatives or go to a large event."</p>
<h3>Cyprus tightens entry rules</h3>
<p>Travellers to Cyprus must now produce a negative PCR Covid test taken within 48 hours of departure.</p>
<p>The new rule applies to all arrivals aged 12 or over, regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p>All travellers, except those who have received a booster shot, must also undergo a rapid antigen test on arrival.</p>
<p>Masks are also mandatory in public areas for everyone aged six or over.</p>

<p>The firm predicts that the manufacturing-led economic recovery will shift to one driven by leisure and tourism as foreign visitors return after enduring nearly two of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>In Spain, there are signs the industry is getting back on its feet, with tourists spending 678pc more in November than they did a year ago.</p>
<h3>Covid infects 214 on five cruise ships in Brazilian waters</h3>
<p>Five cruise ships in Brazilian waters have reported 214 cases among their crew and passengers, including two ships that are in quarantine in the port of Santos, health regulator Anvisa said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two ships run by the Swiss-Italian cruise line MSC Cruises, each with more than 3,000 passengers are due to arrive in Rio de Janeiro and Santos this week, the regulator said.</p>
<p>The MSC Seaside arriving on Thursday in Santos has reported 65 cases among crew members and 25 among passengers, while the MSC Preziosa due in Rio on Wednesday has 25 crew with COVID-19 and 8 passengers infected, Anvisa said.</p>
<p>Cruise ship companies suspended operations in Brazil until Jan. 21 after health authorities recommended against cruise ship travel following several offshore outbreaks of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Industry association CLIA said no ships will cast off during the "voluntary" suspension period, while those at sea will complete their voyages.</p>
<h3>How to prove you've recovered from Covid in order to travel</h3>
<p>Here’s everything that travellers need to know. </p>
<h3>Moroccan tour operators protest pandemic restrictions</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Moroccan tour operators threatened with bankruptcy due to border closures protested Tuesday, calling for the tourism industry to be "saved".</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>About 200 industry workers demonstrated in front of the tourism ministry in Rabat, demanding the reopening of borders and talks with the authorities, citing the "dramatic collapse" of the industry in the wake of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Lahcen Zelmat, head of the national federation of the hotel industry, said the situation for tourism was "catastrophic" and called for borders to be reopened and bank loan payments to be delayed.</p>
<p>Raja Ould Hamada, the owner of a travel agency in Marrakesh, said the most recent border closure was a "fatal blow" to the industry, claiming "other competing countries" such as Egypt, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had benefitted.</p>
<p>Rabat recently promised a 2,000-dirham (about $216) monthly allowance to tourism workers for the final quarter of 2021.</p>
<h3>Reminder: Germany has dropped quarantine for UK arrivals </h3>
<p>Germany has eased travel from the UK and South Africa by dropping them from its list of so-called areas of variants of concern.</p>
<p>Vaccinated travellers from those countries will no longer need to quarantine in Germany if they can show a negative test result before arrival.</p>
<h3>CDC keeps UK at top of 'do not travel' list</h3>
<p>The UK has remained on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Level 4 category since July 19. </p>
<p>This list, which rates countries on Covid-19 levels and risk of travel, was updated on January 4.</p>
<p>Aruba was the only new destination to be added to the 'do not travel' category. </p>
<p>There are 80 countries in this category, including France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.</p>
<h3>'Cruise to nowhere' ordered back to port in Hong Kong</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>A Hong Kong cruise ship carrying 3,700 people was ordered back to port on Wednesday for virus testing after nine people were found to be close contacts in an omicron variant outbreak. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Contact tracing efforts have reached the "Spectrum of the Seas", one of the vessels offering cooped-up Hong Kongers a "cruise to nowhere" that sails into international waters for short trips. </p>
<p>Health authorities said nine people on the cruise were classified as close contacts and ordered the ship back to port a day early. </p>
<p>All on board, including 2,500 passengers and 1,200 crew, must test negative before they can disembark.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong bans flights from eight countries, including UK</h3>
<p>Hong Kong announced strict new Covid controls on Wednesday, including banning flights from eight destinations, shutting bars and gyms and cancelling evening restaurant dining after the omicron variant was detected within the city.</p>
<p>Like mainland China, Hong Kong has maintained some of the world's harshest measures throughout the pandemic. These have included virtually closed borders, weeks-long quarantines, targeted lockdowns and mass testing.</p>
<p>Fights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, UK and US will be banned from midnight on Friday for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The latest rules take effect on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Israel reports all-time high for new cases, despite border closure</h3>
<p>Israel has recorded its highest-ever number of new Covid-19 infections, driven by the omicron variant, despite restrictions on travel and required quarantines, the government reported on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The record of 11,978 cases diagnosed on Tuesday marks the most new infections reported in a single day since the start of the pandemic. The previous record was set Sept. 2 with 11,345 new infections logged during the delta variant's wave. </p>
<p>Now, Israel is believed to be the first country to offer a 4th vaccination to people 60 and older, as well as those with compromised immune systems.</p>
<h3>What can we expect from today's travel update? </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Costly and stressful testing requirements could be reduced or even scrapped in the latest update.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Pre-departure tests for travel to the UK could be axed following the January 5 update.</p>
<p>A number of senior figures in the Government are pushing for this test requirement to be dropped, with ministers insisting that the rapid spread of the omicron variant has made it pointless. </p>
<p>Here' a reminder of the current rules.</p>
<h3>You’ll need a Covid booster vaccine to travel abroad, warns Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Booster vaccines are likely to be needed for travel to many countries within weeks, Boris Johnson warned as he urged people to come forward for a third jab.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said the travel requirement was likely to become "the norm" very soon, adding that it would be "very much to people's advantage" to take up the jabs.</p>
<p>Third vaccines are also set to be needed for vaccine passports in England after everyone has been offered a third vaccine. That milestone has now been reached – but more than nine million eligible people have yet to take up the offer.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the Government would "give people plenty of time" before requiring a third jab for vaccine passports and urged millions to come forward.</p>
<h3>Sage member signals support for eased travel testing rules </h3>
<p>He said it was "very, very important" that if any changes were brought in regarding dropping some PCRs that people still recorded their results from lateral flows. </p>
<p>Regarding the potential change to travel testing requirements, he said when there were very high numbers of cases in the UK, testing upon entry to the UK "becomes less important" as cases are already circulating. </p>
<p> "So, again, that's probably why the change is coming in to support the travel industry and reduce a lot of the testing requirements."</p>
<h3>The key stories from Tuesday</h3>
<li>Pre-departure tests likely to be scrapped</li>
<li>Germany has ditched its mandatory requirement for UK arrivals to quarantine</li>
<li>Maya Bay, made famous by The Beach, has reopened after a three-year closure, but Thailand says it has no plans to resume quarantine-free travel</li>

<header> <h1> How to get a Government-approved day two test </h1> <p> The Government has scrapped the travel testing regime introduced to combat the omicron variant </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Beaumont, Assistant Content Editor and Greg Dickinson <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:53pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Regardless of their vaccination status, all travellers entering the UK must take a day 2 test. </p>
<p>From 4am on January 9, this can be a lateral flow test instead of a more costly PCR test and the need to self-isolate until they receive a negative result will be scrapped from 4am on January 7.</p>
<p>Those who are not double jabbed still face a pre-departure test, 10-day quarantine sentence and two PCR tests. </p>
<p>Here, we break down how the respective tests work and what to look out for when booking one in the coming months.</p>
<h2>How do I get a lateral flow or PCR test for my 'day two'?</h2>
<p>The Government has released a list of approved testing companies. Prices for these range from £20 to £399. The test can be taken at home or a clinic. </p>
<h2>When will my day two test arrive?</h2>
<p>Most companies will deliver your home test by post within 48 hours, though some have longer guarantees. Book your test in good time before returning from your trip to avoid an extended quarantine period.</p>
<h2>What do I do with my day two test confirmation code?</h2>
<p>Keep this safe. You will need to put this on your <a>Passenger Locator Form</a> in order to travel back to the UK.</p>
<h2>When do I need to take the day two test?</h2>
<h2>What do I do once I have taken my test?</h2>
<p>If you are not double-vaccinated, see below. </p>
<h2>How long will I have to wait for my day 2 test result? </h2>
<a>Regenerative Clinic</a>, which has 12 centres across the country, from Canary Wharf to Cambridge. 
<a>Cignpost Express</a> offers next day results (by 10pm) from Heathrow, Gatwick and other airports for a relatively reasonable £69. 
<p>Of course delays in testing results have been known, however with the need to isolate until you receive a negative test result removed from 4am on January 7, arrivals may be more relaxed about this. </p>
<h2>Do children need to take tests for travel?</h2>
<p>Different countries have varying entry rules for children. Many, including France and Greece require unvaccinated children over the age of 12 (or five in Greece) to have taken a Covid test before arrival.</p>
<p>In terms of returning to the UK, all children over the age of five must take the day two test. Under 18s will no longer have to take a pre-departure test from 4am on January 7.</p>
<h2>What if I am not vaccinated?</h2>
<p>If you are not vaccinated, you must take a PCR test for your day two and day 8 tests, and isolate for 10 days. You can either post your test back to the clinic, or take the test in a dedicated centre. </p>
<p>In England, under the Test to Release scheme you can choose to pay for a private Covid test on day 5. If the result is negative (and the result of your day 2 test result was negative or inconclusive) you can end your quarantine.</p>
<p>Vaccinated travellers will need (from 4am on Sunday, January 9):</p>
<ul> <li>To complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK</li> <li>A PCR or lateral flow test, taken within two days of arriving back in the UK. </li> </ul>
<p>Unvaccinated travellers need:</p>
<li>A Covid test before boarding a flight home (pre-departure test)</li>
<li>To complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK</li>
<li>A PCR test within two days of arriving back in the UK and another Covid test on day eight</li>
<li>To self-isolate for 10 days, or pay for a ‘Test to Release’ to leave quarantine early (England only)</li>
<h2>How do I get my pre-departure test?</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated travellers still need proof of a negative Covid-19 test to travel to England from abroad. This must be taken no more than three days before travel but can be either a LAMP, lateral flow or PCR test. </p>
<h2>How do I get a day two (and eight) PCR test when I arrive back in England?</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated travellers must book a PCR test to take place on or before day two of their return to the UK and provide a booking reference on their passenger locator form. Unvaccinated travellers must also book a day 8 test.</p>
<a>Boots offers 'day two' home tests</a> for £75. 
<p>Arrivals can also take a test at a clinic or drive-through site. Randox, for example, has an <a>airport centre</a> at Manchester where arrivals can take their required test (for £60).</p>
<h2>Do I need to take a test before I travel abroad? </h2>
<a>Vivo Clinics</a> has 34 outposts across the country, from Glasgow to Exeter, and offers next day PCR test results from £119. 
<a>Cignpost ExpressTest</a> facilities also offer lateral flow tests (certain countries accept rapid tests for entry) for £35.

<h2>Best family SUVs to buy right now</h2>
<h2>5. Ford Kuga (2008-2013)</h2>
<p>The first-generation Ford Kuga is ageing gracefully, and even at 13 years old it’s still a handsome-looking thing today. But its beauty isn’t just skin-deep.</p>
<p>We found: 2009 Kuga 2.0 TDCI Titanium 4x4, 94,000 miles, full service history £4,999</p>
<p>Watch out for: Poorly maintained autos, electrical glitches inc. haywire instruments, battery drains with Bluetooth, dual mass flywheel failures</p>
<h2>4. Toyota RAV4 (2000-2006)</h2>
<p>But dependability isn’t the RAV4’s only strong suit. It also happens to look pretty good, even 21 years after it was introduced, with chunky styling that catches the eye and a smart, if rather plasticky, interior. </p>
<p>We found: 2005 RAV4 2.0 VVT-i XT3 4WD 5dr, 78,000 miles, full service history, £3,995</p>
<p>Watch out for: Glitchy radios, rusty floorpans and wheel arches, signs of off-road abuse, inoperative speedometers</p>
<h2>3. Hyundai Santa Fe (2006-2012)</h2>
<p>We found: 2006 SantIMAGE Fe CRTD CDX 4WD 7st, 81,000 miles, full service history, £4,299</p>
<p>Watch out for: Diesel particulate filter issues, chipped/cracked windscreens, head gasket failures on diesels, broken/cracked interior plastics</p>
<h2>2. Nissan Qashqai (2010-2013)</h2>
<p>Inside, the Qashqai is attractive and easy to find your way around, and while it isn’t quite as spacious as a larger SUV, there’s still plenty of room for a family in the rear seats and boot. </p>
<p>We found: 2006 Qashqai 1.5 dCi Acenta, 70,000 miles, full service history, £4,999</p>
<p>Watch out for: Knocking rear suspension, weak automatic gearboxes, loose exterior fittings, clogged diesel particulate filters, turbo failures and rough running on 1.5 diesels</p>
<h2>1. Best buy: Honda CR-V (2007-2012)</h2>
<p>The Honda CR-V has been around for more than 20 years now, and this third-generation version is one of the best in the model’s history.</p>
<p>It feels robust inside, too, with the sort of no-nonsense build quality you’d expect from a Honda, and many CR-Vs come with a long list of standard equipment – especially if you go for the top-spec EX. </p>
<p>We found: 2009 CR-V 2.2 CTDi ES, 91,000 miles, full service history, £4,600</p>
<p>Watch out for: Dual-mass flywheel and injector failure on diesels; premature clutch wear</p>

<header> <h1> The 5 best classic cars to buy in 2022 for less than £2,000 </h1> <p> An older, more interesting car isn't the preserve of a monied elite. These five are rewarding to own – and won't cost much to buy or run </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, contributing editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:11pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In fact, if you’re willing to accept a classic that’s a little more modern than the norm, then an interesting old car can still be yours for less than £2,000. And we’ve got five suggestions as to the best ones to buy. </p>
<p>There’s always an exception to the rule – and the 190 is the exception to the rule that all 1980s cult classics are now out of reach on this sort of budget.</p>
<p>Price to pay: from £800</p>
<p>We found: 1991 190E 2.0 Auto, 88,000 miles, 11 months’ MOT, £1,750</p>
<p>Watch out for: Busted head gaskets, old timing chains on pre-88 engines, crusty inner wings and boot floors, cracked door cards</p>
<p>The 205 was the car that made Peugeot, turning it from a maker of worthy but dull saloons into one known for chic little hatchbacks imbued with more than a dash of fun. </p>
<p>We found: 1991 205 GRD, 99,000 miles, full service history, £1,300</p>
<p>Watch out for: Smoky petrol engines, knocking suspension, rust around rear screen, play in the steering rack</p>
<p>Saloons are less desirable than estates, but don’t overlook them – they make excellent family-friendly classics even if they aren’t quite as roomy, and they’re just as comfortable and pleasant to cruise along in.</p>
<p>Price to pay: from £1200</p>
<p>We found: 1985 740 GLE, 141,000 miles, six months’ MOT, £1,995</p>
<p>Watch out for: Sagging rear suspension on estates, cracked front crossmembers, oil leaks suggesting blocked breathers, rusty floors, leaky heater matrices</p>
<p>One of Citroen’s most popular models, the BX is now scarce on Britain’s roads, but it is emerging from banger territory and fast becoming a classic in which people are rather interested.</p>
<p>They’re frugal, too, if you choose one of the diesels, while the estates make excellent load luggers. And of course, there’s that trademark Gallic weirdness, especially in early cars with their typically quirky dashboard layouts.</p>
<p>Price to pay: from £600</p>
<p>We found: 1990 BX 19TGD Estate, 114,000 miles, 12 months’ MOT, £1,700</p>
<p>Watch out for: Rusty door jambs and boot floors, creaking rear suspension, leaking suspension pipes, stiff ride indicating worn-out spheres, head gaskets on later 1.4s</p>
<p>Full disclosure: the author has just bought one of these himself, and the reason is simple. It’s amazingly good value for a 1980s classic, not least one that’s so solidly built and replete with fascinating engineering.</p>
<p>Price to pay: from £700</p>
<p>We found (and bought): 1991 1.8E, 98,000 miles, 11 months’ MOT, £1,295</p>
<p>Watch out for: Poor maintenance, leaking power steering, smokey petrol engines, fading red paint, duff automatics</p>

<header> <h1> Eight (realistic) fashion resolutions to make for 2022 </h1> <p> Swear you’re going to shop ‘better’ this year, but not entirely sure how? These are the simple resolutions that you might actually stick to </p> </header>

<p>From washing your clothes less to wearing them more, here are a few sartorial resolutions you might actually stick to this year. </p>
<h2>1. I will follow the #secondhandfirst rule</h2>
<p>If giving up new clothes is too daunting a prospect, then this is a softer approach, and a good rule to live by. Before buying anything brand new, see if you can find it secondhand first. </p>
<a>Vestiaire Collective</a> to find the same item at a fraction of the price (often with the tags still attached).
<p>When you’ve exhausted all those avenues with no success, then you may buy new. If you haven’t already gone off the idea. </p>
<h2>2. I will actually wear all of my accessories</h2>
<p>Sometimes it takes a little courage to get comfortable with a bold accessory – but if Carrie Bradshaw can wear two bags and a hat at the same time, you can definitely pull off a beret.</p>
<h2>3. I will only buy from brands that pay a living wage</h2>
<a> less than two per cent earn a living wage</a>. A living wage is crucially different from a minimum wage, which in many countries does not cover basic expenses like food, rent and healthcare. 
<a>By Megan Crosby</a> instead. 
<p>Use the Clean Clothes Campaign’s<a> Fashion Checker</a> tool to suss out where your favourite brands stand – but be warned, not a single big high street player is paying a living wage yet.</p>
<a>Clothes Doctor</a> offers a postal service for repairs and alterations, while the
<a>Sojo</a> app will even pick up your clothes by bike and drop them off again, good as new. And for bags and shoes that have partied too hard,
<a>The Restory</a> is better than rehab.
<h2>5. I will do less laundry</h2>
<a> Kair’s Finishing Spray</a> or
<a>The Laundress</a> will help keep things freshly scented between washes. And when you do wash, wash at 30 degrees and dry outside if you can – or
<a>invest in a heated clothes airer</a>, my new favourite possession, which uses only a fraction of the energy of a tumble dryer and could save you money too.
<h2>6. I will finally sort out that moth problem</h2>
<a>follow Debora Robertson’s lead</a> with a zero tolerance policy of smoke bombs and pheremone traps. And stay vigilant for the first signs of a flutter. Where there’s wool, there’s a way.
<h2>7. I will play dress-up more often</h2>
<h2>8. I will stop apologising</h2>
<p>This might be the hardest resolution to keep, but it could also be the most powerful. Make 2022 the year you stop apologising for your clothes. </p>
