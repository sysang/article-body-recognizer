<a>garden</a>. But it’s been so mild, I’ve barely seen them.
<p>No matter, because I know the <a>wildlife</a> is just sleeping. I hope hedgehogs are snuggled in my large compost heap, slow worms are buried deep in the soil and frogs are nestled among thickets of uncut meadow or beneath the leaves.</p>
<p>As a wildlife gardener I create as many hibernacula as possible and leave them alone between <a>autumn</a> and spring. Here is a list of potential hibernation sites, so we can all ensure our garden wildlife survives the winter.</p>
<h2>The best hibernation sites for wildlife in winter</h2>
<p>Great places for hibernating wildlife, particularly if you’ve packed the gaps with leaves. Amphibians could be nestled tight beneath the logs, along with lots of things they eat, such as beetles and slugs.</p>
<p>Loose tree bark is the perfect habitat for queen wasps and other insects to hibernate. Take care not to disturb when pruning, and remove bark from wood before burning.</p>
<p>If you accidentally disturb a hedgehog, leave a dish of dog or cat food out. If you see one in the day it’s in trouble – take it in, keep it warm and call your local hedgehog rescue.</p>

<header> <h1> How to forage foliage for natural Christmas decorations – and tips for a stunning festive table </h1> <p> Perhaps this year our Christmas decorations should reflect our love of the outdoors and everything natural </p> </header>

<p>Indisputably sustainable, they are an easy route to really beautiful Christmassy rooms.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have much of a garden, a foraging walk offers you bountiful resources and good florists are stocking more and more stylish natural things these days.</p>
<p>My favourite seed heads for winter displays come from Smyrnium perfoliatum, which self-seeds here at Perch Hill in the dappled shade. And, of course, alliums, in almost every shape and size.</p>
<a>when you want to decorate</a>.
<a>Christmas</a> filled with bracken fronds, bare tree boughs, oak, sweet chestnut and field maple leaves can be a revelation of everything that might otherwise go unnoticed outside our windows.
<p>Happy Christmas foraging!</p>
<h2>How to create natural festive decorations</h2>
<h2>The Christmas table </h2>
<p>Amber, bronze and oyster are the colours I want for a Christmas table this year, calm and natural, and a breakaway from red and green.</p>
<p>Finally, add dried and painted leaves and small sections of bracken fronds. Scatter them with candles and strings of lights between.</p>
<h2>Silver birch Christmas tree </h2>
<p>The easiest way to colour the seed heads is to use an aerosol water-based spray paint, but it’s more environmentally-friendly to dip or spray from a water atomiser you might have for the ironing.</p>
<p>Add your lights (I’ve gone for battery powered allium-like starbursts), then plenty of rainbow-coloured decorations before finally chucking the alliums at the tree. They stay where you throw them.</p>
<p>Concentrating on the outer edge to give a loose Catherine-wheel effect, poke hazel or alder catkins into the moss.</p>
<p>Add the acorns, bunching some to give impact, but also making sure a few are scattered all through.</p>
<p>Add some battery wreath lights to give glow.</p>
<p>With all the dried flowers, it’s quicker and easier to leave the stems on, to slot and hold them into the birch. You can remove the heads and wire them, but it’s fiddly.</p>
<p>Add decorations last so you don’t knock them off and break them. Because the overall effect of the dried plants and flowers is subtle, the decorations added are small but punchy – glass parrots, beetles and bright, small baubles.</p>

<header> <h1> Should we stop feeding wild birds in the garden? </h1> <p> Some bird species thrive on human intervention, but is it at the expense of biodiversity? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Kate Bradbury <time> 12 November 2021 • 6:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>“But when blue and great tits have constant access to food at garden feeders, the strategies of the willow and marsh tits are rendered useless.”</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that, having gone to the effort to excavate their own nest hole, willow tits often then have it stolen by blue tits. “The willow tit is now extinct across most of southern Britain,” says Dr Lees.</p>
<a>very urban garden</a> has ever seen a willow or a marsh tit, let alone a spotted flycatcher or lesser-spotted woodpecker – in fact, I barely get great tits and blue tits.
<h2>How to feed wild birds in the garden</h2>
<p>Ultimately, it seems we need to be cleverer about feeding birds. Rather than simply hanging a feeder with some peanuts, fat balls or a generic seed mix, we should be looking first at where we live – are we urban, suburban or rural?</p>
<p>Next, consider which species are likely to visit our gardens and which need our help, and then what food we’re actually leaving out. There are other considerations, too.</p>
<p>“People leave food for birds which <a>then attracts rats</a>; so they might then poison the rats, and that poison will end up in the bodies of crows and other scavengers.”</p>
<a>an open compost heap</a>. All of these things are better for wildlife in the long term; supplementary feeding works only if you remember to top up your feeders.
<p>Asked if we should stop feeding birds altogether, Dr Lees says no. “It’s early days and we need more research before we tell people to stop feeding, but it’s clear that feeding birds has both positive and negative effects.”</p>
<p>Dr Lees does, however, think less dominant species could benefit from supplementary feeding stations being removed from nature reserves, where habitats are already intact.</p>
<h2>Things to remember when feeding birds</h2>
<li>Think about what, where and how you feed. Are you replacing food that is scarce due to habitat loss in your area, or are you creating additional resources for more dominant species?</li>
<li>Consider cutting back on peanuts, and scatter small amounts of seed on the ground for a wider variety of species.</li>
<li>Clean your bird feeders – don’t let them become agents of diseases and viruses that can kill birds.</li>
<li>Continue to provide fresh water for garden birds, including a bird bath.</li>
<li>Grow natural sources of food, including native shrubs and trees. According to Dr Lees, marsh tits seem to be particularly fond of honeysuckle berries and (European) spindle fruit.</li>

<header> <h1> The best indoor plants to keep the air clean in your home </h1> <p> If you're looking to update your space, but don't want to make permanent or drastic changes, all you need is some greenery </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lela London <time> 14 December 2021 • 4:04pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When it comes to interior decorating, there is no easier or more affordable way to upgrade your space than a few good houseplants.</p>
<p>Easy to care for, resilient and a quick way to inject some nature into your living room - no wonder <a>houseplants </a>have recently made a comeback. What's more is that they can also <a>clean the air in your home</a>.</p>
<p>For green-fingered newbies, it can be hard to know where to start. Here, we've done the work for you and compiled the best indoor plants for any space. But first, let's start with the basics. </p>
<h2>What is the best indoor plant to clean the air?</h2>
<a>Interior Landscape Plants for Indoor Air Pollution Abatement</a>" — was a revelation to houseplant lovers. 
<h2>Red-edged dracaena (Dracaena marginata)</h2>
<h2>Snake plant (Sansevieria)</h2>
<h2>Barberton daisy (Gerbera jamesonii)</h2>
<h2>Broadleaf Lady Palm (Rhapis excelsa)</h2>
<a>sun-loving plant</a> on your kitchen windowsill. Aloe vera is another plant which emits oxygen throughout the night, simultaneously taking in carbon dioxide, leading to cleaner air in your household.
<h2>Chrysanthemum (Chrysantheium morifolium)</h2>
<h2>Spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</h2>
<a>spider plant</a> can remove 10mg of formaldehyde from a room per day. It's also said to filter xylene and carbon monoxide, making them the ideal choice for garages and sheds. They work best in cool temperatures and indirect sunlight.
<h2>English Ivy (Hedera helix)</h2>
<a>English ivy</a> is believed to attract airborne particals of fecal matter and mold spores - making it the ideal plant for bathrooms and toilets.
<a> Keep the soil moist </a>and give the plant at least four hours of direct sunlight daily for flourishing ivy.
<h2>Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis spp.)</h2>
<a>Orchids </a>give off more oxygen at night, so are a
<h2>Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema modestum)</h2>
<h2>Weeping fig (Ficus benjamina)</h2>
<p>Weeping <a>figs</a> can remove 47 per cent of formaldehyde, 30 per cent of benzene and 11 per cent of trichlorethylene, according to NASA. Sensitive to drafts, this plant is best kept out of the hallway - but is ideal for living rooms. </p>
<h2>What is the easiest indoor plant to grow?</h2>
<p>For those of us who haven’t had a great history with houseplants in the past, you’ll not only be on the hunt for the easiest indoor plants to grow, but the hardest indoor plants to kill.</p>
<h2>Where should you put plants in your house?</h2>
<p>While most indoor plants will do well in indirect sunlight, the best spot for plant health and growth will depend on each species’ specific requirements. </p>
<p>Here is our guide to the best indoor plants you can order today - and where to buy them:</p>
<p><a>£12.99, You Garden</a> </p>
<p><a>£8.99, Thompson and Morgan</a> </p>
<p><a>£19.99, You Garden</a> </p>
<p><a>£12.99, Amazon</a> </p>
<p><a>£65, The Little Botanical</a> </p>
<p>With concrete grey and copper-dipped ceramic pots included, a full indoor plant set-up is truly just a few clicks away. </p>

<header> <h1> A step-by-step guide on how to prune a climbing rose, by a gardening expert </h1> <p> Telegraph gardening expert Helen Yemm gives tips and advice on all your gardening problems whether at home or on the allotment </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Yemm <time> 10 September 2021 • 8:29am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Are you a proud custodian of climbing roses that resemble pruning manual illustrations, or that could feature in an online tutorial? No, I thought not.</p>
<p>So, as the weather turns and plants become increasingly leafless, it is a good time to try to knock even the most gnarled and neglected specimens into shape.</p>
<p>Remember that one of the good things about roses is that the harder you cut them, the more they shoot – the all-important trick is to learn to cut the right stuff off so that you enhance rather than spoil their ability to flower well.</p>
<li>Remove also any other woody shoots that were unproductive or growing in the wrong direction.</li>
<li>When tying in climbing rose shoots, make a twist in the twine or Flexi-Tie, between the shoot and the support to prevent chafing. Never thread stems through trellis or shove them behind support wires.</li>
<li>Now cut back the thinner shoots (growing from what remains of the older framework) that have borne flowers. Cut them back so that two or three leaf scars (i.e. buds) remain on each, making a slanting cut close to the uppermost scar.</li>
<li>You should now be left with a relatively stout, sparse rose with a fanned-out, largely horizontal framework, with a series of neat little green stumps sticking off it, each about 10cm long.</li>
<li>Stand back and make sure that the overall branch pattern is going roughly where it should – you can always re-tie bits or take out more old wood if the rose still looks too fulsome for its allotted space.</li>
<li>Your rose should now bear at least a passing resemblance to those daunting examples of proper pruning and should, furthermore, flower well next summer…</li>
<li>…especially if you follow up with a mulch of well-rotted manure in a few weeks’ time and spray it with vigour-and-health-enhancing <a>Uncle Tom’s Rose Tonic</a> (from Amazon and garden centres) at intervals next year.</li>
<h3>Box hedging from cuttings </h3>
<p>Sandra Ellis – via email</p>
<p>You may have to shuffle the pack a bit to give everything in the bed what it needs, and also provide a moisture retaining mulch for your box while it gets established this year.</p>
<h3>A creative project? </h3>
<p>Malcolm Blakeway is not the only reader to ask if there is anything particularly toxic about wooden wine boxes that would make them unsuitable for use as plant containers.</p>
<p>That was way back in 2014 and the box, in which I have grown parsley ever since, finally split apart and fatally collapsed at the start of summer 2020. I wonder how Jenny Blair got on.</p>
