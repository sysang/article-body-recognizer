<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — After years of looking abroad for answers, countries in the Middle East now appear to instead be talking to each other to find solutions following two decades defined by war and political upheaval.</p>
<p>But the diplomatic maneuvering signals a growing realization across the region that America’s interest is moving elsewhere and that now is the time for negotiations that were unthinkable just a year ago. </p>
<p>The United States still maintains a strong military presence, including bases across the wider Mideast. Tens of thousands of American troops operate tanks in Kuwait, sail through the Strait of Hormuz and fly missions across the Arabian Peninsula. </p>

<a>an ongoing shadow war</a> in could escalate into open conflict.
<p>And with the border-locking chaos of the coronavirus pandemic largely behind them, Mideast leaders are now shuffling, talking face-to-face amid a flurry of diplomatic meetings, seemingly eager to hedge their bets. </p>
<a>The United Arab Emirates sent its national security adviser</a> on a rare trip to speak to Iran’s hard-line president, likely hoping to head off any
<a>other maritime attacks off its coast</a>. Saudi Arabia, which
<a>cut off ties to Iran in 2016</a> following attacks on their diplomatic posts sparked by the kingdom’s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric, also has

<p>The closing of ranks also brought a return of realpolitik to the region, a decade after the Arab Spring movements that aimed to topple the region’s autocrats. </p>

<a> sidelined the country’s Islamists in a move criticized by opponents as a coup</a>.
<p>And in Sudan, where a popular uprising and coup toppled longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019, <a>another recent coup disrupted fragile plans for a transition to democracy</a>. </p>
<p>This new Mideast reassessment however, appears to have limits on what it can resolve. </p>
<a>what the World Bank described as the world’s worst financial crisis in 150 years.</a>
<p>But the talking, for now, continues. And absent a major crisis that could draw America in again, those conversations likely will be where the deals get done. </p>

<p>The Associated Press’ film writers picks for best movies of 2021:</p>
<a>“Licorice Pizza”</a>: It’s a rare film that makes you nostalgic for a time and place you never knew, but
<a>Paul Thomas Anderson’s breezy, sunny “Licorice Pizza” </a> does just that for the San Fernando Valley of Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman) and Alana Kane’s (
<a>Alana Haim</a> ) youths. Awash in Southern California calm and optimism, this is a playful and joyous ode to the big personalities, embellished stories, endless possibilities and endearing Hollywood-adjacency of a place that barely exists anymore.
<a>“Dune”</a>: A bigger-than-IMAX vision that is
<a>“Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar”</a>: Writing about
<a>“Luca”</a>: This is the only film on the list that I’ve seen more than 10 times already. It’s not exactly by choice, there’s a 2-year-old in the equation, but it’s not a chore either. In fact, it’s a
<a> joy to be transported into the Cinque Terra-inspired town of Portorosso </a> to watch
<a> a few adolescent sea monsters dream of Vespas and a better future</a>. It also has a tremendous score and a lively soundtrack of mid-century Italian bops.
<a>“The Power of the Dog”</a>: A story about loneliness in the barren Montana frontier of 1925,
<a>“The Hand of God”</a>: Paolo Sorrentino’s autobiographical film
<a>“The Hand of God”</a> may deal with tragedy and fate and “coming-of-age” but it is hardly a maudlin or overly sentimental affair. This is
<a>a shimmering, ecstatic love letter to family</a> that uses all of the colors in the box.
<p>Also of note: “The Rescue,” “Bergman Island,” “Flee,” “The World to Come,” “The Green Knight,” “Summer of Soul” </p>
<a>“The Beatles: Get Back”</a>: It’s been an extraordinary year in music documentary thanks to revelations like
<a>Questlove’s “Summer of Soul”</a> and
<a>Todd Haynes’ “The Velvet Underground.”</a> But Peter Jackson’s eight-hour Beatles hang-out is an overwhelming cultural artifact not just because of how it
<a>“The Truffle Hunters”</a>: Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw’s
<a>“Pig,”</a> starring a fabulous Nicholas Cage.)
<p>7. <a>“The Mitchells vs the Machines”</a>: A <a>classic family road trip movie</a>, with a robot apocalypse thrown in, along with a pug easily mistaken for a loaf of bread. An antic delight.</p>
<a>“Petite Maman”</a>: Céline Sciamma’s
<a>Richard Jenkins</a> and Jayne Houdyshell are particular standouts.

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Books and authors mattered in 2021, sometimes more than the industry wanted.</p>
<p>“Everything feels very magnified,” says the prize-winning novelist Jacqueline Woodson, whose books have been challenged by officials in Texas and elsewhere. </p>

<p>“You’re not hearing much these days about how people don’t read anymore,” says Allison Hill, CEO of the American Booksellers Association, the trade group for the country’s independent bookstores.</p>
<p>A year after the ABA worried that hundreds of stores could shut down because of the pandemic, Hill says membership is growing, with more than 150 new stores opening and around 30 going out of business. </p>
<p>The CEO of Penguin Random House U.S., Madeline McIntosh, called the popularity of fiction “the greatest sign we have of long-term growth for the industry.” </p>
<p>Gorman’s appearance at the inaugural was made possible by first lady Jill Biden, who in 2017 had attended a reading Gorman gave at the Library of Congress as the country’s Youth Poet Laureate. </p>
<p>Woodson says she and other writers were stunned by the DOJ’s announcement and remembers thinking, “Wait, they’re speaking for us!”</p>
<p>The debates about literature were never more passionate than in the country’s classrooms and libraries.</p>

<p>All in all, “Home Video” is a moving recollection of youth — and it is a shame that it was overlooked by the Recording Academy. — <a>Ragan Clark</a></p>
<p>JAZMINE SULLIVAN, “HEAUX TALES”</p>
<p>BILLIE EILISH, “HAPPIER THAN EVER”</p>
<p>H.E.R., “BACK OF MY MIND”</p>
<p>LITTLE SIMZ, “SOMETIMES I MIGHT BE INTROVERT”</p>

<div><div><h1>The AP Interview: 'We want justice' on climate, Nakate says</h1></div></div>
<p>The <a>25-year-old’s rise</a> in profile has been quick. Not even three years have passed since she set out with relatives in Kampala to stage her first, modest protest over how the world is treating its only planet.</p>
<a>outcome of the U.N. climate talks in Scotland</a> and what she and other young activists plan for the year to come.
<a>could be on a pathway to warm 2.4 degrees Celsius</a> (4.3 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times.
<p>That’s well above the goal of <a>limiting warming to 1.5C</a> — and would be “a death sentence for so many communities on the front lines of the climate crisis,” Nakate said.</p>
<a>warming three times faster</a> than the rest of the planet. The
<a>dramatic drop in carbon dioxide emissions</a> from COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns has almost disappeared. This year,
<a>forests burned in Siberia’s weakening permafrost</a>, while record-shattering heatwaves in Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest and deadly flooding in Europe brought the climate threat
<a>home to some who once thought they could outspend it</a>.
<p>But many of the most-affected communities are in Africa, whose 1.3 billion people contribute the least to global emissions, less than 4%, but stand to suffer from it most.</p>
<p>And yet the $100 billion in financing per year promised by richer nations to help developing countries deal with the coming catastrophe has not appeared.</p>
<p>The next big climate conference will be in Africa, in Egypt, a chance for the spotlight to fall squarely on the continent. </p>
<p>It will be a test for activists and negotiators from Africa’s 54 countries who have long jostled for space at global climate events.</p>
<p>“Many times, activists in Africa have been called missing voices. But we are not missing,” Nakate said. “We are present, we are available, we are just unheard.” </p>
<a>cropped out of an AP photo of climate activists last year</a> at the World Economic Forum. The AP apologized for its error in judgment and the pain it caused her.
<p>But it is not enough to simply listen to Africa’s climate activists, Nakate said this week. People with power must act on those demands. </p>
<p>“We don’t want to just hear sweet phrases from them, sweet commitments,” she said. “Commitments will not change the planet, pledges will not stop the suffering of people.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Nakate said, drastic action is needed by the leaders in government and business that continue to fund the extraction of fossil fuels, like coal and oil.</p>
<p>In fact, the 77-year-old leader has never been in contact with Nakate, who became one of the world’s most well-known Ugandans not long after graduating from university with a business degree and becoming inspired by climate activism.</p>
<p>In her recent book “A Bigger Picture,” Nakate reflects on how leaders’ decisions on climate have real-life consequences far beyond the data that often dominate the conversation.</p>
<p>She worries about how farmers who lose their crops to climate shocks will feed their families, and how lost income can force children out of school and young women into early marriage.</p>
<p>Asked how young climate activists can make sure that they are central to decision-making worldwide, Nakate expressed confidence that they are making themselves heard, creating their own platforms on social media and elsewhere.</p>
<p>“If the table is not given to you, you make one for yourself,” she said — a message she could well tweet to her 230,000-plus followers.</p>
<p>In 2022, Nakate’s work will be closer to home as she pursues a project to provide schools in Uganda with solar panels and eco-friendly cookstoves to reduce the amount of firewood consumed.</p>
