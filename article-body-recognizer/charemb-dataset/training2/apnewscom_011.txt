<div><div><h1>The Dylan catalog, a 60-year rock ‘n’ roll odyssey, is sold</h1></div><div>By DAVID BAUDERDecember 7, 2020 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — To many music lovers, Bob Dylan’s songbook is priceless. Well, now he’s put a price on it.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize-winning songwriter has sold publishing rights to his catalog of more than 600 songs, one of the greatest treasures in popular music, to the Universal Music Publishing Group, it was announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The price was not disclosed, but industry experts have suggested the sale is in the range of $300 million to a half-billion dollars.</p>
<p>The sale gives Universal the right, in perpetuity, to lease use of Dylan’s compositions to advertisers and movie, television or video game producers, or anyone who thinks his words and melodies could enhance their product.</p>
<p>In cultural terms, Dylan’s catalog is “quite literally priceless,” said Anthony DeCurtis, a veteran music writer and contributing editor at Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>“It has been 60 years and it’s still going strong,” DeCurtis said. “There’s no reason to believe there’s going to be any diminishment in its significance.”</p>
<p>Given the pace of change in the industry, “songs seem to be the place to place your bets,” Light said.</p>
<p>Dylan’s songs, however, will long outlive him.</p>
<p>“It’s the kind of thing, if you want it done right, you want to take care of it yourself while you’re still at a stage in your life when you can do it right,” said Robert Levine, Billboard’s industry editorial director.</p>
<p>“I have a family and a mortgage and I have to take care of them so it’s my only option,” Crosby said. “I’m sure the others feel the same.”</p>
