<header> <h1> Best budget smartphones that prove you don't have to spend a fortune for quality </h1> <p> After realising that many consumers don't want to get a mortgage for a new phone, manufacturers have started creating 'mid-tier' gems </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 2 September 2021 • 3:43pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>If I had to name my favourite tech trend of the past five years, I would have no hesitation in choosing the rise of the budget smartphone. </p>
<p>In the below reviews, I’ll outline the key features of the cheaper models and advise how they stack up to their top tier counterparts. </p>
<p>So, without further ado, here’s my guide to the best budget and mid-tier smartphones… </p>
<p>Why we like it: It’s basically flagship quality</p>
<p><a>£399 for the 128GB version, John Lewis</a></p>
<p><a>From £25 per month with £19 upfront, Three</a></p>
<p><a>Buy now pay monthly</a></p>
<h3>2. Google Pixel 4a </h3>
<p>Why we like it: The camera</p>
<p><a>£349 SIM-free, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p><a>£18.99 per month with £9.99 upfront, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p>The 4a is actually a lot closer to the newly released Pixel 5 than it is to last year’s Pixel 4. It ditches the weird motion control options of the latter and goes back to basics. </p>
<p>All this is nice enough, but let’s be honest, the real reason to buy a Pixel device is the camera and once again, Google have knocked it out of the park with what is almost certainly the best point-and-shoot camera on a smartphone. </p>
<p>The cameras also have a few neat functions. I particularly enjoyed using the astrophotography mode which allows you to take beautiful starscapes on a clear night by pointing the phone up at the sky. </p>
<p>One thing I would say is that the battery isn’t wonderful. It should get you through a day with average use, but if you’re on your phone a lot it might be prudent to carry an extra charger. </p>
<p>So, all that said, how does it compare to the Pixel 5? Well, honestly, despite the £150 difference in price, they’re pretty similar. </p>
<p>Other bonuses on the flagship model include a much bigger battery, wireless charging, and an ever-so-slightly bigger 6-inch screen which has a 90Hz refresh rate which makes it smoother to scroll through.</p>
<p>Arguably though, none of the differences between the 4a and the 5 are really dealbreakers so unless you’re massively interested in 5G, I’d save yourself the money and go for this version. </p>
<p>Why we like it: The ultimate budget smartphone for film buffs</p>
<p><a>£599.99 SIM-free, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>From £26 per month with £150 upfront, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p>The battery is very good too though if you want to take advantage of its fast-charging capabilities you’ll need to buy a new charger rather than the one which comes in the box. Odd.</p>
<p><a>£499.99 SIM-free, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>From £39 per month with £19.99 upfront, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Like OnePlus, Oppo is a Chinese brand which has only made it’s Western debut in the last few years, but I have to say, it’s quickly become a favourite of mine, for it’s top quality mid-tier phones. The Oppo Reno 4 is no different.</p>
<p>Oppo made the baffling decision to launch the Reno 4 alongside a Reno 4 Pro which has a lot of the same DNA but a few ket differences, including a price of <a>£699</a>. </p>
<p>Battery life is solid and the Super VOOC charging is the fastest I’ve encountered on a phone. 1-100pc in just over half an hour is still pretty impressive even if rivals are catching up fast. </p>
<p>When choosing between the Reno 4 and Reno 4 Pro, it comes down to those cameras. If telephoto and better wide-angle shots are enough to tempt you, it’s worth splashing out. If not, save yourself the money and get the Reno 4.</p>
<p><a>From £399, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>£25.99 per month, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p>The cameras are decent, if not mind-blowing and capable of taking some perfectly good shots. You can also record video in 4K which is a nice addition. </p>
<p><a>£349.99 SIM free, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p><a>£31.99 per month with no up front cost, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p>Employee: “Aye aye, sir. Anything else we should include?”</p>
<p>Boss: “Nope, just focus on the camera.”</p>
<p>Employee: “Not even a decent home menu to avoid cluttering up the apps?”</p>
<p>Boss: “Just the camera, Jenkins.”</p>
<p>Employee: “Facial recognition?”</p>
<p>Boss: “Sounds expensive. Keep it cheap and slow, focus on those filters.”</p>
<p>Employee: “So just a really great camera and the bare minimum for everything else then, sir?”</p>
<p>Employee: “...”</p>
<p><a>Buy now pay monthly</a></p>

<header> <h1> The best laptops for students - for essays, lectures and watching films </h1> <p> Good news, university-goers: you don't have to spend a fortune to buy one of the best laptops for students </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 8 September 2021 • 2:09pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>headphone jack </a>is a must if you end up with a grouchy flatmate who demands silence at 8.30pm every night; and built-in
<a>Bluetooth</a> or a decent set of speakers are must if you’re a party animal or even just fancy having friends clustered around your laptop for a movie night. 
<p>You might also consider a laptop with a webcam, especially if you’re going to be doing a lot of seminars online due to Covid. (Though an <a>external webcam</a> might be safer.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with that rubric in place, I’ve picked out five of my top picks of the best laptops for students out there, starting with my top pick… </p>
<p>Why we like it: Apple-esque, at a fraction on the price</p>
<p><a>£499.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Huawei off-shoot Honor have made a statement in the world of technology by offering very, very high quality products at unbelievably low prices and this laptop is no different. </p>
<p>From the outside you can feel the quality and toughness. The chassis is a solid-feeling thing in nice dark grey with an electric blue trim, and despite being all-metal only weighs. 1.47kg. It's slim too: 15.8mm wide when closed.</p>
<p>The screen is positively massive at 14 inches with next to no bezels taking up space (the webcam is hidden in the keyboard). In terms of screen quality, it looks great to my eye. I’ll concede I have seen better, but not for this price. </p>
<p>The keyboard is big and comfortable to write on and the trackpad is helpfully huge. You won’t notice this stuff, but you would if they were too small. </p>
<h3>2. Microsoft Surface Laptop Go</h3>
<p>Why we like it: It’s one of the best laptops available at this price</p>
<p><a>£549, Currys</a></p>
<p>You've also got an HD-ready webcam built in and a nice big touchpad. There's also a fingerprint scanner to allow you to log into the device without having to input a password: inessential but cool.</p>
<h3>3. Google Pixelbook Go</h3>
<p>Why we like it: It’s the best Chromebook out there</p>
<p>Google has been licensing out its ChromeOS operating system to other manufacturers to make hardware for it, but the Made By Google brand is always the best. It’s faster, sleeker, and better at surfacing your content than others. </p>
<p>With a 13.3inch touch screen molecular display, everything looks stunning. Whether you’re just typing up documents or watching something, it looks crystal clear and the colours are perfectly balanced. </p>
<h3>4. Acer Chromebook 514</h3>
<p>Why we like it: A solid, wallet-friendly notebook</p>
<p><a>£229.99, Currys</a></p>
<p>You’ve still got a lot of the elements that make the Pixelbook Go great. A handy 14inch screen which can be touch sensitive as an optional extra, an all-metal chassis, a decent camera, a headphone jack and a comparable battery life. </p>
<p>It also packs a few features that the Pixelbook Go doesn’t feature such as a USB port and a handy LED backlit keyboard for those times when you find yourself pulling an all-nighter to get that essay done. </p>
<p>Alright, so it’s a little bit chunkier, and a touch heavier at 1.5kg and, to my mind doesn’t have quite the same premium look, but did I mention it’s £400 cheaper than the top-of-the-line Chromebook model? </p>
<a>£399.99 on Amazon</a> which has more memory than the Pixelbook (128GB) as well as the touch screen and basically all the other cool features of Google’s version. 
<p>Why we like it: It’s perfect in all ways (except the price)</p>
<p><a>£949, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>The fact is that a Macbook Air is several orders of magnitude better than anything you actually need at university. </p>
<p>When Apple say you can get 12 hours of battery life from one of these things, they really mean it. And you can add to that a 256GB hard drive, 8GB of RAM, a super speedy processor, and that beautifully flawless display.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few annoying things. Like the Pixelbook Go you won’t find any USB ports on here, while the backlit keyboard is weirdly sized and feels a bit crunched up. </p>
<p>See also: Telegraph Recommended's review of <a>the best power banks</a> for charging on the go</p>
<h5>Other kit you might want to consider</h5>
<a>WiFi extender</a> (be warned that some university halls prohibit these).
<a>external hard-drive</a>. These don't cost a fortune and are a handy way to boost your laptop or Chromebook's memory. 
<a>mouse</a> for your student laptop, but if you're more comfortable using these then I've done some little guides on picking the best ones which are linked in this very sentence.
<a>tablet</a> but as a former English Literature student I would very much recommend investing in an
<a>eBook reader</a>, preferably one with audiobook playback as this will make your heavy reading load feel a lot lighter.

<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 28 October 2021 • 4:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>And whichever one you opt for, you'll probably be in need of a power bank for charging on the go – helpfully, we've also tried and tested a selection of the best power banks for 2020, too.</p>
<p>Until then, here's our list of the best smartphones money can buy...</p>
<h3>1. Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</h3>
<p>Why we like it: By far the best point-and-shoot camera on a smartphone</p>
<p><a>£599, SIM-free from Mobiles.co.uk</a> (Standard model) <a>£849, SIM-free from Mobiles.co.uk</a> (Pro model)</p>
<p><a>From £28.99 per month from Carphone Warehouse with £29.99 upfront cost</a> (Standard model), <a>£37.99 per month from Carphone Warehouse with £29.99 upfront cost</a> (Pro model)</p>
<p>There are a few other bugbears too. Unlike basically every other phone of 2021, there's no capacity whatsoever for face unlock, which would be fine but the fingerprint unlocking system is also pretty slow and annoying too.</p>
<p><a>Buy now SIM-free from Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p><a>Buy now from £28.99 per month from Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: The much needed course correction on the camera</p>
<p><a>From £829, SIM-Free, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Since OnePlus first entered the Western market a few years back, it has been all about outperforming the flagships from Apple and Samsung by offering more and better new features than they have been able to. </p>
<p>The outcome is OnePlus’ best camera ever which, alongside a host of other tweaks and improvements, really makes the 9 Pro worth the purchase price.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a great handset which looks and feels premium thanks to its all-glass design. The cameras are there best they’ve ever been and the charging speed is a huge selling point. </p>
<p><a>Buy now SIM-free from John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: Apple are giving the people what they want with their best iPhone in years</p>
<p><a>£849 for the standard model SIM-free, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p><a>From £41.99 per month for the standard model, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>Buy now from £41.99 per month from Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<h3>4. Samsung Galaxy S20/S20 FE</h3>
<p><a>From £799.99 SIM-free from Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p><a>From £40.99 with £79.99 upfront from Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p>The first place to start when it comes to Samsung phones is the camera. These devices have by far the best quality cameras on a phone, outstripping anything from the likes of Apple and even the much-vaunted Google Pixel. </p>
<p>Also available is the Galaxy S20+ which is just a slightly bigger version of the same phone with a slightly bigger battery, faster processor, and as you might imagine, costs more. </p>
<p><a>Buy now from £40.99 per month from Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<h3>5. Oppo Find X3 Pro</h3>
<p><a>£1,099.99 SIM-Free, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<a>£699.99</a>) and Find X3 Lite (
<p><a>£1,099, Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>£39 per month with £25 upfront, Mobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<p>For the average user, there’s a more basic camera app which is great but will pale in comparison to the efforts of those who know what they’re doing. </p>
<p>As I say, this phone certainly isn’t for everyone, but for the film buff or amateur director, it genuinely might be the best option out there. </p>
<p><a>Buy now from £39 per month from Carphone Warehouse</a></p>
<p><a>£749, BuyMobiles.co.uk</a></p>
<h5>Frequently asked questions about smartphones</h5>
<h3>How to buy a smartphone</h3>
<p>Your first decision is whether you want to use an iPhone or a Google Android phone. Both have a different look and feel to how they operate.</p>
<p>In contrast, Apple's iPhones all run on the company's operating system, known as iOS, with almost all now coming with iOS 12. </p>
<h3>Mobile phone buying | Checklist</h3>
<li>iPhone or Android: iPhones are the popular choice in the UK, but powerful Android phones from Samsung and Google now offer plenty of choice beyond Apple</li>
<li>Data, minutes and texts: Plenty of phones offer unlimited minutes and texts, but don't be pressured into buying 20GB of data when you only use 2GB!</li>
<li>Camera: A good camera can be a deciding factor on a phone. Check The Telegraph's reviews for the best around</li>
<li>SIM only: SIM only deals can be a great way to get more data</li>
<li>Battery life: Double check battery life against what the reviewers say</li>
<li>Count the cost: It may look a great deal, but tally the total cost over two years if you are buying a contract and see if you can buy the handset outright with a monthly SIM for less</li>
<h3>What to look for in a smartphone</h3>
<ul><li>Screen size: Measured diagonally from the top corner to the bottom corner. Current sizes range from just under five inches to close to over six inches for screen size, which can be quite large to hold in the hand.</li></ul>
<p>Battery life: Any phone with significantly more than 24 hours is considered very good. Many manufacturers will judge battery on "talk time", but the phones will actually last days if left on standby.</p>
<p>Camera: Most smartphones will take great pictures and high-end models compete to offer the best cameras. Megapixels (MP) are not everything, but they can create shots with greater close-up details.</p>
<h3>The best smartphone deal for you</h3>
<p>Smartphone buying is not getting cheaper, as the £1,449 iPhone XS Max shows. The very top range smartphones are now all a significant investment, so getting the right model is more important than ever.</p>
<p>There are some <a>good deals</a> you can get by buying through a network, but for the most part you are best buying a phone outright and taking on a sim only deal.</p>
<p>Buying a phone outright, however, will give you more control over the data and minutes you need, although you will have to pay more upfront.</p>
<h3>What does it mean and why should I care? | A guide to phone jargon</h3>
<p>Here’s a guide to some of the most mentioned phone jargon, what it is, and how it’ll affect you when you use the phone.</p>
<p>Screen size: Measured from the top corner to diagonally across the phone to the bottom corner on the other side.</p>

<header> <h1> The best yoga mats for beginners to experienced yogis </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 14 December 2021 • 9:41am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Given its transformative benefits for mind and body, the barrier for entry to yoga is low. You need very little specialised clothing or equipment – in fact, all you need is a mat. </p>
<a>fitness equipment</a> such as
<a>treadmills</a>, a yoga mat won't clean out your bank account – some mats are as little as £20. But not just any old mat will do – Emma Henry, an expert yoga teacher at
<a>Triyoga</a>, says that investing in a decent model will pay dividends further down the line. 
<a>Liforme</a> mat (see below). “There are cheaper ones available that are decent, but they might not last as long.” 
<a>Lululemon ‘(Un)mat’</a> when she’s on the move. She also considers the ethics of a company: “what they’re doing to support yoga teachers and what they’re doing environmentally.” 
<h2>How I tested the best yoga mats</h2>
<h2>1. Lululemon the reversible yoga mat 5mm </h2>
<p><a>£68, Lululemon</a></p>
<p>Top marks for this double-sided mat from lululemon, which offers unparalleled grip, a stable surface and plenty of support. It's unnoticeable in the best way; I felt grounded and supported, and my hands and feet didn’t budge. </p>
<p>Despite being thicker than most others, it's not unduly heavy, at 2.3kg. That's the upper end of what I'd consider to be an easy weight to carry, but it means that this mat excels both at home and in class. </p>
<p>The only downside is that it doesn’t come with a carry strap or bag – but that really is nitpicking. Put simply, it’s a brilliant all-rounder that is more than worth the investment. </p>
<h2>2. Manduka PROlite yoga and Pilates mat</h2>
<p><a>£75.95, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Manduka PROlite is ethically made and wonderfully durable. It's favoured by The Telegraph's Boudicca Fox-Leonard, a part-time yoga instructor. Here's what she has to say:</p>
<p>Manduka promises its mats are made for life, and they come with lifetime guarantees. The most durable option you can find.</p>
<h2>3. Liforme Original yoga mat</h2>
<p><a>£104.95, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Yoga teacher Emma Henry’s favoured mat is the Liforme original. There's no getting round the fact that it’s expensive, but this is a mat that will last for years and years. </p>
<a>£89.95, Amazon</a>). 
<p>Liforme also has impressive eco credentials; their mats are made from natural rubber and eco-friendly polyurethane and are biodegradable. </p>
<h2>4. Yogi Bare Paws yoga mat</h2>
<p><a>£74.95, Amazon</a></p>
<p>I loved testing this mat – it has a smooth yet grippy surface not dissimilar to the Liforme model above, but it's not quite as expensive. It also has alignment guides to keep you on track. </p>
<h2>5. Lululemon Take Form Yoga Mat</h2>
<p><a>£108, Lululemon</a></p>
<h2>6. Sweaty Betty Super Grip yoga mat </h2>
<p><a>£65, Sweaty Betty</a></p>
<h2>7. Yogamatters Sticky yoga mat</h2>
<p>This would be an excellent mat for taking to a class or using on the move, but for home practices I would choose something with a smoother surface and a bigger footprint. </p>
<header> <h1> The best coffee machines of 2022, tried and tested </h1> <p> From big, barista-style coffee machines to compact espresso makers and pod and capsule systems, here's how to raise your coffee game </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:28am </time> </div> </div>
<p>I hadn’t previously given much these variables much consideration. It may sound obvious, but factors including the the coarseness of the grind and water filtration make a big difference to the taste of the cup you end up with. </p>
<a>Prufrock</a>, in Farringdon, London – tells me you should never put tap water in any coffee machine. Yikes. There’s a gadget that can help called Peak Water, which is a specialist water filter jug for coffee (
<a>£49, Colonna Coffee</a>). High-end coffee machines should have an inbuilt water filter. 
<a>Piqant</a>, tells me. "Weighing your coffee will mean you get consistently good coffee – rather than relying on a tablespoon or eyeballing."
<h2>How I tested the best coffee machines</h2>
<a>from £24 for four boxes</a>) or beans from Kent-based subscription service
<p>Here are the best coffee machines, starting with my favourite... </p>
<h2>The best coffee machines to buy in 2022</h2>
<h2>1. Sage Barista Pro espresso machine</h2>
<p>Best manual machine for coffee experts</p>
<h2>2. Sage Bambino espresso machine</h2>
<p><a>£329.95, Sage</a></p>
<p>Best manual machine for space-saving</p>
<p>When it comes to actually making a coffee, the Bambino doesn't disappoint. It heats up and is ready to go almost instantaneously and has many of the same premium features as the Sage Barista machines. </p>
<p>It's intuitive to use and extracts the espresso evenly and consistently so you get a great-tasting coffee every time. It also has an especially powerful steam wand that made even my amateur latte art look passable. </p>
<h2>3. De’Longhi Dedica pump manual espresso coffee machine </h2>
<p><a>£181.99, De’Longhi</a></p>
<p>Best manual small espresso machine</p>
<p>It's controlled via three simple buttons on the front of the machine, but they're customisable, so you can adjust brew temperature and water hardness. It notifies you when the machine needs descaling, which is a handy extra feature. </p>
<h2>4. Smeg ECF01BL coffee machine</h2>
<p><a>£319, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Best manual retro style coffee machine</p>
<h2>5. Morphy Richards espresso machine</h2>
<p><a>£109.99, Morphy Richards</a></p>
<p>Best manual budget espresso machine</p>
<p>My first impressions of this machine were very positive indeed, as it's a stylish-looking espresso machine for the same price as most pod or capsule models. </p>
<h2>6. Nespresso Vertuo Next coffee machine </h2>
<p><a>£74.99, Currys</a> </p>
<p>Best (and best-known) pod coffee machine</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to resist the ease of a Nespresso machine. They come ready to go out of the box and each time you want a coffee, you only need to pop a pod in the top and press a single button. It’s totally mess free. </p>
<p>It has a sleek, compact body that doesn’t take up too much space on my work surface. I found that it started up and heated up in seconds and was the easiest to use of any machine I tested. </p>
<h2>7. Grind One coffee machine </h2>
<p>Best alternative to Nespresso pod machine</p>
<p>This machine is a stylish shortcut for coffee snobs. London chain Grind has produced a capsule machine that’s essentially a Nespresso machine, but with an espresso aesthetic. </p>
<p>The sleek stainless steel body is inspired by the manual espresso machines used in Grind’s shops and was designed in collaboration with the Swedish coffee brand Sjöstrand. </p>

<header> <h1> The best mattress for a great night’s sleep – recommended by experts </h1> <p> From memory foam to hybrid models, we've compiled this handy guide to help you make the right choice </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:57am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Wilson himself has an individually customised mattress from <a>UnikBed</a>, which manufactures each mattress based on an individualised assessment with the assistance of physiotherapist. However, such a custom-made mattress comes at a cost. </p>
<h2>What is the best type of mattress? </h2>
<p>There are a wide range of mattresses out there that all make very similar promises. How are you supposed to know which is the most supportive? </p>
<li>Hybrid: The best of both worlds – hybrid mattresses contain both a layer of pocket springs and a layer of memory foam to provide improved comfort, support and temperature regulation.</li>
<h2>How do you know when to change your mattress?</h2>
<h2>How I tested the best mattresses </h2>
<h2>The best mattresses for a good night’s sleep</h2>
<h2>1. Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress </h2>
<p><a>£869.76 for a double, Simba</a> </p>
<p>It doesn’t come cheap, but this consistently top-rated hybrid mattress is worth every penny should you choose to invest, thanks to its winning combination of cloud-like lightness, temperature regulation and unparalleled support. </p>
<h2>2. Brook + Wilde Lux mattress </h2>
<p><a>£699 for a double, Brook + Wilde</a></p>
<h2>3. Emma Premium hybrid mattress </h2>
<p><a>Was £549.45 for a double, now £499.50, Emma</a></p>
<h2>4. Silentnight Genius 1200 Pocket Memory mattress</h2>
<p><a>Was £549 for a double, now £439.20, John Lewis</a></p>
<a>£659</a>) – it has more springs, for extra bounce, and is made from recycled plastic bottles (it’s also fully recyclable at the end of its life). 
<h2>5. Nectar Memory Foam mattress </h2>
<p><a>Was £549.45 for a double, now £411.95, Nectar</a></p>
<p>It has another USP: Nectar is the only climate-neutral mattress company and manufactures its mattresses in the UK without any harmful chemicals (so it doesn’t smell when you first open it). </p>
<h2>6. IKEA MORGEDAL mattress</h2>
<p><a>£199 for a double, IKEA</a></p>
<p>It’s incredibly easy to set up, as it comes compressed in a box and can be slept on straight away (although IKEA do note that it can take a few days to fully decompress). </p>
<a>£199</a>) is another budget-friendly choice.

<p>Dr Jet Khasriya, specialist in bone and mineral biology and NHS-registered and private GP for doctor-on-demand app GPDQ, shares her advice on how smart scales work.</p>
<h2>Why are smart scales useful?</h2>

<h2>What else to consider?</h2>
<p>"Size is important: make sure the scales you eventually decide on are big and sturdy enough to accommodate you. Nobody wants scales that break after one use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have carpeted or uneven floors, you might want to opt for a scale with attachable carpet feet for accuracy.</p>
<p>It's also always worth reading through the small print when it comes to <a>data privacy.</a>"</p>
<h2>The best bathroom scales under £25</h2>

<p>The LCD displays are clear and easy to read, though it can get a little busy and differentiating between the five first thing in the morning might be tricky for some.</p>
<p>Subjectively, the scale's ability to recommend a daily calorie intake often suggests more calories than users are used to (or arguably, need). Because of this, we advise speaking to a nutritionist or GP for more targeted diet planning.</p>

<a>£22.90, Amazon</a>), the new breed of smart scales have exciting features to offer - many of which are easy to use thanks to their connectivity to apps and other devices, and their clear, easy to read LCD screens.
<p>Of these, we particularly rated the Garmin Index smart scale and the Withings Body+ body composition Wi-Fi scale (<a>£89.99, Amazon</a>). </p>
<p>“Studies comparing these machines with traditional methods did show relatively poor accuracy about body composition, principally due to the above reasons.</p>

<header> <h1> The best washer dryers to save you time, space and money </h1> <p> These two-in-one machines will make laundry less of a chore </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:11am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The most compelling case for a washer-dryer is the space they save – instead of two freestanding appliances, you get one that does both. </p>
<p>The first choice to make is between a freestanding or an integrated washer dryer. An integrated dryer fits in with the rest of your white goods and cupboards, while a freestanding model can be front loaded and often has a larger capacity.</p>
<p>Other key considerations are energy efficiency, so the machine doesn’t add unduly to your energy bill, a good range of preset programmes or washing cycles, washing and drying capacity and spin speed. </p>
<p>Most washer-dryers have a smaller drying than washing capacity, so you want a machine with as high a drying capacity as possible if you regularly tumble dry your clothes (to avoid having to split every load in half). </p>
<p>We used all these criteria, not forgetting style and price, to compile this guide to the best washer dryers on the market… </p>
