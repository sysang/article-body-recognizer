<header> <h1> Lord Ahmed accused of exploiting position to pursue sex with vulnerable seeking help </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 14 February 2019 • 10:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The woman, Tahira Zaman, 43, complained about Lord Ahmed’s behaviour to the Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff.</p>
<p>But Ms Scott-Moncrieff concluded the Lords’ Code of Conduct could not have been broken because when the peer offered to help it was not part of his parliamentary work.</p>
<p>In a second case, a woman who wishes to remain anonymous, said she had also asked the peer for help and claims he suggested she should spend the night at his London home.</p>
<p>She interpreted this as a proposition for sex, which she refused. Lord Ahmed denies all the allegations against him.</p>
<p>Ms Zaman said she felt exploited by Lord Ahmed because she was suffering from anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>She had approached him in February 2017 through a mutual friend because she hoped he would help get the police to investigate a Muslim faith healer who she felt was a danger to women.</p>
<p>Ms Zaman told BBC Newsnight Lord Ahmed said he wrote a letter to the Metropolitan Police about her concerns, but went on to have sex with her on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>She accepts the alleged relationship was consensual but said: “I was looking for help and he took advantage of me. He abused his power.”</p>
<p>She said the relationship ended after two months when Lord Ahmed told her he would not leave his wife.</p>
<p>Ms Zaman said: “I genuinely did believe that he had feelings for me, I’m just so stupid… and I believed that he was going to help me.”</p>
<p>In January last year, she complained to Ms Scott-Moncrieff and said she had been “preyed upon due to my vulnerability and used”.</p>
<p>The Commissioner reviewed the complaint twice but said she was unable to investigate.</p>
<p>Lord Carlile, a crossbench peer and QC, said a sexual relationship between Lord Ahmed and Ms Zaman could breach the code and that rules needed to be “clarified”.</p>
<p>He said: “If someone comes to you for help, particularly if they’re vulnerable…and you form a sexual relationship, actually that's disgraceful.”</p>
<p>Ms Scott-Moncrieff said in a statement: “Though credible and substantial, the complaint provided insufficient evidence that contact with the member was in relation to his parliamentary duties.”</p>
<p>She added: “I was therefore unable to launch an investigation. To conclude otherwise, as Lord Carlile has done, is to misunderstand the Code.”</p>

<h1>Labour peer Lord Ahmed suspended over claims he blamed imprisonment on 'Jewish conspiracy' </h1>
<p>Labour has suspended a peer who is alleged to have blamed a Jewish conspiracy for the prison sentence he received following a fatal motorway crash.</p>
<div> <div> <span> By Peter Dominiczak </span> <time> 14 March 2013 • 2:28pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed, a Labour life peer, is alleged to have told a TV station in Pakistan that he was imprisoned in 2009 because of pressure on the courts from Jews “who own newspapers and TV channels".</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Labour immediately suspended the peer “pending an investigation” and Ed Miliband, the party’s leader, described Lord Ahmed’s reported comments as “disgraceful”. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He was jailed for dangerous driving after Martyn Gombar, a 28-year-old Slovakian was killed on Christmas Day in 2007 after his stationary car was hit by Lord Ahmed’s Jaguar. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed served 16 days in jail after it was disclosed that he had been sending and receiving text messages minutes before the crash.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed, who in 1998 became the first Muslim life peer, is said by The Times to have claimed that the conspiracy was a result of his support for the Palestinians in Gaza. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The peer is alleged to have made the comments during a TV interview in April. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>In the TV broadcast it is alleged Lord Ahmed said of his jail sentence: “My case became more critical because I went to Gaza to support Palestinians. My Jewish friends who own newspapers and TV channels opposed this.”</p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Ed Miliband, the Labour leader said: "I think that the comments reported by Lord Ahmed are disgraceful comments. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"There's no place for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, and frankly anybody who makes those kinds of comments cannot be either a Labour lord or a Labour member of Parliament."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A Labour spokesman said the party will be urgently seeking to “clarify” the peer’s alleged remarks.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Jon Benjamin, Chief Executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that the Labour party must expel Lord Ahmed if the allegations are found to be true.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>“We are appalled by Lord Ahmed's alleged comments which recall the worst Jewish conspiracy theories,” Mr Benjamin said. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed, who was born in Pakistan, became Baron Ahmed of Rotherham at the age of 40. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In 2007 he was highly critical of the awarding of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie, claiming the author had "blood on his hands." </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed was last year suspended from the Labour Party amid reports that he offered a £10 million bounty for the capture of President Barack Obama and his predecessor President George W Bush. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The peer denied having made the comments, published in a Pakistani newspaper, and was reinstated after an investigation by Labour Lords Chief Whip Lord Bassam.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed was not available for comment.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>However, he told The Times he had “no recollection” of the TV interview. </p> </div> </div>
<h1>Lord Ahmed freed from prison after dangerous driving sentence suspended </h1>
<p>Lord Ahmed, the Labour peer jailed after admitting sending and receiving text messages minutes before being involved in a fatal car accident, has been released from prison.</p>
<div> <div> <span> By Jon Swaine </span> <time> 13 March 2009 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He left Moorland Prison, near Doncaster, South Yorks, after the Court of Appeal ruled to suspend his 12-week sentence for dangerous driving. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed, 51, of Rotherham, was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court on February 25.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The court heard he had exchanged several text messages with a journalist as he drove down the M1 in West Yorks on Christmas Day 2007. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Minutes later, he was involved in a collision which killed Martyn Gombar, 28, a Slovakian who was living in Leigh, Lancs.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Gombar's car had stopped in the fast lane. Subsequent tests showed that Mr Gombar, a father of two, had been drinking and crashed his car into the central reservation.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Sentencing Lord Ahmed, Mr Justice Wilkie said that the texting and the crash had not been connected.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Steve Smith, Lord Ahmed's solicitor, said his client was "in good spirits" after his release. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"Now he's anxious to get back to work," Mr Smith said. "He'll have two or three days to rest, then he'll be straight back into it. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>Mr Smith said the peer was "very, very grateful" to people who had written to him with messages of support. "He's had loads – more than 6,000 letters. They're from lords right down to Joe Public – the full spectrum.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"He's just overwhelmed by the support which has come from all communities." </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>The decision was condemned by road safety groups. A spokesman for Brake said: "We are appalled ... We think he was given quite a light sentence to begin with. To reduce it sends out completely the wrong message to other drivers." </p> </div>
<h1>Labour peer Lord Ahmed jailed for motorway texting </h1>
<p>Labour life peer Lord Ahmed has been jailed for 12 weeks for dangerous driving by a judge who heard he sent and received a series of text messages from his car on a motorway.</p>
<div> <div> <time> 25 February 2009 • 12:13am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Sheffield Crown Court was told Lord Ahmed was involved in an accident which left a man dead on the M1 near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Christmas Day 2007.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>But the judge made it clear the text messaging had finished before the accident took place and was not connected to the fatal incident.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, heard Lord Ahmed got on to the M1 motorway at Dewsbury in the early evening of Christmas Day 2007. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The peer sent and received a series of five text messages, all of which were described as substantial, rather than a few words. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The judge said the exchange of messages with a journalist amounted to a conversation, which took place as the peer was travelling at around 60mph over a 17.8-mile stretch of the southbound carriageway. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The judge was told the fatal accident happened close to junction 35 of the motorway. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Lord Ahmed's Jaguar ran into an Audi. Its driver, Martyn Gombar, 28, had crashed minutes earlier and is thought to have been trying to retrieve his mobile phone from the vehicle. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The court was told that subsequent tests showed father-of-two Mr Gombar had been drinking and crashed his car into the central reservation, spinning it round. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>As Lord Ahmed approached the Audi, it was facing the wrong way, straddling the two outermost lanes in total darkness. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The court heard another car clipped its wing mirror and a further vehicle had taken such drastic avoiding action that it also collided with the central reservation. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>But the judge said Lord Ahmed's text message conversation ended 1.86 miles, (3km) or two minutes, before the collision with the Audi. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He was jailed for 12 weeks for dangerous driving. </p> </div> </div>
<h1> Former Labour peer Nazir Ahmed ‘sexually abused young boy and girl’ as teenager </h1>
<p> Former politician, 64, is on trial at Sheffield Crown Court for sexual offences against children dating back more than 40 years </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 18 November 2021 • 7:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A former Labour peer sexually abused a young boy and girl when he was a teenager, a court was told.</p>
<p>Nazir Ahmed, formerly Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, went on trial at Sheffield Crown Court on Thursday accused of sexual offences against children dating back more than 40 years.</p>
<p>A jury was told how the woman alleges that Ahmed attempted to rape her in the early 1970s, when the defendant was about 16 or 17 years old but she was much younger.</p>
<p>The former politician, now 64, is also accused of a serious sexual assault against a boy under 11, also in the early 1970s, plus the indecent assault of the same youngster.</p>
<p>The jury was played a recording of a telephone call between the two complainants, made by the woman after she went to the police in 2016.</p>
<p>Tom Little QC, prosecuting, told the jury the call was prompted by the man contacting the woman by email saying: "I have evidence against that paedophile."</p>
<h2>‘Malicious fiction’</h2>
<p>Mr Little said Ahmed claims the allegations are a "malicious fiction", but the recording showed they were not "made up or concocted".</p>
<p>"The police will look after you. They will believe you. They will take your allegations seriously. They are on your side. You are a victim."</p>
<p>Sounding very upset, the man tells the woman: "I don't want the bastard to get away with it." He says: "I thought I was the only one."</p>
<p>Mr Little said: "The surprise you can hear from [the man] is palpable."</p>
<p>The barrister said Ahmed will not be claiming there is an innocent explanation for the allegations. He said: "[Ahmed's] case is that they did not occur and this is all a malicious fiction."</p>
<p>Ahmed was charged along with his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both these men have been deemed unfit to stand trial. </p>
<p>Farouq and Tariq face charges of indecent assault in relation to the same boy Ahmed is alleged to have abused. But the jury has not been asked to determine whether they are guilty of these offences, just whether they did the acts alleged.</p>
<h2>‘This is about repeated sexual abuse that took place in Rotherham’</h2>
<p>Opening the prosecution case, Mr Little told the court: "This is about repeated sexual abuse that took place in Rotherham over a number of years."</p>
<p>"Those involved kept it buried away for many years. It is no longer buried away and no longer kept quiet as they have complained.</p>
<p>"This was not a single incident. It was not isolated and it was not innocent sexual experimentation by children. It was abuse, repeated abuse, plain and simple."</p>
<p>Mr Little said the male complainant told the police the abuse by the brothers began when he was at infants school.</p>
<p>The prosecutor told the jury: "Nasir Ahmed at the time [of the complaint] was a member of the House of Lords. He is no longer a member of the House of Lords."</p>
<p>He said the woman complainant "had the courage to go to the police to make a complaint against a standing member of the House of Lords".</p>
<p>Mr Little said Ahmed told police it seemed there was "an agenda behind the complaints" and he was concerned that, if he responded to the allegations, this would be "manipulated".</p>

<h1> Meghan, Duchess of Sussex wins legal challenge against Mail on Sunday over letter to father </h1>
<div> <div> By Hannah Furness, Royal Correspondent <time> 2 December 2021 • 8:38am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex has won her Court of Appeal case against the Mail on Sunday, as judges rule her "unfortunate lapse of memory" over briefing her biographers should not change the outcome.</p>
<p>She had already been granted a summary judgement in her favour, after she sued the newspaper publisher for a breach of her privacy, data protection and copyright.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing the publisher said Mr Markle had wished to counter points made by friends of his daughter, who had given an interview to People magazine in the US.</p>
<p>But, in a ruling on Thursday, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean dismissed the publisher's appeal and said the new evidence presented by the newspaper publisher was "of little assistance" to the case.</p>
<h2>'It was not necessary to deploy half the contents of the letter'</h2>
<p>Upholding Lord Justice Warby's previous summary judgement, they said: "It was hard to see what evidence could have been adduced at trial that would have altered the situation.</p>
<p>“The judge had correctly decided that, whilst it might have been proportionate to publish a very small part of the Letter for that purpose, it was not necessary to publish half the contents of the Letter as Associated Newspapers had done.</p>
<p>In a written judgment, he noted the evidence from Mr Knauf “disclosing that he had provided some information” to the authors of the Finding Freedom biography with the Duchess’s knowledge.</p>
<h2>'Victory for anyone who has ever felt scared'</h2>
<p>The Duchess hailed her “victory” in a statement, telling the public she had been fighting for them too.</p>
<p>“This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right,” she said.</p>

<p>Commenting on the case, Matthew Dando, Partner at Wiggin LLP: “This is a troubling judgment which has very concerning consequences for freedom of expression.</p>
<p>“This decision heightens concerns that privacy laws permit public figures selectively to determine what can be reported about them and manipulate the media narrative.</p>

<h2>'We are very disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision'</h2>
<p>A spokesman for ANL said it was considering appealing to the Supreme Court, believing that the case merits a trial.</p>
<p>“We are very disappointed by the decision of the Court of Appeal,” the publisher said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is our strong view that judgment should be given only on the basis of evidence tested at trial, and not on a summary basis in a heavily contested case, before even disclosure of documents.</p>
<p>“No evidence has been tested in cross-examination, as it should be, especially when Mr Knauf's evidence raises issues as to the Duchess's credibility.</p>
<p>“After People magazine published an attack on Mr Markle, based on false briefings from the Duchess's friends wrongly describing the letter as a loving letter, it was important to show that the letter was no such thing.</p>
<p>“Both the letter and People magazine also seriously misrepresented the reasons for Mr Markle's non-attendance at the royal wedding.</p>
<p>“The articles corrected these matters, and raised other issues of public interest including the reasons for the breakdown in the relationship between the Duchess and her father.</p>
<p>“We are considering an appeal to the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom.”</p>

<h1> On vaccine passports, Britain is about to repeat Italy's mistakes </h1>
<p> Italy still has a substantial unvaccinated population and infections are now rising. Its draconian vaccine passports have had little effect </p>

<p>The cost of the test, which involves queuing at high street chemists, is set by the government at 15 euros for adults: the equivalent of three packs of 20 cigarettes at Italian prices, and 8 euros for teenagers. </p>
<p>The ban on the unvaccinated eating out and other activities was soon extended to nearly all enclosed public spaces, except shops and churches, and to many forms of public transport such as ships, planes and long-distance trains.</p>

<header> <h1>Green levies add £112 to energy bills – where does the money go?</h1> <p>Falling wholesale prices won't shave the cost of Government green 'taxes' which add more to bills than VAT</p> </header>
<div> <div> <span> By Kate Palmer </span> <time> 26 January 2015 • 10:48am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The falling price of oil and gas hasn't escaped the attention of politicians and householders who are demanding that the "big six" energy firms pass on savings to customers. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>E.ON, British Gas, Scottish Power and npower cut their tariffs by between £24 and £35 in the two weeks after the Treasury began investigating energy firms' prices. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yet recent intense political pressure is targeted at a portion of overall energy bills - the 47pc that makes up wholesale costs. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The £112 levy, broken down in the pie chart (below), is in addition to the 5pc VAT bill that adds £60 to energy costs, according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>And this figure is predicted to rise. Green levies will add a further £55 to bills between now and 2020, and £75 by 2030, says the Committee for Climate Change. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>But as homes get more efficient and we become less reliant on fossil fuels as a nation, the net cost added to our bills could fall, according to industry experts. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>1. Energy Companies Obligation and the Green Deal: £47</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The Energy Companies Obligation (Eco) is the Government's scheme to help householders install energyefficient home improvements. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Under the rules, energy firms must help to improve the energy efficiency of their customers' buildings, with initiatives focused on the poorest and most difficult-totreat homes, with costs added to customers' bills. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>So far, more than one million homes across the country have had works funded through the policy. Householders can check their eligibility by contacting the Energy Saving Advice Service (0300 123 1234). </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This is different to Green Deal cashback, which is funded through taxpayer money, but includes administrative costs of the Green Deal, for example the costs of setting up Green Deal loans. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>2. Renewable Energy Obligation: £30</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Supporting large-scale renewable energy projects, such as solar power and wind turbine farms, cost £3.8bn last year, with this figure set to rise to £5.8bn from April 2015. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Any renewable energy source that generates more than 50kW, equivalent to one large wind turbine, is eligible to receive these subsidies. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This type of generation is expensive: even though renewable sources produce 16pc of UK generation, 90pc of this is supported through green levies. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>All energy suppliers pay towards renewables in this way, regardless of how they source their energy. For example, energy firm Good Energy, which sources all its power from renewables, pays the same as other firms. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"The principle is that 'everyone pays' - so the cost to all customers should be roughly the same," says Gill Dickinson of Good Energy. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>3. Warm Home Discount: £11</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The Warm Home Discount is a grant of up to £140 to help low-income pensioners pay for electricity during winter. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A total of £320m will be paid to customers in the winter of 2015 to 2016, and the scheme works in addition to taxpayer-funded cold weather payments and winter fuel payments. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>To qualify, householders must be with a registered energy supplier and receive the pension credit guarantee, although other households considered "vulnerable" may be eligible. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>However, take-up has not matched eligibility. Of 1.7million eligible people, just 1.4million are expected to claim this winter. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Caroline Abrahams from charity Age UK said more should be done to promote the scheme before funds run out in 2016. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>4. EU Green targets: £8 </b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Europe plans to ensure that 15pc of energy demand in Britain will be met from renewable sources by 2020. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A cornerstone of EU policy is the "emissions trading system", which caps the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted, for example by factories and power plants. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>If energy generators think they will emit more than their cap, they can purchase an extra allowance from the EU. There are added costs, too, such as monitoring and reporting carbon emissions. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Alex Coulton of RenewableUK said: "This impacts the wholesale price we pay by adding to the cost of coal and gas generation, especially for coal which emits more carbon. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"But in the future these mechanisms will have a small impact on consumer bills as we become less carbon intensive as a nation."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>5. Feed-in-tariff payments: £7</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Under the current government feed-in tariff rates, a householder with solar panels could generate an income of £625 a year. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>6. Carbon tax: £5</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The "carbon price floor" is a government-imposed minimum price on every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. Because European policies already increase the cost of fossil fuel emissions, it only adds £5 to energy bills. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Coulton said the policy acts as "top-up" to European policy: "If we took away EU price controls, the Carbon Price Floor would keep wholesale prices high."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>It's unlikely to form an increasing part of households' bills, however, since Chancellor George Osborne plans to freeze carbon tax until 2020. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>7. The smart meter roll-out: £3</b></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Smart meters, the in-home devices that track energy use, will cost every home about £215 over the next 15 years as energy firms deliver them to customers. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The Government says that meters will save householders £23 a year by 2020, by making people more aware of their energy use and scrapping meter readings where an engineer visits your home. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>However, energy experts have denied claims that "only a smart meter can get you accurate bills from your energy supplier" made by Smart Energy GB, the firm overseeing the smart meter roll-out. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"What makes smart meters smart is that they transmit data every second. Getting rid of meter readings doesn't need a smart meter," said Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich. </p> </div> </div>

<h1> Tackle cost of living crisis by scrapping energy bill tax, Tories urge Boris Johnson </h1>
<p> Five former ministers among backbenchers calling for action amid fears that household energy bills could double to £2,000 by April </p>
<div> <div> By Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor <time> 1 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson has been told he must intervene to address Britain's cost of living crisis, with 20 Tory MPs and peers calling on him to scrap taxes on energy bills.</p>
<p>Five former ministers are among a group of backbenchers who are calling on Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, to step in amid fears that <a>household energy bills could double</a> to £2,000 by April.</p>
<a>a global surge in wholesale gas prices</a> is contributing to the crisis, the UK is causing energy prices to increase "faster than any other competitive country" through "taxation and environmental levies".
<p>With the cap on energy bills <a>expected to rise by approximately £500</a> in April, the group warned that the hike will feed "directly into a cost of living crisis for many and push them into what is bluntly called 'fuel poverty'".</p>
<p>"High energy prices, whether for domestic heating or for domestic transport, are felt most painfully by the lowest paid," they wrote.</p>
<p>The intervention will increase the pressure on ministers, who are locked in talks with energy companies and the regulator Ofgem over <a>potential measures to reduce consumer bills</a>.</p>
<a>the removal of VAT on energy bills</a>, set at five per cent, saying it would be a "small" reduction but a "step in the right direction".
<p>One of the signatories also pointed that, during the Brexit referendum, both Mr Johnson and Michael Gove said leaving the European Union would allow the UK to reduce energy bills by scrapping VAT.</p>
<p>Similarly, the MPs noted that the climate change levy, applied to business energy use, is "making domestic energy intensive businesses uncompetitive and again increases the costs to consumers on virtually everything".</p>
<p>The MPs also warned Mr Johnson that <a>his net zero strategy</a> must not undermine the UK's domestic energy supply and urged him to adopt a "new approach to our energy security".</p>
<p>It comes as Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, <a>continues to hold talks with major suppliers</a> who are struggling to cope with record gas prices and the collapse of two dozen smaller companies.</p>
<p>The cost of millions of customers being transferred to new suppliers currently stands at £1.8 billion, and is expected to be recouped through a surcharge that could add an additional £100 to consumer bills.</p>
<p>However, energy companies are also calling on ministers to provide a £20 billion loan to help spread the wider costs of soaring gas prices over a decade – although that sum is said to be viewed to be too high by the Treasury.</p>

<p>Energy chiefs have warned that Britain is facing a deepening national crisis after gas prices soared to record levels following a sharp fall in European imports from Russia.</p>
<p>Executives at EDF, Good Energy and the trade body Energy UK urged ministers to step in following a surge in wholesale gas prices that has left the industry on the brink of disaster.</p>
<p>Prices rose to 470 pence per therm this week after months of unprecedented highs which analysts predict are at risk of continuing in 2023.</p>
<p>The energy price cap for households is expected to climb above £2,000 in April in the wake of the surge, up 56pc on current levels and 75pc higher than it was in September in a blow for millions of consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile 26 UK retail energy suppliers have gone bust since August because the cap prevents them from passing higher costs on to their customers, while a host of other businesses in energy and beyond are struggling.</p>
<p>Russia has been accused of adding to pressure on prices by withholding extra spot market supplies, with the amount of gas piped to Europe down a third from 2019 levels this month.</p>
<p>Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, said: "As the energy sector has been warning for weeks now, the unprecedented and alarming cost of gas across Europe will be the biggest issue facing the UK economy in the spring.</p>
<p>"We need action from the UK Treasury on this huge inflationary risk to business and economic security, and for all the ordinary people who will be facing a 50pc increase in their bill."</p>
<p>High energy prices are being felt across Europe. Factories in France are having to curb output or shut down to deal with energy price hikes, it has emerged. </p>
<p>Nyrstar plans to pause work at its French zinc smelter in January, while Aluminium Dunkerque Industries France and Romanian fertiliser producer Azomures have respectively cut down and halted output, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>The UK does not import much of its gas directly from Russia but does import from Europe which gets about 40pc of its gas from Russia, and prices in the UK track those on the continent</p>
<p>Russia, a major producer, has been accused of withholding supply to Europe in order to pressure German regulators into approving its new gas pipeline to Germany.</p>
<p>The amount of gas sent from Russia to Europe fell by 21pc from January to November, compared to two years ago, according to the Oxford Energy Institute.</p>
<p>So far in December, the amount supplied by state giant Gazprom has fallen by 33pc to 7.7bn cubic metres, compared to 2019, a Telegraph analysis of company figures shows. Supplies are also 22.1pc lower than over the same period in 2020. </p>
<p>Jack Sharples, of the Oxford Energy Institute, said Gazprom had been filling Russian storage sites until early November.</p>
<p>But its decision not to send more gas since then suggests that Moscow is deliberately withholding greater volumes, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Sharples said: "Whether they are doing that to put pressure on Europe, or simply because it is commercially advantageous to keep supplies constrained, is still not clear."</p>
<p>Gazprom stressed it supplies gas in accordance with customers' requests in full compliance with current contractual obligations.</p>
<h1> ‘Heat or eat’: the painful choice forced on families hit by cost of living crisis </h1>
<p> Consumer expert Martin Lewis warns the Government that households are going to take a ‘seismic’ hit to their bills </p>

<p>The cost of living crisis is forcing people to choose whether to “heat or eat”, a consumer expert has warned.</p>
<p>The Government's energy price cap is due to be revised in February, with the increase put onto customers' bills from April, raising fears that households can expect to take a "seismic" hit.</p>
<p>Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, urged the Government to intervene.</p>
<p>"This year is going to be a very tough year for many people,” Mr Lewis said. "The energy price crisis needs substantial intervention from the Government.</p>
<p>"We are going to see a minimum 50 per cent increase in energy prices in the system and that is unsustainable for many."</p>
<p>According to Cornwall Insights, an energy sector specialist,<a> bills could rise from £1,277 a year</a> under the current price cap to £1,865-a-year when the next revision is announced - a rise of 46 per cent.</p>
<p>They also predict it could spike to £2,240 a year at the following quarterly revaluation in August 2022 without a significant fall in energy prices globally.</p>
<p>Mr Lewis said: "We need to look at what we can do now and how we can protect those people who will need to choose between heating and eating. There are already some who are having to make that choice.</p>
<p>"We need to look at the whole structure of the energy market. The Government didn't intervene early enough so we're all paying for the market collapses we're seeing."</p>
<p>Several firms went bust in 2021, with customers at other energy firms picking up the tab for the collapses, whilst the Government also<a> took over the running of Bulb after it failed last November.</a></p>
<p>Ofgem has subsequently announced changes to how much other energy firms, and eventually customers, can be forced to pay to fund rivals' collapses.</p>
<p>However, many in the industry say more needs to be done to avoid companies from going bust and stricter rules put in place over who can run suppliers.</p>
<p>Mr Lewis added that there needed to be greater protection for the most vulnerable, who may not be able to shop around for the best deals, or may be stuck on more expensive pre-payment options.</p>
<p>He said: "What's coming in April is a seismic hit for fuel bills which is going to be astronomical. The Government has been meeting the energy industry but they've not been meeting the consumer groups.</p>
<p>"Certainly, I've not heard of any taking place. They have to sort this now because if we leave this before it's too late it will be a disaster."</p>
<a> to scrap energy taxes as bills continue to rocket</a> and consumers face “fuel poverty”.
<p>Energy prices in the UK are being forced up faster than any other comparable country due to "taxation and environmental levies", they wrote.</p>
<p>"It would be easy to dismiss these as due entirely to international cost pressures that all economies are facing," the letter said.</p>
<p>"However, we have almost uniquely caused our energy prices, through taxation and environmental levies, to increase faster than those of any other competitive country.</p>
<p>"High energy prices, whether for domestic heating or for domestic transport, are felt most painfully by the lowest paid."</p>
<p>A Government spokesperson said: “Protecting consumers is our top priority which is why our Energy Price Cap will remain in place.</p>

<header> <h1> Ellis Genge to quit Leicester in the summer for Bristol Bears </h1> <p> Exclusive: Telegraph Sport understands Genge is joining hometown club Bristol Bears, primarily for family reasons </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Daniel Schofield, Deputy Rugby Union Correspondent <time> 15 December 2021 • 3:20pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Leicester captain Ellis Genge will join his hometown club Bristol Bears this summer in another serious setback for the Gallagher Premiership leaders.</p>
<p>After fly-half George Ford decided to return to his roots by signing for Sale Sharks for next season, Leicester have lost another of their crown jewels with England prop and vice-captain Genge heading back to the West Country. </p>
<a> positive Covid case ruled him out of the victories against Australia and South Africa.</a>
<h2>Delight for Bristol but hopes of another Leicester dynasty receive major blow </h2>
<p>Bristol are in the midst of a woeful campaign, losing six of their nine Premiership matches after coming top last season. The squad is desperately in need of a spark and Genge will provide just that.</p>
<p>Having a local lad thrown into the mix with the array of global superstars at Bristol cannot hurt either, especially when their backs are against the wall.</p>
<p>With head coach Steve Borthwick now the strong favourite to replace Jones at England following the 2023 World Cup, this Tigers renaissance could well be a flash in the pan rather than the start of another dynasty. </p>
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The margins between victory and defeat are very fine this season - just ask Semi Radradra </h1> <p> It will not take much for sides like Bristol to move rapidly forward once they get consistency in their game </p> </div>

<p>So much is made of statistics that they sometimes threaten to become a game in themselves. The truth is that, beyond a certain point, they mean little and improperly analysed can become an impediment to accurate decision-making.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that you should not mock Pat Lam, the Bristol coach, when he claims that his side aren’t far off clicking, even though they presently sit one from bottom of the Premiership table with only hapless Bath below them.</p>
<p>The Bristol faithful might snort derisively at this claim but, so fine are the margins in this year’s Premiership, that it will not take much for sides like Bristol to move rapidly forward once they get consistency in their game.</p>
<h2>Leicester rediscover their traditional bloody-mindedness</h2>
<p>For an inordinately long time Gloucester could not put together five phases and as a result they failed to gain the momentum they should have had when they were by far the better side.</p>
<a>I would point to table-topping Leicester Tigers</a>. You can search for the magic formula that has transformed them from propping up the table to going, so far, unbeaten this season, but there isn’t one.
