<div><div><h1>Fierce Capitol attacks on police in newly released videos</h1></div><div>By ALANNA DURKIN RICHERJune 19, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Videos released under court order provide a chilling new look at the chaos at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, including body camera footage that shows a man charging at a police officer with a flagpole and tackling him to the ground. </p>
<p>The release comes at a time when Republican lawmakers in Washington increasingly try to downplay the siege, portraying the breach of the Capitol as a mostly peaceful protest despite the shocking violence that unfolded. </p>
<p>Supporters of former President Donald Trump fought past police lines to storm the building and interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s election win over Trump.</p>
<p>Other images in court documents show Webster pinning the officer to the ground and grabbing at his face. </p>
<p>Monroe said the officer provoked Webster by reaching across the barrier and punching him. The lawyer says Webster never actually struck the officer with the flagpole. </p>
<p>Other footage released in the case against Patrick McCaughey III, a Connecticut man charged with assault, show police wearing helmets and face shields gathered in a Capitol doorway as the crowd pushes aggressively forward and shouts at them. </p>
<p>An email seeking comment was sent to an attorney for McCaughey. </p>
<p>An email seeking comment was sent to Reffitt’s attorney on Friday. </p>
<p>More than 480 people are facing federal charges in the riot. Four have pleaded guilty so far, including a member of the Oath Keepers extremist group who has agreed to cooperate with investigators. </p>
<p>The powerful video footage was made public as Senate Republicans <a>have blocked a bipartisan inquiry</a> into the insurrection and as an increasing number of House Republicans have defended the rioters and played down the violence of the day. </p>
<p>At a <a>House Oversight and Reform hearing </a> Tuesday, several Republicans questioned Democrats’ efforts to examine the attack and said they should instead be focused on issues like border security or COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
<p>At a hearing last month, GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said one video feed of the rioters looked like they were <a>on a “normal tourist visit.”</a></p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI has released new video showing someone placing two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The explosive devices were placed outside the two buildings between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5 and were located by law enforcement the next day.</p>
<p>Federal agents hope the new video will spark additional tips to help identify the person. A $100,000 reward is being offered in the case.</p>
<p>“We are asking for you to come forward and speak to us about any odd or out-of-character behaviors,” D’Antuono said in a video statement released by the FBI.</p>
<a>secure the Capitol</a> and the number of threats against lawmakers remains high. For weeks, investigators have been worried about the potential for attacks on soft targets in the nation’s capital.

<div><div><h1>Look for Norway to top medal table again at Winter Olympics</h1></div><div>By STEPHEN WADEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Winter Olympics open in 30 days, and Norway is expected to head the medal standings for the second straight time, even topping its record haul of 39 medals in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>This is the prediction of U.S.-based Gracenote Sports, which released its medal table forecast on Wednesday with the Beijing Winter Games opening on Feb. 4.</p>
<p>Nielsen-Gracenote supplies statistical analysis to sports league around the world. Its Olympic numbers are based off computer models that analyze the most recent results in major competitions — and smaller ones — in the runup to Beijing.</p>
<p>Norway is predicted to win 22 gold medals and 45 overall. More than half of Norway’s medals are predicted to come in cross country skiing and biathlon.</p>
<p>Second place, if total medals is used for the ranking order, will be the Russian Olympic Committee with 11 gold and 32 overall. The team in Beijing, as in Tokyo, will be known as the ROC, or the Russian Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>The ROC must compete without its national flag or anthem, fallout from a state-backed doping program dating from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Many critics say the punishment is negligible since athletes still compete in national colors.</p>

<p>Japan is expected to produce its most overall medals in a Winter Olympics with 17, including four gold medals. Host nation China is predicted to win six gold and 11 overall. </p>
<p>“Hopefully we have the kind of forecast which gets us as close as we usually do,” Gleave told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Gleave said the new projection has Finland winning gold, followed by ROC with bronze for Canada. </p>
<p>Gracenote is expected to update the medal predictions around Jan. 19 and issue a final forecast just days before the Olympics open as entry lists are firmed up.</p>

<p>SYDNEY (AP) — David Warner and Marcus Harris guided Australia to 30 runs without loss at lunch Wednesday on a rain-interrupted first day of the fourth Ashes test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>At the interval, Warner was 15, with Harris on 11. </p>
<p>Both teams made one change from the third test at Melbourne where Australia won by an innings and 14 runs to take a 3-0 series lead and retain the Ashes.</p>
<p>For Australia, Usman Khawaja replaced Travis Head, who was absent after testing positive for the coronavirus. Veteran seamer Stuart Broad, with 526 wickets from 150 tests, returned for England for the injured Ollie Robinson. </p>

<div><div><h1>India falters at 188-6, leads South Africa by 161</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) — India slipped up just as it looked to be building a series-winning lead against South Africa to lose four wickets for 33 runs and go to lunch on 188-6 Wednesday in its second innings on the third day of the second test.</p>
<p>India’s advantage was still 161 runs and anything above 200 would be difficult for South Africa to chase batting last at the Wanderers.</p>
<p>But India had been totally in control of the session before a three-wicket burst by South Africa pace bowler Kagiso Rabada was crucial in the tourists faltering from 155-2.</p>
<p>Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara carried on where they left off the day before and both went to half-centuries.</p>
<p>They had built a 111-run partnership when Rahane fell for 58, caught behind off Rabada.</p>
<p>That sparked a run of India wickets as Puajara fell two overs later for 53, also to Rabada, and the quick bowler collected a third when Rishabh Pant went for a duck.</p>
<p>At 167-5, the momentum had swung and Lungi Ngidi followed up to get a fourth wicket for South Africa in the session when he ended Ravichandran Ashwin’s (16 off 14 balls) brief counterattack.</p>
<p>Hanuma Vihari, called in to the India team for this test in place of injured captain Virat Kohli, was 6 not out and the tourists’ last recognized batsman left.</p>
<p>India is seeking a first test series win in South Africa and will make history with a win at the Wanderers after already taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.</p>

<p>WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) — Japan midfielder Hayao Kawabe joined Wolverhampton from Swiss team Grasshoppers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wolves could send the 26-year-old Kawabe back on loan to Grasshoppers for the rest of the season, though he will train with the Premier League team in January. Both clubs are owned by Chinese investment firm Fosun.</p>
<p>Kawabe, who made his senior international debut in March, becomes the first Japanese player at Wolves.</p>
<p>Wolves technical director Scott Sellars said the club made a move to buy Kawabe this month because the player might not have been granted a visa in the future in light of changing criteria following Britian’s departure from the European Union.</p>
<p>Kawabe joined Grasshoppers from Sanfrecce Hiroshima last year.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy for our team. We’re in the semis, so super proud of that achievement,” Hurkacz said. “We have great team spirit. We support each other. I think the atmosphere that we bring helps us play better.”</p>
<p>Poland will next meet either Spain or 2020 champion Serbia for a spot in the final.</p>
<p>Chile’s 2-1 win over Norway meant Serbia needed to sweep Spain later Wednesday to move into top spot in Group A and advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p>Alejandro Tabilo beat Viktor Durasovic 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-1 to give Chile the lead before No. 8-ranked Casper Ruud levelled it for Norway with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Christian Garin.</p>
<p>Tabilo and Tomas Barrios Vera clinched the doubles 6-0, 6-4, giving Chile a 2-1 record in the round-robin stage and leaving Norway 0-3 after earlier losses to Spain and Serbia.</p>

<p>Mark Miles, president and CEO of Penske Entertainment Corp., said he met Kalkoven in 2013.</p>
<p>“In many ways, winning that year’s Indianapolis 500 with Tony Kanaan must have been the highlight of his racing life. I’m sure he didn’t come back down to Earth for many months,” Miles said.</p>
<p>Kalkhoven fielded a team that earned seven victories between 2003-16 in the Champ Car World Series and the NTT IndyCar series.</p>
<p>Kalkhoven, a native of Adelaide, Australia, joined Gerald Forsythe and Paul Gentilozzi to purchase the assets of the CART open-wheel racing series in 2003 and form the Champ Car World Series. </p>
<p>In February 2008, Kalkhoven and then-IndyCar series and Indianapolis Motor Speedway CEO Tony George completed extensive negotiations that reunified North American open-wheel racing after 12 years of two competing series.</p>

<p>The Wimbledon champion dropped serve twice in the first set and was 4-2 down, facing another break point, in the second before recovering to win 11 of the last 13 games.</p>
<p>A two-time major winner, Barty is aiming to be the first Australian woman to win her home major since Chris O’Neil in 1978.</p>
<p>Barty reached the Australian Open semifinals in 2020 and the quarterfinals in 2019 and last year.</p>
<p>She had a bye in the first round at Adelaide, one of the main tune-up tournaments for the Australian Open which starts Jan. 17.</p>

<p>Sabalenka, a semifinalist at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year, wasted a set point as she struggled with her serve in the tiebreaker. She then had 11 double-faults in the second set to give her 18 in total for the match.</p>
<p>The win was Juvan’s first against a Top 10 player and earned her a spot in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Rogers had to recover quickly after she led by a set and a break and then lost seven straight games to Sakkari.</p>
<p>Rogers will face seventh-seeded Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic mean there’s a crammed schedule of tournaments before the Australian Open.</p>

<p>WACO, Texas (AP) — Adam Flagler glanced down at the stat sheet and groaned. James Akinjo didn’t even want to see the Baylor turnovers he knew were glaring on the page. </p>
<p>While the guards combined for 12 of Baylor’s season-high 20 turnovers, both also scored more than 20 points as the top-ranked Bears stretched their national-best winning streak to 20 games with an 84-74 win over Oklahoma on Tuesday night. </p>
<p>“It’s very tough, I don’t even want to look at it,” Akinjo said of the seven turnovers, even though he matched his career high with 27 points and had five assists. </p>
<p>The Bears still won, and coach Scott Drew knows his perfectionist guards will do a better job after watching film. </p>
<p>The Bears made seven of eight free throws in the final 40 seconds, three by Akinjo and two each by Flagler and Thamba.</p>
<p>“We’re a tough team, a tough group of guys,” Akinjo said. “We just fought, Give credit to Oklahoma. ... We know in the Big 12 no one is going away.</p>
<p>Tanner Groves had 13 points to lead four players in double figures for first-year coach Porter Moser and the Sooners, who like Baylor shot 56% from the field (29 of 52). Jalen Hill and Gibson each had 12 points and Ethan Chargois 10.</p>
<p>Oklahoma had only three offensive rebounds, and 16 boards overall, and were outscored 19-0 on second-chance points. </p>
<p>“That definitely was a difference in the game,” Drew said.</p>
<p>Baylor forward Matthew Mayer broke his tooth in half early in the game, and it ended up in teammate Jeremy Sochan’s arm. </p>
<p>“I wonder if the tough fairy still works at his age,” Drew said. </p>
<p>Mayer was in foul trouble all night, but only seconds before his fifth foul blocked a 3-pointer by Gibson, then drove the court for a layup that put Baylor up by nine with 1:35 left. </p>
<p>“That block was huge,” Drew said. “Pleased with Matt’s toughness.”</p>

<p>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Mike Krzyzewski could sense his Duke players were battling fatigue by halftime in the second-ranked Blue Devils’ return from a COVID-19 outbreak. So he kept the message simple.</p>
<p>“I said, ’I know you guys are tired,” he said. “’But you cannot be tired on the defensive end.”</p>
<p>The approach worked, with the Blue Devils holding Georgia Tech to 33% shooting while grinding out a 69-57 win on Tuesday night in their first game in nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>It was never easy. Duke led by 15 midway through the second half but struggled to put this one away, with the Yellow Jackets twice cutting the deficit to six in the final 4 1/2 minutes.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>CFP championship: Matchups that will decide 'Bama-Georgia II</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>NFL's 2nd season of COVID just as trying as 1st, maybe more</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Mired in slump, Nets set to see what Kyrie Irving can do </h4></a></div></li>
<p>Still, Duke came up with answers — namely a vicious throwdown slam from AJ Griffin, a contested 3 from fellow freshman Trevor Keels and multiple late free throws — to stay in front.</p>
<p>“We all had to get our legs back,” Banchero said. “Some of us didn’t feel too good coming into the game. But we had to grind it out and get a win.”</p>
<p>The Yellow Jackets shot just 8 of 32 by halftime (25%) and finished at 33%.</p>
<p>“Duke’s good enough to win the national championship,” Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner said. “I was really proud of our young men, they competed, they battled.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never gone through anything like this,” the retiring Hall of Famer said. “So I’m learning as I’m doing it. ... We’re not close to being the team we were before the break. But we can be.”</p>
<p>There was an awkward second-half moment when Devoe pointed to Krzyzewski and said something as the coach called a timeout. Krzyzewski talked back to Devoe and followed him out near halfcourt as teams returned to their benches.</p>
<p>Afterward, Pastner said he didn’t know the specifics but would talk to Devoe.</p>
<p>“You can’t do that, no matter what the situation is,” he said. “No player should ever talk to an opposing coach. ... I know Michael Devoe has nothing but the highest level of respect for Coach K.”</p>
<p>Duke made 26 of 40 free throws. Georgia Tech got to the line just 12 times, making nine.</p>
<p>“Every one says it’s a farewell tour. We got detoured here.” — Krzyzewski on the COVID-19 postponements in his final season.</p>

<div><div><h1>Presbyterian hires Englehart to replace no-punt Kelley</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CLINTON, S.C. (AP) — Presbyterian hired Steve Englehart as football coach on Tuesday as the program moves on from Kevin Kelley, who made waves by almost never punting but didn’t win much in his only season with the Blue Hose.</p>
<p>The Blue Hose won their first two games but then lost nine straight as opposing coaches adapted to Kelley’s tactics. Kelley stepped away from the program last month.</p>
<p>Englehart had previous stints as the head coach at Florida Institute of Technology and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Athletic director Rob Acunto said Englehart is a “principled leader” who can develop players.</p>
<div><div><h1>Kansas State dominates short-handed LSU 42-20 in Texas Bowl</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>HOUSTON (AP) — Deuce Vaughn and the Kansas State Wildcats finished a streaky season on a positive note Tuesday night with a dominant 42-20 win over short-handed LSU in the Texas Bowl. </p>
<p>Vaughn, a sophomore running back and first-team All-American as an all-purpose player, rushed for 146 yards on 21 carries. He scored four touchdowns — three rushing and one receiving. </p>
<p>“The aggressiveness of our play calling opened up the running game,” Vaughn said. “Everybody was making plays, and our O-line stayed committed to the fight against a really good defense.”</p>
<p>Kansas State (8-5) also got a strong performance from quarterback Skylar Thompson, who returned to make his final collegiate start after missing the regular-season finale with an ankle injury. </p>
<p>“For him to be on point like he was and throwing strikes, he was phenomenal,” Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said. “To see him go out like that was huge. He wanted to play well in this moment and he did.”</p>
<p>Thompson completed 21 of 28 passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns and was chosen Texas Bowl MVP. Malik Knowles had two touchdown catches and 42 yards receiving.</p>
<p>“It flew by, but it was a special way to end it, for sure,” Thompson said. “Holy smokes, I couldn’t have drawn up a better way to finish it than tonight.”</p>
<p>While LSU (6-7) had a tough time slowing Vaughn and Thompson, the Tigers had another uphill battle on offense.</p>
<p>The Tigers turned to senior receiver Jontre Kirklin, who hadn’t played quarterback since high school in 2016. Kirklin had only played in 25 games over five seasons, including his first two years as a cornerback. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Kansas State dominates short-handed LSU 42-20 in Texas Bowl</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Presbyterian hires Englehart to replace no-punt Kelley</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Michigan State WR Jayden Reed returning in 2022</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Long Island University hires Ron Cooper as football coach</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The Tigers didn’t get a first down until late in the second quarter. By that time, Kansas State already had 12 first downs and a 21-0 lead. LSU later scored on that drive, though, a 23-yard touchdown catch by Jaray Jenkins. </p>
<p>Kirklin was 7-of-11 passing for 138 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions while also rushing for 61 yards on 11 carries. He delivered an 81-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hilton Jr. as time expired. </p>
<p>Davis said LSU had just 38 scholarship players available for the game, but backing out was never an option. </p>
<p>“We don’t stand back from a challenge,” Davis said. “There was never a thought in our mind about not playing this game. We fully expected to win.”</p>
<p>Kansas State appeared to have a slight edge in the makeup of the crowd, despite Baton Rouge, Louisiana, being nearly 500 miles closer to Houston than Manhattan, Kansas.</p>
<p>The Wildcats led 21-7 at halftime. </p>
<p>Kansas State enjoyed its most lopsided win over an SEC opponent in school history, improving to 5-17 against the conference. </p>
<p>Kansas State looked strong on both sides of the ball, with big performances from graduating seniors and players returning next season, en route to the Wildcats’ first bowl win since the Cactus Bowl in 2017. </p>
<p>LSU had hoped to carry on the positive momentum from an upset win over Texas AM in the regular-season finale, but transfers and injuries got the best of the Tigers. They’ll look to quickly reload next season under the new regime.</p>
<p>Kelly joined the television broadcast and was asked about his time in the limelight with viral videos poking fun of his dancing with recruit Walker Howard or his newfound faux Southern accent. </p>
<p>“Listen, whether it was dancing or whether I couldn’t get my accent down with ‘family,’ listen, I’m from Boston — we don’t have strong accents,” Kelly said. </p>
<p>Kansas State will have a new quarterback in 2022, but the offense will likely continue to flow through Vaughn. The Wildcats open against South Dakota.</p>
<p>LSU has an important offseason with the transition to Kelly, who has more victories than any active coach in major college football. The Tigers open against Florida State.</p>
