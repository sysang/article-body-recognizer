<p>The detention of Karim Massimov was announced by the National Security Committee which he headed until he was fired by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Wednesday after violent protests swept across the Central Asian nation.</p>
<p>Tokayev’s office said he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call that the situation was stabilising.</p>
<p>“At the same time, hotbeds of terrorist attacks persist. Therefore, the fight against terrorism will continue with full determination,” it quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Tokayev has ordered his troops to shoot to kill to end what he has called attacks by bandits and terrorists.</p>
<p>There were no details of the treason allegations. The security service said other officials were also detained, but did not name them.</p>
<p>It was not immediately possible to verify this account. The airport remains closed but is now under the control of Kazakh security personnel and Russian troops, according to Russia’s defence ministry.</p>
<p>The demonstrations began as a response to a fuel price hike but swelled into a broad movement against Tokayev’s Russian-backed government and 81-year-old Nazarbayev.</p>
<p>In Almaty, where security forces have reclaimed control of the streets since Friday, a Reuters reporter said occasional gunshots were heard on Saturday.</p>
<p>Some businesses began to reopen in the city of around 2 million people as people ventured out to buy supplies, and queues formed at petrol stations.</p>
<p>Security forces patrolled the streets. The deputy mayor was quoted by Russia’s RIA news agency as saying operations to purge the city of “terrorists and bandit groups” were still under way and citizens were advised to stay at home.</p>
<p>In the capital Nur-Sultan, Reuters filmed police stopping drivers at a checkpoint with armed soldiers nearby.</p>
<p>The interior ministry said more than 4,400 people had been detained since the start of the unrest. Tokayev announced a national day of mourning for Monday to commemorate those killed.</p>
<p>Access to the internet, which was been largely shut down in Kazakhstan for days, was still heavily disrupted on Saturday.</p>
<p>The deployment of the Russia-led CSTO military alliance at Tokayev’s invitation comes at a time of high tension in East-West relations as Russia and the United States prepare for talks next week on the Ukraine crisis.</p>

<div>2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: Answers to some big questions</div>
<p>The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing are right around the corner, with all kinds of questions — about international politics, public health and, yes, even sports — hanging over them. So here’s what we know so far.</p>
<p>When are the Beijing Olympics?</p>
<p>The opening ceremony is scheduled for February 4, though some preliminary events will be held in the days before. The closing ceremony is February 20. In all, there will be 19 days of competition across 15 sports.</p>
<p>This year’s Paralympics, also based in Beijing, are scheduled for March 4-13.</p>
<p>Is there any chance the Games could be delayed, or even cancelled, because of the pandemic?</p>
<p>How will they deal with the coronavirus?</p>
<p>Everybody at the Olympics will be required to be vaccinated. (Medical exemptions are available, but anyone who gets one will have to quarantine for an impractical 21 days before competing.) And once there, everyone will be tested every day.</p>
<p>Will any countries boycott the Games?</p>
<p>The calls intensified in November with the disappearance from public life of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis player and three-time Olympian, after she accused a former top government official of sexual assault.</p>
<p>“We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the Games,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said about the decision.</p>
<p>What will happen if an athlete stages a protest — about human rights or anything else — during the Olympics?</p>
<p>“That is a hypothetical question,” an IOC spokesperson, Mark Adams, said when asked in early December, pointing out that athletes could express personal views in interviews during the Games and on social media.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen what would happen if an athlete were to criticise, say, the Chinese government explicitly during the Games. “I think we have to wait for concrete examples,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Will fans be allowed to attend the events?</p>
<p>Overseas spectators will not be allowed to enter the country.</p>
<p>Will National Hockey League players be there?</p>
<p>No. That’s a reversal of plans announced in September that would have allowed the stars to head to Beijing while the league shut down for three weeks.</p>
<p>But with concerns rising about the omicron variant of the coronavirus, the league and its players union pulled out of the Games and may use the time in February to make up postponed NHL games.</p>
<p>The Olympic men’s hockey tournament will now most likely feature minor leaguers and those who play in other organisations.</p>
<p>How can I watch the Olympics?</p>
<p>The Seven Network will broadcast the Games in Australia.</p>
<p>What is the time difference with Beijing?</p>
<p>Beijing is 3 hours behind AEST.</p>
<p>Are there any new events?</p>
<p>There are seven additions to the program for the 2022 Olympics. The most compelling among them could be the monobob, a women’s solo bobsledding event.</p>
<p>Who are the Beijing 2022 mascots?</p>

<p>André Vama was one of hundreds of Kanaks who barricaded the road with burning tires and vehicles this year, strangling the mine’s operations.</p>
<p>The biggest leak, in 2014, led to 100,000 litres of waste gushing into a creek. Thousands of fish died, according to environmental groups.</p>
<p>The destruction, blockade and subsequent mine closure again cost the mine complex tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The Tesla deal, announced half a year later, was greeted with jubilation by Kanak political leaders, who say that it will force Goro to adhere to high standards.</p>
<p>Goro’s earth is rich in nickel and cobalt, key ingredients in the lithium-ion batteries most commonly used for electric vehicles. To extract the useful minerals takes a lot of energy. That means a lot of hazardous emissions.</p>
<p>The dirty coal that powers the processing plant will be replaced by a large collection of solar panels, say Prony executives.</p>
<p>There is another stumbling block in efforts to streamline the battery-making process. Most of the nickel destined for electric vehicle batteries, Goro’s included, goes to one place: China.</p>

<div>‘Deeply concerned’: Wong says Labor must be consulted on Ukraine</div>
<p>Crucial talks are being held between American and Russian diplomats this week, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Moscow of “massive consequences” if the build-up continues.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia have been in conflict since 2014, when Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Tensions have escalated in recent months, with Russia sending thousands of troops to the border, sparking fears of a Russian invasion.</p>
<p>If Russia were to invade Ukraine, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) may look to commit troops to help defend the nation and this could include a request to Australia for a military contribution.</p>
<p>Senator Wong said Labor expressed its support for “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and join international calls for Russia to de-escalate and abide by its international commitments”.</p>
<p>“Labor, as Australia’s alternative government, is deeply concerned about threats to Ukrainian sovereignty and the build-up of more than 100,000 Russian troops at the Ukrainian border,” she said.</p>
<p>Senator Wong said Labor would continue to seek regular briefings from government agencies, including the Office of National Intelligence and the departments of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Home Affairs.</p>
<p>As the US has butted heads with Russia and China in recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have increasingly forged a united front.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth Buchanan, a lecturer of strategic studies at Deakin University and Fellow of the Modern War Institute at West Point, said assuming Beijing had the ear of Moscow was problematic.</p>
<p>“There has yet to be any formal acknowledgement by Beijing of Russia’s Crimea claim, nor has Moscow waded into the South China Sea dispute,” Dr Buchanan said.</p>
<p>“In fact, China might perceive it now has even more room to manoeuvre in the Indo-Pacific should the US (and its European allies) be further distracted or bogged down in Europe.</p>
<p>“If anything, I would expect China to continue to simply watch from the sidelines. Beijing has no major interest in easing tensions.”</p>
<p>Dr Buchanan said international law and the primacy of sovereign borders were of prime interest to Australia and taking a “principled stand” was important.</p>
<p>But she said Australia might also have to consider “defence support to any allied mission”.</p>
<p>“However, in the context of Ukraine, which has been simmering since 2014, our allies have been rather hesitant to increase tensions with armed forces. Instead, dialogue has been the avenue selected.”</p>
<p>Hervé Lemahieu, director of research at the Lowy Institute, said presidents Xi and Putin“share a common enemy, and I think never underestimate the uniting qualities that presents”.</p>
<p>“They are both intent on weakening the US global position, and whilst their foreign policies are not identical, they are mutually complementary.”</p>
<p>Mr Lemahieu said a war in Ukraine would present significant challenges for Washington – “potentially either letting Russia get away with it or detracting from its efforts in the Indo-Pacific”.</p>
<p>DFAT has been contacted for comment.</p>
<div>Don’t fall for Moscow’s ‘continuing disinformation’ on Ukraine, says US</div>
<p>“We urge everyone not to fall for Moscow’s continuing disinformation,” Price told reporters, adding the US was comparing notes with its allies to figure out how best to continue dialogue with Moscow regarding Ukraine.</p>
<p>The warning came as the US and NATO rejected key Russian security demands for easing tensions over Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the US and NATO left open the possibility of future talks with Moscow on arms control, missile deployments and ways to prevent military incidents between Russia and the West.</p>
<p>Separately, the new top Republican on the US House Intelligence Committee called on President Joe Biden’s administration to ramp up military and intelligence support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe that the administration should be actively arming Ukraine so it can defend itself,” Mike Turner of Ohio said. “They want to defend themselves. They should be given every opportunity to do so.”</p>
<p>“Apparently you need a little education on Ukraine,” Turner told the host.</p>
<p>Turner said he wanted the committee to do more to inform Americans about what he called “near-peer adversaries” like China and Russia.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons why Russia might go into Ukraine is because they see the United States as weak,” he said.</p>
<p>“When the United States is weak ... it’s not just that the United States itself is at risk. Our allies are at risk, which of course inevitably puts us at risk.”</p>

<div>Massive cyberattack hits Ukraine government websites</div>
<p>While it wasn’t immediately clear who was behind the cyberattack, the disruption came amid heightened tensions with Russia and after talks between Moscow and the West failed to yield any significant progress this week.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko told The Associated Press it was too soon to tell who could have been behind the attack, “but there is a long record of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine in the past.”</p>
<p>Moscow had previously denied involvement in cyberattacks against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” Psaki said.</p>
<p>The US intelligence findings, which were declassified and shared with U.S. allies before being made public, estimate that a military invasion could begin between mid-January and mid-February.</p>
<p>Ukraine is also monitoring the potential use of disinformation by Russia. Separately, Ukrainian media on Friday reported that authorities believed Russian special services were planning a possible false flag incident to provoke additional conflict.</p>
<p>The new U.S. intelligence was unveiled after a series of talks between Russia and the US and its Western allies this week in Europe aimed at heading off the escalating crisis made little progress.</p>
<p>The use of false-flag attacks and disinformation is similar to what the Kremlin did in the lead-up to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that had been under Ukraine’s jurisdiction since 1954.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday dismissed Western media reports that said Moscow was preparing a provocation in eastern Ukraine as based on “unfounded” information, TASS news agency reported.</p>
<p>Russia said it dismantled ransomware crime group REvil at the request of the United States in an operation in which it detained and charged the group’s members, the FSB domestic intelligence service said on Friday.</p>
<p>The arrests were a rare apparent demonstration of US-Russian collaboration at a time of high tensions between the two over Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States welcomed the arrests, according to a senior admininstration official, adding “we understand that one of the individuals who was arrested today was responsible for attack against Colonial Pipeline last spring.”</p>
<p>High-stakes talks this week between Moscow and the US, followed by a meeting of Russia and NATO representatives and a meeting at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, failed to bring about any immediate progress.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that the 30-country military organisation will continue to provide “strong political and practical support” to Ukraine in light of the cyber attacks.</p>
<p>“In the coming days, NATO and Ukraine will sign an agreement on enhanced cyber cooperation, including Ukrainian access to NATO’s malware information sharing platform,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Friday that the 27-nation bloc is ready to mobilise all its resources to provide technical assistance to Ukraine and help it improve its capacity to weather cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Zhora has told the AP that officials are particularly concerned about Russian attacks on the power grid, rail network and central bank.</p>

<div>Russia could invade Ukraine ‘next month’: US intelligence</div>
<p>“The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment.”</p>
<p>The US analysis of Russia’s plans is based in part on satellite images that “show newly arrived units at various locations along the Ukrainian border over the last month,” the official said.</p>
<p>Biden said he is preparing measures to raise the cost of any new invasion for Putin, who has dismissed the US warnings as rumours and said Russia is not threatening anyone.</p>
<p>The Russian military moves come as Moscow has raised eyebrows in Washington with a sudden mobilisation of reservists this year and a dramatic escalation of its rhetoric regarding Ukraine.</p>
<p>Lavrov, in public comments this week, echoed Putin’s warnings about US military equipment and activity encroaching on Russia’s borders. “The nightmare scenario of military confrontation is returning,” he said.</p>
<p>The intelligence document also suggests that Russian forces may be leaving equipment behind at training facilities to allow an attack on Ukraine to commence quickly.</p>
<p>“Equipment may be left behind at different training ranges to enable a rapid, final buildup,” the document adds.</p>
<p>While laying the groundwork for an invasion, the Russian government has also been waging a propaganda campaign, the US administration official said.</p>
<p>Putin has demanded the United States and its allies provide signed assurances excluding any expansion of NATO to include Ukraine and Georgia and limiting military activity near Russia’s borders, most notably in and around Ukraine.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki rejected out of hand the idea that Washington would provide a guarantee that Ukraine will not enter NATO.</p>
<p>“NATO member countries decide who is a member of NATO, not Russia,” Psaki told reporters during a White House briefing on Friday.</p>
<p>“That is how the process has always worked and how it will proceed. I think it’s important to remember where the provocative action is coming from. It’s not the United States. It’s not Ukraine.”</p>
<div>Belarus sentences opposition leader’s husband to 18 years in jail</div>
<p>Exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya vowed to continue her campaign against authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukashenko after a court in the country jailed her husband for 18 years.</p>
<p>A political novice, she quickly garnered strong support amid widespread public discontent with the long-serving president, whose claim to have won 80 per cent in the August 2020 elections triggered an unprecedented wave of protests.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the verdict “really incredible,” and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of Tsikhanouski and all political prisoners by Belarus.</p>
<p>“They disgrace the rule of law and the international obligations of Belarus by this court ruling,” she told reporters during a visit to Stockholm in Sweden.</p>
<p>Five other people on trial with Tsikhanouski, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty consultant Ihar Losik, were also jailed for 14 to 16 years.</p>
<p>The Belarusian human rights centre Viasna, itself a target of the government’s crackdown, also on Tuesday expanded its list of the country’s political prisoners to 920 people.</p>
<div>Lava from La Palma volcanic eruption finally reaches the ocean</div>
<p>The meeting of molten rock and sea water finally came at 11pm on Tuesday, local time. By daybreak, a widening promontory of newborn land could be seen forming under plumes of steam rising high into the area.</p>
<p>No deaths or serious injuries have been reported from the island’s first eruption in 50 years, thanks to the prompt evacuations of more than 6000 people after the ground cracked open following weeks of tremors.</p>
<p>Just before it poured down a cliff into the sea at a local point known as Los Guirres, the lava rolled over the coastal highway, cutting off the last road in the area that connects the island to several villages.</p>
<p>Torres said his government was working to house those who had lost their dwellings. Authorities have plans to purchase over 100 currently unoccupied homes. Torres cited one village, Todoque, home to 1400 people, which was wiped out.</p>
<p>La Palma, home to about 85,000 people, is part of the volcanic Canary Islands, an archipelago off north-west Africa. The island is roughly 35 kilometres long and 20 kilometres wide at its broadest point.</p>
<p>Cleaning crews swept up ash in the island’s capital, Santa Cruz, while more small earthquakes that have rumbled under the volcano for weeks were registered by geologists.</p>
<p>Laura Garces, the director of Spain’s air navigation authority ENAIRE, said she does not foresee any major problems for other airports on the archipelago due to the ash.</p>
<p>While the red tongue of lava lolled off the coast, the two open vents of the volcano continued to belch up more magma from below.</p>
<p>Experts say it’s too early to determine how long the eruption will last. Previous eruptions in the archipelago have lasted weeks, even months.</p>
<div>Residents flee as lava from volcanic eruption spreads on Spain’s La Palma</div>
<p>La Palma: Around 300 more people fled their homes early on Thursday as flows of molten rock pouring from the Cumbre Vieja volcano threatened to engulf another area on the Spanish island of La Palma.</p>
<p>Emergency crews gave people living between the towns of Tazacorte and La Laguna a few hours to collect their belongings and pets and go to a meeting point.</p>
<p>During the morning, a 4.5 magnitude earthquake rocked the island, the Spanish National Geographic Institute said - the strongest of 100 quakes that have hit the eruption zone over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Tremors have been recorded almost constantly since before the eruption.</p>
<p>With no end in sight to the eruption, which is in its fourth week, authorities said they were expecting the lava flow to keep spreading northwest from the volcano.</p>
<p>Red hot lava has already laid waste to nearly 600 hectares of land and destroyed about 1,500 houses and other buildings, including a cement plant that gave off toxic fumes earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The flow has also devoured banana and avocado plantations vital to the island’s economy.</p>

<div>‘We are at the mercy of the volcano’: No end in sight for La Palma eruption</div>
<p>Madrid: There is no sign that a volcanic eruption on the Spanish island of La Palma is coming to an end, four weeks after it began, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The volcano on one of the Canary Islands off north-west Africa has so far destroyed more than 1800 buildings, mostly homes, though prompt evacuations have helped avoid casualties on the island of some 85,000 people.</p>
<p>Canary Islands President Ángel Víctor Torres said scientists monitoring the eruption that began September 19 have seen no indications that the eruption is abating, as rivers of lava continue flowing slowly toward the sea.</p>
<p>“We are at the mercy of the volcano,” Torres told reporters.</p>
<p>“There are no signs that an end of the eruption is imminent even though this is the greatest desire of everyone.“</p>
<p>Some 7000 people have had to leave their homes.</p>
<p>The volcano has produced a constant rumble and roar, with dozens of minor earthquakes most days. On Sunday alone there were 42 seismic movements reported, the largest measuring 4.3, according to the Spanish National Geographical Institute.</p>
<p>Ash has settled across the island and the ash plume is several kilometres high. Airlines have sporadically cancelled flights to the islands, including 56 flights over Saturday and Sunday, due to the ash.</p>
<p>Almost half – 22 out of 38 – of all flights to the island were cancelled on Sunday, state airport operator Aena said, but the airport remained open.</p>
<p>The latest satellite imagery showed the molten rock has covered 754 hectares, most of it countryside and farm land. Almost 60 kilometres of roads have also been ruined.</p>
<p>The island lives mainly from tourism and banana plantations. The government has pledged millions of euros to help rebuild damaged infrastructure.</p>

<p>Still, trying to compare notes with previous eruptions involves delving into centuries-old records, some from a time when photography did not exist.</p>
<p>Although one man died in November when he fell from a roof while cleaning off volcanic ash, there have been no deaths directly linked to the eruption.</p>
<p>Much of that is due to new technologies in volcanology: everything from drones that allow scientists to peek into a volcanic cauldron to supercomputers that run prediction algorithms.</p>

<p>“It’s like treating a patient,” he said. “You can monitor how (the eruption) evolves, but saying exactly when it will die is extremely difficult.”</p>
<p>“The more eruptions that we study, the more we are going to understand how they behave,” he said.</p>

<div>Villagers flee in Indonesia as tallest volcano on Java erupts</div>
<p>Singapore: People have been filmed running from a spiralling volcanic cloud in Indonesia as the tallest mountain on the island of Java erupted on Saturday, spraying ash 12,000 metres into the sky and turning day into night.</p>
<p>The agency said in a statement the volcano observation post at Mt Semeru had reported lava flow just before 3pm local time, with an avalanche of hot gas and lava quickly descending its slopes onto the village of Sapitarang below.</p>
<p>“Other reports said darkness occurred in several locations due to the fog from the volcanic ash,” it said on Saturday night.</p>
<p>A thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and finally collapsed the lava dome atop the 3676-metre Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey centre.</p>
<p>One of the people killed was in the village of Curah Kobokan, where most buildings were severely damaged.</p>
<p>Entire houses in the village were damaged by volcanic debris and more than 900 people fled to temporary government shelters, Muhari said.</p>
<p>An official at Indonesia’s search and rescue agency told news channel Metro TV on Sunday that evacuations have been suspended due to hot clouds hampering efforts.</p>
<p>Other obstacles include heavy rocks and hot volcanic sediment that is limiting movement, a local disaster mitigation agency official said.</p>
<p>Officials reported that 10 people who had been trapped around mines near the volcano had been evacuated, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Thoriqul Haq, a local official in Lumajang, said earlier that sand miners had been trapped around their work sites.</p>
<p>Haq told Reuters that the eruption had destroyed a road and bridge connecting the district of Lumajang and the nearby city of Malang, and had wrecked buildings.</p>
<p>“This has been a very pressing, rapid condition since it erupted,” he said. Haq added that evacuations were under way but did not give details.</p>
<p>“I hope they are safe,” she said.</p>
<p>AirNav Indonesia, a state-owned company that oversees air safety management in the country, said the volcanic ash from Mt Semeru, Java’s highest peak at 3676 metres, had reached 12 kilometres high.</p>
<p>Mt Semeru is among Indonesia’s 127 active volcanoes and according to the Volcanology Survey of Indonesia, its first eruption was recorded in 1818 and there have been regular instances since, with lava spreading as far as 6 kilometres away.</p>
<p>Between 1885 and 1889 it exploded more than twice in a year and then nearly a century later, in 1980, the eruption went on the whole year.</p>
<p>Indonesian news outlet Kompas reported that the mountain’s most recent eruptions occurred in 2016, and 2019. The last time Semeru erupted, in January, there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the meeting point of continental plates makes it prone to volcanic eruptions and other seismic activity.</p>
<p>It has more active volcanoes than any other country in the world, and they are located on most of the major islands across the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>Only 69 of its 127 volcanoes are being monitored by the Volcanology Survey of Indonesia, according to the website of Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.</p>
<div>Tongan tsunami damage remains unknown as volcanic ash hinders response</div>
<div><div><h5>By Nick Perry</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 17, 2022 — 4.52am</time></span><span>first published at <time>3.43am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Early reports from Tonga indicate the eruption has covered much of the nation in a layer of dust.</p>
<p>Satellite images showed the spectacular eruption on Saturday evening, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters. A sonic boom could be heard as far away as Alaska.</p>
<p>In Tonga, it sent tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground.</p>
<p>The eruption cut the internet to Tonga, leaving friends and family members around the world anxiously awaiting information. Even government websites and other official sources remained without updates on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there had not yet been any official reports of injuries or deaths in Tonga, but cautioned that authorities had not yet made contact with some coastal areas and smaller islands.</p>
<p>“Communication with Tonga remains very limited ... and I know that is causing a huge amount of anxiety for the Tongan community here [in New Zealand],” Ardern said.</p>
<p>She said there had been significant damage to boats and shops along the Tongan coastline. The capital, Nuku’alofa, was covered in a thick film of volcanic dust, Ardern said, contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need.</p>
<p>Aid agencies said thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water.</p>
<p>Ardern said New Zealand was unable to send a planned surveillance flight over Tonga on Sunday because the ash cloud was 19,000 metres) high, but they hoped to try again on Monday, followed by supply planes and navy ships.</p>
<h3>Olympian appeals for help</h3>
<p>Pita Taufatofua, an unofficial ambassador known for baring his chest during opening ceremonies for the Olympic Games, on Sunday pleaded for help for his homeland.</p>
<p>The three-time Olympian, who lives in Australia, created a GoFundMe account, saying communications with his family in Ha’apai had been cut off.</p>
<p>“My current knowledge is that my father (now the governor of Ha’apai) was trying to fly back to Ha’apai from Tongatapu straight after the opening of parliament,” he wrote on social media.</p>
<p>“After getting to the airport his flight was cancelled due to the volcanic eruption. Last we heard he was securing our home in Veitongo right on the waters edge. Our family in Ha’apai has had all communication cut off.</p>
<p>“The King has called all the reservists and armed forces to prepare for assistance. The information I’ve been sent shows the tsunami going over both Popua and the main town in Tongatapu, Nuku’alofa. No word yet from Ha’apai.</p>
<p>“What I do know is that the Tongan people are some of the strongest most resilient people to grace God’s earth. In times of great struggle is when their true spirit shines.”</p>
<p>Taufatofua, who has competed in the 2016 and 2020 Summer Games in taekwondo and the 2018 Winter Games in skiing.</p>
<h3>‘Humbling and scary’</h3>
<p>Dave Snider, the tsunami warning co-ordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Centre in Palmer, Alaska, said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin, and the spectacle was both “humbling and scary.”</p>
<p>The tsunami waves caused damage to boats as far away as New Zealand and Santa Cruz in California, but did not appear to cause any widespread damage. Snider said he anticipated the tsunami situation in the US and elsewhere to continue improving.</p>
<p>Tsunami advisories were earlier issued for parts of Australia, Japan, Hawaii, Alaska and the US Pacific coast.</p>
<p>The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake.</p>
<p>Scientists said tsunamis generated by volcanoes rather than earthquakes are relatively rare.</p>
<p>“We are praying that the damage is just to infrastructure and people were able to get to higher land,” she said.</p>
<p>Tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from Suva in Fiji. All internet connectivity with Tonga was lost at about 6.40pm local time on Saturday, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm Kentik.</p>
<p>On Tonga, which is home to about 105,000 people, video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas and swirling around homes, a church and other buildings.</p>
<p>Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent began erupting in late December. Satellite images showed how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga.</p>
<p>“The surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45 per cent due to ashfall,” Planet Labs said days before the latest activity.</p>
<div>‘The equivalent of 1000 Hiroshima bombs’: World watched a tremendous explosion in Tonga</div>
<p>In a unique first, the rest of the world watched the tremendous explosion in real-time from the new generation of high-resolution weather satellites, which showed in devastating detail its power and scale.</p>
<p>The rapidly expanding mushroom cloud covered the distance from the explosion site to Nuku’alofa at twice the speed of sound, and the sound wave could be seen spreading out across the Pacific at 1200 kilometres an hour.</p>
<p>Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha’apai are remnants of an older volcanic edifice. In 2004, the Australian Marine National Facility’s research vessel mapped the submerged portion of the volcano of which these islands are an above-water fraction.</p>

<p>As messages started to come through from those who had access to satellite phones, a partial picture emerged of what happened and what now faces the Tongan people in terms of response and recovery.</p>

<div>Tongan blast was violent and vast, but may not disrupt global warming</div>
<p>While Tonga’s neighbours struggled to access information about what was happening on the ground, scientists, equipped with modern monitoring technology, saw the blast in real time.</p>
<p>So far much of that data is still to be analysed.</p>
<p>While it remains too early to say just how big the explosion was, the chatter among vulcanologists was Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai’s blast was vast by any measure.</p>
<p>“In recorded history, it is one of the bigger ones,” said Oliver Nebel, Associate Professor of Geochemistry at Monash University.</p>
<p>The explosion blasted gas, steam and ash 30 kilometres into the stratosphere. Seven hours after the eruption it was heard in Alaska. Tsunami waves were recorded right around the Pacific.</p>
<p>Krakatoa’s 1883 eruption, killing 36,417, ranked a six. Mount Tambora, in 1815, is the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded history: it ranked a 7, and caused significant global climate change.</p>
<p>That eruption exacerbated a period of global cooling and the months that followed became known as the Year Without Summer.</p>
<p>In 1991 the explosion of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is estimated to have cooled the world by up to half a degree for several years.</p>
<p>The cooling potential of large volcanoes immediately attracted the attention of climate scientists in the hours after the blast in Tonga.</p>
<p>It was clear the blast from Tonga was violent enough to spew its plume to where the stratosphere sits, above the earth’s surface, but subsequent recordings suggest not enough sulphur dioxide was released to have a measurable effect.</p>
<p>“Our latest measurement is that about half a million tonnes of sulphur dioxide ended up going into the stratosphere from this volcano. And that compares to about 20 million tonnes that came out in Pinatubo.”</p>
<p>According to Professor Nebel, the blast would probably sit on the VEI index between four and five, putting it on par with Mount Vesuvius, the eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD.</p>
<p>That would put the explosion’s power at about 1000 times the power of the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
<p>University of Auckland vulcanologist Professor Shane Cronin, who has closely studied the volcano over the last decade, told Radio New Zealand early signs put the eruption at a five, the biggest eruption since Mount Pinatubo.</p>
<p>Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai - named for two small, uninhabited islands that sit above the vast underwater volcano - has a long history of violence.</p>
<p>In 2014, an eruption created a third island, bridging the gap between the other two; that island has now been effectively destroyed by Saturday’s explosion.</p>
<p>Work led by Professor Cronin in 2014 found the volcano tended to have a major eruption every 1000 years; the last one was in 1100 AD, meaning Friday’s blast was on schedule.</p>
<p>At this stage, it’s not clear what caused the volcano to erupt so violently, but speculation has focused on gas bubbles.</p>
<p>Macquarie University Adjunct Associate Professor Heather Handley studied the volcano in 2009. Her work found a high concentration of dissolved gas within the magma of the volcano.</p>
<p>Subduction volcanoes, like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai, are caused when a section of the earth’s crust is forced down toward the core. As the crust is jammed down, it “sweats”, and releases dissolved gases.</p>
<p>These gases typically work their way to the surface inside magma before being released. But the Tongan volcano wasn’t releasing much of its gas, Professor Handley found, causing extreme pressure to build.</p>
<p>Without communication with Tonga - beyond satellite phones - it is also not yet clear what impact the blast has had on the region.</p>
<p>She says it is also possible the island’s farming could be disrupted by ash.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Fijian government warned its citizens it had detected increased sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and advised them to cover water tanks to guard against the possibility of acid rain.</p>
<p>The explosion may not be the last. Work by Professor Cronin shows the volcano’s major eruptions typically involve separate smaller eruptions - meaning things may not be over yet.</p>
<div>Extensive damage to Tongan islands as first images of eruption aftermath emerge</div>
<div><div><h5>By Jane Wardell, Kirsty Needham and Praveen Menon</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 6.08pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>6.07am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Wellington: Tonga’s small outer islands suffered extensive damage from Saturday’s massive volcanic eruption and tsunami, a Tongan diplomat said on Tuesday, raising fears of more deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>“People panic, people run and get injuries,” Tu’ihalangingie told Reuters. “Possibly there will be more deaths and we just pray that is not the case.”</p>
<p>The Tongan government released its first official update on the disaster on Tuesday night confirming three deaths so far and extensive damage from the eruption and tsunami.</p>
<p>Atata has a population of about 100 people and Mango around 50 people.</p>
<p>“It is very alarming to see the wave possibly went through Atata from one end to the other,” said Tu’ihalangingie.</p>
<p>The first images of the impact of the fallen ash were released by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>New Zealand and Australia sent military surveillance flights to Tonga on Monday to assess the damage. A towering ash cloud since the eruption had prevented earlier flights.</p>
<p>The New Zealand High Commission reported the damage along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, where there are many vacation resorts, and the waterfront of the capital Nuku’alofa.</p>
<p>The UN also said buildings in the capital, including homes and resorts along the island’s western beaches were badly damaged, the UN said.</p>
<p>Australian Minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja said Tongan officials were planning to evacuate people from outer islands where “they’re doing it very tough, we understand, with many houses being destroyed in the tsunami”.</p>
<p>Australian police had visited beaches and also reported significant damage.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Tonga police told the New Zealand High Commission that the confirmed death toll stood at two but with communications cut, the true extent of casualties was not clear.</p>
<p>A British woman was killed as she tried to rescue dogs in her care after the massive eruption, her brother said.</p>
<p>“I understand that this terrible accident came about as they tried to rescue their dogs,” her brother Nick Eleini said.</p>
<p>“She loved people and she loved animals and this went right back to her childhood,” he said. “And the strange thing was the uglier the dog, the more she loved it.”</p>
<p>Eleini confirmed her body had been found, saying the family were shattered by the news. “Angela was the heart of our family. She was the emotional heart of our family. And, you know, that heart is now gone,” he said.</p>
<p>Communications with Tonga remain extremely limited. The company that owns the single underwater fibre-optic cable that connects the island nation to the rest of the world said it likely was severed in the eruption and repairs could take weeks.</p>
<p>The loss of the cable leaves most Tongans unable to use the internet or make phone calls abroad.</p>
<p>Those that have managed to get messages out described their country as looking like a moonscape as they began cleaning up from the tsunami waves and volcanic ash fall.</p>
<p>He said the country of 105,000 people had been in discussions with New Zealand about getting a second international fibre-optic cable to ensure a more robust network but the nation’s isolated location made any long-term solution difficult.</p>
<p>The cable also broke three years ago, possibly due to a ship dragging an anchor.</p>
<p>Scientists said they didn’t think the eruption would have a significant impact on the Earth’s climate.</p>
<p>Huge volcanic eruptions can sometimes cause temporary global cooling as sulphur dioxide is pumped into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Satellite images showed the spectacular undersea eruption on Saturday evening, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a giant mushroom above the South Pacific waters.</p>
<p>A sonic boom could be heard as far away as Alaska and sent pressure shockwaves around the planet twice, altering atmospheric pressure that may have briefly helped clear out the fog in Seattle, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>One complicating factor to any international aid effort is that Tonga has so far managed to avoid any outbreaks of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ardern said New Zealand’s military staff were all fully vaccinated and willing to follow any protocols established by Tonga.</p>
<p>Dave Snider, the tsunami warning co-ordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Centre in Palmer, Alaska, said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin, and the spectacle was both “humbling and scary”.</p>
<p>The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. Scientists said tsunamis generated by volcanoes rather than earthquakes were relatively rare.</p>
<p>“We are praying that the damage is just to infrastructure and people were able to get to higher land,” she said.</p>
<p>The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano, about 64 kilometres north of Nuku’alofa, was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions.</p>
<p>In late 2014 and early 2015, eruptions created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days.</p>
<p>Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent began erupting in late December. Satellite images showed how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga.</p>
