<header> <h1> Novak Djokovic will not be 'blackmailed' over vaccination status as father casts Australian Open doubts </h1> <p> Djokovic’s father Srdjan has hit out at officials in Australia for their vaccine stance </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben Bloom, Athletics Correspondent <time> 28 November 2021 • 2:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novak Djokovic’s father says his son will not be “blackmailed” into revealing his vaccination status and therefore “probably won’t play” the Australian Open.</p>
<p>Only fully vaccinated players will be able to compete at the Melbourne tournament in January, but nine-time champion Djokovic has refused to confirm whether he has received a Covid jab or not.</p>
<p>“As far as vaccines and non-vaccines are concerned, it is the personal right of each of us whether we will be vaccinated or not,” Srdjan Djokovic told Serbian channel TV Prva.</p>
<p>Djokovic currently sits level with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the top of the men’s all-time standings with 20 grand-slam victories.</p>
<p>Two international travellers who arrived into New South Wales from southern Africa on Sunday became the first positive cases of the new Omicron Covid variant in Australia.</p>
<p>Tiley said there are “a lot of unanswered questions” about the new variant, but the plan remains for the tournament to begin on January 17.</p>
<p>“We knew when we announced the event that there would be some more challenges - that’s just the nature of the world we’ve been living in for the past two years,” Tiley told Australia’s Channel Nine.</p>
<p>“We’re still waiting. I’ve been talking to the government... there’s still a lot of unanswered questions around this [new variant].</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot to play out. There’s a lot of unanswered questions, which we will hopefully get to soon. But at this point, everything is as it was a few days ago.”</p>
<header> <h1> Novak Djokovic hits ball at US Open line judge: How the incident unfolded, what was said and the tennis world's reaction </h1> <p> Djokovic joined the list of players to receive one of the sport's rarest punishments </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Sport and Press Association <time> 9 September 2020 • 7:50am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novak Djokovic apologised after being defaulted from the US Open for accidentally hitting a line judge with a ball struck in annoyance.</p>
<p>The top seed and 17-time grand slam champion had just dropped serve to trail Spanish opponent Pablo Carreno Busta 6-5 in the opening set of their fourth-round match on Arthur Ashe Stadium when the incident occurred.</p>
<h4>How the incident unfolded</h4>
<p>Djokovic, who had missed three set points at 5-4 before hurting his shoulder in a fall, hit a ball behind him without looking that struck a female line judge in the throat.</p>
<p>The line judge collapsed to the court and could be heard gasping for air as Djokovic rushed over to check on her condition.</p>
<p>Djokovic <a>pleaded his case during lengthy discussions with tournament referee Soeren Friemel</a> and grand slam supervisor Andreas Egli, but the officials' mind was made up.</p>
<p>"His point was that he didn't hit the line umpire intentionally... We all agree that he didn't do it on purpose, but the facts are still that he hit the line umpire and that the line umpire was clearly hurt."</p>
<p>A statement from tournament organisers read: "In accordance with the Grand Slam rulebook... the US Open tournament referee defaulted Novak Djokovic from the 2020 US Open."</p>
<p>According to the US Open:</p>
<p>There are two ways to be defaulted from a match: through an accumulation of code violations or by a singularly egregious act.</p>
<p>Section T of Article III, "On-Site Player Offenses," of the ITF Grand Slam rulebook discusses the procedure of defaulting a player from a match, and also that the decision cannot be changed.</p>
<p>"In all cases of default," it reads, "the decision of the Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors shall be final and unappealable."</p>
<p>Also, as per the Grand Slam rules, any player who is defaulted from a tournament loses all points and prize money that they would have gained as a result of completing the event. </p>
<h4>Who else has been defaulted previously</h4>
<p>Djokovic is not the first player to be defaulted in similar circumstances, but for it to happen at a grand slam and as the tournament favourite is an extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Canadian Denis Shapovalov was defaulted during a Davis Cup tie against Great Britain in 2017 after smashing a ball in anger that hit umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye.</p>
<a>Tim Henman was disqualified from Wimbledon 25 years</a> ago for hitting a ball girl with a ball during a doubles match while David Nalbandian kicked an advertising hoarding during the Queen's final in 2012, injuring a line judge, and was defaulted.
<h4>'I apologise to the US Open tournament and everyone associated for my behaviour' - what Djokovic said afterwards</h4>
<p>After the premature end to his bid for an 18th Grand Slam, Djokovic left the grounds without attending a press conference - a decision that drew criticism.</p>
<p>"I'm extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong."</p>
<p>He subsequently accepted the decision, saying in his statement: "As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being.</p>
<p>"I apologise to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behaviour. I'm very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I'm so sorry."</p>
<h4>How the tennis world reacted</h4>
<h4>'There's no doubt it's the right decision' - Tim Henman</h4>
<h4>'I was in shock' - match opponent Carreno Busta</h4>
<p>Carreno Busta had sympathy for Djokovic but felt it was the right decision.</p>
<p>He said: "I was in shock. I never expected this moment playing against Novak. So it was a tough moment also for me.</p>
<p>"I don't think that any one of us do this kind of thing intentionally. It's just the moment. The referee and the supervisor do the right thing, but it is not easy."</p>
<h4>'It's very unfortunate that he hit the line judge, and especially where it hit her' - Alexander Zverev, fifth seed</h4>
<p>"It's very unfortunate that he hit the line judge, and especially where it hit her," Zverev told reporters.</p>
<p>"Very unlucky for Novak. I think he's going to be a little bit upset about it. If he would have hit it anywhere else, if it would have landed anywhere else, we are talking about a few inches, he would have been fine.</p>
<p>"I'm a little bit in shock right now."</p>
<h4>'Unbelievable' - Martina Navratilova, 18-times Grand Slam singles champion</h4>
<p>"Wow... #sad Glad the woman is ok- we must do better than that."</p>
<h4>'The rule is the rule' - Billie Jean King, 12-times Grand Slam singles champion</h4>
<h4>'You are not allowed to do that' - Mats Wilander, seven-times Grand Slam singles champion</h4>
<p>"You are not allowed to do that," he said. "It's as much bad luck as you can have on a tennis court. He didn't just roll the ball back to the ball kid, that's the bottom line.</p>
<p>"He hit it harder than he intended to, obviously a complete accident. It was a sign of frustration, yes. A little bit. But it doesn't matter, you are not allowed to do it."</p>
<h4>'They had no other choice' - Alex Corretja, former French Open finalist</h4>
<p>"It's amazing how one centimetre can change not only the match, but the future of our sport, the history of our sport," he told Eurosport.</p>
<p>"With the rule as it is, you need to disqualify him. It's obvious they had no other choice, it's a pity..."</p>
<h4>'Novak deserved it' - Tim Mayotte, coach and former player</h4>
<h4>'How many years would I be banned for?' - Nick Kyrgios, Australian tennis player</h4>
<p>Djokovic will have to get used to being the "bad guy", American great John McEnroe has said.</p>
<p>"The pressure just got to him. I think a lot has been going on off the court," McEnroe told ESPN.</p>
<p>"It's obviously affected him and whether he likes it or not, he's going to be the bad guy the rest of his career.</p>
<p>"If he embraces that role, I think he could recover. He's got a lot of things going for him, but this is a stain that he's not going to be able to erase."</p>
<p>What do you think? Did Djokovic deserved to be defaulted? Should he now receive an additional punishment? Does the rule need adjusting? Have your say in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Emma Raducanu has been invited to become a member at the All England Club, joining Andy Murray, Roger Federer and dozens of other Wimbledon champions on this illustrious list.</p>
<p>Everyone who wins a Wimbledon singles title receives an automatic invitation, but AELTC rules state that the same privilege can also be extended to other “eminent” players. The total number of members may not exceed 500.</p>

<header> <h1> Allan Lamb interview: 'Put your egos aside and don't be afraid to get checked' </h1> <p> Former England batsman Lamb is being treated for prostate cancer and tells men not to die 'from embarrassment' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 4 November 2021 • 8:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>“The public think I’m in a terrible state,” said Allan Lamb, the most pugnacious England batsman of the 1980s. “It’s gone viral, basically.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Lamb revealed to his Twitter followers that he has prostate cancer. He combined this alarming news with a public-health announcement.</p>
<p>“I urge all men to go and get their PSA [prostate-specific antigen] levels checked,” Lamb said. “Put your egos aside. Don’t be ignorant about your health.”</p>
<p>Many cricket-lovers – especially those who remember Lamb’s bristling moustache and military bearing at the crease – must have digested those words and feared the worst.</p>
<p>Had Lamb been dilatory in picking up the problem? Might he even be embarking on the same irreversible decline as his former England captain Bob Willis, who passed away two winters ago after a four-year scrap with the same infernal disease?</p>
<p>“I was lucky because we found it early,” Lamb said. “I owe a lot to this great friend of mine, Jock Miller, who had prostate cancer 10 years ago.</p>
<p>He made prostate cancer sound like a minor inconvenience. Yet the Lambs have already spent more time dealing with the dreaded C-word than any family deserves.</p>
<p>So what can Joe Root’s team expect Down Under in the coming weeks? Apart from packing the Bollinger, that is?</p>
<p>“But then [Justin] Langer is under pressure as Australian coach and their captain [Tim Paine] has barely scored a first-class hundred. So if we get a good start, their press and their public could turn on them quickly.”</p>
<p>First, though, he has a message to bang home, by each and every means he can think of. “I just want to save lives,” Lamb said. “So, please, don’t be too macho to get tested. Just go out and do it.”</p>
<header> <h1> Andy Murray to work with Esteban Carril on trial amid mystery Emma Raducanu coaching deal </h1> <p> In his final tournament of the year, Murray will have a new voice by his side in Stockholm </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 7 November 2021 • 6:52pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Andy Murray will be working with a new coach in Stockholm this week – the in-demand Spaniard Esteban Carril – as he looks to turbo-charge his recent climb up the rankings.</p>
<p>Just to send further ripples across the small pond of British tennis, Raducanu told reporters on Sunday that she has a coach in place for the Australian Open in January. Strangely, though, she declined to reveal the identity of the new appointment.</p>
<p>Raducanu, meanwhile, continues to travel to European events without a coach. She is in the Austrian city of Linz this week, with a small entourage that consists of her mother Renee and agent Chris Helliar.</p>
<p>Asked why she wasn’t ready to reveal the coach’s name, she replied “It’s a bit confidential. Yeah, I mean, it’s my decision. It’s not like fully done and yeah, that’s it. It’s in a good place.”</p>

<div> <div> By Simon Briggs <time> 8 November 2021 • 6:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The former British No1 Jo Durie has described Eddie Jones’s criticisms of Emma Raducanu this weekend as sexist, adding that “no-one ever complains about blokes going to galas; it’s always something that is thrown at women.”</p>
<a>England's 69-3 demolition of Tonga</a>, Jones suggested that Smith needed to be kept away from off-field distractions and drew an unfavourable comparison with Raducanu.
<p>But Durie countered by telling Telegraph Sport that these were “sexist comments” and taking issue with Jones’s phrase “young girl”.</p>
<p>As Durie pointed out, “Emma isn’t a girl; she is an 18-year-old woman. Unfortunately, when you’re this famous, everybody likes to have their opinion about you.</p>
<p>“I don’t know her well myself but she seems to have a good head on her shoulders and she just needs to play for at least a season and get used to life on the tour before anyone expects anything else from her.”</p>
<p>Speaking to Telegraph Sport, Judy Murray described the whole debate as: “typical of what female athletes are up against, in terms of insensitive comments.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, before the publication of Jones’s remarks, Raducanu gave a couple of press conferences <a>ahead of this week’s event in Linz, Austria</a>. She told reporters that her priorities had never changed.</p>
<header> <h1> 'You guys cracked it': Emma Raducanu confirms Torben Beltz will be her new coach </h1> <p> Telegraph Sport broke the story - and US Open champion confirms Angelique Kerber's former coach will join her backroom team </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 9 November 2021 • 9:41pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Emma Raducanu confirmed on Tuesday night that the experienced German coach Torben Beltz is to become her next coach, starting with her off-season training block as she builds towards January’s Australian Open.</p>
<p>Beltz is best-known for his work with Angelique Kerber, the former Wimbledon champion, but news emerged on Monday that the two Germans had split.</p>
<p>"You guys cracked it!” Raducanu said. “It's obviously a great privilege to be working with such an experienced coach. I'm definitely very excited to work with him throughout the preseason and into next year."</p>
<p>Raducanu confirmed on Tuesday night that they had experimented with working together at the Bromley Tennis Centre that same week. “We trialled for a few days and got on very well,” she said.</p>
<p>Beltz enjoyed a long association with Kerber, notably in her dream season of 2016 when she won both the hard-court majors.</p>
<p>Now 44, Beltz did not have much of a playing career. He is listed as having appeared in a couple of low-level matches in 2000, when he would have been 23, but does not seem to have had a professional ranking.</p>
<p>As a coach, however, he has established a strong reputation as a reliable, reassuring operator. He would certainly seem a strong choice for Raducanu’s first coach as a regular member of the WTA Tour.</p>
<p>As Raducanu said in September, when she announced that she would not be continuing with her US Open coach Andrew Richardson, “I really need someone right now that has had that WTA Tour experience at the high levels.”</p>

<header> <div> <div> <h1> Emma Raducanu's blockbuster breakout season ends with painful three-set loss at Linz Open </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>The ultimate breakout year is over. It ended painfully, as tennis seasons often do, when Emma Raducanu suffered a hip spasm towards the end of her 2hr 36min tussle with China’s Wang Xinyu.</p>
<p>Asked last night how she would look back on this life-changing year, she smiled and offered the shortest of replies. “As a surprise.”</p>
<p>Even though she paused for a medical time-out before the tenth game, it wasn’t enough to fully resolve the problem, and an apparently nerveless Wang served out for her 6-1, 6-7, 7-5 win.</p>
<p>In the wider picture, <a>Raducanu has been travelling to events without a coach</a> and learning on the hoof. She has been elevated into a target – a general on the battlefield – before she even knows what it means to be a foot-soldier.</p>
<p>Such a dizzy rise would destabilise many people, but Raducanu has showed maturity and balance in her recent media appearances.</p>
<p>Although Raducanu will now have a new coach at her side to guide her – in the shape of 44-year-old German Torben Beltz – she is an extremely smart analyst of the game and knows very well where she needs to improve.</p>
<p>“A lot has happened this year,” she said after last night’s match. “[To have gone from] where I was in January, February, March compared to now, I mean, I would have taken it.</p>
<p>“But I think that I obviously learned how much I room I have to develop physically and what playing on the tour week-in, week-out actually means. Because clearly my body is still trying to get up to speed.</p>
<p>Raducanu was also asked last night about <a>the criticisms levelled at the weekend by Eddie Jones</a>, the England rugby coach, who suggested that she had become distracted by fashion brands and gala appearances.</p>
<h2>Emma Raducanu vs Wang Xinyu - as it happened</h2>
<p>Lots to takeaway from that match. </p>
<p>Raducanu's fightback was impressive, she showed the way she can rally when facing an opponent who really stepped up their game to play her. </p>
<p>And if Wang can play like that going forward, the 20-year-old will be a force on tour. </p>
<h3>The story of the match in the stats</h3>
<p>Even with just 48 per cent of her first serves, Wang managed to really hold her own, and Raducanu only got rare opportunities to break.</p>
<p>Lots of positives for Raducanu to take - including that very high serving percentage and eight aces. Ultimately she gave Wang too many opportunities regardless - facing 16 break points. </p>
<h3>WANG WINS! Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 5-7 Wang</h3>
<p>Raducanu stretching out her hip between points, as Wang goes 30-0 up. </p>
<p>Wang's backhand goes wide though next, 30-15. </p>
<p>But Wang hits a second serve ace next, and she has two more match points. Raducanu's return goes long and that's that folks - Raducanu, the top seed is out of the Linz Open and her season is over. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 5-6* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Raducanu saves it with a well-constructed point next, whipping her forehand beyond Wang's reach. But after exchanging a few points at deuce, Wang sends a drop shot her injured opponent's way, and Raducanu can't chase it down. </p>
<p>Next, at break point down, Raducanu sends an off-balance rally way wide to be broken for the third time in a row.</p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *5-5 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>The game begins with Raducanu sending a return wide. The next point Raducanu comes forward and her smash is good enough to beat Wang. But she's hobbling on her leg and visibly in pain. 15-15. </p>
<p>She clutches her thigh after sending a backhand into the net next but a double fault from Wang evens things up at 30-30. The Chinese player might be a bit nervous, this would be the biggest win of her career. </p>
<p>But as soon as the points get Raducanu moving, she is at a clear advantage. Raducanu sends a backhand on the run into the net and it's match point Wang. </p>
<p>That was epic. We're all square in this third set.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>7:21PM</time></a> <div> <h3>We're back on the court</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Let's see what Raducanu can do. Wang serving for the match. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>The physio is on the court helping Raducanu</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>She's helping her stretch out what looks like a hip or groin issue on her right side. </p> <p>Wang is out serving on the court while she waits for the three-minute medical time out to end. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 4-5* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang wins the first point, successfully defending Raducanu's baseline grind and smashing home a volley. Raducanu takes a moment then, leaning on the advertising board to stretch out her leg.</p>
<p>Wang hits a stunning winner next to go 0-30 up. Raducanu gestures to the umpire to ask for the physio. </p>
<p>Then Raducanu, who is visibly struggling, hits her forehand long. Three break points to Wang. A wild Raducanu forehand on the move gives away the break and the physio is immediately called onto the court. </p>
<p>This is such a shame if this how the match is going to end, after building to such an exciting climax.</p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *4-4 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang is hitting every line. Raducanu is defending well, but there's only so many deep baseline shots she can reach. Wang goes 30-0 up. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 4-3* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *3-3 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wang holds well, finishing it off with a overhead smash hit straight at Raducanu's feet - which she duly apologises for. Looking very tricky to call at this point. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 3-2* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang goes 0-30 up thanks to a forehand winner reminiscent of her dominant first half hour of this match. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *2-2 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wang recovers from 30-15 down to focus in on and hold to 30. That was a good hold. She's no longer hitting with the same intensity and accuracy as her sublime first set, but the focus remains. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 2-1* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Raducanu's eighth ace, marking her brilliant serving this match - hitting 82 per cent of her first serves into the court. Considering that, it's all the more amazing how Wang was overpowering her in the first and much of the second set.</p>
<p>But that feels a long time ago. Raducanu finishes off another quick game with a confident overhead smash, and we remain on serve. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *1-1 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>After fighting it out on the baseline, Wang hits a deft drop shot which Raducanu doesn't even bother chasing down. A couple of errors eked out of Raducanu, and she responds with a love hold too. This final set could really go either way.</p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) 1-0* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <h3>Raducanu 1-6 7-6(0) *0-0 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>An ace seals it - and top seed Raducanu storms back to her chair. A FLAWLESS tiebreak. She's pumped up. We're into a decider.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 6-6, TB *6-0 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <p>Raducanu is on a roll!</p> <p>Wang's decent drop shot is chased down by Raducanu, and she hits her shot past Wang on the run.</p> <p>Three mini breaks up, she then hits an unreturned serve and she has six break points. </p> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 6-6, TB 3-0* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Raducanu goes 3-0 up, hitting a cross-court pass beyond the approaching Wang. This is her first ever tiebreak on the WTA tour. Strong start.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 6-6, TB *1-0 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>A baseline tussle in the opening tiebreak sees Raducanu on the front foot, and she sends a forehand down the line. Easily her best point of the match, and she takes a point off Wang's serve. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 6-6, TB 0-0* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Another cruel net cord gifts Wang a point, and Raducanu can only laugh at the way everything is going Wang's way this match. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div><div> <div> <blockquote><p>Tough one to take 😬#WTALinz pic.twitter.com/flaOVVmWGi</p>— wta (@WTA) <a>November 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But the teenager follows it up with a blasting ace - her sixth of the match - to go 30-15 up. Raducanu's forehand into the corner of the court has Wang beat too, and she holds with a well-placed second serve, which Wang cannot return. </p>
<p>We're into a tiebreak. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 *5-6 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>This game is no different, she holds to 15, helped by her first ace of the match, and Raducanu again must serve to stay in the match. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 5-5* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Raducanu rushes to a 40-0 lead. But this game isn't over yet. </p>
<p>She doesn't give Wang another in though, and holds. We're all square in the late stages of this set. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 *4-5 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <p>A huge momentum shift as a result of that last game, and Wang holds to love - chasing down Raducanu's drop shot to seal it - to win her third game in a row. </p> <p>Raducanu serving to stay in the match next.</p> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 4-4* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang's return has been the story of this match, and the depth she finds on the first point of this game puts Raducanu off kilter, and she finishes it off with another winner. </p>
<p>But Raducanu recovers from 0-30, defending well, to bring the game to 30-30. Big point. Wang knows exactly what to do though, and she targets Raducanu's forehand, eventually forcing the error. Break point Wang. </p>
<p>Raducanu sends her backhand limply into the net next, and Wang breaks back. That might just be the moment this match ended for Raducanu. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 *4-3 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wang responds with a confident service game, holding to 15, but she still trails by a break in this set. </p> <p>Key game coming up for Raducanu. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 4-2* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <p>Raducanu takes the pace off a few points, and seems to throw Wang's rhythm and the Chinese player makes a few errors. A brilliant serve, which Wang can't return, and Raducanu holds to love. How's that for a confidence boost?</p> </div>
<h3> Raducanu 1-6 *3-2 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>After the battle in her last service game, just like that, there's two break points for Raducanu on Wang's serve. </p>
<p>She can't get her return into the court on the first one though, and Wang gives her the run around before finally drilling another forehand winner to beat her on the second one.</p>
<p>But up game point, Wang misses a sitter and gives Raducanu another glimmer of hope. </p>
<p>At deuce , Raducanu pushes Wang into the corner of the court, and wears her down to earn a third break point. Wang's forehand goes long and Raducanu shouts "come on!" - she is up a break again.</p>
<p>That's the type of game that could plant a seed of doubt in Wang's brain. The test will be in the next game. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 2-2* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Raducanu holds on - but Wang is not making a single point easy for her.</p>
<p>The Brit is forced to save another slew of break points. First with a forehand into the corner of the court - and that's the only type of shot worthy of beating Wang at the moment, as she's proving impossible to get past otherwise. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 *1-2 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>The signature Raducanu backhand finally gets an opportunity to appear in this match, the flat shot finding the back of the court. </p>
<p>But Wang is proving impossible to get past otherwise. As Wang finishes off a confident hold to 15, fittingly, 'I've Got The Power' by SNAP blasts in the TipsArena. She doesn't look like she's going to let go of her grip of this match. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 1-1* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>With the game poised at 30-30, Wang delivers another strike down the line to force an error off Raducanu's forehand. Break point Wang. </p>
<p>Her ruthless streak continues, as Raducanu at full stretch sends her backhand into the net. That's the fourth break on Raducanu's serve in this match, and her advantage in this second set disappears with it. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-6 *1-0 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<h3>WANG WINS THE FIRST SET: Raducanu 1-6 0-0* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Three very strong serves and quick points from Raducanu gives her back a semblance of control, and she goes 40-15 up. </p>
<p>Wang gains another set point, after hitting a forehand winner right on the line to end an 18-stroke rally. Yet another winner neutralises any threat of Raducanu extending this set.</p>
<p>What a flawless set of tennis from Wang. Can Raducanu respond? </p>
<h3>Raducanu *1-5 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang is so comfortable out there. She's opening up the court, taking her opportunities early - and Raducanu hasn't really done anything wrong so far except fail to match her opponent's very, very high level.</p>
<p>She's got to hope that Wang slows down, but she has dropped just one point in the last three games and is on her way to taking the first set. </p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-4* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Raducanu is down 0-30 again, mostly because Wang is taking crucial time off her in every point. The Chinese player steps into her return next, hitting a backhand winner. Suddenly Raducanu is staring down the barrel of three break points. </p>
<p>Wang's cross-court shot seals the double break and continues her fine momentum. Raducanu is in trouble here in this first set. </p>
<h3>Raducanu *1-3 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Wang's looking very confident out there, despite Raducanu putting up a fight.</p>
<h3>Raducanu 1-2* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<p>Two errors from Raducanu puts her at 15-40 down, facing two break points.</p>
<p>The first is saved by Wang's wayward forehand, and the second with a strong defensive point. But Wang is playing very aggressively, swinging freely and then secures another break point with an approach shot. </p>
<p>A passing shot leaving Raducanu stranded at the net, sees Wang makes the first major move of this match. She fist pumps as she goes a break up against the US Open champion. </p>
<h3>Raducanu *1-1 Wang (denotes the next server)</h3>
<div> <p>Wang holds easily to 15. At almost 6ft tall, Wang has a strong serve to match and puts it to work in that game. </p> <p>British coach Iain Hughes, who previously coaches Elina Svitolina, is in the 20-year-old's corner.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>Raducanu 1-0* Wang (denotes the next server)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>A couple of aces a good early sign from Raducanu - especially getting one at deuce. Another strong serve secures her the hold. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>5:06PM</time></a> <div> <h3>We're about to begin!</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Raducanu to serve first.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> Emma Raducanu the 'most exciting player on either tour' – but the hard work starts now </h1>
<p> Andy Murray's fitness expert Matt Little tells Telegraph Sport the US Open champion faces a winter of slow and arduous endurance work </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 10 November 2021 • 4:17pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>How will Emma Raducanu begin her off-season? By booking a holiday for the first time in seven years. Her agenda, one suspects, will involve sun, sand and sea. But it won’t be long before the suffering starts.</p>
<p>Raducanu’s newly hired coach, Torben Beltz, is available to help. But the key figure will be Gareth Shelbourne, her fitness trainer since she was 12, and a man who has already placed her on the right road.</p>
<p>As Andy Murray’s long-standing fitness trainer Matt Little told Telegraph Sport this week, “I find Emma Raducanu to be the most exciting player on either tour, in terms of the way she uses her physicality on the court.”</p>
<p>By the middle of the deciding set in this two-and-a-half-hour barn-burner, both women were beginning to flag. But it was Raducanu’s hip which went into spasm, requiring her to call the physio for treatment at 5-4 down.</p>
<a>finally the arthritic hip which nearly ended his career. </a>“I don’t think Andy was completely fit for a single week as No 1,” Little said ruefully.
<p>Patience is as important as commitment – a point that Little spelled out this summer in his fitness self-help book The Way of the Tortoise.</p>
<blockquote><p>Matt Little’s book – The Way of the Tortoise: Why You Have to Take the Slow Lane to Get Ahead – was published in June by Michael O’Mara</p></blockquote>

<h1> Stay patient and be more aggressive from the baseline: how Andy Murray can improve on mediocre 2021 </h1>
<p> Murray logged more matches than in any season since 2016 - now he needs a gameplan that can carry him to the presentation ceremony </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 12 November 2021 • 4:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Emma Raducanu’s New York miracle has rather obscured the fact that, in tennis, progress tends to be slow and faltering. That has certainly been the case for Andy Murray since his return from hip surgery two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
<p>Having forfeited most of his ranking points, Murray’s battle back towards the top hundred has resembled a shipwreck victim swimming for shore, and regularly being slapped in the face by another gigantic wave.</p>
<p>Now that he has achieved a decent attendance record, and regained the old pitter-patter of his scampering feet, Murray is seeking the last piece of the puzzle: a gameplan that can carry him all the way back to the presentation ceremony.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks, two things have become clear to him. Firstly, just because he is a 34-year-old with a bionic hip, that doesn’t mean he should attempt to whip through rallies as speedily as Roger Federer.</p>
<a>in search of a step change in physical conditioning</a>. Whereas he is already phenomenally strong, having piled on even more quadricep muscle to support that metal hip. No, it will be skills-based training for Murray.
<p>His long-standing coach Jamie Delgado will be there, perhaps <a>accompanied by Esteban Carril</a> – the experienced Spaniard, formerly employed by Johanna Konta, who travelled to Stockholm with Murray for a trial last week.</p>

<h1> Nick Kyrgios: It's not 'morally right' to allow unvaccinated players to fly in for Australian Open </h1>
<p> The tournament will be a flashpoint in the tennis vaccination debate, although it is still unclear how tough the tournament’s rules will be </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 16 November 2021 • 5:08pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Kyrgios’s position – as so often with him – has not been entirely clear-cut. His latest message came only hours after he had made supportive comments about unvaccinated players on a podcast.</p>
<p>But Kyrgios isn’t alone in his latest sentiments. In an interview with the Spanish daily Marca, published on Monday, Rafael Nadal had also argued that “people who do not want to be vaccinated are a little bit selfish”.</p>
<p>The Australian Open promises to be a flashpoint in the tennis vaccination debate, although it is still unclear how tough the tournament’s rules will be.</p>
<p>Last year’s men’s finalists – Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev – have both declined to confirm whether they have received the vaccine or not.</p>
<p>He went on to add, somewhat uncharacteristically, that it would be unfair to pressurise players into being vaccinated in order to attend the tournament.</p>
<p>“They are global athletes who millions of people look up to,” Kyrgios continued. “I just think it is so morally wrong to force someone to be vaccinated.”</p>
<h1> Roger Federer poised to miss Wimbledon next year – but Centre Court curtain call remains the focus </h1>
<p> Currently sidelined after a third knee op, Swiss maestro, 40, will miss 2022 Australian Open - but intends to thank fans with SW19 return </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 17 November 2021 • 9:46am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Roger Federer says that he does not want his 6-0 "bagel" set against Hubert Hurkacz to be his final act as a tennis professional, and hopes to make one more miraculous comeback – even if it is not until late next year.</p>
<p>Federer lost 6-3, 7-6, 6-0 to Hurkacz in this summer's Wimbledon quarter-final, and did not play again all season because of a third operation on his troublesome right knee. He turned 40 in early August.</p>
<p>Speaking to the paper's tennis correspondent Mathieu Aeschmann, Federer explained that his latest injury had been particularly troublesome, and that he was unlikely to play next year’s Wimbledon because of the lengthy rehabilitation process.</p>
<p>"I wanted to wait for the first major check-up before making a public statement, and the check-up was very encouraging," said Federer. </p>
<p>As far as retirement is concerned, he explained that he does not want his fans' last memory of him to be <a>that mediocre display against Hurkacz at Wimbledon</a>, when the pain in his knee had restricted his movement to the point of powerlessness.</p>
<p>"I think that every athlete should decide for himself," Federer said. "There is no right time to retire. There is only the time that suits each individual athlete. It is a very personal decision.</p>
<p>"My world will not collapse if I never play in another Grand Slam final. But it is my ultimate dream to return once again. And in fact, I still believe in it. I believe in these kinds of miracles."</p>
<p>"I have experienced similar challenges many times in my career, sometimes without the public being aware of it. And even though I know that the end is near, I want to try to play some big matches again. It won't be easy, but I will try."</p>
<h2>Federer targets another deep SW19 run - and fitting Centre Court curtain call</h2>
<p>Analysis by Simon Briggs</p>
<a>then there is Wimbledon</a>. Here is one reason why he is so desperate to return for a final tilt: because he doesn't want his last act on the cathedral of Centre Court to be that 6-0 "bagel" set against Hubert Hurkacz from July 7.
<p>They make up for their physical limitations with an instinctive understanding of how to play on grass, using plenty of slices and low balls rather than the tour's go-to method of heavy topspin.</p>
<p>In his mind's eye, Federer is probably thinking that he can spend 2022 building up his leg strength to cover for the weaknesses in that right knee, before embarking on the tour early in 2023. </p>
<h1> Peng Shuai: Joe Biden and United Nations demand assurances over Chinese tennis player's safety </h1>
<p> Andy Murray has joined protests and the WTA has threatened to pull out of China if Peng's claims of sexual abuse are not investigated </p>
<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent ; Molly McElwee and Sophia Yan <time> 19 November 2021 • 11:13pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>American President Joe Biden and the United Nations joined calls to establish the whereabouts of Peng Shuai as pressure grew on China to provide “verifiable proof” of her safety.</p>
<p>Peng has not been seen since she made allegations of sexual misconduct against Zhang Gaoli, a former vice-premier of China, on Nov 2.</p>
<p>Liz Throssell, the spokesman for the UN Human Rights Office, added: “We would urge that there be an investigation with full transparency into her allegations of sexual assault.”</p>
<p>Beijing authorities had previously released a letter purporting to be from Peng claiming “everything is fine”, which was greeted with universal scepticism.</p>
<p>The Lawn Tennis Association also backed the Women’s Tennis Association following its concerns for Peng and warning that it could pull tournaments out of China.</p>
<p>“We have written to the WTA offering our assistance in their efforts to establish the safety and well-being of Peng Shuai,” an LTA statement read.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee declined to comment, with Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics in February.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie’s season ended with a 6-2, 6-1 defeat to Novak Djokovic at the ATP Finals in Turin. </p>
<h2>'Where is Peng Shuai?' Naomi Osaka censored in China as sport unites to demand answers</h2>
<p>Naomi Osaka has been targeted by Chinese government censors after her post calling for the whereabouts of Peng Shuai, who recently alleged sexual misconduct against a retired Communist Party official, was removed.</p>
<p>Searches for her profile on the Weibo microblogging platform were blocked after Ms Osaka spoke out about the former Number One doubles player, though the account remained accessible by going directly through the specific web address.</p>
<p>Official censors - and algorithms - routinely scour and scrub the internet for anything deemed sensitive by the authorities in China, where the government tightly controls all news and information.</p>
<p>Even Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times tweeted about “the thing people talked about,” avoiding any direct mention.</p>
<p>"We're definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it. Because this is certainly, this is bigger than the business. Women need to be respected and not censored" he told CNN in an interview.</p>
<p>China has been a primary focus of the WTA's expansion over the last decade and hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total $30.4 million of prize money on offer.</p>
<p>Peng, a two-time major doubles champion, had her own online footprint wiped from Chinese social media minutes after posting her allegations against Zhang Gaoli, one of China’s former top leaders, on Nov 2.</p>
<h2>Doubts over veracity of Peng's email</h2>
<h2>Tennis players unite to demand answers</h2>
<p>The Osaka tweet that appears to have resulted in her censorship in China was an expression of her shock at Peng's disappearance. </p>
<p>"Censorship is never ok at any cost," Osaka wrote. "I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and ok. I'm in shock of the current situation. #whereispengshuai"</p>

<header> <h1> Bring back school bubbles system amid rising Covid cases, says union </h1> <p> National Education Union urges Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, to reintroduce virus safety measures </p> </header>
<div> <div> By India McTaggart <time> 9 October 2021 • 7:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Bubbles and self-isolation for children should be brought back to schools, the UK's largest teaching union has said.</p>
<p>The National Education Union (NEU) urged Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, to reintroduce additional Covid safety measures in schools amid <a>rising cases</a> and pupil absence.</p>
<p>Four education unions have joined the NEU in calling for previous measures – including the bubble system, social distancing and face masks in secondary schools – to be adopted again.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that around one in 15 children in school years seven to 11 in England are estimated to have had Covid in the week to Oct 2 – the highest positivity rate for any age group.</p>
<p>Government data show that more than 204,000 pupils were absent from school on Sep 30 for Covid-related reasons.</p>
<p>Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said: "We are concerned that the Government is standing by while Covid cases surge across schools.</p>
<p>"It is evident that more needs to be done – and sooner rather than later – to prevent further massive disruption to children's education, caused either by children contracting Covid-19 or Covid-related staff absence."</p>
<a>does not want to see a return to bubbles</a> because the fall off in attendance harms children's mental well-being.
<a>scrapped by the Government</a> after more than one million pupils were kept off school in July.
<p>However, education unions warned that, without such measures, students' education and health will be damaged unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Jon Richards, the Unison assistant general secretary, said: "To offer pupils and staff greater protection, face masks must return right away, along with school bubbles and other sensible precautions that were ditched."</p>
<p>Avril Chambers, the GMB national officer, said the latest figures show that "it is clear further mitigation measures are needed immediately" in order to avoid further disruption to schooling.</p>
<p>"School staff have kept our schools open throughout the pandemic – they deserve to stay safe and our children deserve not to have their education interrupted any more than it already has been," she said.</p>
<p>Most children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered <a>one dose of the Pfizer vaccine</a> by immunisation teams at schools.</p>
<h1> Number of pupils forced to stay home owing to school Covid closures doubles in a fortnight </h1>
<p> Some 3,000 pupils are learning remotely because their school has shut, with almost quarter of a million students in total now stuck at home </p>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor and Ben Butcher <time> 14 December 2021 • 4:58pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The number of children forced to stay at home owing to school closures has more than doubled in a fortnight, official figures show.</p>
<p>The data relate to last Thursday, when 3,000 pupils were learning remotely because their <a>school had shut completely</a>, compared with 1,400 two weeks previously.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of students stuck at home following an outbreak at their school rose by 24 per cent, from 9,700 two weeks ago to 12,000.</p>
<p>The latest statistics from the Department for Education also reveal that almost a quarter of a million <a>children are now off school</a> (236,000) for Covid-related reasons, up from 208,000 a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>This includes 109,400 with a confirmed case of Covid and almost as many again - a further 90,900 - with a suspected case.</p>
<h2>'Doing nothing not plausible or realistic'</h2>
<a>moving to remote lessons</a> for the final week of term, often following a suspected case of omicron.
<p>Meanwhile, headteachers are drawing up lists of key workers’ children and updating plans for remote learning in January in case schools are told not to reopen after the Christmas break.</p>
<p>Almost twice as many primary school pupils are off school for Covid-related reasons compared with secondary school pupils.</p>
<p>In primary schools, some 145,900 children are off owing to Covid-related reasons, up just 15,000 from two weeks ago. This included 122,600 off with either confirmed or suspected Covid cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at secondary schools 82,300 pupils are off on account of Covid, up from 71,400 on November 25. Of these, 73,100 were because of confirmed or suspected cases.</p>
<p>In both primary and secondary schools, this is the highest number of Covid absences since pupils returned after the October half-term holiday.</p>
<header> <h1> Schools plan to send home whole year groups as Covid fears mount </h1> <p> Headteachers warn Boris Johnson that staff shortages caused by the omicron variant mean they will have to take drastic action </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor ; Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor and Danielle Sheridan, Political and Defence Correspondent <time> 26 December 2021 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Schools are drawing up plans to send whole year groups home amid growing concern that the omicron Covid variant will lead to staff shortages spiralling out of control in January.</p>
<p>Headteachers have warned the Prime Minister that they may be forced to prioritise key age groups for time in the classroom, while <a>others are told to learn remotely.</a></p>
<p>The biggest threat to keeping children in face-to-face education will be high numbers of teachers forced into self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Primary schools in villages and small towns are understood to be considered by Whitehall officials as especially at risk of teacher shortages, given they have small numbers of staff.</p>
<p>The Government has already admitted that schools are <a>likely to face disruption until Easter</a> and is urging retired teachers to return to the classroom to fill gaps in timetables.</p>
<p>But headteachers and parents fear that the scheme will not be enough to stem the tide of teacher absences and<a> keep schools fully open next term.</a></p>
<p>Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said headteachers were “hoping for the best but planning for the worst”.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson will meet government scientists and advisers on Monday morning for an update on<a> how quickly the omicron variant is spreading</a> and its impact on hospitalisation and death rates.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, no recall of Parliament had been announced. Similarly, no urgent meeting of the Cabinet to discuss tightening the Covid rules had been called.</p>
<p>Government insiders continue to say it is possible no new Covid restrictions for England will be<a> announced before New Year’s Eve, </a>but they stress the situation remains fluid.</p>
<p>On Sunday night it was reported that weddings are funerals will be exempted from any new Covid restrictions, if it is decided that tougher measures are needed.</p>
<p>One avenue open to Downing Street is to publish new guidance, for example on limited household mixing, which would not need legal changes and could be adopted without Parliament being recalled.</p>
<p>Officials at the DfE wrote to headteachers earlier this month telling them to “revisit” their outbreak plans and ensure contingency plans are up to date so they are “prepared for any future changes” in January.</p>
<p>He said that one approach would be to keep Year 11 and Year 13 in school for face-to-face lessons, while other year groups are sent home to learn remotely.</p>
<p>“We feel we owe it to the young people doing GCSEs and A-levels because<a> we already know their time is being disrupted</a> and want to make it as normal as they can be,” he said.</p>
<p>It also emerged that the leader of the Government-backed<a> remote learning platform </a>has issued a warning that the number of children missing school is “likely to grow over the winter”.</p>
<p>Family groups have warned that if entire year groups are told to learn remotely, this would make life impossible for working parents and could hamper the country’s economic recovery by forcing them to stay at home to supervise their children.</p>
<p>Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem, said the Government’s plan to encourage ex-teachers back to the classroom was “an acknowledgement that this is a very serious situation”.</p>
<p>Robert Halfon, the Tory chairman of the education select committee, said: “I’m concerned that even if the Government says they want to keep schools open, schools will continue to send hundreds of thousands of children home.</p>
<p>"If schools are closing or sending lots of children home, they should set up task forces with the schools to work with them to keep them open. They can’t just say this – they’ve got to mean it.”</p>
<p>Caroline Ansell, the Conservative MP for Eastbourne, and<a> Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted,</a> are among those taking part in the Government’s scheme to encourage ex-teachers back to the classroom.</p>
<p>The drive is part of wider concerns within the Government about the impact of the surge in infections triggered by the omicron variant among critical workers in key industries.</p>
<p>To help ease pressure on the workforce, the required period of self-isolation after testing positive for Covid <a>was cut from 10 days to seven </a>if the person shows a negative lateral flow test result.</p>
<p>The impact of the omicron surge on critical national infrastructure, including areas such as food supplies and transport, is being closely monitored by ministers.</p>
<header> <h1> Omicron surge likely to cause disruption in schools until Easter </h1> <p> More supply teachers needed throughout spring term to prevent closures, says Education Secretary, as high staff sickness levels expected </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor <time> 20 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Schools are likely to face disruption until Easter with omicron cases leading to spiralling staff absences, the Education Secretary has warned - as he issues a call out to former teachers.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi has urged retired teachers and those who have left the profession to “come forward and join the national mission” to keep schools open during the spring term.</p>
<p>Officials at the Department for Education admitted on Sunday that it expects omicron to cause high levels of staff absence throughout the spring term.</p>
<p>It believes the number of teachers forced into isolation by the Covid variant could lead to entire year groups being sent home, or <a>even school closures</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi is launching a major campaign on Monday aimed at encouraging former or retired teachers to rejoin the profession as supply teachers during the spring term.</p>
<h2>‘National mission to protect education’</h2>
<p>“Don’t let anything get in the way of coming forward to join the national mission to protect education."</p>
<p>Dozens of schools around the country started to send children home early for the Christmas holidays owing to staff sickness.</p>
<p>School leaders and academy chain chiefs are preparing for the possibility of having to switch to online learning next term, with some pupils <a>asked to take laptops and textbooks home</a> before Christmas just in case.</p>
<p>Those eligible to apply as supply teachers can expect to receive targeted communications encouraging them to participate.</p>
<p>The Government is also working with the teacher training programme provider Teach First, which offers university graduates a fast track into the teaching profession.</p>
<p>After completing the two years of teaching at a school in a deprived area, participants in the scheme often go on to work in a range of private sector roles such as accountancy, banking or consultancy.</p>
<header> <h1> You must keep schools open come what may, Boris Johnson told </h1> <p> Prime Minister faces demands to put pupils’ education first by avoiding repeat of chaotic Covid closures </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor ; Paul Nuki, Global Health Security Editor, London and Sam Hall <time> 10 December 2021 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson has been urged to intervene to ensure that schools reopen fully after the Christmas break amid growing concern that the rise in omicron Covid cases could cause fresh chaos for children's education.</p>
<a>schools stay open</a> "come what may" and urged Mr Johnson to draw up fresh legal protections to ensure this happens.
<a>more than a million infections</a> by the end of the year.
<p>The UK has closed schools for <a>longer than anywhere else in Europe apart from Italy</a> during the Covid pandemic, with British children out of the classroom for half of all school days between January 2020 and this July.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a>The Telegraph launched a Campaign for Children</a>, calling for disruption in schools to be brought to an end and urging ministers to put youngsters at the heart of policy-making.</p>
<a>have already started to send pupils home</a>, with some closing for a few days as a "circuit breaker" and others telling pupils to learn remotely until the start of the new term in January.
<p>On Friday night, unions said schools were revisiting their contingency plans for January, which include provision for remote education.</p>
<p>Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said some headteachers were already calling for <a>exams to be axed</a> for a third year in a row, with predicted grades used instead.</p>
<p>But Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said schools must remain open "come what may", adding: "What we have seen over the last year is an appalling collapse of education, particularly for those in the poorest areas of society. </p>
<p>"It will affect their life chances dramatically if they aren't able to catch up – and they can't catch up if you keep shutting the schools."</p>
