<p>Meanwhile, my 13-year-old had once again taken over the kitchen table with her art materials: several canvases, endless sheets of A4, some paintbrushes and hundreds of coloured pencils (we’d be eating on our laps again tonight). </p>
<p>While drawing, she was also watching a US comedy on the iPad (my iPad), eating crisps, Maoam chews and a Peperami, and conducting a FaceTime call on her phone with a friend. Her school blazer was in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>Still dazed on the sofa and shivering lightly, I wondered aloud whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday. The 13-year-old answered: “No, it’s yellow, LOL,” her guttural laugh gloating.</p>
<p>It was in this way I was reminded, once again, that living with teenagers increasingly resembles an unsatisfying flatshare arrangement with people you would do well to limit your time with in order to preserve sanity.</p>
<p>I love my children, I do: they offer me countless thunderbolts of pure joy as I watch and marvel at how they grow and learn to assert themselves in an often hostile and bewildering world. </p>
<p>I routinely catch glimpses of the women they will become and swell with pride. But adolescence is a long game and right now it’s a messy one, riven with complication and argument, ennui and backchat, sarcasm and slammed doors. </p>
<p>Confrontation is routine, but then of course it is: we occupy opposing ends of life’s spectrum, and while my wife and I have spent years learning empathy and compassion, our girls haven’t – not yet. </p>
<p>Their individual worlds consume them entirely and anything we may be going through is but a peripheral concern when compared to Depop, Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, it was my grandmother’s 102nd birthday, the occasion made poignant by the fact that her daughter, my mother, had died on the same day 20 years previously. </p>
<p>I wondered whether I should bang on and bore them of the day’s relevance, but they wanted to show me a video on YouTube of a cat pushing a dog down the stairs. </p>
<p>It was funny: the cat’s intent, the poor dog’s confusion. Together we laughed, briefly united; then they went one way, and I another.</p>

<p> You might feel like squirming with embarrassment, but it’s important that your child is equipped to deal with what they might see online </p>
<header> <h1> A psychologist’s guide to talking to your children about porn </h1> <p> You might feel like squirming with embarrassment, but it’s important that your child is equipped to deal with what they might see online </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Dr Maryhan Baker <time> 16 December 2021 • 4:10pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>After a report this week revealed that half of children are exposed to online pornography before they leave primary school, parents are being urged to talk to their children about porn as early as possible.</p>
<p>But at what age is it appropriate to start talking about sex – and is it possible to have these conversations with a pre-teen without you both squirming with embarrassment?</p>
<p>As a child psychologist and mother to an 18 and 21-year-old, I know how difficult it can be to approach this topic. Yet I’ve also seen the damage that can be caused when children see disturbing images without being equipped to deal with them.</p>
<p>I urge parents to regularly talk to their children about pornography and consent. Here are my tips for tackling the subject:</p>
<h2>Accept they will see it</h2>
<p>So, it’s important we have the conversations early to prevent our children being accidentally exposed to something they are unable to process or understand.</p>
<p>What we don’t want is a child to see pornographic images and internalise it and feel ashamed or, at the other extreme, believe that is ordinary behaviour and try to mimic some of it.</p>
<p>Don’t bury your head in the sand – work on the assumption they will see it and talk to them about it from around the age of seven.</p>
<h2>Let go of your own hangups</h2>
<p>As parents, we need to make sure we set aside our own feelings of shame or embarrassment when it comes to speaking to our children about porn and sex.</p>
<p>If you’ve discovered your child has seen porn, it’s common to feel angry, disappointed or upset – but remember that they haven’t deliberately sought this out.</p>
<p>Avoid expressing any anger or frustration, or criticising or blaming your child, as you risk triggering feelings of shame or guilt, which will make them close up and avoid talking to you about this again.</p>
<p>You could start by saying: “I know you might have seen some images which might have made you feel uncomfortable but I want you to know it’s OK and I’m not cross with you.”</p>
<h2>Discuss normal relationships</h2>
<p>The most important thing to emphasise is that these images are not real life and it’s not how adults normally act in happy relationships.</p>
<p>With older children aged 11 and above, you should frame the conversation around them as individuals and their choices.</p>
<p>It’s better to explain the risks of this objectively (such as that images can easily end up in the wrong hands and that taking pictures without consent is illegal) than pass judgement, such as by suggesting it’s morally wrong.</p>
<h2>Don’t use baby language</h2>
<p>When we feel uncomfortable, it’s easy to end up using euphemisms or jokes to make light of the subject. But you need to steel yourself and be as frank as possible, while adapting your language to the age of your child.</p>
<p>Use anatomically correct language when describing body parts (say “penis” and “vulva”) and avoid childlike language (like “bits”), even with very young children.</p>
<p>With younger children, you can explain that “sex is something adults do with other adults” and make clear that they can talk to you about any images they’ve seen.</p>
<p>You might need to do some prompting at first, so they can say yes or no rather than answering open questions.</p>
<p>And however old your child is, don’t assume you can have “the talk” once and get it over with. Aim to have regular, open conversations where you allow your child to ask questions without judgment.</p>
<p>If our children feel they can’t talk about it and learn from you, they could be exposed to situations where they are exploited or their consent is not sought.</p>

<p>Speaking as the mother of one young son, I must say this parenting lark is a breeze. A doddle. An absolute cinch.</p>
<p>At least that’s what mums of two, three, four and more kids seem to think.</p>
<p>The reality is that many of the mums of multiples who I know either don’t work or have a nanny – or both. That’s private school for you.</p>
<p>In fact, he does more activities out of choice than some of his friends and their siblings put together. So, yes, I’m still very much pulled in all directions transporting him to these.</p>
<p>Not that I’d change it for anything. Having an only child is both wonderful and intense in equal measure. It’s just that the latter is something mums of multiples don’t seem to clock.</p>
<p>There is evidence – both scientific and behavioural – that only children actually defy these traits that others project onto them.</p>
<p>So why do these stereotypes of only children and their parents abound? After all, where multiple-child-families were once a given, in the UK 40 per cent of families had only one child in 2017.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they’d heard the word at the school gates from mums of multiples that stopping at a “lonely only” would be child’s play compared to having more.</p>

<p>For breakfast on the big day, I would have sliced mango under coconut yogurt, topped with luxury granola (there is a delicious Keto one with no grains, just nuts and seeds) and fresh passion fruit. </p>
<p>Let everyone help themselves, fill their pancakes and eat them with their fingers. We did this for Christmas dinner once. Huge fun and delicious.</p>

<a>Covid-19</a> six weeks ago, my daughter refuses to eat meat because of the environment, my daughter-in-law is lactose intolerant… there’s literally nothing that all of us will be able to sit down and enjoy at the same time.
<p>A I think you’re rolling over a bit too readily in the face of these “challenges” if you don’t mind me saying so! Let’s deal with them one at a time.</p>
<p>Firstly, your loss of sense of smell (and therefore your ability to taste things, too). By the time you read this, it may well have returned, even if only in part. Live in hope, Paul! Especially <a>at Christmas!</a></p>
<p>Lactose intolerant? Well don’t give her any bread sauce or brandy butter then! Simples!</p>
<p>Come on, Paul, none of this is Cordon Bleu or rocket science. You’re merely providing some simple alternatives, or holding one or two things back from the odd plate here and there. If I can manage it every year, you can!</p>
<p>So cover the table with crackers, light the candles, get the indoor fireworks ready, and, as Tiny Tim observed: “God bless us, every one!”</p>

<p>My husband died shortly after Christmas last year. It wasn’t Covid-19 but the pressures on the NHS arising from the pandemic did impact on the care he received: it was not a peaceful or a dignified end, and the funeral was a dismal affair.</p>
<p>I can’t seem to see a compromise between going and being immersed in jollity (or feeling that I am stifling it by my presence) and staying at home with my thoughts and memories, and causing worry and perhaps offence.</p>
<p>I suspect I shall end up going – can you suggest specific ways we can find some sort of middle ground on the day?</p>
<p>As you say, if you could just pop over mid-morning for the present-opening, stay for lunch, and slip home after the Christmas pudding, you could probably manage it. But not three days straight, and I don’t blame you.</p>

<p>As I write this it’s the day after Boxing Day, and the coat I bought my wife has already made its way to the returns department of our local store. She’s exchanged it for some other things (a few of them – it wasn’t cheap).</p>
<p>No, you’re not being unreasonable. You are, however, on a hiding to nothing and as soon as you can just put the whole matter behind you the better.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before many times in this column and I’ll say it again: gifts should come without strings attached, otherwise they are not gifts, they’re contracts.</p>
<p>How can you have control over any part of a gift once you’ve given it, Brian? Look what happens when you try – you’re angry and miserable, aren’t you? And over what? A coat. A flipping coat.</p>
<p>Look. You did everything right. You picked the right size, style and colour. You didn’t baulk at the price. You handed it over on Christmas Day with a full heart. I’m sure your wife was ­sincerely grateful for all that.</p>
<p>It’s also what’s called marriage.</p>

<p>After another Covid Christmas, it is perfect New Year viewing – and the perfect way for me to say goodbye to appearing on television.</p>
<p>Earlier in my life, I was focused on my career. These days, I hardly watch television, disenchanted at the patronising fare served up for women like me.</p>
<a>Michelle Obama’s autobiography Becoming</a>, she talks about the need to “swerve”, by which she means being brave enough to defy convention and take a risk. It is something I recommend we all try in our lives.
<p>Whatever talent and profile I once had as a broadcaster, television is unlikely to come calling again. But what compensations I have had.</p>
<p>I am proud of the accolades I have received from television – but prouder still that my farm will be a more lasting legacy.</p>

<p>Alex Allan, a nutritional therapist, is not surprised by these findings.</p>
<p>“Extreme New Year’s resolutions often barely make it to the second week of January,” she says.</p>
<p>So this year, rather than setting yourself up for failure, we’re proposing 40 anti-resolutions, whether your goals are to save the planet, lose weight, get more active, sleep better or just to be happier.</p>
<p>These are, as Alex puts it, “simple changes that will make a big difference in the long term, because long-term habit changes are the only thing that works”.</p>
<p>Don’t feel you have to immediately embark on all 40, pick a handful, and when they feel like ingrained habits, pick a few more. Make 2022 the year that you change your life for the better, without even noticing it.</p>
<h2>Ditch the To Do list in favour of a Good Enough list</h2>
<h2>Write a thank you letter every month</h2>
<h2>Acknowledge compliments</h2>
<p>It’s a very British thing to brush off compliments, but learning how to enjoy them rather than just bat them away can help improve your self-esteem.</p>
<h2>Cleanse your social media feeds</h2>
<h2>Call, text or email a family member or friend every day</h2>
<h2>Commit to a random act of kindness every week</h2>
<h2>Set a reminder to smile</h2>
<p>If you’ve failed to get your head round meditating with a phone app, don’t panic. “Meditation is beneficial, but even just being more focused on breathing really helps,” says meditation teacher Chloe Webster.</p>
<h2>Drink one extra glass of water every day</h2>
<p>“Being hydrated will also keep your joints lubricated, your bowels moving, support your heart to pump blood more efficiently and regulate your body temperature.”</p>
<h2>Make half your dinner plate vegetables</h2>
<p>We know we should be eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. MacDonald says you’re more likely to achieve that if you simply fill half your dinner plate with veg.</p>
<h2>Start your meal with a green salad</h2>
<h2>Switch your evening GT for a half gin, half alcohol-free mix</h2>
<h2>Buy smaller bottles of wine</h2>
<h2>Rearrange your cupboards</h2>
<h2>Commit to not eating in front of the TV</h2>
<h2>Pick things up with your feet</h2>
<h2>Start your day with an eight-minute stretch</h2>
<h2>Do 100 squats while the kettle boils</h2>
<p>Starting the day with a couple of stair climbs, doing some squats while the kettle is boiling, or taking a quick walk around the block at lunch time can be just as if not more valuable than gym sessions, according to fitness coach Sarah Scudamore.</p>
<h2>Speed up your favourite tracks</h2>
<p>If the worrying news about climate change has made you want to do your bit but you don’t know where to start, here are some easy ways to lighten your impact on the planet.</p>
<h2>Turn your thermostat down to 19C/66F</h2>
<h2>Swap shampoo and shower gel for bar versions</h2>
<h2>Stop leaving your gadgets on standby</h2>
<h2>Freeze food that’s ‘on the turn’ rather than binning it</h2>
<h2>Keep micro plastics out of the ocean</h2>

<p>One of the most exciting discoveries, he says, came while examining the rolls. “In 1484, on March 1, the mother of the princes and her daughters were in sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, hiding from Richard III in fear of their lives.</p>
<p>"Richard III said I will find husbands for your daughters, you have nothing to worry about, come back to court, and within two days of that, I find that he sent someone called Robert Markenfield here.” </p>
<p>“He could have been Edward V, he could have been reverting back to using John Evans."</p>
<p>There’s a possibility, Dike says, that he was wounded. "There’s also a possibility, which is horrible, that the wounding may have happened after the battle, to disfigure him.</p>
<p>"If you cut across the chin it cuts the muscle which controls the lips, the lips drop and your mouth is exposed.” </p>
<p>Sure enough, the man in the stained glass who Dike and his fellow researchers believe to be John Evans has an exposed mouth. </p>
<p>“That was a moment,” says Dike, with just the faintest glimmer of pride. “I know Phillippa Langley was quite amazed by that.” </p>
<p>What, then, is the next step, I ask, imagining a great excavation project to find the bones of Edward V. Dike looks horrified. “Absolutely not,” he says, pointing out the remains "could be anywhere”.</p>

<p>So, on Christmas Day, you unwrapped your metal detector – the one you've wanted since you were 13. Now what?</p>
<a>the BBC series starring Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones as metal-detecting amateurs</a>.
<p>Also in December, an extraordinary, Roman rock-crystal jar, wrapped in eighth-century AD gold thread, emerged, magnificently restored, from a hoard of discoveries made in Scotland in 2014.</p>
<sup>th</sup>-century AD gold ‘tremisses’. The find also included nine solidi – bigger Byzantine coins, each worth three tremisses.
<p>One of the detectorists who found this hoard had been investigating the site for six years. This anonymous detectorist was acting perfectly legally.</p>
<p>But a second detectorist, David Cockle, a former policeman, also digging at the West Norfolk site, kept his discovery secret and sold 10 of the coins illegally for £15,000. He was jailed for 16 months and dismissed from the police.</p>
<p>Cockle’s fate shows how strict the legal controls are on detecting – and how careful you must be with your Christmas present.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to find something historical or valuable, you must report all unusual finds to the landowner. The landowner owns everything found on their land.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Norfolk coroner is investigating whether that great West Norfolk hoard is in fact treasure and so belongs to the Crown.</p>
<p>East Anglia is one of the richest areas for metal-detecting in the country, thanks to the ancient civilisations that flourished there. Sutton Hoo, which featured in The Dig, is in Suffolk.</p>
<p>Most of Britain has been heavily settled for millennia, though, inevitably, remote, uninhabitable sites are less likely to be good hunting grounds.</p>
<p>And there’s still plenty more out there. The boom in finds under Covid restrictions shows there isn’t a shortage of treasure: the more you look, the more you’ll find.</p>
<p>So be careful with your new metal detector in 2022 – you may find yourself changing the course of history.</p>
