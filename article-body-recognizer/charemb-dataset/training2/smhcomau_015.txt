<div>Britney Spears says fans ‘saved my life’ after 13-year conservatorship</div>
<p>The sun shining behind her, Britney Spears stood on a patio at her home in Thousand Oaks, California, in a video posted on Wednesday, and spoke to her fans for the first time since a judge terminated her 13-year conservatorship last week.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Spears posted a video to her Instagram and Twitter of #FreeBritney fans celebrating her win outside the Los Angeles courthouse.</p>
<p>“Good God I love my fans so much it’s crazy!!!” she wrote. “I think I’m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever ... praise the Lord ... can I get an Amen ???? #FreedBritney”</p>
<p>In her video on Wednesday, Spears said she wanted to answer the many questions she’s received from fans, including what she wants to do now that she’s free to make her own decisions.</p>
<p>Spears emphasised that she wants to be an advocate for people “with real disabilities and real illnesses.”</p>
<p>“I’m a very strong woman, so I can only imagine what the system has done to those people,” she said. “Hopefully my story will make an impact and make some changes in the corrupt system.”</p>
<p>In the Instagram caption, Spears called out her family members who were complacent about her situation.</p>
<p>“It still blows my mind every day I wake up how my family and the conservatorship were able to do what they did to me,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Spears said that her fans were the ones who looked out for her.</p>
<p>“The #FreeBritney movement – you guys rock,” she said, adding it was time to now “move forward.”</p>
<p>“God bless you all,” she said. “We’re going to have a good year, a good Christmas and rock on.”</p>

<div>How do you make reptilian, haunting, epic music? Mix metal and gamelan</div>
<p>What happens when extreme metal meets traditional Javanese instrumentation and mantras? When growling, ominous vocals overlay the chimes and calm rhythms of gamelan, with a rampaging wave of guitar feedback waiting in the wings?</p>
<p>In the hands of Rinuwat – Karina Utomo, Rama Parwata and Mike Deslandes – the result is reptilian, haunting and epic.</p>
<p>Utomo is best known to metal fans as the compelling frontwoman of Melbourne band High Tension, formed in 2012, which guitarist Deslandes joined in 2015.</p>
<p>Utomo says, even if the musical genres they’re exploring are in stark contrast, she found common thematic threads.</p>
<p>Deslandes swapped his guitar for “making noise”, finding new ways to play contemporary and ancient instruments.</p>
<p>The album title Dua Naga, referencing the simultaneous dualities of creation and destruction, sums up the spirit of Rinuwat and what they’ve achieved.</p>
<p>“There’s stuff on this record that’s not metal at all, so I hope that in the fact we did that, we can expand the palette of the average metal listener.”</p>
<li>Dua Naga is out now. Rinuwat will perform in Melbourne’s Flash Forward festival: details at flash-fwd.com/artist/rinuwat</li>

<div>Two pandemic breakups set the tone for a luxurious album about being sad</div>
<p>Melbourne musician Martha Brown – best known as Banoffee – suffered two major breakups during the pandemic and in her typical, candid way, salvaged the emotional wreckage to craft her second album.</p>
<p>Teartracks, an album tracing her breakup with a long-time on-off boyfriend, also traverses illness, self-harm and the fear of never having sex again.</p>
<p>She reflects that music is a risky career. “It’s like you’re gambling every week.”</p>
<p>She didn’t see the end coming.</p>
<p>“I think like many people who went through something like this in lockdown, a lot of it was about being caught in my own story and not being able to see outside of that.”</p>
<p>Her ex had barely closed the door when Brown picked up a pen and paper and began trying to make sense of her emotions through lyrics.</p>
<p>This is not a breakup album for those who are in pain and ready to heal and move on. It is luxuriously, tragically sad and it openly invites listeners to be sad too, unashamedly.</p>
<p>“I feel like my music is about pain and pushing through pain and a lot of the time it is about the double-sided coin of love and sadness.”</p>
<p>Teartracks is out now. Banoffee performs at The Gaso, Melbourne, on December 10 and The Landsdowne, Sydney, on December 17.</p>

<h3><a>What it took to get a major review into Australia’s music industry culture</a></h3>
<p>Please Explain host Nathanael Cooper joins Rachel Clun to discuss issues that have led to a review of the music industry.</p>
<h3><a>Major review to be undertaken into culture in Australian music industry</a></h3>
<p>A pioneering review into the culture inside Australian music has been commissioned as the industry faces a reckoning over inappropriate behaviour.</p>

<p>Grace Cummings is a creature of two worlds: an accomplished stage actor and a lauded singer-songwriter.</p>
<p>One world is a collective pursuit, but for Cummings, writing music is a personal journey – and not just because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>On the musical stage she sheds all costumes and scripts to bare her fears, hopes and revelations in raw, riveting folk rock.</p>
<p>Her new sophomore album, Storm Queen, is wild, tempestuous and dramatic – but anchored by her earthy vocals.</p>
<p>Her voice forms the bond between her two worlds: the gravitas that emanates from her theatrical vocal delivery. And the deep, smoky singing voice that’s a revelation.</p>
<p>Her musical accent was influenced by the artists she has on high rotation.</p>
<p>“Driving through, there were two main colours: black and a kind of unbelievable, Scottish green emerging from ash, really. The contrast between those two things is quite heavy on the eyes and to think about really.”</p>
<p>The sax wails, the acoustic guitar tries to hold the whole maelstrom together and Cummings is there at the centre of it all as the valiant Storm Queen.</p>
<p>She has previously toured with acts such as Evan Dando and J Mascis and in February she hits the road with Gareth Liddiard’s supergroup Springtime.</p>
<p>“I love Joanna and we work well together and I think I’ll be seeing a lot of her in the next little while, but [there’s] nothing in front of me right now.”</p>
<p>Storm Queen is out on January 14.</p>

<div>Sporting bosses watch border rules ahead of Australian Grand Prix, Women’s World Cup</div>
<p>The decision to deport Novak Djokovic, the world’s No.1 male tennis player, because of his defiance of Australia’s requirement for international arrivals to be fully vaccinated, has cast a shadow over the Australian Open.</p>
<p>Australia is due to stage the UCI Road World Championships, the men’s T20 World Cup and the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup this year, and the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2023.</p>
<p>AGPC chief executive Andrew Westacott expects all Formula One drivers to comply with border rules and be fully vaccinated, if they are not already, when the Australian Grand Prix rolls around in April for the first time since 2019.</p>
<p>The final three events of 2021, in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, required drivers to be vaccinated to either enter their respective countries or attend the race meeting, and no Formula One drivers missed due to not being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Westacott said the Djokovic saga had put Australia as a host of major sporting events in the spotlight.</p>
<p>“It’s a massive global story, and it’s been out there for every sport fan and every sport journalist across the globe to report on, and therefore it’s brought focus on Melbourne and focus on the issue,” he said.</p>
<p>“Because of the outcome of that issue, it hasn’t necessarily been observed favourably in the same way you get positive kudos at the end of staging these wonderful tournaments.</p>
<p>“Major events are a double-edged sword, and you always see this in the lead-up to and the staging of massive events, be it Formula One, grand slams, majors in golf, Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games.</p>
<p>FIFA in a statement said it was paying close attention to border rules ahead of next year’s Women’s World Cup.</p>
<b/>“With the vaccine rollout underway around the world and the tournament still around 18 months away, we are confident of being able to host a safe and successful tournament in 2023.”
<p>The 2022 UCI Road World Championships are to be held in Wollongong. A spokesperson for the local organising committee said:</p>
<p>Westacott said he was preparing for a much-anticipated Australian Grand Prix in April.</p>

<h3><a>Olympic dreams, Diamond teens and a club season battered by COVID-19</a></h3>

<p>If this was the dress rehearsal, the final performance is going to be quite something. So much for a dead rubber.</p>
<p>With England and Australia already assured of their places in Thursday’s (AEDT) Quad Series final, this match between old sporting enemies was meant to be a meaningless warm-up act for little more than bragging rights.</p>
<p>As it turns out, neither team will have those after a thrilling 48-48 draw in London on Wednesday that only whetted the appetite for the final showdown.</p>
<p>It was just a shame so few people were there to see it, with a dismally low crowd at the Copper Box Arena in London to watch the best two teams in the world face off for the first time in three years.</p>
<p>It was not pretty at times, but it set the stage for a massive series finale. Honours even, now for the match that really matters.</p>

<h3><a>Think the pandemic was done ruining Australian sport? Think again</a></h3>
<p>For Australian sporting clubs and competitions which have only just emerged from two years ensconced in bio-secure bubbles, the newest variant of the coronavirus brings with it a different sort of challenge.</p>
<div>Milestone interrupted: Wilson’s 400th delayed again as all WNBL games postponed</div>
<div><div><h5>By Roy Ward</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 8, 2022 — 11.24am</time></span><span>first published <time>January 7, 2022 — 4.58pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Kelly Wilson was so close to making WNBL history on Wednesday night that she was getting ready for her 400th game when a positive COVID-19 case resulted in it being called off.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old took it in her stride as her milestone game had already been moved twice previously. Plus, as the mother of 11-month old son Teddy, she has plenty to keep her busy.</p>
<p>On Friday, the WNBL had hoped to play two games between Wilson’s Canberra Capitals and the Melbourne Boomers on Saturday and Monday, but the league tweeted on Saturday morning that COVID-19 issues had forced both games to be postponed.</p>
<p>There are now no games scheduled for the league this round. Wilson said on Friday she had doubts the games would happen.</p>
<p>“I was so grateful they hadn’t come because I would have felt so bad if they drove all the way to Canberra and I was going to see them this weekend in Victoria anyway.</p>
<p>“If I’m being 100 per cent honest, I can’t be certain the game is going ahead, especially after Wednesday when I was literally getting ready to go to the game.</p>
<p>“We will get to shoot around Saturday morning and see how we go from there.”</p>
<p>Close friend and long-time teammate Gabrielle Richards was teasing Wilson that she could be stranded on “399 not out” but Richards also paid tribute to the Leongatha-raised Wilson’s longevity.</p>
<p>“I’ve played with her since we were in under-14s and she’s always been an incredible athlete and fiercely competitive,” Richards said.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a play with broken ribs, huge hits to the head and even with a broken ankle - she’s the definition of tough and when you mix all those traits, it’s no surprise she has played this long.”</p>
<p>Wilson has always been an understated player, defending hard, hitting her shots and letting bigger stars get the attention.</p>
<p>“It’s been uncomfortable for me but the calls and messages have been amazing,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>“It’s the people I’ve met throughout my career that mean the most to me.”</p>
<p>Wilson started in 2002-2003 when the Australian Institute of Sport fielded a WNBL team and she played in 16 or more games every campaign until the hub season last December when she was in her third trimester with Teddy.</p>
<p>Wilson either studied or worked as a teacher in Bendigo for “80 to 90 per cent” of her career, although she took leave to join Townsville Fire as a full-time professional in 2017-2018 and leave without pay to join Canberra in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>Wilson had no comeback plans after the challenges of becoming a mum during the lockdowns of 2021.</p>
<p>But NBL1 side Bendigo Braves kept asking Wilson to train and she eventually joined them, becoming “super competitive again” and opening the door for a WNBL comeback. However, balancing mum duties with playing has been tough.</p>
<p>“Becoming a mum is one hell of an adjustment and nothing makes you ready for it,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>“But it’s not just me. I have an amazing, supportive husband, family who help out and I definitely don’t have time to myself now but we make it work.”</p>
<p>Wilson, husband Michael and Teddy are spending the season in Canberra.</p>
<p>“Ted has no idea what is going on, but he likes to come to basketball and see the girls because he gets a fair bit of attention,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>“For me, I just love seeing him happy and realising that there are more people than just mum and dad and immediate family - that is exciting for me.”</p>
<p>Teammate Kelsey Griffin said she thought no one would break Wilson’s record in her lifetime but Wilson hopes someone does.</p>
<p>“I hope someone gets the chance to play that many games,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>In the NBL, only one game remains scheduled for this round with Brisbane to play New Zealand in Brisbane on Sunday after COVID-19 cases at the Adelaide 36ers resulted in their two games being postponed.</p>
<p>South East Melbourne Phoenix hope to have a replacement import for their next game which is currently scheduled for January 15.</p>
<p>The Phoenix are looking for a replacement for Devin Thomas who was terminated from his position last week.</p>
<p>Coach Simon Mitchell said he was looking at a more versatile forward instead of a centre as Dane Pineau and Zhou Qi were performing well at that position.</p>

<h3><a>NBL’s big import under cloud, Klay time looming and LeBron cleared of COVID</a></h3>
<p>Three NBL stars are under injury clouds heading into round one as the Breakers continue to battle a COVID-19 outbreak while the Golden State Warriors are preparing for star guard Klay Thompson to return from serious injury in the NBA.</p>
<div>Boomers begin road to Paris Olympics with Beveridge in charge, newcomers on court</div>
<p>When it comes to thriving in a make-do situation, stand-in Boomers coach Rob Beveridge ranks among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Beveridge has been appointed by Basketball Australia to lead the Boomers for their three-game 2023 FIBA World Cup qualifying window in Japan from February 25-28.</p>
<p>This squad will be a throw-together of available NBL players, overseas players and younger Australian talents and preparation time will be limited but this is where Beveridge’s experience stands out.</p>
<p>Brian Goorjian was not able to leave his Illawarra Hawks side to lead the team, which opened the door for Beveridge to take up the role for this window.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a tough challenge but I have experience in preparing teams with very, very limited time,” Beveridge told Hoops Heaven on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The World Uni Games team met for the first time at our hotel in Naples and had two days to get going, yet we won a bronze medal. It’s about implementing a system the players feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>“I’ve worked with the Nike Hoops Summit [world team] for six or so years as well, where you only have a few days to prepare before the game.”</p>
<p>BA is currently putting together its roster and NBL clubs are assisting where they can with the hope that some of the younger players could be released for the window.</p>
<p>“BA and the NBL have a really good relationship and BA understands where the league is at with COVID [ravaging] all the teams, they can’t stop if they want to finish the season on time,” Beveridge said.</p>
<p>“I think the bulk of them will have been in the national pathway before so they know the pressure defence we want to play and those sort of things, which will help.”</p>
<p>The Boomers play Chinese Taipei on February 25 and 28, along with facing Japan on February 27. Venues and game times are yet to be announced but Beveridge intends to make the most of the experience.</p>
<h3>‘It’s not cricket’: Tough going to get COVID players</h3>
<p>With COVID-19 forcing postponements around the NBL in recent weeks, fans were quickly asking why teams weren’t bringing in replacement players from lower leagues like the NBA or even the local Big Bash cricket tournament.</p>
<p>But South East Melbourne Phoenix coach Simon Mitchell gave a good explanation why that is much harder to do for NBL sides, although teams can bring in short-term replacements on a game-by-game basis.</p>
<p>“We are bound by NBL protocols, you can’t just bring guys in,” Mitchell said.</p>
<p>“If you are bringing [local] players in, they are generally out of season. In cricket, everyone is in season, so everyone is playing and in game shape so it’s a different situation.</p>
<p>“We don’t have access to those second tier of players to come in. We do have our five training guys who have been fantastic, although we have a couple of them go down at times [with COVID or close contacts] so it’s tough.”</p>
<p>The Phoenix have made a boom signing to fill their vacant import slot, with former New Zealand Breakers big man Brandon Ashley joining for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>He looks a good fit for what the Phoenix need to complement Zhou Qi and Mitch Creek.</p>
