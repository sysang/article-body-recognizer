<div> <div> By Our Foreign Staff <time> 2 January 2022 • 4:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>French authorities took down a temporary installation of the European Union flag from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday after Right-wing opponents of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, accused him of "erasing" French identity.</p>
<p>The giant flag was raised in place of a French flag on New Year's Eve to mark France's turn at the rotating presidency of the EU Council, which it will hold for the next six months.</p>
<p>The arch, a monument to war dead, and other landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon are also being illuminated with blue lights.</p>
<p>But Mr Macron's Right-wing rivals for the presidential election, which is four months away, seized on the removal of the tricolor and called it an affront to France's heritage and veterans.</p>
<a>Valerie Pecresse</a>, the conservative candidate, who according to polls could be the main challenger to Mr Macron in the forthcoming vote. She urged him to restore the French flag, saying: "We owe it to our soldiers who spilled their blood for it."
<h2>Flag’s removal ‘was in line with planned schedule’</h2>
<p><a>Marine Le Pen</a>, the far-Right candidate who had vowed to file a complaint with the State Council, France's highest court for administrative matters, also denounced the move.</p>
<p><a>Eric Zemmour</a>, a far-Right media pundit who is also running against Mr Macron, called it "an insult".</p>
<p>But an official in the French presidency said the flag's removal before dawn was "in line with the planned schedule", insisting that, unlike the blue lights for monuments, it was only supposed to be at the Arc for two days.</p>
<p>Mr Beaune said the decision to remove the flag during the night had been made by officials at the agency in charge of national monuments.</p>
<p>A presidency official, who asked not to be named, could not say when the French flag would fly again under the Arc but noted that it was not a permanent feature of the monument.</p>

<header> <h1> Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni: The rise and fall of France's golden couple </h1> <p> He was a once-powerful president; she was a supermodel, then he fell foul of the law this year, sentenced to three years in prison </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Anne-Elisabeth Moutet <time> 20 May 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>France isn’t a betting country, but when Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni decided to get married in 2008, after a two-month courtship, many of France’s chattering classes were already starting to guess the likely divorce date.</p>
<p>‘She’ll drop him if he loses in 2012,’ a politician friend told me knowingly. (Republican Sarkozy lost to his socialist opponent François Hollande.)</p>
<a>he was finally convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014,</a> two years after he left power.
<p>‘I told her they’d only been parted five minutes!’ Séguéla recalls. ‘It was my best success at matchmaking ever.’ The pair have been inseparable ever since.</p>
<p>While the police surrounded the school, Sarkozy went in alone, negotiated, and heroically delivered bagfuls of cash, carrying the children out until the police finally took over and shot the bomber dead.</p>
<p>In 1974, when Bruni was seven, the family were forced to flee Italy after kidnapping threats from the far-Left terrorist group the Red Brigades. They moved to France, and Bruni was sent to boarding school in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Both found themselves growing up in a well-off milieu in which they were perceived as slightly different, and each built up a persona to deal with this insecurity. Tellingly, they are not shy of confessing admiration for the other.</p>
<p>‘I think each of them believes at heart the other is too good for them, really, and can’t quite believe their luck,’ says a former colleague of Sarkozy in the Gaullist Party. ‘It takes them out of themselves, really.’</p>
<p>Sarkozy’s bribery conviction is without doubt the lowest point in the career of a politician who, more than any other, symbolises law and order. But his detractors who think this career is over are way off the mark.</p>
<p>This, observers believe, will be another big challenge, but while the French have a short fuse when it comes to financial scandals, they have a higher tolerance for campaign financial irregularities, as long as there is no personal enrichment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sarkozy watches Macron battling plummeting polls – the French are angry with <a>the president’s handling of the Covid crisis,</a> his perceived arrogance and what most people see as his disconnect with the common man.</p>
<a>Washington Speakers Bureau</a>, which also lists Tony Blair, at an estimated rate of £100,000 a lecture.
<p>‘I’d rather he went and made some money,’ Carla told a TV interviewer when asked about his future political ambitions.</p>
<p>‘He never did, you know? So he’d like that.’ Supportive of his aborted run in 2017, she told Spanish Vanity Fair the same year, half jokingly, that if her husband wanted to run again, he’d better not flinch at divorce.</p>
<p>‘Politics makes people quite strange. They are either very aggressive or very submissive, there is not much in-between. Media attention makes everything worse. Me, I like peace.’ </p>
<p>Whether she’ll get it is another story. Because if the last two years tell us anything, it’s that you should never underestimate Sarko.</p>

<h1> ‘He thinks we’re stupid children’: how France turned mutinous on Macron </h1>
<p> Demonstrations against the country's controversial Covid passports have the president on the ropes. Anne-Elisabeth Moutet reports </p>
<div> <div> By Anne-Elisabeth Moutet <time> 20 August 2021 • 7:04pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Brigitte, a middle-aged receptionist from Hyères, southern France, interviewed on France Info news radio last week, has for many become the voice of the unexpectedly successful revolt against the Health Pass bill.</p>
<p>“I am a peaceful and moderate person,” she continued. “But Macron's last address was just too harsh. This pass is a dangerous tool. It will be used for more than health emergencies. That’s why I’m marching now.”</p>
<p>Demonstrations against the unpopular measures began last month – and have been picking up steam ever since. </p>
<p>Instead, they have grown by word of mouth on social media, from the hard Left as well as the the hard Right, and Facebook groups started by ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>This, contrary to Macron’s intentions, failed to come across as reassuring. By the time the president decided the vaccination effort should be stepped up, the anti-vaxx movement was in full swing.</p>
<p>But even that alone isn’t enough to explain the protests.</p>
<p>Strong words – but not the strongest. </p>
<p>Moderate marchers feel embarrassed by these extremes – but not enough to quit. </p>
<p>French Catholics, who take a lot of provocation to come out into the streets, are a small but significant presence, the perceived contempt of officialdom having pushed them to protest.</p>
<p>Many are simply worried for their jobs. </p>
<p>While the vaccine obligation for care workers – the non-compliant will be suspended without pay from September – seems understandable, there is a fear that many businesses will seize the opportunity to lay off the non-jabbed. </p>

<h1> The ancient curse of the Grimaldis – are Monaco marriages always doomed to fail? </h1>
<p> With all eyes on Prince Albert and Princess Charlene’s relationship, Anne-Elisabeth Moutet looks at the family’s history of break-ups </p>
<div> <div> By Anne-Elisabeth Moutet <time> 4 September 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>What’s the point of reigning over a glittering independent state, on the loveliest bay of the French Riviera, with only 9,486 subjects and enough income to make you a billionaire if you are cursed never to know happiness in marriage?</p>
<a>she is also suffering from an ear, nose and throat condition</a> that has impelled doctors to bar her from flying. In the past months, Charlene has undergone a series of hospital procedures, most recently a four-hour operation in August. 
<p>But if the medieval Curse of the Grimaldis has anything to do with it, he might see his hopes dashed.</p>
<p>In 1304, Rainier won the crucial sea battle of Zierikzee. Legend has it that to celebrate he kidnapped a Flemish maiden. In revenge, she is said to have cursed his family, vowing that “never will a Grimaldi find happiness in marriage”.</p>
<a>Rainier III (the current prince Albert’s father)</a> a noted womaniser, was nevertheless happy in his marriage to Grace Kelly, but this ended prematurely
<a>when she was killed in a car crash</a>, while driving with her youngest daughter in 1982.
<p>Then there are Rainier and Grace’s three children. </p>
<a>he was slapped with a 10-month suspended jail sentence in Austria</a> for injuring a police officer and threatening a police woman with a baseball bat. “His title was Royal; his behaviour wasn’t,” a friend said.
<a>running away with a circus elephant trainer</a>, only to later wed an acrobat (they divorced 14 months later).
<p>Many at court recall a snub to Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron as recently as January last year, when Albert showed up alone at the Élysée palace for a formal State dinner in his honour, causing some frantic reshuffling of place-cards.</p>
<p>The twins, back in Monte Carlo with their father, have now started classes at the local school. Jacques now has had the title of Marquis des Baux and is the official heir to the princely throne. Continuity, not happiness, is what counts.</p>

<p>What did Lionel Bart, the composer who gave the world Oliver!, have to say – or, perhaps more to the point, want people to sing – about Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister between 1969 and 1974?</p>

<p>That he was capable of producing anything of distinction in the mid-Seventies, though, is in itself a valuable corrective to the notion that the composer was all washed up, a notorious casualty of drink, drugs and high-profile bankruptcy.</p>

<a>Normal People</a> – were published by Modan, the firm she has now declined. Rooney seems to have become more committed to the BDS cause since the summer,
<p>Following the buzz created by her announcement, Rooney magnanimously sought to clarify her position: she would be “honoured” to have the book translated into Hebrew, just not by an Israeli publishing house.</p>
<p>On the upside, Rooney novels are dreary and monochrome, and Israelis, at the very least, will be spared the time and dreariness that goes into reading yet another.</p>

<a>this week, the Department of Education warned schools not to teach political concepts such as “white privilege” as fact</a> – amazingly, many have been doing just that. 
<a>Black Lives Matter protests</a>] last summer, we are at a point where the idea is that blackness is defined by being a tragedy until there’s this massive socio-psychological revolution among whites.
<p>“That’s partly why I’ve started kicking harder than I have in about 15 years. Because it won’t do. We’ve got to get rid of this idea that ‘yes we can’t’ is a constructive mantra.”</p>
<a>As for the murder of George Floyd</a>, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement’s meteoric rise, it was “egregious and it’s important we know about it. It’s also important we know that
<a>white Tony Timpa was killed the same way in Texas four years before</a>”.
<a>unconscious bias training</a>, a practice McWhorter abhors. “If Columbia requires me to do that I am going to formally refuse and see what happens.”

<header> <h1> Meet the man who thinks your gut instincts are always wrong </h1> <p> In his new Radio 4 show, psychologist Steven Pinker argues that we can and should improve our thinking by weaning ourselves off gut feelings </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Zoe Strimpel <time> 16 November 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Read carefully, and think. A smartphone and case, combined, cost £110. The phone costs £100 more than the case. How much is the case?</p>
<p>If you answered £10, you are, like most people: wrong. The answer, of course, is £5 (£105 is £100 more than £5, and £5 + £105 = £110).</p>
<a>The Language Instinct</a>), human nature (
<a>The Blank Slate</a>) why the world is getting less, not more violent (
<a>The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>), among many others.
<p>I confess to Pinker immediately that I was one of the dunderheads who was wrong on all three questions after making a snap decision. He laughs with kindness and a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<a>author of a superb book on Spinoza</a> – they’re a brainy pair.
<p>One of Pinker’s most pungent takeaways is that intuition, the so-called gut feeling, is very often wrong. It was intuition, for instance, that led me and so many others to the wrong answer on the smartphone problem.</p>
<p>And sometimes, irrationality is the best course – in relationships, for example, it is knowing you’re loved for your “indescribable unique quirks”, rather than a box-ticking exercise, that persuades people to commit.</p>
<p>If nerdiness is the essence of the Pinkerian universe, then I want more of it, feeling clearly, as we end the call, that harnessing reason is not just useful in all kinds of ways both personal and universal, but a wondrous property of being human.</p>
<p>Think with Pinker starts on Thursday at 4pm on Radio 4 </p>

<p>True, reported crime actually fell in 2021 to the lowest rate since 2016. But to me this smacks just as much of an increase in unreported crime, and the loss of faith in the police implied therein, as anything else.</p>

<p>This is certainly not as flagrantly offensive as the protesters’ stars and is almost certainly a mistake rather than malicious. But the lack of sensitivity is real, troubling, and should be a source of concern for any civilised society.</p>

<p>Sadly, since then, along with her Aussie neighbours, Ardern has revealed herself to be hopelessly addicted to a machinery of state so obsessed with controlling public health, the woods and the trees have well and truly ceased to be distinguishable.</p>
<a>fondness for health nannying</a> himself (sugar taxes, intrusive messaging about obesity, junk food advert bans), we should be looking at Ardern’s sinister paradise as a cautionary tale.

<a>we may be facing further restrictions</a>, if not something approaching another lockdown.
<p>Despite successful vaccination and far better-equipped health systems than ours, Europe is still imposing almost immediate lockdowns. A full lockdown began in Austria in late November to mass outrage and <a>protests on the streets of Vienna</a>.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 1 December 2021 • 12:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – When are Tory MPs going to stand up to this Government’s diktats – that we must suffer yet more restrictions introduced before a vote in Parliament?</p>
<p>The House of Commons has been neutered without a murmur from the very people who should uphold our long-fought-for freedoms.</p>
<p>Philip HallPetersfield, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – If there is going to be mass hysteria and calls for a lockdown every time a new variant appears we are never going to have normal lives again.</p>
<p>SIR – Jacqueline Hawkins (Letters, November 25) argues that people should wear masks to protect her on her way to and from radiotherapy treatment. My wife, who has also had radiotherapy treatment, caught Covid when she was wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I, who live with her, did not wear a mask at any time that I was with her, and did not catch it. The Government encouraged the development and distribution of anti-Covid vaccinations for us so that normal life can return.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of us have now been vaccinated to mitigate Covid’s effects.Figures for vaccinations are astounding and put the United Kingdom in a far better place than much of continental Europe.</p>
<p>However, those with underlying health issues, or who feel that they might be at risk, should avoid crowded places, as do others who are immuno-compromised. We cannot wear face masks or have lockdowns forever.</p>
<p>Andrew H N GrayEdinburgh</p>
<p>SIR – Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said that it was “not all doom and gloom at this stage”. Well you could have fooled me.</p>
<p>Ian MackenziePreston, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – Once again our precious children’s education looks poised to bear the brunt of Covid hysteria. Has nothing been learnt?</p>
<p>Angela SaundersOtterbourne, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has announced that the new Covid measures will be “temporary”. Like income tax, then.</p>
<p>Jonnie BradshawSouth Warborough, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – I am not certain that Sajid Javid’s promise to “put the booster programme on steroids” was the best possible choice of words.</p>
<p>Bob HartNewark, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – Gillian Keegan, the Minister for Care, in an interview on speeding up the Covid booster programme, used the word operationalise five times. I am not confident.</p>
<p>Dr David ShoesmithAcklington, Northumberland</p>
<p>SIR – Noting the cluster round Glasgow, I wonder whether the new variant should be known as the Cop26 variant.</p>
<p>Robert Stratton-BrownMidhurst, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – It is reported that the World Health Organisation declined to name the latest Covid variant by the Greek letter Xi to avoid embarrassing the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>If we are to stop using words simply because they sound like the names of Chinese officials, what am I to call the alcoholic drink commonly mixed with tonic? How do I describe the noise my microwave makes when it has finished?</p>
<p>David MillerChigwell, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – Following omicron, the next inevitable variant will presumably be named pi.</p>
<p>Statistics will be demonstrated in a pi-chart, and hope of a return to normal life just pi in the sky.</p>
<p>Our only link to the outside world was a longwave radio. All this coincided with the coldest weather of the winter so far, with temperatures of -5C and snowfall on Sunday.</p>
<p>Had I owned an electric car I would have been confined to the house all weekend as I would not have been able to recharge it after using it on Friday.</p>
<p>The Government may believe that the future lies in all-electric devices powered by renewables, but I will not be giving up my wood burner under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Phil MobbsKendal, Cumbria</p>
<p>SIR – “Utter tat” architecture is invading even our finest and oldest cities (report, November 25).</p>
<p>If Chester is not safe from such vandalism, where is?</p>
<h2>It’s in the title</h2>
<p>SIR – Aberdeen University has issued a warning to its students that Robert Louis Stevenson’s novel Kidnapped (surely one of the best historical novels ever written) “concerns abduction” (report, November 29).</p>
<p>Could not their Department of Logic have saved them the trouble by pointing out that if the poor creatures cannot understand the book’s title, then clearly they are not in a position to read the book?</p>
<p>Nikolai TolstoySouthmoor, Berkshire</p>
<a>Comment, November 29</a>) says that “Brexit was never going to be a neo-Thatcherite mission to shrink the state and turn Britain into a European Singapore”. Yet that is precisely why I and most Conservatives supported it.
<p>Brexit can succeed, and endure, only if a low-tax, deregulated, pro-investment economic model based on free trade – such as the one outlined in the 2017 Conservative manifesto, co-authored by Mr Timothy – is swiftly adopted.</p>
<p>Philip DulyHaslemere, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – To see Prince Charles helping the new Republic of Barbados “celebrate” ditching the Queen as its head of state (<a>report, November 30</a>) was bizarre.</p>
<p>Nicholas YoungLondon W13</p>
<p>SIR – Several friends have informed me that instead of sending Christmas cards they plan to give the equivalent sum to charity <a>(Letters, November 29</a>).</p>
<p>I pointed out that it is possible both to donate to charity and send a card. I now seem to have fewer friends.</p>
<p>Simon BaseleyBoyton, Cornwall</p>
<p>SIR – My wife informs me that she has just heard Chris Rea’s Driving Home For Christmas on the radio for the first time this year. How many more times must we hear it before he arrives?</p>
<p>Paul WebbHinckley, Leicestershire</p>
<h2>Sheep are part of the landscape of Cumbria</h2>
<p>SIR – Sheep have shaped the landscape of Cumbria for thousands of years, yet Chris Moss (Travel, November 26) thinks they should be booted off for damaging the landscape.</p>
<p>But witness the foot-trodden scars across popular fells caused by tourism and our desire to explore the vistas so eloquently characterised by Alfred Wainwright. Why not ban humans too?</p>
<p>Cumbria’s fell farmers work hard to manage the grazing of their sheep and are aware of the legacy they leave. But what about other animals?</p>
<p>The pandemic saw the price of venison crash because restaurants –the primary market – closed; deer were no longer shot and herds have increased significantly, causing widespread damage to grasslands and fells through overgrazing.</p>
<p>Patrick LaceyAskham, Cumbria</p>
<h2>Now the gas man insists on full medical details</h2>
<p>I was asked: “Do you or any member of your household have a medical condition?” This despite my 40-year membership of HomeCare.</p>
<p>I answered: “Yes – but I feel this is of no concern to British Gas.”</p>
<p>“Unless you tell me what the condition is – to note on our records – I am unable to assist,” came the reply.</p>
<p>Having, reluctantly, explained that it was cancer-related, I was able to book an appointment to be seen in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p>Malcolm EmmersonBarnet, Hertfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – Kevin Mann (<a>Letters, November 25</a>) berates GPs for “hiding behind their computers” and not allowing face-to-face consultations.</p>
<p>He is of course welcome to sit in reception at the surgery where I train. I am sure he will feel quite comfortable surrounded by patients coughing and sneezing around him and will happily accept the risk of acquiring Covid.</p>
<p>However, once he has needlessly been exposed to Covid, whom will he blame and, more importantly, whom will he put at risk should he require treatment for an infection he could have avoided?</p>
<p>Believe me, I would much rather see patients face-to-face. However, my first duty is to do no harm. Putting patients at risk of Covid would be to breach that oath.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 2 December 2021 • 12:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The problem is that no one in the Government has any scientific understanding, and instead of following the science they have followed non-clinical scientists, many of whom have their own political agendas.</p>
<p>Mike Wilkinson FRCSLondon SW14</p>
<p>SIR – It was so disheartening to read that Parliament had welcomed, by an overwhelming majority, new Covid measures until March next year (report, December 1).</p>
<p>Anyone who has been in contact with a suspected omicron case must now self-isolate for 10 days: a prison sentence without warders or iron bars. Furthermore, you will be presumed guilty without trial. Being fully vaccinated makes no difference.</p>
<p>The justification for this measure is based not on real-world outcomes, such as virulence or transmissibility, but merely on laboratory data.</p>
<p>No doubt, however, much of the public will support these rules, owing to a cloak of fear that has once again enveloped the country. Perhaps that is the most depressing aspect of all.</p>
<p>Dr David WaltersBurton Bradstock, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – The new restrictions seem rather like fiddling while Rome burns. Surely it would be better to shut the pubs, clear the stadiums, close the borders and encourage working from home now, to solve the problem sooner.</p>
<p>Yes, this would be unpopular, but the Government and its metaphor-obsessed leader are already doomed to relegation, having suffered far too many defeats, so what is there to lose?</p>
<p>Peter H YorkDaventry, Northamptonshire</p>
<p>SIR – I received an email saying that our local vaccination centre was desperate for volunteers, not to perform the injections but just to tell people where to go.</p>
<p>Is this the best way to encourage volunteers?</p>
<p>Dr Richard SoperBury St Edmunds, Suffolk</p>
<p>SIR – Today marks the first anniversary of Jimmy Lai’s imprisonment, on December 2 2020. Other than a brief period of bail in late December, he has spent the past year behind bars.</p>
<p>Mr Lai was imprisoned under the National Security Law, for allegedly conspiring with foreign forces to endanger national security. There is also a separate accusation of fraud.</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t George Michael singing, so I’m not counting it.</p>
<p>Pamela YatesSouthport, Lancashire</p>
<p>A further problem for the village shop was the loss of power for the tills and digital payments. This will have affected retailers over the entire region, from Scotland to Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>Felicity McWeeneyMorpeth, Northumberland</p>

<p>Lord Grade has apparently convinced himself that there was no bias against the play arising from its sympathetic portrayal of Margaret Thatcher: he may find it harder to convince anyone else.</p>
<p>Dr Julian Lewis MP (Con)London SW1</p>
<p>SIR – I was interested in the feature (<a>November 30</a>) about the pros and cons of various sizes of wine glass.</p>
<p>The solution was summed up many years ago by my father, a Master of Wine. The actual glass size is immaterial. However, “it should never be full but never empty”.</p>
<p>Simon LovellPeterborough</p>
<h2>Let the recorder be consigned to history books</h2>
<p>SIR – I will not regret the demise of the recorder (<a>report, November 29</a>) – although I do have concerns about the ukulele as a replacement.</p>
<p>Since then I have endured many recorder-based concerts delivered by my children and grandchildren. Hopefully these days are no more.</p>
<p>Ken AtkinsonDoncaster, South Yorkshire</p>
<h2>Emergency services left to do the work of GPs</h2>
<p>In desperation, I phoned 111. Because I told them I had a pelvic fracture, they sent a “non-urgent” ambulance to take me to AE. I was assessed and given some strong pain medication and three days’ supply of diazepam.</p>
<p>The cost to the NHS of sending an ambulance for a non-urgent condition and the valuable time taken from AE doctors (who are now doing the work of our non-visible GPs) are a disgrace.</p>
<p>Amanda MalasHartley, Kent</p>
<a>November 25</a>) brings to mind an aphorism I used for my junior staff, way back in pre-computer days: “When all else fails, examine the patient.” I suppose today I’d have to insert: “Take your eyes off the screen.”
<p>Dr Kenneth NesbittRamsey, Isle of Man</p>
<p>SIR – When I want to see my GP now, I go to the surgery, report to reception, have my temperature taken, state which GP I would like to see and then sit in the waiting area before being seen.</p>
<p>Some of us are, obviously, very lucky.</p>

<p>GPs, on the other hand, need to be bribed: £15 a throw, £20 on Sunday and £30 to administer to some poor soul who is housebound.</p>
<p>The BMA and its greedy members should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Colonel Mark Rayner (retd)Eastbourne, East Sussex</p>

<p>SIR – What on earth is going on? Our super-efficient vaccination centre in Bracknell is entirely staffed by volunteers – doctors, nurses and others doing it in their own time and for no reward.</p>
<p>On my frequent visits with elderly patients the place is almost empty, with vaccinators waiting for patients.</p>
<p>Now the Government proposes to pay doctors a bonus for administering the jab. How crazy is this?</p>
<p>Duncan RaynerSunningdale, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Why cannot those who had no ill effects from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine be given that in the next round of jabs, saving millions of pounds and showing faith in our home-grown vaccination?</p>
<p>Lois McgillBuxton, Derbyshire</p>
<p>And when the next variant arrives? We’ll be in perpetual lockdown.</p>
<p>As Boris Johnson said, we have to live with Covid.</p>
<p>Samantha PatrickGravesend, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Victor Launert (<a>Letters, November 30</a>) likens mask scepticism to questioning turning lights off and closing curtains during the Blitz.</p>
<p>The point is the unintended consequences of such blanket policies. In a free and liberal society, especially during times of fear, asking “Why should I?” is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Northern Powergrid is struggling to reconnect thousands of homes. We’ve had no update, and I can’t help noticing the Government’s indifference.</p>
<p>Charles PalmerBirtley, Northumberland</p>
<a>“Illingworth backs calls for assisted dying”, report, November 30</a>). A consultant told me to get my affairs in order and take a good holiday, as I had six months to live.
<p>I got a second opinion from America, had major surgery, and recovered. But six months later I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and was again told that it was incurable. I went back to America, where the diagnosis was reversed.</p>
<p>This was in 2002, 19 years ago. If assisted dying had been legal I might well have chosen it.</p>
<p>Michael ParryCheltenham, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>Their arrival marks the beginning of summer and their departure its end. What joy these little flying machines bring!</p>
<p>H J ClarkSandway, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – In 1976, I bought a Creda tumble dryer. It still works well (<a>“Still working flat out”, report, December 1</a>).</p>
<p>Since then I have replaced six washing machines, the latest recalled by Whirlpool.</p>
<p>Rachel McCoolSouth Molton, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – Ken Atkinson (<a>Letters, December 2</a>) is being a little unfair to the recorder.</p>
<p>The recorder also has the misfortune of being cheap and easy to fit into a school satchel, which is why it has been foisted on reluctant musicians for generations.</p>
<p>If something more demanding, like the cello, had been adopted at school assemblies, millions of parents and neighbours might have been spared the torture of indifferent musicianship – and the recorder would have a different reputation.</p>
<p>SIR – As a former head of music, I am glad it is open season on the recorder.</p>
<p>I can’t think of anything worse. Well, maybe the bagpipes.</p>
<p>Ian FrancePenrith, Cumbria</p>
<p>SIR – Philip Duly (<a>Letters, December 1</a>) thinks that most people voted to leave the EU because they wanted Britain to become a European Singapore.</p>
<p>John SharpGreat Glen, Leicestershire</p>
<p>SIR – With regard to gendered language (<a>Comment, December 2</a>), a Swedish friend, who is a retained firefighter in Wincanton, proudly describes herself as a brandman when we speak in Swedish.</p>

<h2>The risky art of charging home for Christmas</h2>
<p>SIR – Chris Rea’s time of arrival home for Christmas (<a>Letters, December 1</a>) may depend on his finding sufficient charging points for his electric car.</p>
<p>Sally LawtonKirtlington, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – My Christmas began with the arrival of The Daily Telegraph’s entertaining and thought-provoking book of unpublished letters, <a>Wake Me Up When It’s All Over</a>.</p>
<p>One particularly appealed to me, as it demonstrates the importance of punctuation. Clare Gill writes: “Meanwhile, ‘No’ voters across Scotland are purchasing popcorn.”</p>
<p>Wrongly punctuated, the sentence would indicate a big downturn in sales for popcorn-makers.</p>
<p>Robert ReadmanBournemouth, Dorset</p>
<a>report, December 1</a>)? This year’s Christmas offerings are exactly the same as last year’s. Can’t it at least trawl its archive to give viewers a merry Christmas?
<p>David TesterRochester, Kent</p>
<p>This revised pricing came into effect on January 1 2021. Far from becoming “Global Britain” we seem to be fencing ourselves in.</p>
<p>Ian GordonKettleshulme, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – Alan Simpson (<a>Letters, November 29</a>) says that it’s the cost of postage that deters people from sending Christmas cards.</p>
<p>In 1958, when I started work at Eastbourne post office, the cost of sending a letter was 3d (a little more than 1p). A portion of chips was also 3d.</p>

<p>SIR – The Cambo oil field off the Shetland Islands, and for that matter the Jackdaw field, need to go ahead – here and now.</p>
<p>The jobs connected with Cambo and Jackdaw will be needed in the future. They are crucial to levelling up and to nurturing more economic activity in the North.</p>
<p>Does the governing party wish to retain its blue-collar vote and expand it? Approval of more blue-collar jobs in Scotland is a litmus test for the Conservatives’ one-nation credentials.</p>
<p>John BarstowPulborough, West Sussex</p>
<p>Hugh Murray-GourlayLangport, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – I have a fully insulated, mainly electric house with no open fireplace, and with a gas boiler and pumps that are also dependent on electricity.</p>
<p>Having suffered a six-day power-cut some winters ago, I feel well placed to offer advice. It is: move out.</p>
<p>Victoria EdgeFarningham, Kent</p>
<h2>A child’s murder</h2>
<p>Dave AlsopChurchdown, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – This has been a sad week for many Barbados people. A republic came into effect without a referendum or the consent of the population.</p>
<p>We have tossed our history away for a republic for which there was little demand. The administration of Mia Mottley, the prime minister, thrust this on our country with indecent haste. There was no public consultation.</p>
<p>Over the past few years there has been a marked increase in Chinese influence in Barbados. Chinese people, rarely seen here previously, are now buying up businesses, mingling with government officials and undertaking projects for the Government.</p>
<p>China seems to want to dominate the Caribbean. The Queen as head of state with our Parliament, and an impartial judiciary and courts, have been the hallmark of our history.</p>
<p>Brian I AlanBridgetown, Barbados</p>
<a>Letters, December 2</a>) attempts to undermine my first-hand account of the BBC and Ian Curteis’s controversial Falklands Play by pointing to the very favourable reception of its eventual production transmitted by the BBC in 2002.
<p>If Dr Lewis were to compare the draft that Curteis submitted 20 years earlier with the version actually produced, he would see a material difference and, dare I say, improvement.</p>
<p>I regret that Ian didn’t feel able to rework his oeuvre for the BBC of the Thatcher era but felt it acceptable much later.</p>
<p>Lord Grade of YarmouthLondon SW1</p>
<p>SIR – What is wrong with the expression “ladies and gentlemen” (<a>Christopher Howse, Comment, December 2</a>)? Surely, it covers all bases in this gender-fluid age.</p>
<p>Ladies refers to both biological women and transwomen, and gentlemen to biological men and transmen. It also covers non-binary people who fluctuate between the two.</p>
<p>Michael BanyardCharlton Adam, Somerset</p>
<h2>Vaccination volunteers</h2>
<p>SIR – Given that we may require an annual booster programme to combat Covid, could we not develop a medical reserve of trained volunteers in the same way that the Reserve operates to provide regular forces with support at times of need?</p>
<p>Diane EvansChislehurst, Kent</p>
<p>Why are there so many fewer venues than there were in March, when I received a vaccine invitation letter from five different centres in one week?</p>
<p>Dr Penelope UptonLighthorne, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – I lost a ridge tile during the recent storm, which was quickly replaced by a roofer for £300.</p>
<p>So the Government’s £30 payment to a GP practice for a home-visit Covid jab seems very good value to me.</p>
<p>Dr Robert McKintyDarlington, Co Durham</p>
<h2>The advantage of finishing every glass of wine</h2>
<p>SIR – When I went to see my headmaster for the last time, he touched on the subject of drink (<a>“Clear cut: confessions of a wine-glass snob</a>”, Features, November 30).</p>
<p>His advice was always to drink one’s glass to the bottom so that you would know exactly how much you had drunk.</p>
<p>If only I had listened to him.</p>
<p>Donald SutherlandHale, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – I have a neck complaint and can hardly tilt it back. I want a wine glass with a lip for my nose to fit in.</p>
<p>Richard StathamLangport, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Has anybody else noticed that letters and cards are now franked on the day they leave the main sorting office? This means they appear to arrive on the day they were sent, which seems highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Fiona WildCheltenham, Gloucestershire</p>
<h2>Older and safer drivers</h2>
<p>SIR – If the government-funded report on older drivers (<a>report, December 2</a>) brings an improvement to road safety then it is to be applauded.</p>
<p>However, it would appear from statistics that by far the biggest number of culprits of careless driving offences are the 45-54 age group, and the biggest number for dangerous driving offences are the 25-34 age group.</p>
