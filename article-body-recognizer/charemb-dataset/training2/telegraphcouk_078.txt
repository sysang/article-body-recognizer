<div> <div> By Tamara Abraham, Acting Senior Fashion Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The brand spearheading this movement is Marfa Stance. Founder-designer Georgia Dant, who previously worked at Burberry and Rag Bone, was inspired to create multifunctional outerwear by her own long-distance commute between London and New York.</p>
<p>None of these options are cheap - Marfa Stance coats cost upwards of £600, and the others command four-figure sums, but that’s because they take a lot more work and skill to create.</p>
<a>Boden</a>). Likewise Jaeger’s reversible camel and grey wool wrap coat (£325,
<a>Marks Spencer</a>) and French Connection’s long quilted coat in satsuma orange and camel (£185,
<a>French Connection</a>). The Countess of Wessex has a very on-trend reversible teddy coat by Spanish brand Indi Cold, which retails for £207 (
<p>“It’s about creating a unique, personalised, timeless and seasonless garment that works for you and your lifestyle,” says Dant. “One coat with multiple accessories for whoever you are and wherever you go.”</p>
<header> <h1> How I had a ‘no-buy’ year – and never went back to normal shopping again </h1> <p> Planning a shopping ban in 2022? Here's my best advice to keep you calm and see you through </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lauren Bravo <time> 4 January 2022 • 2:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In 2019, I gave up buying brand new clothes for a year. A #notnewyear, as my friend Daisy pithily branded it, hoping that a hashtag would hold us accountable when resolve started to waver. </p>
<a>How To Break Up With Fast Fashion</a>. The book I went on to write, because – spoiler! – I didn’t fall off the wagon. Somehow, I lasted the whole year. And I've never gone back. 
<p>So if you’re planning a shopping ban in 2022, here's my best advice to keep you calm and see you through. </p>
<p>And we’re all different. If you’re the kind of person who needs a little flexibility baked into their forbearance, then consider an alternative to the complete cold turkey. </p>
<h2>Don’t: go it alone</h2>
<h2>Do: unfollow, unsubscribe and delete all digital temptations</h2>
<p>I recommend this step to everyone, even those who would just like to cut back a little and be able to look their banking app in the eye at the end of the month. </p>
<a>Nuw</a>, and follow a few more people who aren’t afraid to grid the same outfit twice. 
<h2>Don’t: be afraid of outfit-repeating</h2>
<a>Whering</a> can help gameify this process even further, allowing you to ‘play’ your own wardrobe like it’s Candy Crush. Fun! 
<h2>Do: shop secondhand when the urge strikes</h2>
<a>eBay</a> are so full of barely-worn bargains these days that you can often find the exact piece you’re lusting over before it’s even left the shop floor.
<p>So if total abstinence is too big an ask, stick to the odd preloved purchase. </p>
<h2>Don’t: mistake PMS for destiny</h2>
<h2>Do: make it a pleasure, not a bore</h2>
<p>I won’t pretend ‘have a bath!’ is the answer to every problem in life, but it is harder to add-to-basket if your fingers are pruned. </p>
<h2>Don’t: give up if you slip up</h2>

<h1> The rise of the ‘mum necklace’ – and the chicest ones to invest in now </h1>
<p> Princess Beatrice recently sported a necklace tribute to her family – a style loved by the Duchess of Cambridge. Here's how to get the look' </p>
<div> <div> By Tamara Abraham, Acting Senior Fashion Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:20pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duchess of Cambridge has several versions, the most recent being a £495 Daniella Draper design with G, C and L, her three children’s initials, strung on a short gold chain. </p>
<p>It’s a charming idea (pun not intended) and these necklaces are much-treasured pieces that are worn day-in and day-out. But they’ve evolved of late, too. </p>
<a>Loquet London</a>, whose hero product is 9k gold and clear sapphire faceted crystal locket into which you can choose any combination of charms to represent the people and things you love.
<p>Part of this shift stems from including children in the design process. ‘Clients often bring their children into the boutique and encourage them to choose their favourite charm,’ Goldsmith says. </p>
<p>‘It can result in mothers having a charm which has no initial significance but ends up meaning the world to them, such as a beautiful but random goldfish that will forever remind them of their little one.’</p>
<p>A fitting tribute: a handwritten ‘Mama’ necklace, £160, <a>Aurum + Grey</a>; right, bold letter pendant necklace, £130, <a>Mejuri</a></p>
<a>the ‘neck mess’ idea</a>: ‘We have seen an increasing trend for layering and stacking our lockets,’ she says. 
<p>By having a dedicated piece of jewellery for each child, they develop heirloom potential too. ‘These precious keepsakes [can be] cherished and worn by the parent until the child is old enough to wear it.’</p>
<h2>Four of the best mum necklaces</h2>
<a>Roxanne First</a>; 2. Letter necklace, £65,
<a>PD Paola</a>; 3. Diamond Capricorn Zodiac pendant, £800,
<a>Catherine Zoraida</a>; 4. Small round gold locket, £380,

<div> <div> By Debora Robertson <time> 1 August 2020 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>We are well into moth season now. Constant vigilance is required.</p>
<p>This week, when I tweeted I was writing about moths, I should really have taken the day off to handle the replies.</p>
<p>One person admitted, “A raffia beach mat was the Death Star of my worst infestation,” another, “I’m afraid to open my wardrobe. I know it has gone full 2020 in there.”</p>
<p>Somewhere between chickens and fire, we can find a middle path.</p>
<p>It has become my life’s work to eradicate them. I write simply to support my pheromone trap habit.</p>
<p>Clothes moths and carpet moths, those epicurean perverts, like natural fibres and dirt. They are drawn to sweat, body oils, and food stains, which is why we often end up with holes on the front of sweaters.</p>
<h5>How to get rid of moths once and for all</h5>
<p>This is where I would normally give you a recipe for some potion to banish moths forever using ingredients found under your sink, plus something foraged from a hedgerow. Bring in the big guns. Your cashmere depends on it.</p>

<h2> The true cost of owning an electric vehicle </h2>
<p> EVs are still expensive to buy despite being cheap to run. From batteries to insurance, there are hidden costs to be wary of </p>
<h2> <a> What is the Plug-in Car Grant, how much is it – and what are the best cars that still qualify for a discount? </a> </h2>
<p> The Government has reduced the plug-in grant for a second time this year, so which electric cars still benefit from a state EV subsidy? </p>
<h2> <a> Vauxhall Mokka-e: a re-invented family favourite </a> </h2>
<p> The £30,000, 200-mile range EV market is brimming with options, including the Mokka-e. Is this the one to go for? </p>
<h2> <a> The five best new small SUVs to buy in 2021 </a> </h2>
<p> In the ultra-competitive market for supermini-based SUVs, which are the cars that deliver maximum value and driving pleasure? </p>
<h2> UK’s rarest cars: 1967 Vauxhall Cresta PC – an estate car fit for HM The Queen </h2>
<p> Her Majesty is the most high-profile owner of a car that cost a princely £1,507 and became the largest British-built estate of the period </p>
<h2> <a> UK’s rarest cars: 1984 Vauxhall Carlton 2000 CD, the sole survivor on British roads </a> </h2>
<p> The CD badge denoted the range-topping Carlton, driven by self-assured company car drivers who knew how to rise up the executive ladder </p>
<h2> <a> UK’s rarest cars: 1982 Vauxhall Cavalier SR, one of only four left on British roads </a> </h2>
<p> The Mk2 Cavalier was the car that took the fight to fleet favourite Ford. There was a model for everyone, including this rare SR version </p>
<h2> <a> UK’s rarest cars: unique 1982 Vauxhall estate made for the Queen </a> </h2>
<p> This Viceroy is the fourth of five shooting brakes made for HM The Queen, but it’s built for everyday practicality rather than regal luxury </p>
<h2> UK’s rarest cars: 1978 Vauxhall VX 490, one of only four left on British roads </h2>
<p> This performance variant of the FE-series Victor was definitely the right car – only it appeared five years too late and struggled to sell </p>
<h2> <a> The best used small cars for only £2,000 </a> </h2>
<p> Get mobile for a surprisingly small sum with these hard-wearing hatchbacks that are also as cheap to run as they are to buy </p>
<h2> <a> Days left to save Vauxhall factory as verdict looms </a> </h2>
<p> Owners Stellantis lobbied by the Government as key meeting is set to determine future of Ellesmere Port </p>
<h2> <a> UK’s rarest cars: 1982 Bedford HA 110 ‘public utility’, one of only six left on British roads </a> </h2>
<p> This light van was once ubiquitous, particularly in the vicinity of railway stations and vandalised phone boxes; today it is shockingly rare </p>
<h2> Vauxhall plant under threat from 2030 petrol ban </h2>
<p> Stellantis, the new super manufacturer, says there could be no business case for the Ellesmere Port Vauxhall plant </p>
<h2> <a> Vauxhall owner merges with Fiat Chrysler to form world’s fourth-biggest car maker </a> </h2>
<p> Peugeot and Citroen owner PSA joins forces with the Italian/American company as Stellantis to take on the likes of Toyota and Volkswagen </p>
<h2> <a> The most anticipated cars of 2021 – including a great British hope and a spirited electric Spaniard </a> </h2>
<p> Five reasons to be cheerful at the start of a potentially worrying year as the slew of new models continues unabated </p>
<h2> <a> Which is the best electric supermini? Peugeot e-208 vs Vauxhall Corsa-e </a> </h2>
<p> These are among the best in a competitive (and rapidly growing) class. In many respects they're similar but they have different characters </p>
<h2> UK’s rarest cars: 1991 Vauxhall Senator CD 24v, one of only 46 left on British roads </h2>
<p> At last Vauxhall was able to challenge Mercedes and BMW for the custom of executives. The car was good, although the badge didn't quite fit </p>
<h2> <a> UK’s rarest cars: 1966 Vauxhall Viva Brabham, one of only six left on British roads </a> </h2>
<p> An association with a three-times Formula 1 World Champion was an opportunity too good to miss for buyers of Vauxhall's family saloon </p>
