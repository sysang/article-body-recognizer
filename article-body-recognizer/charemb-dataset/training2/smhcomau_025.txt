<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Staffing shortages caused by this summer’s Omicron surge have led to the relaxation of COVID restrictions by federal and state governments.</p>
<p>As a result, Australian workers are being exposed to health risks at work on a scale like never before.</p>
<p>Since coronavirus cases began multiplying exponentially a few weeks ago, and supply chains ground to a halt from chronic staff shortages, several steps have been taken to get people back to work.</p>
<p>The definition of who constitutes a “close contact” was narrowed, and the isolation period for close contacts was reduced from 14 to seven days.</p>
<p>Many workers are therefore being pressured to resume work in circumstances that, previously, were considered highly likely to lead to transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>So, are we likely to see widespread strikes, which employers argue would be irresponsible in the current dire situation facing many businesses?</p>
<p>The answer is: probably not, but the exercise by workers of their legal rights to refuse to perform unsafe work is legitimate and has already been a feature of this two-year long pandemic.</p>
<p>Labour laws protect workers in taking a strong stand to defend a healthy and safe workplace.</p>
<p>For example, the model Work Health and Safety legislation in place in most jurisdictions and equivalent provisions in Victorian OHS law:</p>
<p>Stop-works are not usually an automatic response to workplace safety risks: consultation, dispute resolution and the involvement of agencies like WorkSafe Victoria are also effective methods.</p>
<p>But even in a health and supply chain crisis like the one we are currently facing, businesses have a legal duty to ensure the health and safety of their workers (so far as is reasonably practicable).</p>
<p>And our laws enable workers to say “no” if they are required to work in situations that endanger their health.</p>

<div>Knee-jerk switching of super fund investment options rarely pays off</div>
<p>Superannuation fund members who panicked during the COVID-19 induced sharemarket meltdown in early 2020 and switched to their fund’s ultra-conservative “cash” option will be worse off in retirement than if they had done nothing.</p>
<p>During 2020, the typical balanced option returned 3.3 per cent, capital stable produced 2.2 per cent and cash produced 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>During the sharemarket sell-off during March and April 2020, many fund members switched to cash investment options, or to a more conservative diversified option.</p>
<p>However, sharemarkets later went onto to rally around the world to recover almost all of their losses, leaving those invested in cash and conservative diversified options who did not quickly switch back far worse off than if they had done nothing.</p>
<p>Super funds offer a range of diversified investment options from which members can choose that hold various asset classes in differing proportions, as well as single-asset class options, such as Australian shares.</p>
<p>Balanced options, the most popular type, have about 30 per cent of their total pool of money invested in Australian shares and about 20 per cent in global shares, making equity market performance the main driver of their returns.</p>
<p>Following analysis of thousands of switching decisions, the researchers found a near-tripling of members switching their investment options from the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The ease with which members are able to switch through online channels, combined with heightened consumer awareness of fluctuations in financial markets, led to an increase in both switching activity and negative outcomes for members.”</p>
<p>Many super funds have added notes to their websites warning their members of the dangers of switching options during times of sharemarket volatility.</p>
<p>The super fund noted that “sharemarkets quickly recovered to their pre-pandemic levels... but unfortunately, many members who had switched investment options didn’t switch back to their original strategy”.</p>
<p>“This had a double-negative impact on their savings, as they sold when markets were down and didn’t get back into the market to benefit from the recovery.”</p>

<div>Time to cast off satellite TV and save money</div>
<p>One of the biggest money saving opportunities available to about one-third of Australian households is to cut your traditional pay satellite TV cable and switch to internet streaming services.</p>
<p>The move could slash your subscription TV costs from as much as $150 a month to just $50 a month – or more than $1000 a year – with little change to the content you are viewing.</p>
<p>However, one major barrier to taking the leap is access to free-to-air TV.</p>
<h3>1. Indoor amplified antenna</h3>
<p>When I asked a local JB Hi-Fi TV expert for their proposed solution, they suggested I try a digital indoor amplified antenna. This is the modern-day equivalent of the old “rabbits-ears” aerials that used to sit on top of TVs indoors.</p>
<p>An amplified antenna costs about $70 but, unfortunately, its effectiveness comes down to your proximity to the free-to-air stations’ digital output antennae.</p>
<p>I was not close enough to get a good result and picked up only a handful of channels. Thankfully, JB Hi-Fi refunded my money.</p>
<p>My smart TV is not old, but it is not new either. This means it does not host the latest versions of some free-to-air TV apps, and it cannot stream live TV – only catch-up TV.</p>
<p>One solution is to buy a new smart TV that works seamlessly with 9Now, 7Plus, 10Play, ABC iView and SBS On Demand – all of which offer free live TV in the latest versions of their apps.</p>
<p>The weakness of this plan, or course, is the cost. Smart TVs start at about $300, but they can go as high as $5000-plus.</p>
<p>My seven-year-old Samsung was doing just fine, so I was reluctant to get rid of it.</p>
<p>This was the mid-way solution that worked a treat in the end.</p>
<p>Google and Apple’s latest smart TV devices are called Chromecast with Google TV and Apple TV 4K. They effectively turn your TV into the latest smart TV and toss in a few Google/Apple bonus features, too.</p>
<p>Both devices offer the latest in streaming quality – 4K HDR video with support for Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and HDMI 2.1.</p>
<p>Google and Apple offer access to all the major streaming services. (The Google platform even allows you to add your Apple TV+ app subscription, too.)</p>
<p>The Google device starts at $99 while Apple starts at $249.</p>
<p>I chose Google because it is cheaper, and you can “cast” from both Apple and Android devices (Apple’s Airplay only works with Apple devices).</p>
<p>I did have to increase the speed of my NBN plan to ensure better reliability, but that had become necessary anyway because I have been working from home.</p>
<p>So, in 2022, I will be living without a phone landline, a TV aerial or a cable subscription – and will miss out on nothing. Brave new world!</p>

<div>NPP makes it more secure to sell your used car</div>
<p>The second-hand vehicle market is hot but selling your car privately can still be challenging.</p>
<p>Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and a chronic shortage of new cars flowing into this country, used car prices have soared.</p>
<p>In 2021, the average price Carsales users received for their vehicles was $25,623, a 20 per cent increase on the $21,370 they received in 2020.</p>
<p>For those who wish to sell their car privately, the dilemma is how to receive payment for their car.</p>
<p>In the past, sellers often accepted cash or a bank cheque, or sometimes even a personal cheque.</p>
<p>However, personal cheques are now almost a thing of the past and getting a bank check is inconvenient. Turning up with $25,000 or $30,000 in cash is also an unattractive option.</p>
<p>Many sellers have resorted to traditional bank transfers. However, there are problems associated with that type of payment method, too.</p>
<p>Transferring funds into the seller’s account sounds good, however, delays in the money landing in the account can be as long as three days – an agonising wait for both buyer and seller.</p>
<p>The buyer is often anxious transferring such large amount of money, while the seller won’t hand over the car until the money is in their account.</p>
<p>An increasingly popular payment method offered by the major banks is called the New Payment Platform (NPP), where funds are transferred almost immediately.</p>
<p>Launched in February 2018, the platform is open access infrastructure for fast payments.</p>
<p>Each bank determines the amount they allow to be transferred as well as any specific fraud rules that may delay payments. Check with your bank on the procedures before you accept payment for your car.</p>
<p>The NRMA website also has some helpful tips to selling your car privately. These in include:</p>
<li>Give the purchaser a receipt for their deposit and/or for the balance or the total sale price.</li>
<li>Complete the notice of disposal as soon as you can to ensure any traffic infringement notices issued after the sale are sent to the new owner.</li>
<li>Phone your insurance company and transfer your car insurance policy to your new car, or cancel the policy.</li>
<li>If the car is listed on your toll road account, remove it and add your new car.</li>

<div>Agents prep for Plan B as Omicron hits the property industry</div>
<p>Some property sellers are already shifting to online auctions, even though there is no requirement to do so, as the Omicron strain of COVID-19 hits the housing market.</p>
<p>The disease is also disrupting inspections and some agents are taking the added precaution of organising A and B teams to cover in case one of them is sick.</p>
<p>Real Estate Institute of Australia’s newly appointed president Hayden Groves said the property industry was “bracing itself” for the potential changes to deal with the Omicron strain, including agents needing to isolate.</p>
<p>Mr Groves said online auctions could become more widely used by vendors or buyers wanting to keep their distance during 2022, as would the continued use of masks, hand sanitiser and social distancing.</p>
<p>That has been the case in Melbourne, where the property market shifted entirely online during its record-breaking six lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 during the Delta outbreaks.</p>
<p>So far in 2022, some agencies in Croydon, Werribee and Craigieburn have shifted their auctions online even though they are allowed to be held on site.</p>
<p>Ray White Victoria chief executive Stephen Dullens said some vendors were keen to avoid the risk of having an in-person auction, while others were not as worried.</p>
<p>“We have gravitated more and more towards online auctions – there are some agencies that won’t do any on the street at all,” Mr Dullens said.</p>
<p>About 200 auctions had been booked across Victoria in January – 250 per cent more than a pre-COVID year, Mr Dullens said. Of these, between 40 and 50 per cent were expected to be held online.</p>
<p>Auctions at a hall or other public venue were being moved to a digital format, while special Australia Day events where 10 or more auctions would be held over the long weekend by particular agents were also being moved online, he added.</p>
<p>While auctions were being moved online, sales campaigns were being slowed by coronavirus cases, though it was not putting buyers off.</p>
<p>“Everyone is understanding of the circumstances. It’s just a matter of being open and honest about it.”</p>
<p>While Melburnians were moving auctions online, Sydneysiders were taking a more “business as usual” approach, Manor Real Estate director Jay Bacani said.</p>
<p>The Hills district agency was still holding in-person auctions, though they were using a hybrid approach for those bidding from another state or country or those wanting to avoid crowds and bid online.</p>
<p>Mr Bacani said he had also seen an early rush to the market, with at least 15 vendors approaching the agency to sell in January.</p>
<p>Though prices boomed by 21 per cent nationally in 2021, that’s not expected to be the case this year, with rises expected to be far more modest.</p>
<p>“It is still a sellers’ market, but it’s not as strong as it was in October and November, it’s starting to cool off – flattening out a bit,” Mr Bacani said.</p>
<p>In Brisbane, agents are holding auctions where only registered bidders can attend to allow for social distancing, and are also holding hybrid in-person and online auctions.</p>
<p>Place Estate Agents Bulimba director Sarah Hackett said buyers were very respectful, with some buyers even offering to undertake rapid tests before inspecting the home of a client who worked in a children’s oncology unit.</p>
<p>Agents were also working in teams which never met face to face, meaning if one team member got sick, another could step in.</p>
<p>“We’ve got A and B teams,” Ms Hackett said. “My shadow … we won’t see each other so if one of us goes down, the other one can cover. All of our meetings are done on Zoom or on [Microsoft] Teams.”</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ms Hackett said she expected the real estate market to continue to be as resilient as it had been over the past two years.</p>

<div>Search for space to WFH sends Sydney rents to record high</div>
<p>Sydney rents have risen to a record high and tenants are forking out $50 a week more than they were a year ago for the median house.</p>
<p>Released on Thursday, the Domain Rent Report for the December quarter shows asking rents rose 9.1 per cent to $600 a week for the median Sydney house over 2021 – a rise of 3.4 per cent in the past three months.</p>
<p>A search for more space to work from home during lockdown prompted the rise, with apartment rents rising at only half the pace of houses – up 4.3 per cent in a year, or $20 a week, to a record median of $490.</p>
<p>Sydney’s rental market is the second-most expensive in the country, topped only by Canberra, despite last year’s lockdown and its associated job losses.</p>
<p>Tenants are in a race for space and have been placing greater importance on their homes due to lockdown, Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell said.</p>
<p>“It’s been two years we’ve been living through restrictions and ever-changing conditions. We’ve seen many people upgrade their rental property,” Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>“Many of us are working from home, still and people are willing to pay more and pay that premium.”</p>
<p>But it’s a grim picture for essential workers or lower-income households and Dr Powell said such renters could face compromises such as longer commutes.</p>
<p>Once international border rules ease further, a return to high levels of immigration could place added strain on the rental market, she said.</p>
<p>Last year’s rent increases were even steeper in sought-after neighbourhoods near water.</p>
<p>Eastern suburbs house rents soared 15.6 per cent in a year to $1150, while northern beaches houses clocked the same median price after a 16.2 per cent rise, and Central Coast houses rose 15.2 per cent to a median $530.</p>
<p>AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said rents have historically tended to rise after house prices rise, although not in perfect relationship.</p>
<p>“A deterioration in housing affordability tends to lead to a deterioration in rental affordability,” he said.</p>
<p>If the rate of immigration increases, it could initially push up unit rents, although not house rents, he said, but he warned a 9 per cent annual rent increase was not sustainable for Sydney and reflected the distortions of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Sydney’s economy has also been less interrupted compared to Melbourne’s six lockdowns, keeping people in work. Melbourne house rents rose only $5 a week over 2021.</p>
<p>“There’s a bit of a cumulative result for Sydney in terms of fewer interruptions to the economy and activity from lockdowns,” Mr Hassan said.</p>
<p>Dulwich Hill renter Joel Murray has been trying to move for 18 months as prices rise.</p>
<p>When prices fell as international students left the country during lockdown one, the community health worker, who uses they/them pronouns, was caught without the cashflow to take advantage of the discounts and then got stuck watching prices rebound.</p>
<p>“I’m already in a basic unit with no air-conditioning, no heating, no dishwasher.”</p>
<p>They would face a steep deposit hurdle to try to buy in Sydney’s expensive property market.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the option of the Mum and Dad Bank. I don’t have the option of going home and living with my parents in Albury to save on rent,” they said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really scary, firstly for people who are currently renting who are worried about getting a rent increase,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s tough for people who are looking and may have to move further afield.”</p>
<p>BresicWhitney head of property management Chantelle Collin said the market had been inconsistent throughout the year of changing restrictions, with strong tenant demand for houses but less interest for smaller one-bedroom apartments.</p>
<p>Features such as home offices, natural light and balconies were highly sought after, she said.</p>
<p>Open for inspections are now well attended and tenants are getting their applications in quickly and at the asking price.</p>
<div><p>“They ask the question, ‘is the rent negotiable?’ But then they see the competition and they put in their application at asking [price],” she said.</p></div>

<div>Where rents have risen most as Melburnians chase a sea or tree change</div>
<p>House rents in some of Victoria’s most popular regional towns have soared by as much as $80 per week over the past year, new data shows, as the desperate desire to make a sea or tree change continues during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Melburnians are seeking out the ultimate lifestyle with a bigger home and cheaper rents than those found in highly sought-after areas such as the Mornington Peninsula.</p>
<p>Rents in the popular seaside area, just over an hour from Melbourne’s CBD, have skyrocketed over the past two years as people scrambled for a home close to the ocean during the worst of the coronavirus lockdowns.</p>
<p>In Mount Eliza alone, rents rose by 13.7 per cent over the year to December, to a median weekly rent of $850, Domain’s latest rent report revealed.</p>
<p>People are compromising by moving further away from the city, to towns where they will have views of the ocean and a bigger home but may have further to travel back to the office.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the key trends we’ve seen – the commutable distance people are willing to take a couple of days a week back to the city will be much longer than those who do it five days a week,” Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>Rents also rose in the Bass Coast’s Cowes and Inverloch, jumping by 19.4 per cent to a median $430 and adding another $70 per week to rents since December 2020.</p>
<p>Likewise, on the popular Surf Coast near Geelong, rents were up by 15.5 per cent as the median hit $600. That added $80 per week to a tenant’s rental bill and made it one of the most expensive areas to rent a house in regional Victoria.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only coastal areas that saw significant spikes in rental medians, with Horsham, close to the Grampians National Park, also clocking a big lift. Rents rose by 17.6 per cent over the year to December to a median of $350 per week.</p>
<p>Wes Davidson Real Estate property manager Joe Richardson, who works in Horsham, said the area was still seeing a huge number of inquiries for available rentals.</p>
<p>“It’s just mad, it has been for the past 12 months,” Mr Richardson said. “We have three property managers, and I’m the only one with properties available at the moment.”</p>
<p>Mr Richardson said whenever a house was advertised for rent there were more than a dozen inspections and applications.</p>
<p>Some applicants from Melbourne were doing FaceTime inspections as they couldn’t always get to the property, he said.</p>
<p>Property manager with Nutrien Harcourts Timboon, Donna Bedggood, said she wasn’t surprised rents had flown in the Corangamite area given so many people were not only moving in to rent, but also to buy.</p>
<p>New developments had seen house and land buyers renting while they waited for their new home to be built, while others rented before finding an established home to buy.</p>
<p>Homes that did come up for rent were leasing within just a few days, she said.</p>
<p>About 25 per cent of all inquiries were coming from Melbourne with the other 75 per cent from local renters who were moving as landlords sold their homes to owner-occupiers.</p>

<div>How COVID-19 changed where Melburnians want to live</div>
<p>Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula has become one of the most desirable places to rent a property, with a COVID-induced rush to beachside suburbs sending weekly rents to record highs.</p>
<p>The insatiable appetite for seaside rentals saw suburbs on the Mornington Peninsula make up nine of the top 10 rises in house rents over 2021, Domain’s latest rent report shows, with rents surging by as much as 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Four of the top 10 unit rent rises were also found on the sought-after stretch of coast, data showed.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2021 and the seaside suburb of Rye topped the list of rent rises, soaring by 25 per cent to a median $500 per week, on Domain data. Safety Beach also saw rents rise by 20 per cent to $600 per week.</p>
<p>Patterson Lakes, about 35 kilometres from the CBD, was the only suburb outside the peninsula to make the top 10, after rents there jumped by 20.6 per cent to a median $645 per week.</p>
<p>Unit rent rises saw Rosebud top the list, up 19.7 per cent to a median $445 per week, followed by Mornington which jumped by 12.5 per cent to $450.</p>
<p>These compared to the biggest changes in annual rents in 2018, when Essendon West, Hughesdale, Glen Huntly and Alphington topped the rent rises for houses, while Moorabbin, Middle Park, Vermont and East Melbourne saw unit rents soar.</p>
<p>The past two years have seen a huge shift to the Mornington Peninsula, and things have not slowed in the early part of 2022.</p>
<p>Pressure is also coming from those not wanting to move, with those who signed a lease 12 months ago now looking to extend as the city deals with the latest challenge - the Omicron strain of coronavirus.</p>
<p>If people stay put in the outer suburbs and continue to work from home, it could see a future of change for inner-city areas.</p>
<p>McCrindle demographer Mark McCrindle said that while he believed Melbourne’s inner-city apartment rental market would strengthen, workplaces would be very different.</p>
<p>“The hybrid work model, where people spend some days in the offices and some working from home, we think it will continue beyond COVID, from our research.”</p>
<p>While people still wanted to live close to bars, cafés and restaurants, they would be looking to the local areas, with the city becoming more of an entertainment destination, McCrindle said.</p>
<p>“People want to live, work and shop locally and that will continue … we’ll end up with a decentralised city which was always the dream of city planners - the 20-minute city - that’s what COVID has created.”</p>

<p>Australia builds houses that are as big as anywhere in the world and during the COVID-19 pandemic that has often been a good thing.</p>
<p>The trend to large new houses with multiple bathrooms and bedrooms is decades old but they have proved especially handy over the past two years because lockdowns and quarantine rules have forced people to stay indoors more than usual.</p>
<p>Home schooling and working from home is easier with a separate dining room or living room and the hundreds of thousands of people now forced to isolate at home will be glad if their house has extra bathrooms.</p>
<p>Yet once the pandemic passes, one of many aspects of Australian life that may come up for discussion is whether we need to keep building such big houses.</p>
<p>As Shannon Battisson, the incoming president of the Australian Institute of Architects, says in the Herald today, the amount of floor space in many Sydney homes is “crazy” considering the average household consists of just 2.8 persons.</p>
<p>An Australian Bureau of Statistics analysis in 2016 found that about 50 per cent of Australia’s housing stock had two or more spare bedrooms.</p>
<p>One problem with building huge houses is first that they are more expensive. The increase in size of houses contributes to the crazy house prices of the past two decades.</p>
<p>In NSW, architects are trying to raise consciousness of the issue by making sustainability a criterion in awards for design excellence.</p>
<p>The pandemic seems to have slowed the recent trend to living in apartments which most studies suggest are more energy efficient, not to mention cheaper.</p>
<p>Moreover, a lot of people are keen to buy big houses because they are tired of living in overcrowded apartments which are much less likely to have spare rooms.</p>
<p>The choice of house size will depend on people’s specific circumstances, from the size and composition of households to their work arrangements. Everyone will have their own preferences.</p>
<p>Yet people should certainly factor in the costs both to their own pockets and to the environment when deciding how big a house they need.</p>
<p>The financial sums could be about to change. For the past few decades, the rise in house prices has made buying a large house a solid investment because homebuyers expected strong capital appreciation.</p>
<p>But housing might not be such a sure thing in the next few years because the Reserve Bank is expected to start raising interest rates from the zero-floor where they have been stuck for the past two years.</p>
<p>Premier Dominic Perrottet can help downsizers by pushing ahead with his plan to replace stamp duty on property sales with a broad-based land tax.</p>
<p>One of the unexpected side effects of the pandemic has been a return to the golden era of the freestanding home on the quarter-acre block. But the trend could well dissipate along with the virus.</p>
<div><div>The Herald's View – Since the Herald was first published in 1831, the editorial team has believed it important to express a considered view on the issues of the day for readers, always putting the public interest first.</div></div>
<div>Construction boss shows what $21m buys in Potts Point</div>
<p>Just before Sydney’s trophy home market calls it quits for 2021 comes talk from Elizabeth Bay of a $21 million sale of a non-waterfront apartment owned by Rosanna Hindmarsh, wife of Canberra’s construction industry boss John Hindmarsh.</p>
<p>The three-bedroom penthouse sits atop the luxury One Onslow Avenue development, one of the premier residential projects completed by John Hindmarsh’s eponymous national construction giant a decade ago.</p>
<p>Symond currently owns just one apartment after he offloaded two of them in 2018, including the sub-penthouse for $7.25 million to Sino Gold founder Nick Curtis and his wife Angela.</p>
<p>Jason Boon, of Richardson Wrench Potts Point, was already rumoured to be quietly taking buyers through the apartment before it sold, but declined to respond to calls about the sale this week.</p>
<p>The sale also steals the area’s apartment record crown from audio king Peter Freedman, who Mr Boon sold the Ikon penthouse to for $16 million in 2018.</p>
<h3>Private equity property spree</h3>
<p>Forget the need for rich parents to crack Sydney’s over-priced luxury property market. Private equity has funded some of this year’s top sales, as Coco Republic’s Paul Spon-Smith, his wife Dale, and their son Anthony well know.</p>
<p>Fresh from reports that US private equity group Story3 Capital Partners has paid more than $100 million for a stake in their high-end furniture company, the family have splurged more than $43 million on some fancy property.</p>
<p>First there was a house on Palm Beach’s Snapperman Beach for $9.8 million, and in June a three-bedroom apartment on the Elizabeth Bay waterfront was added for $6 million.</p>
<p>More recently, son Anthony – the company’s new co-chief executive – and his wife Emma have bought a $9.75 million house in Rose Bay to replace their $3.73 million Bondi Beach semi.</p>
<p>And this week word leaked that Paul and Dale have bought again in Palm Beach, buying a house up the beach for close to $18 million from hospitality entrepreneur John Szangolies.</p>
<p>The sale, by LJ Hooker’s father and son team David and BJ Edwards, almost doubles the $9.2 million Szangolies paid for it five years ago when he too was freshly cashed up after private equity interests bought his Urban Purveyor Group.</p>
<p>Papinelle sleepwear founder Renae James bought her first home, a $9.22 million house in Point Piper, a month after Quadrant Private Equity acquired a majority stake in her PJs company.</p>
<p>The Bronte record was reset at $25 million by baby sleepwear entrepreneurs Hana-Lia and Gavin Krawchuk, who sold a majority stake in their company Love to Dream two years ago to Quadrant Private Equity.</p>
<h3>Santa delivers to tech entrepreneur</h3>
<p>Included in his portfolio is a row of three terraces in Paddington, purchased last year for $3.05 million each, of which one has sold for $4 million through The Agency’s Ben Collier.</p>
<p>There was at least fresh paint splashed across the three-bedroom digs in the year since, and a matter of the $150,000 stamp duty on the purchase, which still left plenty on the table to give him Christmas cheer.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised to see Collier kick-start 2022 by listing the better terrace next door.</p>
<div>Craig Kelly buys $1.3 million family home 100km north of electorate</div>
<p>Eight months after Craig Kelly sold his Sutherland Shire house in Illawong, the United Australia Party leader has bought a family home for his wife and children more than 100 kilometres away on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>It is a requirement of membership of the House of Representative for members to lodge any sale or purchase of property on the registrar within 28 days.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly’s former Illawong home, in his electorate of Hughes, was sold at auction in February for $1.651 million, three days before he resigned from the Liberal Party to sit on the crossbench as an independent.</p>
<p>The maverick MP, who has been an outspoken critic of vaccines on social media and against lockdowns in Victoria, joined Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party in August.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly said he and Vicki sold up earlier this year to buy a larger house with more outdoor space that would better provide for their intellectually disabled son.</p>
<p>“He is now 25 years of age and his entire world revolves around his home,” Mr Kelly said.</p>
<p>“To provide him with the best, we decided that he needed [a] large, flat, fully secured and private backyard, of which we were unable to do so in Sydney, and therefore the best option for him was to relocate to a semi-rural location.”</p>
<p>Mr Kelly said Vicki was also keen to move away after public calls for people to protest out the front of the family home, and claims the publication of their address prompted politically motivated intruders to enter their home.</p>
<p>At the time the Illawong property sold, the local newspaper, The Leader, reported Mr Kelly as saying: “Someone sneaked in during an open house inspection and hung an Islamic flag in the main bedroom.”</p>
<p>Mr Kelly said that while his wife and children were living in the Central Coast home, he would continue to live in the electorate in Menai.</p>
<p>“Due to recent COVID restrictions and the parliamentary calendar, I have only seen them once in the past several months, and I’m looking forwarded to the Christmas break when we will be able to spend time together,” he said.</p>
<p>The Kelly family’s Central Coast home is set on 3800 square metres and was billed a “secluded urban oasis” in the marketing before it sold.</p>
<p>There are two separate residences on title, of which the main is a five-bedroom house with a vast covered deck that overlooks a wood-fired pizza oven, vegie garden and outdoor spa.</p>
<p>The second dwelling is a two-bedroom granny flat that was built in 2017.</p>

<div>How $32.5m mansion sale triggered huge year in prestige property</div>
<p>When the oracle of Sydney’s high-end housing market, Seven’s Bruce McWilliam, kicked off the year listing one of his Point Piper waterfront investment properties for $32 million to $35 million, industry watchers sat up and took notice.</p>
<p>When it sold for about $32.5 million a few weeks later, it was as if a starter gun had been fired on what has turned out to be the strongest performing trophy market ever.</p>
<p>Empty-nesters across the eastern suburbs decided it was finally time to cash in their high-end housing, and William Wu was on hand to buy much of it.</p>
<p>Wu even outspent techie Mike Cannon-Brookes, as the Atlassian co-chief executive opted for Southern Highlands life and a mere $40 million worth of bucolic acquisitions.</p>
<p>But this year’s top Title Deeds marks go to former garbo Ian Malouf, who went from renter to spender of more than $140 million on high-end real estate, including a $60 million city pad for him and wife Larissa.</p>
<p>If lockdown didn’t remind us about the vital role internet technology is playing in our lives, the property purchases of the tech sector sure will.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just AirTrunk’s Robin Khuda ploughing his new-found wealth into $124 million worth of bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>Fintech stocks may have been on a rollercoaster but Australia’s youngest billionaire Nick Molnar didn’t let that interfere with his plan to buy most of Ben Buckler.</p>
<p>The Afterpay co-founder wasn’t content to buy up the whole clifftop triplex in North Bondi as his own, but added the block of apartments next door, as well as a $5.8 million Bowral getaway for good measure.</p>
<p>BigCommerce co-founder Eddie Machaalani prompted eastern suburbs locals to ask “where’s Abbotsford?” after he paid $25 million for a waterfront estate on the Parramatta River.</p>
<h3>Children of the rich list</h3>
<p>Estate planning has clearly been on the to-do lists of some long-term members of the rich list.</p>
<p>Harry Triguboff’s daughter, Dr Orna Triguboff, bought a block of North Bondi apartments for $11.5 million, and soon after, her daughter Ella Lizor scored $15 million digs in Bellevue Hill.</p>
<p>Monica Saunders-Weinberg, daughter of the late Westfield co-founder John Saunders, bought three houses in North Bondi in company names that are a mash-up of her children’s names for a total of $23 million this year.</p>
<p>Software developer Vito Belgiorno-Zegna of the wealthy Transfield family and his wife, Kate, saved one of Forest Lodge’s oldest houses from demolition when they bought it for $4.62 million.</p>
<p>Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest is worth an estimated $27 billion, but his daughter, Sophia, is getting by in a $1.8 million penthouse in Waterloo.</p>
<h3>Making the property news</h3>
<p>A slew of big media names made headlines for real estate deals, including James Packer, scion of former Nine owner Kerry, who finally paid up for his apartment in Crown’s Barangaroo One tower.</p>
<p>That’s the apartment Crown announced it sold off-the-plan four years ago to its major shareholder for more than $60 million, but which translates in casino-speak to $72,229,573 on settlement.</p>
<p>Peter Overton and Jessica Rowe traded in their $8.1 million Vaucluse house to move closer to the harbour for close to $11 million.</p>
<p>Seven stalwart Ann Sanders secured about $12 million for her Hunters Hill digs, and new recruit Natarsha Belling sold in Lane Cove for $3.42 million to buy in Longueville for $6.1 million.</p>
<p>All of this made the remuneration packages of the ABC’s star news teams look a little tight: Stan Grant and Tracey Holmes swapped Auburn for a $2.85 million penthouse in Coogee, while Indira Naidoo bought into Potts Point for $472,000.</p>
<p>Simon Baker and Rebecca Rigg did well out of their Bronte home when they sold for $17 million less than a day after word broke their hillside house was even on offer.</p>
<p>Nicole Kidman rounded out the renovation of her Latitude penthouse at Milsons Point by buying one of the apartments a few floors down for $2.78 million.</p>
<p>No sooner did Test cricket captain Pat Cummins buy into Bronte for $9.3 million than former captain Michael Clarke showed he still has a penchant for high-end harbourside real estate by buying $13 million digs in Vaucluse.</p>
<div>PM tells Australians to disregard George Christensen over ‘dangerous’ vaccine advice</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged parents to ignore George Christensen, a member of his own government, after labelling the member for Dawson’s calls for them not to immunise their children as “dangerous”.</p>
<p>Dr Malone has been permanently suspended from Twitter for spreading COVID-19 misinformation.</p>
<p>“I strongly disagree with the message sent out by Mr Christensen regarding children’s vaccinations,” Mr Morrison said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is contrary to the official professional medical advice provided to the government, and I urge parents to disregard his dangerous messages in relation to vaccines.”</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said vaccinations were “our primary weapon against this virus” currently sweeping through the Australian population.</p>
<p>The statement, issued on Tuesday afternoon, made no mention of any action the government might take against Mr Christensen.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said the inaction was a “failure of leadership” on the part of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>“Scott Morrison has just presided over a circumstance, which has been watched by the whole world, of the deportation of Novak Djokovic,” he told Sydney radio 2SM.</p>
<p>Mr Christensen’s Nationals partyroom colleague Darren Chester went further than the Prime Minister, calling out the “reckless” claim, which he described as “just more of the same conspiracy theory crap”.</p>
<p>Former Nationals leader Michael McCormack, meanwhile, seemed to suggest Mr Christensen needed to be “pulled into line” in a Twitter post on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>But the Nationals’ leader, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, has long said Mr Christensen had a right to express his views.</p>
<p>“We’ve got anti-vaxxers, certainly, but they’re not from overseas,” Mr Joyce told this masthead earlier this week.</p>
<p>“What can [we] do? As much as [Immigration Minister Alex] Hawke would like, he can’t send any of our politicians to Serbia.”</p>
<p>But Mr Albanese said that as government MPs, they had extra responsibility.</p>
<p>“As Australians, they can say whatever they like, but these are government members,” he said. “They shouldn’t say whatever they like as members of the Australian government.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Health Minister Greg Hunt said he had not heard about Mr Christensen’s comments.</p>
<p>“Vaccinations save lives and I would flatly, plainly disagree with anyone who said that,” he said.</p>
<p>“Anti-vaxxers aren’t just losing the debate, they’ve lost the debate.</p>
<p>“We’re at a 95 per cent national 16-plus vaccination rate. That’s beyond the conception of almost any commentator or observer through the course of the pandemic, and yet we pushed through.”</p>

<p>Employees are unlikely to strike over coronavirus health concerns despite demands from unions and business groups for the federal government to provide free rapid tests as one million Australians isolate.</p>
<p>Instead, she said the vast majority of businesses were doing the right thing and were aligned with their staff on the need for more testing and a review of workplace safety. Legal experts warn widespread strike action could be considered unlawful.</p>
<p>The ACTU has requested businesses undertake a new risk assessment due to the Omicron variant and to pay for and provide RATs to employees when they become available.</p>
<p>Ms McManus said she was “focused absolutely on people working” and it was a “very small percentage” of businesses doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>“Half of some workforces are sick at the moment, it’s a total crisis. We want people to be at work absolutely, we also want to keep people safe and businesses open,” she said.</p>
<p>“So we’re actually working towards keeping the economy going ... we’re simply saying to employers you can’t just go on like you were prior to Christmas because Omicron is here and it’s different.”</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank analysts estimate one million people across the country are isolating due to either contracting COVID-19 or being a close contact.</p>
<p>CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said it was having a huge impact on the nation’s economy, labour force and supply chains.</p>
<p>“A lack of workers has strained supply chains, particularly in the food sector, with shelves threadbare in some supermarkets,” he said. “Of course, infected workers have little choice but to stay at home.” </p>
<p>Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash hit said it was disappointing union leaders were “complaining about Australian workers going back to work”.</p>
<p>“It seems they would rather that they stay at home indefinitely,” she said.</p>
<p>She said the government was working with all stakeholders including the unions to ensure people can return to work safely and criticised the unions for playing “politics with health policy”.</p>
