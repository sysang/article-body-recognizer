<p>Some 33 different vaccines have been approved for use across the world, with Covax delivering AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac doses.</p>
<p>Covax has also signed agreements with the manufacturer of the Russian Sputnik jab - but this cannot be delivered until it has received emergency approval from the World Health Organisation - and is due to start delivering the Novavax vaccine.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca has made up the biggest share - 280m doses delivered - followed by Pfizer at 260m.</p>
<p>India’s months long export ban hit Covax hard</p>
<p>The Serum Institute of India (SII) was set to be one of the biggest suppliers of Covax jabs until India imposed a vaccine export ban last March, which remained in effect for roughly nine months.</p>
<p>The SII was forecast to produce 240m AstraZeneca shots, but so far just 46m have gone to Covax.</p>
<p>Bhutan rolled out jabs at record-breaking speed</p>
<p>The tiny kingdom of Bhutan had one of the fastest vaccine roll-outs in the world in April when it delivered a first vaccine dose to half its population in a single week.</p>
<h3>US donates four times more than others</h3>
<p>Its tiny population size - around three quarters of a million people living in the mountain kingdom - was certainly a factor in its success but its army of citizen volunteers played a crucial role.</p>
<p>The country was a beneficiary of vaccine diplomacy and was gifted 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca jab by India in a bid to counter growing Chinese influence in the region. But it has also received 500,000 doses of the Moderna jab via Covax.</p>
<p>The US has pledged the largest number of shots to Covax: 857million, compared to Germany’s 175 million, France’s 120m and the UK’s 100m. However, the actual donations to Covax have not yet matched the pledges.</p>
<p>The US has donated just over 318m shots already, more than four times greater than the 79m given by Germany. The UK has donated just 18m doses - placing it sixth on the league table of donors. Some 588m doses have been donated in total.</p>
<p>100m doses rejected in December alone</p>
<p>According to data released by Unicef - one of the partners in Covax - some 100 million doses donated were rejected by lower income countries in December alone because they had short expiry dates.</p>
<p>It was not possible to redirect 15.5m of these vaccines before they expired, which meant they had to be destroyed.</p>
<p>After a slower start than hoped, Covax shifted into fifth gear in autumn as supply constraints eased and donations finally started to arrive from wealthy countries with plenty of surplus shots.</p>
<p>In the month ending December 12, 395m doses were delivered - smashing the previous record of 125m in October. By contrast, the year began with just 1.3m vaccines shipped in February.</p>
<p>But there’s still a long way to go for the initiative, and mounting concerns that the drive to distribute booster shots in wealthy countries could undermine efforts to expand access elsewhere.</p>

<div>Tortured and isolated in a Chinese jail, Yang Hengjun has ‘no regrets’</div>
<p>Singapore: Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun says he has no regrets about being arrested in China, declaring it has allowed him to put a spotlight on the country’s legal system.</p>
<p>The comments made in a message to his wife Yuan Xiaoliang, lawyers and friends come three years after the University of Technology graduate and pro-democracy blogger was first detained and subjected to torture and isolation.</p>
<p>The Chinese court system has delayed his trial and verdict for months, leaving Yang to languish in prison, unsure of his fate on espionage charges which he and the Australian government have strongly denied.</p>
<p>Yang’s verdict after a one-day closed-court hearing in May last year was originally scheduled to be handed down in October, but this was delayed until January. It has now been pushed out further to April 9.</p>
<p>“I will not give in under any pressure from any forces,” Yang said in the message released on Monday. “Let the Chinese legal system triumph once, and let the sunshine of fairness and justice shine into every dark corner!</p>
<p>“I wait with optimism for the day that I will be free again, and with optimism for the day when freedom comes to everyone, and such hope will not fade till the end of my life!”</p>
<p>The father-of-two had spent a decade in Australia pushing for democratic reforms in China and criticising economic policy and corruption within the Communist Party after earlier working in business and for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>“I’m not guilty, but they treat me like dirt here and they tortured me,” he said in the message dictated before he was made to put on a blindfold and leave the room.</p>
<p>The Melbourne mother-of-two was detained on August 13 on suspicion of illegally communicating state secrets overseas. The exact nature of the claims remains unknown and her family has always maintained her innocence.</p>
<p>Cheng had been critical of the Chinese government’s initial management of COVID-19, mocking President Xi Jinping as a “dear leader” and arguing the horrors of the pandemic response had been “very uneasy to swallow”.</p>

<p>The pair allegedly left their homes when they should have been in isolation for possible coronavirus infections, which were later confirmed.</p>
<p>They were charged under Hong Kong’s Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation and are due to appear in court February 9. If convicted, the pair face a fine of $HK5000 ($890) and six months in jail. </p>

<div>Cold case team thinks they have found who betrayed Anne Frank</div>
<div><div><h5>By Anthony Deutsch and Stephanie van den Berg</h5><div> <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 2.39pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Amsterdam: A six-year cold case investigation into the betrayal of Anne Frank has identified a surprising suspect in the mystery of how the Nazis found the hiding place of the famous diarist in 1944.</p>
<p>A team that included retired US FBI agent Vincent Pankoke and around 20 historians, criminologists and data specialists identified a relatively unknown figure, Jewish notary Arnold van den Bergh, as a leading suspect in revealing the hideout.</p>
<p>Some other experts emphasised that the evidence against him was not conclusive.</p>
<p>The note said Van den Bergh had access to addresses where Jews were hiding as a member of Amsterdam’s wartime Jewish Council and had passed lists of such addresses to the Nazis to save his own family.</p>
<p>Twisk said only four out of initial 32 names remained following the research, with Van den Bergh the lead suspect.</p>
<p>Investigators confirmed that Otto, the only member of the family to survive the war, was aware of the note but chose never to speak of it publicly.</p>
<p>Otto “had been in Auschwitz,” Van Twisk said. “He knew that people in difficult situations sometimes do things that cannot be morally justified.”</p>
<p>While other members of the Jewish Council were deported in 1943, Van den Bergh was able to remain in the Netherlands. He died in 1950.</p>
<p>Historian Erik Somers of the Dutch NIOD institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies praised the extensive investigation, but was sceptical of its conclusion.</p>
<p>He questioned the centrality of the anonymous note in the arguments for Van den Bergh’s responsibility and said the team made assumptions about wartime Amsterdam Jewish institutions that are not supported by other historical research.</p>
<p>According to Somers there are many possible reasons Van den Bergh was never deported as “he was a very influential man”.</p>
<p>Miep Gies, one of the family’s helpers, kept Anne’s diary safe until Otto returned and first published it in 1947. It has since been translated into 60 languages and captured the imagination of millions of readers worldwide.</p>
<p>The foundation’s director Ronald Leopold said the new research had “generated important new information and a fascinating hypothesis that merits further research”.</p>
<p>Using modern research techniques, a master database was compiled with lists of Dutch collaborators, informants, historic documents, police records and prior research to uncover new leads.</p>
<p>Dozens of scenarios and locations of suspects were visualised on a map to identify a betrayer, based on knowledge of the hiding place, motive and opportunity.</p>
<p>The findings of the new research will be published in a book by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, The Betrayal of Anne Frank, which will be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The director of Dutch Jewish organisation CIDI which combats anti-Semitism said she hoped the book would provide insight into the war-time circumstances of Amsterdam’s Jewish population.</p>
<p>“If this turns into ‘the Jews did it’ that would be unfortunate. The Nazis were ultimately responsible,” Hanna Luden of CIDI said.</p>

<p>New York: Police in Britain have arrested two teenagers in connection with a Texas hostage taker the FBI identified as a British citizen.</p>

<p>One hostage was released unharmed after being held for six hours and the remaining three were later safely freed by the FBI team.</p>
<p>The hostage-taker claimed to be the brother of the neuroscientist and accused al-Qaeda operative, and demanded she be freed. Siddiqui was convicted for shooting at soldiers and FBI agents in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although the Texas hostage situation appeared to be an isolated incident, synagogues in New York and elsewhere around the country ramped up security in response and officials condemned anti-Semitic acts.</p>

<div>No, you shouldn’t throw an Omicron party ...</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>London: Almost two years since the start of the pandemic, Britain is divided into the haves and have-nots: the have-had-COVIDs and the have-nots, that is.</p>
<p>So should you get Omicron over with?</p>
<p>The apparent trend for COVID parties prompted the World Health Organisation to issue a warning last week. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, its technical lead for COVID-19, said that it was “very unsafe”.</p>
<p>“We are working very hard with all of our partners around the world to give you advice to avoid exposure, to reduce your chance of getting infected, to reduce your chance of passing the virus onward,” she said.</p>
<p>“This is critical right now. It is not the time to retreat. It is not the time to give up because we have these tools.”</p>
<p>Van Kerkhove added that those looking to be purposefully infected could pass the virus to the vulnerable, and that implications of the Omicron coronavirus variant were still not fully understood.</p>
<p>After reports of COVID parties in Queensland, Dr John Gerrard, chief health officer for the Australian state, called the idea “utterly ridiculous”.</p>
<p>“The best way to get immunity to this virus is through vaccination, not through COVID parties. Please stop,” he said.</p>
<p>Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and lead scientist on the ZOE COVID symptom tracker app, also cautions against the “chicken pox party” approach to catching the virus.</p>
<p>As for the unvaccinated, there isn’t yet enough data to suggest that Omicron will be less severe for them than previous strains of the virus. “They are still filling the intensive care units,” Spector says.</p>
<p>And what of those like me, the have-had-COVIDs: can we reasonably let our hair down and enjoy a bit of post-infection immunity?</p>
<p>Elizabeth, a 37-year-old university lecturer from Sheffield, says she and her husband have just spent an enjoyable weekend catching up – face-to-face, indoors – with lots of friends who have also just had COVID.</p>
<p>There remains enough uncertainty around Omicron that even those of us who have recently recovered cannot know for sure what our chances are of catching it again soon, according to Spector.</p>
<p>“We don’t know yet whether people can get Omicron twice in a short time. We think it’s probably possible but likely to be rare in the first three months. That would fit with the pattern of previous variants,” he adds.</p>
<p>Pre-Omicron data found that one in five people tested six months after a COVID infection didn’t have any antibodies. That doesn’t mean they had no immunity – our body can also fight off the virus with T-cells.</p>
<p>“But it probably means they have very little,” Spector says. “So there’s that element of Russian roulette.”</p>
<p>Simply, we don’t yet understand if Omicron will behave the same way as the Delta strain. “It might find a way of reinfecting people more than Delta did,” he adds.</p>
<p>“You can be slightly less worried if you’ve just had it – but the chance of reinfection is not completely zero,” Spector says.</p>
<p>Many of those enjoying a post-COVID bounce may feel life is too short to wait for the chance of reinfection to dwindle to zero before resuming their normal activities with pre-pandemic zeal.</p>
<p>“It’s always possible you’ll catch something when going about your business,” Elizabeth says. “But I feel a sense of security now that I didn’t have before.”</p>

<p>It’s important, in the interests of constructive debate, to recognise when political leaders who have been the object of serious criticism in the past turn out to have done something right and to praise them fully for it.</p>
<p>Malcolm Turnbull has had his critics over the years, including this writer. I’ve said that, among other irreverent things, as prime minister (2015-18) he resembled – gasp! – Kevin Rudd: adrift and at the mercy of events.</p>
<p>But credit where it’s due: it’s now absolutely clear that Turnbull’s policy towards China was very much in Australia’s best interests.</p>
<p>For now, though, Beijing is likely to bully Australia when it suits its purposes to do so. But Canberra’s resilience to any such attempts will be greater as a result of Turnbull’s prudent strategy towards China.</p>

<p>New York: A New York Post editor whose departure was announced on Wednesday AEST alleged she was fired two months after revealing to an executive that former editor Col Allan had sexually harassed her.</p>
<p>The Post said any suggestion of wrongdoing related to Editor-in-Chief Keith Poole’s announcement of Michelle Gotthelf’s exit was meritless.</p>
<p>Poole, who Gotthelf said fired her in November after more than two decades at the Post, is a defendant in a lawsuit she filed on Tuesday, along with Allan, an Australian, and the newspaper’s publishing company and corporate owner News Corp.</p>
<p>She said Allan became hostile when she rejected his advances. She complained to her superiors and human resources, and alleged that Allan was forced to retire shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>He returned as a consultant in 2019, however.</p>
<p>During a lunch meeting in November 2021 to discuss a soon-to-expire contract, Gotthelf said Poole asked her “what happened between you and Col?”</p>
<p>She told him Allan had propositioned her.</p>
<p>She said Poole fired her “without cause” on January 12.</p>
<p>“Any suggestion of wrongdoing related to the management changes announced today is meritless,” the Post and News Corp. said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they’re a victim of sexual harassment, unless they speak publicly, as Gotthelf has done.</p>

<div>‘Next few weeks will be tough’: Omicron hasn’t peaked in US, top doctor warns</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Washington: The United States has not yet reached a national peak of the Omicron variant, the nation’s top doctor said, urging caution even as the explosion of cases has started to plateau in some areas.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t expect a national peak in the next coming days - the next few weeks will be tough,” US Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said Sunday on CNN.</p>
<p>While that’s good news, Murthy said, “the challenge is that the entire country is not moving at the same pace. The Omicron wave started later in other parts of the country.”</p>
<p>Kelen, comparing the surge to a hurricane, said in an interview that talking about the peak of the variant is like asking, “Where’s the high-water mark?”</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter - the real question is: When will the water recede?” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re at such high numbers that even as we’re coming down, we’re still overwhelmed. Hospitals will still be overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Even in places where case numbers are starting to slow, he said hospital visits, admissions and intensive care unit numbers “are going to stay up, probably for several more weeks”.</p>
<p>Ahead of the weekend, the United States reached a record for coronavirus hospitalisations, with a total of 159,589 people in US hospitals with COVID-19 on Friday.</p>
<p>The hospitalisation count nationwide set records on six consecutive days after last week surpassing the record of 142,273 hospitalisations set January 14, 2021, during a previous peak of the pandemic in the country.</p>
<p>In the interview on CNN, Murthy also stressed the impact of the surge on hospital resources.</p>
<p>“This is also why it’s so important that we are surging resources to hospitals that are struggling,” he said. “It’s why it’s so important that we all double down on precautions that we’re taking.”</p>
<p>He said a lesson from this surge is that “vaccines are still working very well to keep people out of the hospital and to save their lives. That’s why we want everyone to get vaccinated, to get boosted, as soon as they can.”</p>
<p>Kelen predicted that “assuming nothing new happens,” health systems in some parts of the country may start to see some relief in mid-February or into March.</p>
<p>“The rest of January and a good piece of February are going to be tough,” he said. “Though different parts of the country will see it differently.”</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, also warned in recent days not to necessarily count on the Omicron variant to drive the coronavirus into an endemic phase.</p>
<p>“We do not know that - and we have to be openly honest about that,” Fauci said Monday during a virtual panel session of the World Economic Forum, when asked if this would be the year “we go from pandemic to endemic”.</p>
<p>Fauci explained that his definition of “endemicity” is when there is a “non-disruptive presence, without elimination.”</p>
<p>He described multiple phases of a pandemic, where a “control” phase would mean that “you have it present, but it’s present at a level that does not disrupt society.”</p>
<p>“It is an open question as to whether or not Omicron is going to be the live virus vaccination that everyone is hoping for,” he added.</p>

<h3>What you need to know about Kazakhstan’s ‘anarchy’</h3>
<p>Protesters stormed the main airport and set fire to government buildings forcing the authoritarian regime to call for Russian help. Here’s what is going on.</p>
<div>Anthony Blinken accuses Russia of pushing ‘false narrative’ on Ukraine</div>
<p>“The idea that Ukraine is the aggressor in this situation is absurd,” Blinken said, adding that Moscow was “simultaneously driving the false narrative that NATO is threatening Russia”.</p>
<p>But a diplomatic solution was still possible and preferable, and there were areas of potential progress in next week’s meetings, Blinken said.</p>
<p>The United States and NATO roundly rejected Russian demands that the alliance not admit new members amid growing concerns that Russia may invade Ukraine, which aspires to join the alliance.</p>
<p>Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia would have no say over who should be allowed to join the bloc. And, they warned Russia of a “forceful” response to any further military intervention in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their comments amounted to a complete dismissal of a key part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demands for easing tensions with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Putin wants NATO to halt membership plans for all countries, including Ukraine. The former Soviet republic is unlikely to join the alliance in the foreseeable future, but NATO nations won’t rule it out.</p>
<p>Blinken and Stoltenberg spoke separately following an extraordinary virtual meeting of NATO foreign ministers.</p>
<p>“NATO never promised not to admit new members; it could not and would not,” Blinken said, accusing Putin of raising a strawman argument to distract from Russian military moves along the Ukrainian border.</p>
<p>“They want to draw us into a debate about NATO rather than focus on the matter at hand, which is their aggression toward Ukraine. We won’t be diverted from that issue,” Blinken said.</p>
<div>Kazakhstan’s street battles may mask a behind-the-scenes power struggle</div>
<p>Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: It came as no big surprise when a crumbling oil town in western Kazakhstan stirred in protest on Sunday, 10 years after security forces there killed more than a dozen workers who had gone on strike over pay and poor conditions.</p>
<p>About the only thing that is clear is that the country’s convulsions involve more than a straightforward clash between protesters expressing discontent and the heavy-handed security apparatus of an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>With Kazakhstan now largely sealed off from the outside world — its main airports are closed or commandeered by Russian troops, while internet services and phone lines are mostly down — information is scarce.</p>
<p>Echoing the refrain of repressive leaders around the world confronted with protests, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Friday lashed out at liberals and human rights defenders, lamenting that authorities had been too lax.</p>
<p>But there is growing evidence that the mayhem in Almaty, the epicentre of this week’s turmoil, was more than just people power run amok.</p>
<p>Tokayev also fired Nazarbayev’s nephew Samat Abish as deputy head of the main security service and purged several others close to the former president.</p>
<p>The riots in Almaty, Kislov said, appeared to be an attempt by members of Nazarbeyev’s political clan to reverse their eclipse.</p>
<p>“This was all artificially organised by people who really had power in their hands,” he said, adding that Nazarbayev’s ousted nephew seems to have played a major role in organising the unrest.</p>
<p>He said the mob was “clearly organised by crime group marauders” and surged down main streets toward Akimat, the City Hall, setting cars on fire and storming government offices.</p>
<p>On Friday, the interior ministry said that its special forces unit had arrested Dzhumageldiev, together with five accomplices. Dzhumageldiev was the leader of an organised criminal gang, the ministry said.</p>
<p>“One lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,” Blinken added.</p>
<p>That a possible power struggle could have morphed so quickly into mayhem on the streets is a measure of how brittle Kazakhstan is beneath the shiny surface of wealthy, cosmopolitan cities like Almaty.</p>
<p>“Kazakhstan is a rich country,” Umbetov said, “but these resources do not work in the interests of the people; they work in the interests of the elites. There is a huge stratification of society.”</p>
