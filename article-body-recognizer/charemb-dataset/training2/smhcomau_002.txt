<h3>Eleven Eleven continues Hickman’s magic run</h3>
<p>Warwick Farm trainer Greg Hickman has already marked a date in the diary for smart sprinter Eleven Eleven for January 2023, and it’s Magic Millions day.</p>
<p>Eleven Eleven has had a bit of luck around the Gold Coast, he won the 2020 Magic Millions Guineas after Alligator Blood was disqualified and for the past two years he has won the Magic Millions Cup over 1400m.</p>
<p>He prevailed in a four-way drive to the line on Saturday and Hickman wasn’t sure if had won.</p>
<p>“I was just hoping, waiting for the photo, but this horse has a habit of winning when he gets the right run like that,” Hickman said. “I hope I have found another like him at the sales this year.”</p>
<h3>Baker has a Prime candidate for the Carrington</h3>
<p>“I will think about backing up Frosty Rocks from the Magic Millions but the race might come a week too soon for him.”</p>
<div>Snowden showdown start of big week for Central Coast trainer Angela Davies</div>
<p>It might only be a Maiden Hcp over 1280m, but it’s looming as a classic city against provincial war at a neutral country venue in Monday’s feature meeting at Muswellbrook.</p>
<p>The powerful Randwick-based Snowden stable debuts well-bred three-year-old Pole Position off the back of two progressive trials.</p>
<p>By power-sprinting 2016 Group 1 Golden Rose winner Astern and out of a Snitzel mare, Pole Position was a $50,000 purchase through the 2020 Magic Millions Yearling Sales and is out to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>But he’ll get a tough test from strong provincial mare Yes You Think, part of a blossoming 2022 team with “Queen of the Central Coast,” Angela Davies.</p>
<p>A four-year-old daughter of dual Cox Plate champion So You Think, Yes You Think made an eye-catching debut at Taree two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Settling back and covering ground on a track she was never really comfortable on, the mare balanced up late and attacked the line hard.</p>
<p>Davies was adamant that with that experience and switching to a bigger track and a longer straight, Yes You Think is a serious chance of breaking through in the Upper Hunter.</p>
<p>It might be the start of a big week for the Davies stable who are likely to have progressive three-year-old and last start maiden winner Reggie’s Boy tackling a Class 1 at Thursday’s Tamworth meeting.</p>
<p>The stable then plans to aim big guns Salina Dreaming and Through The Cracks at two of the bigger races at Saturday’s Listed Carrington Stakes meeting at Randwick.</p>
<p>And speaking of potential match races, three exciting fillies - two on debut and one having her second start - are set for a mighty battle in the opening Maiden Hcp over 1000m.</p>
<p>Hawkesbury-based Verzenay looks well-placed three weeks after flashing home to just miss on debut at Orange, although she’s also accepted to run at Wyong on Tuesday.</p>

<div>Tips and race-by-race preview for Muswellbrook on Monday</div>
<h3><b>Race 1: MAIDEN HCP (1000m)</b></h3>
<p>Improving provincial filly <b>8. Verzenay </b>came home hard to miss narrowly on debut and can go one better here on the bigger track.</p>
<b>Dangers:</b> Tamworth-based Your Song filly
<b>9. Le Melody </b>won the second of two recent trials on this track, and rates well above average. Two debutants, I Am Invincible filly
<b> 10. Sahana</b> who draws between the top two, and Snitzel filly
<b>Saivata</b> who wears blinkers, can fight out the minor end of the prize.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>Verzenay to win.</p>
<p><b>Odds and Evens: </b>Split.</p>
<h3><b>Race 2: CLASS 1 HCP (1450m)</b></h3>
<p>Can’t go past provincial five-year-old<b> 2. The Chosen One</b> who was close-up at this track second-up off a long break and hits fitness here over a bit more ground in a race with less depth.</p>
<b> 4. Mr Severino</b> is a serious threat third-up from a better draw, with a senior and far stronger rider taking over. Keep safe
<b>5. Fusaichi Family</b> who draws to get a soft run off the speed with far more experienced jockey back on; while
<b>1. Media Man</b> third-up heads the rest.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>The Chosen One win.</p>
<h3><b>Race 3: MAIDEN HCP (1280m)</b></h3>
<p>Tricky affair with a few first starters on show. One of them, Randwick-based Astern three-year-old <b>3. Pole Position</b>, is the one to beat behind two progressive trials up to 1000m.</p>
<b>Dangers:</b> Progressive provincial mare
<b>6. Bil Colyns</b> who was good late resuming; while
<b>8. Nayziar</b> goes in trifecta bets third-up.
<p>How to play it: Pole Position win and quinella 3 and 4.</p>
<h3><b>Race 4: SUMMER SIZZLER (1000m)</b></h3>
<b>1. Sharpe Hussler</b> third-up, and a month between runs. Flashed home in the Mudgee Sprint before again doing his best work late in a metro BM 72, and behind a hot speed here on a bigger course, nothing will be finishing harder.
<b> 2. Eiger </b>is always a big market watch when resuming. Comes to hand quickly, although inside draw might not be to his advantage, and better served if the track is well in soft range. Tough six-year-old
<b>4. Lord Tony</b> fought on okay after leading in the Inverell Shorts; while
<b>5. Gidgee Guy</b> can run a race first-up off a nice trial; and local five-year-old
<b>7. Bengalla Bay </b>is somewhat of a distance specialist but likely to need it wetter.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>Sharpe Hussler each way and box exacta 1,2,3.</p>
<h3><b>Race 5: CLASS 1 HCP (1000m)</b></h3>
<p>Still over the sprint trip, and this stacks up nicely for progressive filly <b>6. Phule</b> second-up. Missed by a whisker getting home on a heavy 10 at Coffs, despite getting lost down the straight. Drawn to get an ideal trail just off the speed.</p>
<b>Dangers: </b>Consistent four-year-old
<b>5. Foxstorm</b> finished hard to miss narrowly against similar opposition first-up for 10 weeks, and also better suited on the bigger track. Watch the betting on
<b>4. Sharpay Ruler </b>who hasn’t started since leading all the way on debut at Taree 17 months ago, but trialled okay a month back.
<b>8. Milingimbi </b>progresses off a nice debut win here; and
<b>3. Photogenic</b> resumes off a long break behind two progressive trials.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>Phule to win.</p>
<h3><b>Race 6: MAIDEN PLATE (1450m)</b></h3>
<p>Very tough race, with plenty of chances. Progressive three-year-old <b>8. Hettinger </b>has shown plenty over the final furlong in two runs since switching from Victoria. Blinkers are back on over a little more ground, and he’s primed to peak.</p>
<b>Dangers:</b> Improving three-year-old
<b>7. Ciao Bicky </b>got mobile late second-up behind a smart winner at Taree. Expecting a big second-up run from provincial staying four-year-old
<b>2. Double Award </b>who did his best work late in that same race as the former. Keep safe metro filly
<b> 13. Redoute’s Soul</b> on debut behind two quiet trials; while improving metro three-year-old
<b>6. Artie’s Dreamtime</b> and hard fit
<b>10. Thunder Knob</b> both go in wider exotics.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>Hettinger to win.</p>
<p><b>Odds and Evens: </b>Split.</p>
<h3><b>Race 7: BENCHMARK 58 HCP – CLASS 2 ABOVE (1280m)</b></h3>
<b> 11. Tequila Cabos</b> can strike third-up five weeks between runs at good odds. Has stuck to his task well getting home in deeper races and carries only 1.5kg above the minimum after the claim.
<b>Dangers: </b>Provincial three-year-old
<b>9. Jet Pack</b> has been held back to avoid wet tracks since failing on the Beaumont course five weeks ago. Has trialled okay and blinkers come off. Capable mare
<b>6. Chomeur </b>has trialled nicely since finishing off late in a Class 2 when put into an ordinary position back in the field. Honest six-year-old
<b> 4. Pass The Card</b> draws to get a soft run just behind the speed, although up sharply in weight. Don’t dismiss
<b>1. The Snooperstar</b> at big odds, drawn off the track fourth-up, and
<b>8. Dynastic</b> who is hard fit and a worthy exotic inclusion.
<p><b>How to play it: </b>Tequila Cabos each way and box exacta 6,9,11.</p>

<div>‘The sale of a lifetime’: Magic Millions sets remarkable record marks</div>
<p>The world’s biggest racing and breeding operation, Coolmore Stud, scooped up the top yearlings at the Magic Millions sales on the Gold Coast. But the record-breaking week saw the emergence of new young players in Australian racing.</p>
<p>Tom Magnier, Coolmore’s Australia boss, signed for four of the 19 million-dollar yearlings during the sale, while young trainers Ciaron Maher and Annabel Neasham also played at the top of the market.</p>
<p>Gai Waterhouse wasn’t to be outdone, though, taking home an I am Invincible colt for $1 million and paying $900,000 for a Justify filly, which was offered by Coolmore and Magic Millions owner Gerry Harvey.</p>
<p>“The industry in Australia is booming and Coolmore wants to be a part of that whether it is buying or selling,” Magnier said.</p>
<p>“That is why we invested so much in a Triple Crown winner from America like Justify, and it was great to see the Global Glamour filly so well-received and go to Gai.”</p>
<p>Magic Millions managing director Barry Bowditch labelled the 2022 yearlings sale, “the sale of a lifetime”.</p>
<p>“You just don’t expect that sort of clearance rate in a sale of more than 900 yearlings, that’s how strong the market was, especially considering we ran this sale under trying circumstances because of COVID,” Bowditch said.</p>
<p>“To be the leading vendor at this sale when it was so strong is incredible for the farm and is what we have been working towards for a few years,” Field said. “We have set a record gross, which is so satisfying.</p>

<div>‘Anti-vaxxer is harsh’: Why Sydney-bound Pike spiked getting jab</div>
<p>Australia’s richest and premier racing scene is about to welcome the “King of the West” who has always had a huge cult following among punters on the east coast.</p>
<p>The amount of money wagered on Pike’s rides in the last race at Perth every Saturday became unofficially known among bookies as the “Pike Spike” in Sydney.</p>
<p>The Western Australian Government’s decision to force all racegoers to be double vaccinated forced Pike to the sidelines, meaning he missed the ride on Perth Cup winner Midnight Blue. Jockeys in NSW are not required to be double vaccinated.</p>
<p>The only time the 36-year-old has ridden in Sydney was in 2008, when he partnered Grand Journey in the AJC Oaks, but he does have a strong connection with the almighty Team Hawkes stable, including group 1 success with Masked Crusader and Ole Kirk.</p>
<p>“I’ve had my own experiences with vaccines, and I had a really bad reaction to the flu shot when I was an apprentice,” Pike said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even need the flu shot back then, but I had it so I could avoid getting sick. I was young and keen and didn’t want to miss a day’s work in the saddle.</p>
<p>“But I ended up missing more days as a result and was really sick. That was the start of it for me. While I’d never say never, I felt from that day if it was something I didn’t need to have, I wouldn’t get it.</p>
<p>“I had all the vaccines when I was a child. I feel ‘anti-vaxxer’ is harsh, but I know I’ll be thrown into that category and branded that from this point on.</p>
<p>“The [WA Government’s] decision forced me to the sidelines, but it was never going to force me to retire. There’s an option for me in Sydney, and I owe it to myself and my family to explore that option and keep riding.</p>
<p>“Riding is what I do, it’s all I’ve ever been good at, and I didn’t fancy trying another career.”</p>
<p>Pike only applied for his NSW riding licence on Tuesday. He remains unsure exactly when he will make the move, but it is likely he will be in town by the middle of February.</p>
<p>He is well aware of the riches on offer in Sydney, but also the outstanding level of competition, with James McDonald, Tommy Berry, Kerrin McEvoy and Hugh Bowman among the best riders in the world.</p>
<p>“I’ll be coming across to do my best and the money on offer will make it feel like every day is a carnival day for me,” Pike said.</p>
<p>“The money is good, but nobody gives it to you, and you have to work hard and go out and get it.</p>
<p>“My manager and I have tried to keep our cards close to our chest, and we wanted to make sure Sydney was a viable option before I came. The scouting really begins now. Fingers crossed I can slot into the fold somewhere.”</p>

<p>Travis Head’s death-or-glory approach to batting has the potential to go horribly wrong but he was reassured by Pat Cummins there would be no repercussions. And it helped Australia dominate the Ashes.</p>
<div>England coach Thorpe facing sack over Ashes hotel party video</div>
<p>Graham Thorpe is on the brink of the sack as England assistant coach after it emerged that he had filmed police breaking up a team drinking session hours after the end of the final Ashes Test.</p>
<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board has launched an investigation after the all-night party, which involved players from both teams and was ended by Tasmanian police shortly after 6am on Monday.</p>
<p>It is understood that Thorpe filmed the incident and sent it to friends. It was then circulated more widely and ended up in the hands of the Australian media.</p>
<p>In the footage, four police officers can be seen arriving at the party to confront players including captain Joe Root, bowler James Anderson and Australian players Alex Carey, Travis Head and Nathan Lyon.</p>
<p>Thorpe, speaking from behind the camera, is heard to say: “This is for the lawyers.” He also goes on to name every player present.</p>
<p>A noise complaint, as the group played music from the balcony on the fourth floor of the building, was made to the team hotel, the Crowne Plaza Hobart, where both sides were staying for the fifth Test.</p>
<p>The ECB is understood to be more angry that the incident was filmed and then entered the public domain than that players were drinking. No COVID-19 regulations are believed to have been breached.</p>
<p>“During the early hours of Monday morning, members of the England and Australia men’s teams shared a drink in the team areas of the hotel in Hobart,” the ECB said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The England party have apologised for any inconvenience caused. The ECB will investigate further. Until such time, we will make no further comment.”</p>
<p>With two days to spare before England’s players return home, most of the squad have remained in Hobart until their scheduled flight today.</p>
<p>The restricted environment under which this tour has unfolded, and which has prevented both sets of players from visiting public spaces for much of the series, has meant that instead alcohol was more readily available at the teams’ hotels.</p>
<p>However, with no more immediate fixtures to protect, members of England and Australia’s squads were seen out partying around Hobart throughout the day on Monday and deep into the night.</p>
<p>Another party involving England players at the team hotel continued into the early hours of yesterday, the day after the leaked footage was filmed.</p>
<div>Mike Tomalaris says he was an ‘emotional wreck’ after forced resignation from SBS TV</div>
<p>Former SBS TV cycling presenter Mike Tomalaris has revealed that he was “an emotional wreck” after being forced to resign from the broadcaster last month.</p>
<p>Cycling fans were mystified when the popular former Tour de France host suddenly left the network after 34 years with little explanation or fanfare.</p>
<p>His departure was only announced in a staff email, with news presenter Anton Enus posting on social media that it “left his colleagues and many friends at SBS News bereft”.</p>
<p>“It was a minor mistake and it wasn’t a hanging offence,” he said.</p>
<p>His theory was that SBS did not want to renew his contract.</p>
<p>“I’ll be 61 in a couple of weeks and I feel that age had a lot to do with my moving on,” he said. “It was SBS’s way of showing me the door because it was the cheapest option.”</p>
<p>While not commenting on the breach, an SBS spokesperson said the broadcaster had been committed to Tomalaris continuing his role in the news and sports team irrespective of his age.</p>
<p>As well as continuing to broadcast the Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and other major races, SBS’s cycling coverage will include the new Tour de France Femmes from next year.</p>
<p>Tomalaris, who covered the past 26 editions of the world’s greatest cycle race, said he had struggled with depression at the shock of his exit.</p>
<p>“It made me think of the people that I’ve lost through suicide,” he said. “And even though I never considered doing any damage to myself, it did cross my mind for the very first time.</p>
<p>“It took me about 14 days to get over the shock and the shock turned to anger and my mental health was very unstable for the first time in my life.”</p>
<p>Having taken up SBS’s offer of counselling support, Tomalaris said family, friends and cycling up to 400 kilometres a week had helped him feel ready for the next stage of his life.</p>
<p>“The turning point was the outpouring of public support from viewers who have followed my career,” he said. “It was overwhelming ...</p>
<p>“I literally received thousands of personal messages – not to mention the wave of notices on various social media platforms.”</p>
<p>Tomalaris said he hoped to continue in broadcasting as well as being an advocate for cycling and maintaining his charity work for such organisations as Mental Wheels Foundation, Hands Across The Water and Youth Off The Streets.</p>
<p>“If I can put bums on and saddles and encourage people to take bicycles as a mode of transport or a recreation, my job is done,” he said.</p>
<p>While he would love to cover the Tour de France again, Tomalaris said he had been approached about taking cycling groups to Europe’s grand tours.</p>

<p>Porte (Trek-Segafredo) is third on the general classification behind Slovenians Tadej Pogacar (UAE Emirates) and Primoz Roglic (Jumbo-Visma) ahead of Sunday's final and largely processional stage into Paris.</p>
<p>The result for his parents, Ian and Penny, and the Australian cycling community is as good as a win after four years of fighting for the yellow jersey and overcoming blunders and bad luck.</p>
<p>"I don't think he got on a bike until he was about 15 or 16 and it wasn't his own bike, it was just a borrowed one. When you hear a lot of the cyclists speak, they've been riding since they were nine years old.</p>
<p>"He's a very private person. He doesn't always say what he's dreaming of, he just goes about his business and achieves it without talking too much and that's basically Richie.</p>
<p>"We're just happy that he's happy. It's a dream come true. I think we feel as if he's won. That's honestly how we feel, just relief. There's so many ups and down in anyone's career and he's certainly had his fair share of those."</p>
<p>Porte jumped from fourth to third overall after placing third in stage 20 on Saturday - a 36.2km time trial, which Tour debutant Pogacar won to sensationally steal the yellow jersey from Roglic on the penultimate day.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old is set to grace the podium on the Champs Elysees in Paris nine years after Cadel Evans, at 34, became one of the oldest winners in the Tour's history and the first Australian to claim the yellow jersey.</p>
<p>Porte competed with a depleted squad in what was one of the most mountainous Tours in modern memory and his last as a title contender before he reverts to being a super domestique at a new team next season.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian spent about the first half of his professional career famously assisting Tour champions Alberto Contador, Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome to victory before leaving Team Sky at the end of 2015 to try and win the race himself.</p>
<p>"He deserves all the accolades he's going to get because he's helped so many riders win the Tour de France. It's fitting that he's finally going to stand on the podium because he's been one of Australia's best ever GC riders."</p>
<p>Porte in the self-described "twilight" of career was inhibited by and equally profited from restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic this season.</p>
<p>"I was really impressed with how mature he has become. He's in a different stage of life. He's got a new daughter he's about to finally meet when he gets back home and he seems very happy with his partner, Gemma.</p>
<p>"From his performance and the way he delivered, I'd call that delivering - a podium spot at the Tour de France. That's pretty huge. I mean Cadel has won it but to have Richie up there, I think it's on the same level."</p>

<div>‘I don’t want that pressure any more’: Porte settles for support role at Tour de France</div>
<p>This was published 6 months ago</p>
<h1>‘I don’t want that pressure any more’: Porte settles for support role at Tour de France</h1>
<p>Paris: Richie Porte will go full circle at the Tour de France starting on Saturday, intent on helping teammate Geraint Thomas to cycling’s biggest prize despite his own blistering form.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old will line-up at the grand depart in Brest on the back of victory at the Criterium du Dauphine, the champion of which has often gone on to win the yellow jersey.</p>
<p>That result put his collection of one-week stage-race victories in the same stratosphere as all-time great Eddy Merckx and followed a career-best third place at the Tour last season with former team Trek-Segafredo.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I was never part of that boys’ club, and that’s what it is.”</p><cite>Richie Porte</cite></blockquote>
<p>Porte’s mindset is different to the champions, from Froome, to Merckx and Australia’s only Tour winner, Cadel Evans, who his name is now etched alongside in history books.</p>
<p>“I do have the [CV] of a seriously good bike rider, but I’ve always underestimated myself. I don’t have that confidence in myself, I guess. I’ve always been the little guy.”</p>
<p>“I never came through the AIS [Australian Institute of Sport] program; there was no easy pathway for me into it,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve ridden for the best teams now, but I didn’t ever have the support of the AIS or the TIS [Tasmanian Institute of Sport] and still, I’m not even a part of the TIS now.</p>
<p>“I was never part of that boys’ club, and that’s what it is.</p>
<p>“I would have loved to have been a part of it. They had no interest in me. I don’t know what I did but obviously I upset someone. Maybe it’s being from Tassie!”</p>
<p>Porte is your quintessential Australian, but he’s never competed for the only Australian-registered team in cycling’s top tier, which many academy staff and products graduated to.</p>
<p>The British set-up he’s returned to has always felt like home, even though while it supported his decision to leave in 2015, the squad, in competition, held no sentiment towards him thereafter.</p>
<p>Froome, the Kenyan-born Briton whose impeccably well-mannered demeanour belies his killer instinct, remains Porte’s rival with his own transfer to the Israel Start-Up Nation team.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Dauphine, Porte recalled the 2017 edition, which he had all but won until Froome allegedly instigated an ambush that he believes needlessly cost him the title.</p>
<p>Porte describes Froome off the bike as a good friend and the godfather of his son, but on the bike, they operate differently.</p>
<p>“Maybe if I had his mindset, I would have won more bike races,” Porte said.</p>
<p>“That’s why he’s so good. It’s foot on the throat.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s our upbringing. I came from a privileged upbringing in Australia where, it’s totally different to growing up in Kenya.</p>
<p>“I’ve had that conversation with him face to face, he knows my feelings.”</p>
<p>Froome, by contrast, credits an impenetrable mental fortitude above all else to his success.</p>
<p>However, as he readies for the Tour and rides closer towards a rich sunset, Porte is having the last laugh.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I never won the Tour. But I’m happy with my career and how it’s panned out,” he said.</p>
<div>Siuuu: The cry that’s confusing tennis fans</div>
<p>If it sounds so very unkindly un-tennis to boo on a point, then there is a very reason for it – the fans were not booing.</p>
<p>It’s a cheer not a boo. It just sounds like a boo. But it’s still not tennis, it’s a football cry.</p>
<p>It had the TV commentators flummoxed at quite what the fans were up to and what had upset them. And it had some of the players a little uncertain.</p>
<p>“First I thought they were booing me, but then I realised they were doing the sound Ronaldo does when he scores. It’s incredible,” Scot Andy Murray said.</p>
<p>Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech seemed to feel the crowd was against him with the “siuuu” cry, though he was also playing Australian Alexei Popyrin, so there was a partisan bent to the crowd.</p>
<p>Nick Kyrgios, who followed Murray on John Cain Arena, even laughed with the crowd during the match, indicating that they were overdoing it.</p>
<p>One journalist after Kyrgios’ match was a little uncertain what all the apparent booing was about.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t getting booed. That’s not getting booed,” Kyrgios said.</p>
<p>“They actually weren’t saying “boo’.</p>
<p>Kyrgios embraced the “siuuu” by doing a little imitation of Ronaldo’s trademark celebration after he won.</p>
<p>You had to feel for his opponent Liam Broady, though. He’s from Manchester in England, where Ronaldo plays for Manchester United. Broady barracks for City.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know the “siuuu” and don’t know English football, then suffice to say City and United fans don’t much like one another.</p>
<p>That was only half the problem for Broady. He thought they were actually booing: “It’s the first time I’ve ever walked onto a tennis court and been booed which for me was a crazy experience,” he said.</p>

<p>The drums are still beating for Australia coach Justin Langer to be sacked.</p>
<p>In August last year, when the drums were beating loudest, the 51-year-old promised to change his ways so he could keep his job and stop being a distraction for his players.</p>
<p>“It’s time for me to take ownership of this situation, mate,” he said to this column via text. “That’s my commitment.”</p>
<p>When Langer was a stubborn opening Test batsman, bruised and battered as opposition bowlers attacked him from a variety of angles, his default position was to dig in, refusing to change the way he played.</p>
<p>“Watching Langer bat is about as exciting as watching bananas brown,” Kerry O’Keeffe said in commentary for the ABC in 2001, a remark that infuriated Langer at the time.</p>
<p>Langer’s approach to adversity as a player was to obsessively work harder. He adopted the same mindset as coach when he replaced Darren Lehmann following the ball-tampering saga at Newlands.</p>
<p>That approach worked to a point but eventually drove his players bonkers. Cricketers at this level, in a team this competitive, rarely need motivation let alone micro-management.</p>
<p>In the face of internal unrest and endless chatter about a disharmonious dressing-room, though, Langer didn’t dig in.</p>
<p>He listened. He stepped back. He changed. He took ownership by handing back ownership of the side to his players and bringing in new coaches.</p>
<p>Say what you want about Langer, who can be a prickly little pear at the best of times, but this change speaks to a humility not often seen at this level.</p>
<p>Since Langer has moved to the back seat of the bus, Australia has been unstoppable, winning their first Twenty 20 World Cup and eviscerating England in a home Ashes series.</p>
<p>They’ve suffered just two losses — to India and England in the group stage of the World Cup — and were one wicket away from a 5-0 clean-sweep in retaining the Ashes.</p>
<p>Australia’s humiliation of Joe Root’s side has been widely considered in terms of the opposition’s weaknesses, especially with the bat.</p>
<p>Seemingly ignored have been the difficulties Australia faced.</p>
<p>Captain Tim Paine quit on the eve of the series because of a sexting scandal, forcing the selection of a debutant gloveman — Alex Carey — for the first Test. Drama.</p>
<p>Australia’s best bowler, Pat Cummins, was handed the extra responsibility of the captaincy and, notwithstanding the timing of his declaration on day four in Sydney, handled it with aplomb.</p>
<p>More than that, within just a few weeks, the dynamic within the side changed. It became his team.</p>
<p>Even when Cummins wasn’t playing, after he was ruled out on the morning of the Adelaide Test as a close COVID-19 contact, Australia still won.</p>
<p>Cummins returned in Melbourne but fellow paceman Josh Hazlewood didn’t play again because of a side strain. More drama.</p>
<p>Travis Head finally cracked triple figures with his century at the Gabba, then he caught the dreaded virus and was ruled out of Sydney. More drama.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the replacements didn’t just fill a void but performed so well they couldn’t be dropped.</p>
<p>Scott Boland has become a cult hero within three matches. Usman Khawaja’s back-to-back centuries at the SCG won’t easily be forgotten.</p>
<p>The problem with winning an Ashes series on the third day of the third Test is that there’s only so many issues left to write about for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>After picking through the dead carcass of the England cricket team, the drums started beating again for Langer.</p>
<p>As the Herald reported on Monday, some key players still want him gone after next month’s tour of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take too many phone calls to learn the mail is right: the mood around Langer hasn’t really changed in the last year or so, although there is far less support for team manager Gavin Dovey than the coach.</p>
<p>There’s already a strong push from several quarters for the well-credentialed Trevor Bayliss, who steered England to the one-day World Cup in 2019, to replace him.</p>
<p>There could be three positions available if Cricket Australia decides to split the job between the different formats of the game.</p>
<p>Regardless, players shouldn’t demand who coaches them, in any environment. They should have input — but they don’t make appointments.</p>
<p>And they’ve already had their say.</p>
<p>Yet the drums are still beating for Justin Langer’s sacking. Remind me again: why?</p>

<div>All Starved: NRL clubs concerned about releasing players for All Stars</div>
<p>The NRL and club bosses will meet via a phone hook-up on Friday, and one of the hot topics on the agenda will be the protocols in place for the players involved in the February 12 game between the Indigenous All Stars and New Zealand Maori.</p>
<p>All 16 clubs have been hit hard by COVID, especially over the Christmas break when players tested positive or were forced to isolate because they were close contacts.</p>
<p>James Fisher-Harris, the Penrith hitman who was used in the initial promotional photos for the CommBank Stadium game, only resumed training a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>The best part about All Stars week is the community involvement in the lead-up to the game, but that presents its own challenges given daily COVID numbers in NSW are just shy of 30,000.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the game and what it represents, but it’s not ideal under the circumstances because of everything that is going on everywhere,” one club boss said.</p>
<p>“There has been so much disruption already, and I’m talking about every club, not just ours.</p>
<p>The All Stars game will be played in Sydney for the first time, but without Indigenous pin-up Latrell Mitchell who misses the game as part of his six-match ban for a shot on Joey Manu late in the regular season.</p>
<p>There are no shortage of candidates for his No.1 jersey, including St George Illawarra rookie Tyrell Sloan, who told the Herald late last year his short-term goal was representing his people and playing for the Indigenous All Stars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Melbourne and the New Zealand Warriors will dedicate their February 19 trial to the people of Tonga after the weekend’s shocking underwater volcano and tsunami.</p>
<p>The Unite for Tonga match will be played at Casey Fields with a range of initiatives to be announced in the lead-up to the game, which will give members and supporters of both clubs the chance to donate to the cause.</p>
