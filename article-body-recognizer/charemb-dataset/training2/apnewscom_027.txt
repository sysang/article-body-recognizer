<div><div><h1>New Year’s Day Rose Parade set to go despite virus surge </h1></div><div>December 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The New Year’s Day Rose Parade and Rose Bowl college football game between Ohio State and Utah remained on track Friday despite surging cases of COVID-19, which forced the cancellation of the 2021 parade.</p>
<p>The 133rd edition of the Pasadena, California, tradition was scheduled to feature actor Levar Burton as grand marshal, 20 marching bands, 18 equestrian units and dozens of floats reflecting the theme of “Dream. Believe. Achieve.”</p>
<p>In a change due to soaring infections, Kaiser Permanente said its float, “A Healthier Future,” would not have 20 “front-line medical heroes” riding or walking alongside.</p>
<p>“We must prioritize the health and safety of our front-line medical staff and ensure we are able to treat patients during this recent surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the omicron variant,” the health care network said. </p>
<p>Spectators planning on camping out overnight were allowed to begin staking out spots along sidewalks at noon Friday. Pasadena authorities urged people to wear masks and avoid mingling with anyone outside their own groups. </p>
<p>Ticketholders for parade bleachers and the Rose Bowl game will be required to show proof of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours, and masks will be required for everyone age 2 and up, the Tournament of Roses Association said.</p>

<div><div><h1>Betty White, an ageless TV star, was America’s sweetheart</h1></div><div>By FRAZIER MOOREDecember 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Betty White was America’s naughty sweetheart.</p>
<p>With a wholesome smile and a dirty joke she charmed millions of viewers decade after decade, rising from $50-a-week to ageless superstar who advised her fans, “Don’t try to be young. Just open your mind.”</p>
<p>It helped that she only needed four hours of sleep each night.</p>
<p>White, who died Friday at 99 just weeks before her birthday, launched her TV career when the medium was still in its infancy and never lost touch. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Images of chaos: AP photographers capture US Capitol riot</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<p>But all that proved to be only a warmup for even greater stardom in the new millennium when White’s stardom erupted, by public demand, as it never had before.</p>
<p>In a Snickers commercial that premiered during the 2010 Super Bowl telecast, she impersonated an energy-sapped dude getting tackled during a backlot football game.</p>
<p>“Mike, you’re playing like Betty White out there,” sneered one of his chums. White, knocked flat on the ground and covered in mud, fired back, “That’s not what your girlfriend said!”</p>
<p>But once again, White worked her magic. The salty Elka Ostrovsky became a key part of the series, which became an instant hit.</p>
<p>Then she was voted the Entertainer of the Year by members of The Associated Press. “It’s ridiculous,” scoffed White, self-deprecating, at the honor. </p>
<p>“They haven’t caught on to me, and I hope they never do.”</p>
<p>One thing that made White seem forever young was her skill at playing bawdy or naughty while still radiating niceness.</p>
<p>The horror spoof “Lake Placid” and the comedy “The Proposal” were marked by her characters’ surprisingly salty language. Her character Catherine Piper killed a man with a skillet on “Boston Legal.”</p>
<p>But CBS casting head Ethel Winant declared White the logical choice. Originally planned as a one-shot appearance, the role of Sue Ann lasted until Moore ended the series in 1977. </p>
<p>White made comic hay as Sue Ann, for instance with a line explaining that she planned to spend Christmas with a sister in Florida: “She’s kind of a creep,” Sue Ann noted sweetly, “but she’s got a pool.”</p>
<p>The role brought her two Emmys as supporting actress in a comedy series.</p>
<p>White played Rose, a gentle, dim-bulb widow who managed to misinterpret most situations. She drove her housemates crazy with off-the-wall tales of her childhood in the fictional backwoods town of St. Olaf, Minnesota</p>
<p>For example, Rose’s explanation of the annual talent show, which was highlighted by a herring juggling act:</p>
<p>“Somebody actually juggled herring?” her friends asked skeptically.</p>
<p>“No!” Rose corrected them. “It was the herring that did the juggling: tiny little Ginseng knives.”</p>
<p>That role won her another Emmy, and she reprised it in a short-lived spinoff, “The Golden Palace.” </p>
<p>“Just Men” brought her a daytime Emmy, while she won a fourth prime-time Emmy in 1996 for a guest shot on “The John Larroquette Show.”</p>
<p>She also appeared in numerous miniseries and TV movies and made her film debut as a U.S. senator in Otto Preminger’s 1962 Capitol Hill drama “Advise and Consent.”</p>
<p>She was born Betty Marion White in 1922 in Oak Park, Illinois, and moved to Los Angeles when she was a toddler.</p>
<p>Her early ambition was to be a writer, and she wrote her grammar school graduation play, giving herself the leading role.</p>
<p>At Beverly Hills High School, her ambition turned to acting, and she appeared in several school plays. Her parents hoped she’d go to college, but instead she took roles in a small theater company and played bit parts in radio dramas.</p>
<p>Then in 1949, she was hired for a local daytime TV show starring Al Jarvis, the best-known disc jockey in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It was then that she got a tip to start lying about her age.</p>

<p>“I did that show 5½ hours a day, six days a week, for 4½ years,” she recalled in 1975. Jarvis was replaced by actor Eddie Albert, and when he went to Europe for the film “Roman Holiday,” she headed the show.</p>
<p>That was in 1961, and the next year, while touring in summer theater during television’s off-season, she starred with Ludden — by then a widower with three children — in the comedy “Critic’s Choice.” </p>
<p>White, who had claimed to be “militantly single” since a marriage in the late 1940s, weakened in her resolve. </p>
<p>The marriage lasted from 1963 until his death from cancer in 1981.</p>
<p>Her devotion to pets was such that she declined a plum role in the hit 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” She objected to a scene in which Jack Nicholson drops a small dog down a laundry chute.</p>

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic isn’t stopping Nashville from hosting its annual New Year’s Eve bash, but it has wrought some last minute changes to the concert lineup. </p>
<p>The Nashville Convention and Visitors Corporation, which is organizing the New Year’s Eve show airing live on CBS and Paramount+, said in a statement that Sam Hunt, the Zac Brown Band and Elle King will not be performing Friday night.</p>
<p>Neither Hunt nor King immediately released a statement explaining their absences.</p>
<div><div><h1>Betty White, TV’s Golden Girl, dies at 99</h1></div><div>By LYNN ELBER and FRAZIER MOORE December 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>White’s death was confirmed Friday by Jeff Witjas, her longtime agent and friend. She would have turned 100 on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>“I truly never thought she was going to pass away,” Witjas told The Associated Press. “She meant the world to me as a friend. She was the most positive person I’ve ever known.”</p>
<p>Witjas said White had been staying close to her Los Angeles home during the pandemic out of caution but had no diagnosed illness. It was unclear if she died Thursday night or Friday, he said.</p>
<p>Her death brought tributes from celebrities and politicians alike.</p>
<p>“We loved Betty White,” first lady Jill Biden said as she and President Joe Biden left a restaurant in Wilmington, Delaware. Added the president: “Ninety-nine years old. As my mother would say, ‘God love her.’”</p>
<p>“She was great at defying expectation,” Ryan Reynolds, who starred alongside her in the comedy “The Proposal,” tweeted. “She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty.”</p>
<p>But it was in 2010 that White’s stardom erupted as never before.</p>
<p>In a Snickers commercial that premiered during that year’s Super Bowl telecast, she impersonated an energy-sapped dude getting tackled during a backlot football game.</p>
<p>“Mike, you’re playing like Betty White out there,” jeered one of his chums. White, flat on the ground and covered in mud, fired back, “That’s not what your girlfriend said!”</p>
<p>But White stole the show, and the salty Elka Ostrovsky became a key part of the series, an immediate hit. She was voted the Entertainer of the Year by members of The Associated Press.</p>
<p>“It’s ridiculous,” White said of the honor. “They haven’t caught on to me, and I hope they never do.”</p>
<p>By then, White had not only become the hippest star around, but also a role model for how to grow old joyously.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to be young,” she told The AP. “Just open your mind. Stay interested in stuff. There are so many things I won’t live long enough to find out about, but I’m still curious about them.”</p>
<p>In a People cover story on White’s upcoming 100th birthday, the magazine’s Jan. 10 issue touted White’s secrets for longevity and quoted her as saying, “Funny never gets old.”</p>
<p>Witjas said it was as if Betty insisted on a last laugh: “It’s a wonderful tribute, and she has to pull this.”</p>
<p>“We will go forward with our plans to show the film on Jan. 17 in hopes our film will provide a way for all who loved her to celebrate her life — and experience what made her such a national treasure,” they said in a statement.</p>
<p>“While she’s icky-sweet on her cooking show, Sue is really a piranha type,” White once said. The role brought her two Emmys as supporting actress in a comedy series.</p>
<p>White played Rose, a gentle, dim widow who managed to misinterpret most situations. She drove her roommates crazy with off-the-wall tales of childhood in fictional St. Olaf, Minnesota, an off-kilter version of Lake Wobegon.</p>
<p>The role won her another Emmy, and she reprised it in a short-lived spinoff, “The Golden Palace.”</p>
<p>After her co-star Arthur died in 2009, White told “Entertainment Tonight”: “She showed me how to be very brave in playing comedy. I’ll miss that courage.”</p>
<p>“Just Men” brought her a daytime Emmy, while she won a fourth prime time Emmy in 1996 for a guest shot on “The John Larroquette Show.”</p>
<p>She also appeared in numerous miniseries and TV movies and made her film debut as a female U.S. senator in Otto Preminger’s 1962 Capitol Hill drama “Advise and Consent.”</p>
<p>White began her television career as $50-a-week sidekick to a local Los Angeles TV personality in 1949. She was hired for a local daytime show starring Al Jarvis, the best-known disc jockey in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It was then she got a tip to start lying about her age.</p>
<p>“I was born in 1922. So I thought, ‘I must always remember that I was born in 1926.’ But then I would have to do the math. Finally, I decided to heck with it.”</p>
<p>White proved to be a natural for the new medium. She was bright, pretty and likable, with a dimpled, eye-crinkling smile. A 1951 Los Angeles Times headline said: “Betty White Hailed as TV’s Busiest Gal.”</p>

<p>White, who had claimed to be “militantly single” since a 1947-1949 marriage, weakened in her resolve.</p>
<p>The marriage lasted from 1963 until his death from cancer in 1981.</p>
<p>Her devotion to pets was such that she declined a plum role in the hit 1997 movie “As Good As It Gets.” She objected to a scene in which Jack Nicholson drops a small dog down a laundry chute.</p>
<p>Are there any critters she doesn’t like?</p>
<p>“No,” White told the AP. “Anything with a leg on each corner.”</p>
<p>“Ohhh, I LOVE snakes!”</p>
<p>She was born Betty Marion White in Oak Park, Illinois, and the family moved to Los Angeles when she was a toddler.</p>
<p>Her early ambition was to be a writer, and she wrote her grammar school graduation play, giving herself the leading role.</p>
<p>At Beverly Hills High School, her ambition turned to acting, and she appeared in several school plays. Her parents hoped she’d go to college, but instead she took roles in a small theater and played bit parts in radio dramas.</p>
<p>Explaining in 2011 how she kept up her frantic pace even as an octogenarian, she explained that she only needed four hours of sleep each night.</p>
<p>And when asked how she had managed to be universally beloved during her decades-spanning career, she summed up with a dimpled smile: “I just make it my business to get along with people so I can have fun. It’s that simple.”</p>

<p>Her role as “Happy Homemaker” Sue Anne Nivens in “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” which was already a huge hit, was planned as a one-off appearance in 1973, but it would last until the show ended in 1977.</p>
<p>“While she’s icky-sweet on her cooking show, Sue is really a piranha type,” White once said. The role brought her two Emmys as supporting actress in a comedy series.</p>

<p>A sketch she had done with Jarvis turned into a syndicated series, “Life With Elizabeth,” which won her first Emmy. </p>
<p>Off-screen, White tirelessly raised money for animal causes, hosting a syndicated TV show and writing three books on her animal love, which she said stemmed from her family taking care of as many as 15 dogs at a time during the Depression. </p>

<div><div><h1>Tony Blair, Daniel Craig join scientists on UK Honors List</h1></div><div>By SYLVIA HUIJanuary 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II also made former Prime Minister Tony Blair a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry.</p>
<p>In total, the Honors List recognized more than 1,200 people in the U.K. this year, including scientists, actors, politicians, Olympic athletes and people who worked to raise funds for charities.</p>
<p>Craig, who made his final outing as 007 in the blockbuster “No Time to Die,” was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George -- the same honor given to the fictional Bond -- for his services to film and theater.</p>
<p>The title is often given to diplomats, and Bond was described as holding it in the film franchise and the books by Ian Fleming. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in entertainment, veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave is to be made a dame, while former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, known as Mel B, was recognized for her work with domestic violence charity Women’s Aid.</p>
<p>In sport, 19-year-old U.S. Open champion Raducanu becomes an MBE, or a Member of the Order of the British Empire. </p>
<p>“This year has been full of amazing surprises for me so to end 2021 with this appointment is very special,” Raducanu said. </p>
<p>Other athletes who were awarded included Olympic champion cyclists Jason Kenny and his wife Laura, diver Tom Daley and swimmer Adam Peaty. </p>
<p>The knighthood given to Blair, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007, was separate from the main list because it was decided by the queen and made without government advice.</p>
<p>The queen also appointed two others to the Order of the Garter: Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Baroness Valerie Amos, a Labour member of the House of Lords, who will become the first black person to be appointed to the order. </p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — New York City welcomed the new year — and bid good riddance to 2021 — as confetti and cheers spread across Times Square as a New Year’s Eve tradition returned to a city beleaguered by a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Last year’s ball drop was closed to the public because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>As the ball dropped and euphoria filled the streets, Maya Scharm, a dog trainer visiting from New Jersey, felt 2021 slide away.</p>
<p>“It’s symbolic of getting back to normal,” she said, just minutes after the stroke of midnight.</p>
<p>Mary Gonzalez stood a few feet behind a crowd, wanting to keep her distance from anyone unwittingly carrying the virus. </p>
<p>The annual ball drop took place as the clock ticked into midnight and ushered in the new year, an occasion usually commemorated with the uncorking of Champagne, clinking of pints, joyous embraces and renewed hope for better times ahead. </p>
<p>Times Square is often referred to as the crossroads of the world, and city officials insisted on holding the marquee New Year’s Eve event to demonstrate the city’s resiliency even amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. </p>
<p>But 2022 begins just as the year prior began — with the pandemic clouding an already uncertain future.</p>
<p>Doubts swirled about whether the city would have to cancel this year’s bash, as the city posted record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the days leading to it, even as some cities like Atlanta had decided to cancel their own celebrations.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Final goodbye: Recalling influential people who died in 2021</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Supply shortages and emboldened workers: A changed economy </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Sports returned in 2021, but not the way we remembered them</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Rap artist and actor LL Cool J was supposed to be among the performers taking the stage in Times Square on Friday night, but announced he would pull out of the event because he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>But Mayor Bill de Blasio, who relinquished oversight of the nation’s most populous city at the stroke of midnight, said the festivities at Times Square would “show the world that New York City is fighting our way through this.”</p>
<p>New York City’s incoming mayor, Eric Adams, <a>took his oath in Times Square</a> soon after the ball drop. He made a brief appearance earlier on the main stage to affirm the city’s resiliency.</p>
<p>That hopeful sentiment was shared by ordinary people.</p>
<p>“I look back and I see it as a sort of a stressful year, but it wasn’t a terrible year,” said Lynn Cafarchio, who braved the crowds to attend the festivities with her husband Pete.</p>
<p>A New York City tour guide, she was unemployed for a spell as the economy was shuttered and tourism tanked.</p>
<p>“We’re standing here glad that 2021 will soon be over,” she said, “but really positive about next year.”</p>
<p>Even if the crowds were considerably smaller, people gathered across block after block to witness the ball drop.</p>
<p>Nursing student Ashley Ochoa and her boyfriend, Jose Avelar, traveled from the central valley of California specifically to be at Times Square. </p>
<p>“COVID did hold a lot of stuff back for me,” Ochoa said, “but I mean, I’m here today, so that’s what I’m thankful for.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Actor Sam Waterston to kick off annual Moby-Dick Marathon</h1></div><div>January 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) — This year’s Moby-Dick Marathon, the annual cover-to-cover reading of Herman Melville’s iconic man-versus whale novel hosted by the New Bedford Whaling Museum, kicks off on Jan. 7.</p>
<p>The nonstop reading, again a virtual event this year, takes about 25 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Although this is his first time at the museum, Waterston is a Melville aficionado who once read the part of Ishmael in a 2001 celebration of the 150th anniversary of “Moby-Dick” at Tanglewood.</p>
<p>The marathon, which has been held since 1997, ends Sunday Jan. 9. </p>
<p>Several other interactive virtual events are also scheduled.</p>
<div><div><h1>New Year’s Rose Parade marches on despite COVID-19 surge</h1></div><div>January 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The 133rd edition of the Pasadena, California, tradition on Saturday featured actor LeVar Burton as grand marshal, 20 bands, 18 equestrian units and dozens of floats reflecting the theme of “Dream. Believe. Achieve.”</p>
<p>After days of record-smashing rains, there were sunny skies for the 8 a.m. start of the spectacle, which has an uncanny history of postcard weather.</p>
<p>LeAnn Rimes kicked off the event with a performance of “Throw My Arms Around the World” followed by a military flyover of a B-2 stealth bomber. </p>
<p>The parade and the afternoon Rose Bowl football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Utah Utes remained on track despite an explosion of COVID-19 infections in Los Angeles County, where daily new cases topped 27,000 on Friday.</p>
<p>The county Department of Public Health said it was the highest number of new cases. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Insurrection prompts year of change for US Capitol Police</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jan. 6 attack posed loyalty test for Indiana Rep. Greg Pence</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Trump cancels Florida press conference scheduled for Jan. 6</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The soaring infections had already prompted Kaiser Permanente to announce that its float, “A Healthier Future,” would not have 20 “front-line medical heroes” riding or walking alongside.</p>
<p>“We must prioritize the health and safety of our front-line medical staff and ensure we are able to treat patients during this recent surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the omicron variant,” the health care network said.</p>
<p>The crowd was smaller than in previous years, but the parade still drew thousands of fans along its 5.5-mile (8.8-kilometer) route. Many camped out on sidewalks overnight, staking out their spots in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>Pasadena authorities urged people to wear masks, upgrading to the N95 or KN95 types, and avoid mingling with anyone outside their own groups. Many attendees wore face coverings, as did Rose Parade Queen Nadia Chung and her court.</p>
<p>The Tournament of Roses Association said ticketholders for parade bleachers and the Rose Bowl game were required to show proof of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours, and masks were required for everyone age 2 and up.</p>
<p>The 2021 Rose Parade was canceled months ahead of time. The Rose Bowl football game was played after being moved to Arlington, Texas. </p>
<p>Previously, the parade was canceled for several years during World War II and the 1942 Rose Bowl game was played in North Carolina after the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<div><div><h1>New hi-tech photo brings Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ up close </h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>AMSTERDAM (AP) — Rembrandt van Rijn’s iconic and huge painting “The Night Watch” is now also a supersized museum photo delivered right to your laptop in unsurpassed detail. </p>
<p>The real canvas measures 379.5 x 453.5 centimeters (149.4 x178.5 inches) canvas and each pixel represents 5 micrometers or 0.005 square millimeters. </p>
<p>Apart from simply showing the dazzling detail, it will also help researchers restore the work and assess its aging process over time. </p>
<p>The oil-on-canvas painting depicts a group of Amsterdam civil militia and shows off Rembrandt’s renowned use of light and composition to create a dynamic scene filled with characters.</p>
<p>The painting has undergone many restorations over its existence. It was placed on its present wooden stretcher in 1975. Once the painting has been re-stretched, the museum will decide whether further restoration work is needed. </p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Hospitals aren’t usually incubators of great music, but in the case of English indie-pop band Glass Animals, one member’s medical emergency led to a breakout album and a Grammy nomination.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>

<p>“‘Dreamland’ was made before we ever knew about COVID-19, but it was born in period of personal turbulence for Dave and the band — in the wake of Joe’s accident,” says Amy Morgan, the band’s manager.</p>
<p>“‘Heat Waves,’ for example, is a very personal love song about loss, but it connected because I think it captures a very universal sense of loss — which is at the forefront of all of our hearts at the moment, sadly.”</p>
<p>Bayley believes some of the success of the album is due to the pandemic. Finding the future bleak, many listeners looked for comfort in the past — like he had done back in the hospital. </p>
<p>He didn’t want to put it on the album. He played it for the rest of the band, who quickly insisted it be on the album. Fans later wrote letters saying how much the song meant to them and that gave Bayley courage to turn more inward.</p>
<p>“We had to completely rethink everything. And in a way, it kind of made us really open-minded,” says Bailey. “No one during the Spanish flu left a handbook of how to release an album in a pandemic.”</p>

<p>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — Sky Sports News has been dropped from U.S. television following the shutdown of the NBC Sports Network.</p>
<p>Premier League highlights are often broadcast on SSN, and Fox no longer had the rights to show those clips.</p>
<p>NBC Sports said Monday that SSN is not currently on its broadcast or streaming schedule.</p>
<div><div><h1>Judge sets Jan. 28 for ‘Tiger King’ Joe Exotic resentencing</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A federal judge in Oklahoma on Monday set a Jan. 28 date for the resentencing of “Tiger King” Joe Exotic. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Palk set the resentencing for 10 a.m. and granted the defendant’s request to be transported to Oklahoma City for the hearing.</p>
<p>Maldonado-Passage, who maintains his innocence, also was sentenced for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs and falsifying wildlife records.</p>
<a>delaying cancer treatment</a> until after his resentencing. Maldonado-Passage
<a>announced in November</a> that he has prostate cancer, and he was
<a>transferred</a> from a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas, to a federal medical center in Butner, North Carolina.
<p>Jeffrey and Lauren Lowe, who are former friends of Maldonado-Passage, also agreed in a Dec. 23 consent decree filed in federal court in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to never again exhibit animals.</p>
<p>Federal agents seized the 97 endangered animals, including 68 big cats and a jaguar, from Tiger King Park in Thackerville, Oklahoma, in two seizures last May and August. Federal officials accused the Lowes of harming and harassing the animals.</p>

<p>When you see a nice handmade sweater, you know it took a while to make.</p>
<p>The knitting or crocheting is just part of it. (A fun online calculator at www.lovecrafts.com estimates how long anything from a basic scarf to a blanket, baby booties or patterned garment would take you; figure on 20 to 80 hours.) </p>
<p>Before that, however, there are those who make the yarns. Indie craftspeople are doing new things with wool and other fibers, including recycled plastic, as well as with dyes. </p>

<li><div><a><h4>Crafts: Indie makers get creative with yarns, dyes</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Why are so many vaccinated people getting COVID-19 lately?</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Myrhe has a good group of reliable, “stable” colors, but also what the indie dye world refers to as OOAKs: One of a Kinds. </p>
<p>“The magic of what the dye gods give me that day,” she says.</p>
<p>Different fibers take dye in different ways. Alpaca hues tends toward pastel, as it doesn’t absorb as much color. Nylon and silk soak up dye, and when blended with merino wool, give beautiful color depth.</p>
<p>Some dyers are exploring other types of wool, including yak, cashmere, and Australian Polwarth sheep, which has a strong, silky character good for many woven projects.</p>
<p>Her soft, chunky yarns include Color Core, in which she spins ethically sourced merino wool around a colorful organic cotton fiber; the result looks like a woolly Twizzler. Alm came up with the idea during the pandemic.</p>
<p>With her Washington State mill partners — a mother-daughter team who also raise a few alpacas — she developed seven Color Core colorways.</p>
<p>Love Fest also has a naturally shed, downy yak yarn called kullu, which feels like cashmere, without the sheep shearing. </p>
<p>Sustainable options for yarn now also include upcycled linen and plastic fiber.</p>
<p>“I grew up crocheting and knitting so much polyester and acrylic yarn; it seemed such a shame that more recycled materials weren’t being utilized,” says Alm. </p>
<a>Red Hill Fiber Mill</a> in Taswell, Indiana, which raises alpacas, gives educational tours, and spins and sells yarns and wool products gleaned from their herd. Lydia Christiansen’s
<a>Abundant Earth Fiber,</a> on Whidbey Island north of Seattle, includes wool spun from East Friesian sheep that graze just down the road from her mill.
<a>Vivid Wool</a> outside Reykjavik, Iceland;
<a>Wishbone</a> yarns in South Africa, and
<a>The Blue Brick</a> in Ontario, Canada.
<p>The company <a>Yarnspirations</a> has developed a new format for the yarn ball itself – a Lifesaver-shaped ring called an O’Go that it says is less prone to tangles. O’Go is available under various brands and in a range of colors.</p>
<p>Myrhe and Alm say indie-made dyes and yarns tell stories that make a knitted piece feel more precious to its wearer.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed the lawsuit of a 30-year-old man who alleged that the image of him nude as a 4-month-old on the 1991 cover of Nirvana’s “Nevermind” album is child pornography. </p>
