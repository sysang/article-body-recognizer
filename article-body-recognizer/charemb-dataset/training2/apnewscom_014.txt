<a>talked of being deeply shaken by their experience</a>, recalling viscerally the sights and sounds amid the chaos.
<p>And most indelibly, the loud clap of a gunshot, reverberating across the cavernous chamber. </p>
<p>“I’ve heard a lot of gunshots in my time, and it was very clear what that was,” Crow said. “I knew that things had severely escalated.”</p>
<a>Ashli Babbitt</a>, a Trump supporter from California who was trying to crawl through the broken window of a door that leads to the House chamber. Both the Justice Department and Capitol Police investigated the shooting and
<a>declined to file charges</a>.
<p>While the gunshot dispersed some of the violent mob, the lawmakers ducking in the gallery believed the worst was just beginning.</p>
<a>lies about election fraud</a> that were
<a>“fight like hell.”</a>
<a>“Hang Mike Pence”</a> as they forced their way into the Capitol, brutally overpowering police who stood in their way. Dozens were injured, some seriously, and four officers who were there that day later took their own lives.
<p>She shuddered when police said there had been a “breach” of the building. </p>
<p>She says she told a colleague sheltering with her in the gallery: “Just remember, we’re on the right side of history. If we all die today, another group will come in and certify those ballots.”</p>
<p>Congress reconvened that night, certifying Biden’s election victory before sunrise. </p>
<p>In the days after the attack, many of the lawmakers who were in the gallery started connecting on a text message chain. It quickly evolved into therapeutic group sessions and even potluck gatherings where they tried to make sense of it all. </p>
<p>They dubbed themselves “the gallery group,” and the name stuck. </p>
<p>“We were the last people in the chamber,” said Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former Navy helicopter pilot. “I think we saw the whole thing play out in a way that is very different from anybody else on the Hill.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers said the gallery group has been a refuge through it all.</p>
<p>The rioters were just inches from the doors of the gallery. </p>
<p>As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Himes says he spends a lot of time in high-security spaces — and before Jan. 6, he had assumed the Capitol was one of them. </p>
<p>“It was as though you were watching water flow uphill,” Himes said. “Something that you imagined was impossible is happening right in front of your eyes.” </p>
<p>Kuster says that one of the most traumatic things for her was not being able to see what was happening outside the chamber. They could only hear “the noises of the threat — the pounding on the door, the shouting in the hallways.”</p>
<p>When she made it home two days later, she watched hours of video from the insurrection, including harrowing footage from the police battles outside the building. It only compounded the trauma. </p>
<p>“I remember my husband coming in, and I was just sobbing,” Kuster said. “And he was holding me, saying, ‘I don’t know if this is the best thing for you to see.’”</p>
<p>“But we have to — we have to acknowledge the reality of what happened that day. And what’s challenging for us is that we are both victims and witnesses to the crime on our country.”</p>
