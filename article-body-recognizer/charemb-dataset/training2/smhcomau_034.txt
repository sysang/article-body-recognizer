<div>The surprising art show that came from a polluted harbour cave</div>
<p>How full of weathered and storm-tossed polystyrene can a water-level cave on Sydney Harbour get?</p>
<p>The answer is “jam packed”, according to two artists in residence at Q Station, the former quarantine station on North Head at Manly.</p>
<p>Jane Gillings and Lucy Barker found the cave while exploring Q Station when their residency, in the old weatherboard doctors’ and nurses’ living quarters, started last March.</p>
<p>The artists crawled into the shallow cave on their stomachs, raked out the detritus and hauled it up the cliff in nets and bags. “We got very good at being filthy,” Gillings said.</p>
<p>The tumbled fragments of polystyrene that began life as bodyboards, buoys, coolers and consumer packaging will go on view at Q Station later this month in an exhibition of work by the two artists called Poly.glut.</p>
<p>Gillings, of Avoca, and Barker, of Wahroonga, made objects from the polystyrene and other ocean garbage and created two rooms resembling the private quarters of a 19th-century amateur naturalist.</p>
<p>There’s a bust of a Rococo gentleman in robes, a cabinet of fossils, a judge’s wig, and a faux Grecian urn depicting a runner with a takeaway coffee cup. All are made from polystyrene and other found materials.</p>
<p>One sculpture was inspired by Pompeii, but the artists imagined the huddled figure had been buried in an onslaught of waste rather than volcanic ash.</p>
<p>In a discovery room, visitors will be able to handle various objects and see how weathered polystyrene can look uncannily like sea urchins or loaves of sourdough bread.</p>
<p>There’s a piece of black yoga mat that’s been pecked by birds. Birds that swallow ocean plastics such as polystyrene are known to die of starvation because they assuage their hunger without ingesting nutrients.</p>
<p>One of the polystyrene art objects resembles a fragment of an ancient mosaic. Keneally was reminded of the Roman mosaic he saw in Chichester Cathedral, except that one wasn’t bearing the logo of a popular hamburger chain.</p>
<p>“A staggering 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans each year and plastic dumped in one region can travel and impact others. This is a global disaster that requires a global response,” Noble said.</p>
<p>The global problem of ocean waste is a shared passion for Gillings and Barker, who both make art from consumer discards and are regular exhibitors in Sculpture by the Sea and elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We work in a similar style – eclectic and materials based,” Gillings said.</p>
<p>Gillings said the views of the harbour from Q Station are deceptively pristine. “It’s just crazy that [the ocean-borne pollution] is all still out there,” she said.</p>
<p>Will the cave that yielded so much art material fill up with waste again? “Oh yeah, I expect it to be full again now,” Gillings said.</p>
<p>Apart from polystyrene, the artists salvaged coal, tennis balls, bits of glass and other discards that made their way into the art objects.</p>
<p>Poly.glut might have a longer shelf life than just at Q Station. The artists plan to enter the installation in various art prizes, and hope it will be shown in regional galleries.</p>
<p>Poly.glut opens at Q Station on Saturday, January 22. An exhibition of sculptures rejected from Sculpture by the Sea is on at Q Station now until the end of January. Entry to both exhibitions is free.</p>
<div>Single page from Spider-Man comic sets auction record</div>
<p>A single page of artwork from a 1984 Spider-Man comic book sold at auction last week for a record $US3.36 million ($4.7m).</p>
<p>The record bidding, which started at $US330,000 and soared past $US3 million, came on the first day of Heritage Auctions’ four-day comic event in Dallas on Thursday.</p>
<p>The previous record for an interior page of a US comic book was $US657,250 for art from a 1974 issue of The Incredible Hulk that featured a tease for the first appearance of Wolverine.</p>
<p>The same day one of the few surviving copies of Superman’s debut, Action Comics No. 1, sold for $US3.18 million, putting it among the priciest books ever auctioned.</p>
<p>It set a new record for Superman comics despite being graded just six out of ten for its condition: the cover was marked with a rocket stamp by its original owner when he was 13.</p>
<p>But Spider-Man still holds the record for a comic book at auction with his debut issue, the 1962 Amazing Fantasy No. 15, fetching $US3.6 million sale at Heritage last September.</p>
<p>None of the sellers or buyers of the latest auction were identified.</p>

<p>Jagged Little Pill ★★★½Comedy Theatre</p>
<p>With so much of the city in a kind of Clayton’s lockdown, the show must go on. Besides, this is Alanis Morissette we’re talking about. Her music has staying power.</p>

<div>Not throwing away their shot: Hamilton cast ready for Melbourne move</div>
<p>Jason Arrow says it feels like he’s experienced about 18 first nights of Hamilton’s Australian season in less than a year.</p>
<p>“I think the audience is just as excited as we are to actually be back doing what we love.”</p>
<p>And there’s another big night coming soon. In just over a month the show will close its doors at Sydney’s Lyric Theatre, ahead of a March 15 premiere at Her Majesty’s in Melbourne.</p>
<p>All 10 named-role performers from the show that premiered in Sydney in March last year are coming to open the Melbourne season, the company confirmed this week.</p>
<p>“It can be tumultuous, it can be harrowing and challenging,” Watts says. “But the gift of the show is that it gives back to you. As much as you let yourself lean into the show, and let the show hold you, it will reward you.”</p>
<p>Zuel agrees. Before they go out for each performance they pull the cast into a tight circle - a circle that is different almost every night as COVID or fatigue take their toll and understudies swing in and out – and hug each other.</p>
<p>“But even still to this day it takes me a few songs to find the ground and feel like I’m not floating in the air from nerves and excitement,” she says.</p>
<p>Arrow says from the moment he says “Hamilton”, he knows the “vibe” of the show. It’s a beat where he and the audience take each other in, and new beginning for both.</p>
<p>“It’s a show that’s heavily reliant on more than one person. Everyone is doing everything they can to get the show going, and keep it going.”</p>
<p>The Melbourne move will see some turnover among the 35-strong cast, with five new ensemble performers arriving including three from Melbourne.</p>
<p>Tickets are on sale through to the end of July. Producer Michael Cassel has said he intends to take the musical back to Sydney in 2023.</p>

<div>Tweet of the dead: The celebrities who keep posting from beyond the grave</div>
<p>Admittedly, I was a little spooked when I read author Jackie Collins’ happy new year tweet, especially given she’s been dead for over six years.</p>
<p>Jackie Collins is in good company when it comes to the posthumous social media lives of our dearly departed celebrities – I also follow Elizabeth Taylor, Prince and Michael Jackson on various platforms.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is one of the more perverse byproducts of social media and modern-day celebrity that even after death they can continue to enjoy a life – albeit a virtual one – in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Like most of the accounts for dead celebrities, it is run by his estate, and the tweets are signed off with Team PW, but still, it does seem a little creepy.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson’s Twitter account is still constantly updating its 2.3 million followers, even making grisly boasts about just how popular the King Of Pop remains 12 years after he died.</p>
<p>Amy Winehouse died in 2011, but her Twitter account still carries the “verified” blue tick and shares her music on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Joan Rivers, who died in 2014, is apparently still cracking jokes, via Twitter, in between sharing patriotic 4th of July posts and “Throw Back Thursday” memories, which appear to be curated by her daughter Melissa.</p>
<p>While Twitter allows a dead person’s estate to deactivate an account, it doesn’t require an account to be suspended once someone has died – famous or otherwise.</p>
<p>Elvis Presley died in 1977, but he managed – or at least his estate did – to join Twitter in 2008.</p>
<p>Elvis’s Yule Log is still burning on Youtube well after Christmas, and had clocked up 168,000 views when I last looked a few days ago.</p>
<p>The account took on an entirely new life after Bowie’s death, and today boasts 1.9million followers lapping up its updates five years after he died.</p>
<p>The popularity of Bowie’s Instagram account is a good measure of just how relevant his music remains.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bowie’s posthumous social media “footprint” from beyond the grave would have played a pivotal role in negotiations recently over the sale of his back catalogue of music to Warner Music for a staggering $344 million.</p>
<p>And so, it would appear that in 2022 death is no longer an obstacle when it comes to celebrity adoration, and just like so much of modern celebritydom, we can thank social media for it.</p>
<div>‘Seven-foot frame, rats along on his back’: The Encanto soundtrack has taken over my life</div>

<p>But, of course, it’s not just Bruno (no, no, no) - the whole Encanto album, featuring eight tunes penned by Miranda, has quickly claimed rent-free tenancy in my head.</p>
<p>Then there’s Diane Guerrero’s What Else Can I Do?, a Shakira-esque rock ballad of self-determination featuring a delightfully Latin-ised pronunciation of “jacarandas”, that’s similarly been creeping up the pop charts.</p>
<p>Of course, the ubiquity of Disney hits is not a new phenomenon - households with slightly older children are no doubt still living the Let It Go (or, for the true heads, Love is an Open Door), experience of 2013’s Frozen.</p>
<p>Now, somehow, I’m a relative expert on Disney deep-cuts.</p>
<p>And in any case, All of You is really starting to grow on me.</p>

<div>‘It’s an absolute spin-out’: The Wiggles, somehow, edge towards Hottest 100 glory</div>
<p>Lachlan Gillespie, better known to your kids as Lachy the Purple Wiggle, can’t quite believe it. A week out from Triple J’s Hottest 100 and The Wiggles are currently favourites to top the countdown. With a Tame Impala cover, no less.</p>
<p>“It’s bizarre, it’s just been this amazingly popular thing,” Gillespie, 36, says. “In the end, it’s been a special experience for all of us.”</p>
<p>“It’s an absolute spin-out,” laughs Blue Wiggle Field, 58. “It’s not something we ever thought would happen. But we really did do the song out of love.”</p>
<p>Suffice to say, Tame Impala wasn’t dominating The Wiggles’ listening habits before they tackled the tune.</p>
<p>“As soon as we heard Elephant, it seemed a good fit. The lyrics were semi-Wigglish; we have a few songs about elephants, too,” he laughs.</p>
<p>Gillespie’s pitch-perfect evocation of Parker’s vocals, not to mention his keytar solo, have been singled out among the cover’s highlights. But he initially underestimated the song’s deceptive complexity.</p>
<p>“It seemed quite straightforward. But then we actually went to rehearse it, and the phrasing and the timing of it - we were kind of blown away, he is an incredible musician,” he says of Parker.</p>
<p>Field says an early iteration of the cover was so respectful to the source material it led Webb to quip, “Sounds like a cover band. What’s Wiggly about it?” His solution? Bring in some Fruit Salad (yummy, yummy).</p>
<p>Bryce Mills, host of Triple J’s breakfast show which presents Like a Version, says the idea to get The Wiggles on was first suggested by a listener.</p>
<p>“I honestly didn’t think it’d happen, but when it did, I spent the whole day with a huge smile on my face,” he says.</p>
<p>Besides the next-gen incongruity, the mere existence of The Wiggles’ Elephant perhaps isn’t the outlier it seems.</p>
<p>Gillespie, meanwhile, is leaning into the band’s Hottest 100 hopes, if not for his own amusement then to honour The Wiggles’ original core - Greg and Murray and Jeff and Anthony - following the group’s 30th anniversary last year.</p>

<div>The man is music: why Neil Young will always be a star</div>
<p>Neil Young and I go back a ways. For half a century we’ve been walking down a one-way street. He’s been on one side, and I’ve been on the other. He’s never known I’ve been there, and that’s fine.</p>
<p>At the start, he’d release an album to the breeze and I’d scoop it up with my hands and tuck it under my arms, and on we walked. I’d take it on trust.</p>
<p>This year (2022) marks the 50th anniversary of Harvest, the record that catapulted Young into the orbit of stardom. It was the first of his albums that landed on the McFadyen record player.</p>
<p>If I had been less of a musical snob at 14, I now sigh, I might have bought singles, and if I had I might have owned the hidden gem that was Sugar Mountain. It had been the B side for a few singles, but also Heart of Gold.</p>
<p>Joni Mitchell wrote The Circle Game in response to it and it wouldn’t appear on an album until Young’s triple Decade in 1977.</p>
<p>Harvest propelled Young into the stratosphere of fame, multi-platinum sales accrued around the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even in the sunshine of the tunes there were shadows. It was anti-pop. It was the truth of the artist made real.</p></blockquote>
<p>His guide, however, often takes him down roads that truly stretch the faithful.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say there’s any circularity to Young’s oeuvre. He’s ploughed so many fields over his 60 years in the business that whatever the next crop of songs, it should equally bring no surprises.</p>
<div>Bored in lockdown? This couple recorded an album to stay busy</div>
<p>How would your relationship hold up under 14 days of hotel quarantine?</p>
<p>Rather than assemble a 3000-piece puzzle, they decided to stay busy “and avoid killing each other” by recording an album in the confines of their hotel room.</p>
<p>The couple met in Britain, when Barker became enmeshed in the music scene through bands, as a solo artist and composer for television and film. Her Cornwall-born husband Drinkwater is a producer and multi-instrumentalist.</p>
<p>They arrived at the Westin Hotel Perth on October 14 last year, their bus given a police escort, with an acoustic guitar and folding double bass. A friend dropped off microphone stands and a keyboard at the hotel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hotel quarantine rules, all guests paid the same price for their stay regardless of the hotel, so the entire 14-day stay was $3,300 inclusive of meals.</p>
<p>Their 10-track album, <i>Room 822, </i>is a bittersweet, tender and loving homage to Australian artists and the songs that held the most sentimental value for the couple.</p>
<p>Though they didn’t expressly ask for permission to record an album, there were several visits from nurses for COVID tests and daily phone calls with staff in which they chatted about what they were doing.</p>
<p>“When we arrived, there were various conversations and people responded in such a lovely way to it. I think people were quite amused … It was quite a nice, uplifting story within the hotel.”</p>
<p>The delicate acoustic guitar, sparse and melancholic, is almost hypnotic in its romantic, pared-back earnestness on Push The Sky Away.</p>
<p>They came to Push The Sky Away, after trawling the internet.</p>
<p><b>The band will perform on Sunday March 6</b><b> at Camelot Lounge in Marrickville.</b></p>

<div>The children’s show where making a mess is part of the fun</div>
<p>The idea for <i>Fluffy</i>, an interactive family show set in a cascading wonderland of mountainous shredded paper, came simply.</p>
<p>Part of Sydney Festival, <i>Fluffy</i> champions creative free-play for all ages on a large, immersive, hands-on set installed within Carriageworks.</p>
<p>Newman says <i>Fluffy’s</i> mix of theatre, visual art and confetti-filled playground will hopefully inspire hands-on creativity, a sense of awe and human connection.</p>
<p>Newman and Artbomb co-artistic director Curly Fernandez have observed how interactive arts and theatre-based projects aimed at families can often result in kids playing and parents and carers watching from the perimeter.</p>
<p>“We were interested in how art can actually bring different generations in the family together and discover something new about each other,” Fernandez says.</p>
<p>“The audience feel they can run amok. They have license to play, make their own creations and we want to see what they come up with.”</p>
<p>Artbomb are also keen to upend rules about creating mess and touching art, particularly for children whose impulse in a gallery space may be to stroke sculpture or brush a curious hand across paintings.</p>
<p>A cast of six performers help visitors navigate different creative experiences, including using double-sided tape to cover themselves in paper shreds.</p>
<i>Fluffy</i> in their own way, in their own time.”
<p>The show<i>,</i> which has a COVID-safe environment and includes relaxed sessions, also focuses on the recycling process. Audiences can bring their own paper for shredding and all paper used is donated to community compost sites.<b/></p>
<p>At the end of every day, Fluffy’s cast and crew must sweep away every shred of paper using leaf-blowers and enormous scissor brooms. Do audience members take paper to compost at home?<b/></p>
<p>“No they don’t,” Newman says. “But they can certainly walk away covered in fluff.”</p>
