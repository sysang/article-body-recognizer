<h2>A school report to fire-up any budding scientist</h2>
<p>SIR – My daughter’s school science report (<a>Letters, December 18</a>) read: “Katie can now light a Bunsen burner with no visible sign of terror.”</p>
<p>Richard HortonThurnham, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – My late partner always said that his finest prep-school report ended, “but his sewing does him credit”.</p>
<p>Vivien Gainsborough FootBury St Edmunds, Suffolk</p>
<p>SIR – Forty years ago, my son’s junior school music teacher commented: “He occasionally hits the right note by mistake.”</p>
<p>SIR – I once had a master who wrote of my geography: “Could do better.” Under history, which followed, he simply added: “See geography.”</p>
<p>Ashley PapeWimborne, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – The most memorable comment came from my son’s housemaster: “A ball and chain would make a very acceptable Christmas present for Mark.”</p>

<h2>‘New’ Highway Code echoes long-standing advice</h2>
<p>SIR – The proposed “changes” to the Highway Code (report, December 17)are not new, but are bringing the Code into line with the Department for Transport’s long-standing advice and guidance to cyclists.</p>
<p>Bikeability, the Government’s cycle training programme, advises cyclists to ride in the centre of the lane (not in the middle of the road). This is known as the primary position for cyclists; the secondary position is nearer the kerb.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 21 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – I wonder how many readers were infuriated by Sajid Javid’s article “We should respond early to omicron trends”.</p>
<p>He would have said that Dame Kate Bingham’s brilliant turbo-charged vaccination programme should have continued and that it should never have drifted back under NHS control.</p>
<p>Instead of congratulating his department for being the first to procure antivirals, he would have said that the procurement fell tragically short of what is needed and demanded a Bingham-style approach.</p>
<p>Terry HighamHaywards Heath, West Sussex</p>
<p>Dr Fiona UnderhillWoodford Green, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – A significant number of top footballers are evidently against Covid vaccinations. Their fans are expected to prove immunity to enter stadiums, so why are the players exempt?</p>
<p>Dr Martin ShutkeverPontefract, West Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – I was disgusted at Camilla Tominey’s <a>article</a> suggesting that only the very selfish better-off can afford to stay at home and effectively have poor people kowtowing at their door, after arriving with all their deliveries.</p>
<p>Barbara MarshallHelmdon, Northamptonshire</p>
<p>SIR – The use of the word mandate applied to an order, for instance to wear masks, seems to be an attempt to soften the harshness of what is really a new order, regulation or law.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is an attempt to make us believe it is something we voted for, as the word used to be mainly used for an electoral mandate for a policy as a result of winning an election.</p>
<p>Dr Treve WillisChipping Norton, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – Boris Johnson may once have had the ability to charm the birds from the trees. However, if he now knocked on our door and tried to explain the rationale of Plan B he would get a “Frosty” retort from Mrs Evans.</p>
<p>David EvansWilmslow, Cheshire</p>
<h2>Supplies of Covid tests</h2>
<p>SIR – I am a volunteer vaccinator. I have administered 4,000 to 5,000 jabs over the last 10 months.</p>
<p>Hugh N Whitfield FRCSWargrave, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – One of the pages of the Government’s coronavirus information wraparound with yesterday’s Telegraph has the strapline: “Going shopping? Test before you go.”</p>
<p>Surely there aren’t enough lateral flow tests in the country to make such guidance even remotely feasible.</p>
<p>John RattiganDoveridge, Derbyshire</p>
<p>SIR – Graham Croft<a> (Letters, December 20) </a>declares White Christmas (1954) to be the most boring film ever. I couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p>The song White Christmas, sung by Bing Crosby, was first aired in the superior musical Holiday Inn (1942), with music by Irving Berlin.</p>
<p>The later, execrable film White Christmas was nothing more than a lame attempt to capitalise on the song for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Alan G BarstowOnslunda, Skåne, Sweden</p>
<p>SIR – I note that interest rates are on the rise, in an attempt to control inflation. I remember the 1970s, when inflation was disastrously high and interest rates reached 17 per cent; it was eventually cured by controlling the money supply.</p>
<p>However, quantitative easing has had the opposite effect as the Government has been printing large amounts of money. Maybe this is the problem.</p>
<p>Robert DuffieldTenby, Pembrokeshire</p>
<p>SIR – If Christmas crackers are <a>wasteful</a> – which, of course, they are – then how about the amount of extra electricity we use over the festive season?</p>
<p>Liz WheeldonSeaton, Devon</p>
<h2>A Christmas crisis at the heart of government</h2>
<p>SIR – Major political crises rarely erupt during the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Salisbury observed wryly: “Not much, I am afraid, around us of ‘peace and goodwill’.”</p>
<p>Ostensibly the issue was public spending, but as the cabinet minister Lord Cranbrook noted in his diary on Christmas Day: “He was a growing rival of the prime minister and wished to wrest the lead from him.”</p>
<p>Salisbury knew that he could ill afford to lose his talented chancellor, writing that “our front-bench power in the House of Commons is so weak that we run a very great risk of being broken to pieces”.</p>
<p>Could this be a lesson for the current Chancellor and his undisguised leadership ambitions?</p>

<p>SIR – There have been, there are and there will be reasons to vote Conservative. <a>Liz Truss</a> is not one of them.</p>
<p>Charles FosterChalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – If Liz Truss manages to invoke Article 16 and resolve the Northern Ireland problem, it will show that she could be a worthy successor to Boris Johnson as Prime Minister; if she fails and caves in to the EU, it will scupper her chances.</p>

<p>John KennettHadlow, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – I am reminded of my brother’s first term report at secondary school.</p>
<p>Summarising all of the other subject reports, the form master wrote simply: “It doesn’t look like Iain will be getting a new bike for Christmas.”</p>
<header> <h1> Letters: Government caught between those isolated by fear and those who can’t bear Covid regulations </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 22 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The Government is in a cleft stick. It relayed the scientists’ doom-laden prophecies to the public, and a great percentage of the population are self-isolating out of fear. That badly affects the retail and hospitality sectors.</p>
<p>In the meantime it is becoming clear that, for vaccinated and healthy individuals, catching the omicron variant will be no more dangerous than a heavy cold – something we deal with every winter without hysteria.</p>
<p>So, if Boris Johnson decides that something like another lockdown is required, he will alienate the large proportion of the population little affected by Covid. If he lets things go on as they are, he will alienate those who have been frightened.</p>
<p>For those who are unvaccinated out of choice, I have no sympathy, as they are the ones ultimately putting the most strain on the NHS. They should not complain when their freedoms are restricted by controls such as Covid passports.</p>
<p>Howard G MarchBirmingham</p>
<p>Restrictions seem now for the large part to be for protecting the unvaccinated. This should not constrain those who have had the jab.</p>
<p>Dr Duncan HallSidmouth, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, has expressed frustration at the failure of many Premier League footballers to accept vaccination. The Government keeps urging people to be inoculated, which also suggests vexation with anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>The answer with football is for managers to agree not to use unvaccinated players in their first teams. That would make them think twice, as they would lose their win bonuses and become less attractive to would-be purchasers.</p>
<p>Robin NonhebelSwanage, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – Why has the BBC has stopped publishing the daily hospital admissions data on the 10 o’clock news? Surely this key metric is vitally important when assessing if the NHS is about to be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Jonathan HutchinsonHadstock, Cambridgeshire</p>
<p>SIR – The nation now has a strong and ever increasing triple vaccination base on which to meet omicron on the pandemic battlefield.</p>
<p>Building resistance on top of vaccination will likely be dependent on further exposure to omicron or delta. We are told symptoms may be no worse than a common cold or flu, which we have to live with in any case.</p>
<p>This suggests that future lockdowns and restrictions should be replaced by progressively getting back to normal.</p>
<p>It would be helpful for the NHS to issue guidance and drug recommendation for patients who need nursing at home.</p>
<p>Philip CongdonPoyntington, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – The requirement for all new builds to have charging units for electric vehicles is poor planning.</p>
<p>First, it assumes that there is adjacent parking; secondly, that there would be sufficient capacity available from the estate substation; and thirdly, that occupants have the capital to invest in a new car.</p>
<p>Regulations should require new builds, domestic and commercial, to be fitted with photovoltaic panels. Further planning considerations should include rainwater capture.</p>
<p>Michael MarksLeominster, Herefordshire</p>
<p>SIR – On Sunday the weather was cold and misty with no wind. My eight solar panels were generating 81 watts. On a very good day they generate 1700 watts.</p>
<p>Where is our electricity coming from if the future is electric?</p>
<p>John RansonLetchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire</p>
<h2>Scottish self-sabotage</h2>
<p>SIR – As well as opposing the development of its oilfields, the Scottish government has lost three industrial investments through rejecting the UK Government’s offer to fund freeports.</p>
<p>Once again its subservience to green policies undermines the economic case for independence.</p>
<p>Ian SteedmanSalisbury, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – Last month I managed a week’s stay in Mulranny, Co Mayo, where I had booked self-catering accommodation from a lady my family had stayed with several times before.</p>
<p>When being shown around the kitchen, I asked her whether there was a spurtle with which to stir my (Irish) porridge. She said she’d neither got one nor even heard of such a utensil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was also a pink label from Correos España attached to the parcel, and evidently used for “Devolucion/Retour” items.</p>
<p>If any reader can supply an explanation I’d very much appreciate it, before an Englishman risks smuggling a Scottish spurtle to an Irish lady.</p>
<p>J Eric NolanWilpshire, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – The National Trust for Scotland has drawn a connection between Culloden battlefield, site of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s final defeat, and the evils of slavery.</p>
<p>Keith AitchisonInverness</p>
<p>SIR – As everyone in Bonnie Prince Charlie’s day was touched by slavery, wouldn’t it save a lot of trouble if we just cancelled the 18th century?</p>
<p>Charles HoldenMicheldever, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – I wonder what sort of nut harvest the residents of Boa Frente were watching in your photograph <a>(Letters, December 18)</a>.</p>
<p>Not Brazil nuts, because their fruits are collected from the ground. Weighing about four and a half pounds and falling from up to 160 feet, they can be a danger to anything below.</p>
<p>SIR – Lynn Barber’s <a>unmasking of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll </a>was a nice antidote to the BBC’s absurd portrayal of her as some feminist free spirit.</p>
<p>She was a sort of Wallis-lite, a rent-a-toff for when the Kents had gone to a fancier gig. She looked like Pierrot, ghastly white, and freeloaded for as long as the Bollinger held out.</p>
<h2>Pulling the plug on tidings of comfort and joy</h2>
<p>SIR – On Sunday evening we had our annual church carol service, which we streamed live so that people nervous about attending church in these Covid times might enjoy our Christmas carols and readings.</p>
<p>It appears that social media is so geared that it cannot distinguish between ersatz renditions and the genuine article.</p>
<p>Bret JohnsonBures, Suffolk</p>
<h2>When a school report offers unexpected insight</h2>
<p>SIR – A school report <a>(Letters, December 21) </a>that perfectly summed up my daughter’s personality read: “Kate is the life and soul of the party; unfortunately we are not having a party.”</p>
<p>Margaret HawksClevedon, Somerset</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 23 December 2021 • 12:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – I could not agree more with Philip Johnston (Comment, December 22) about the risk that the unvaccinated now pose to the rest of society.</p>
<p>There seems to be little recognition that with rights come responsibilities.</p>
<p>Joanne HayesBerkeley, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – As a retired surgeon and a volunteer vaccinator, I believe it is now vital that the harm being caused by the unvaccinated is widely publicised.</p>
<p>A large proportion of patients in intensive-care beds are from this group. Without them there would be no undue pressure on the NHS.</p>
<p>SIR – Let’s examine Philip Johnston’s claim that it’s the “unvaccinated rump who risk pushing us back into lockdown”.</p>
<p>We know that the vaccine does not prevent transmission of the virus, but that it does curb serious illness (I’m confident that my three jabs will protect me, whoever I’m around).</p>
<p>We also know that, as there are some who have good reasons for rejecting the vaccine and others whose distrust only increases in line with sanctions against them, we will never have a fully inoculated population.</p>
<p>Tim ColesCarlton, Bedfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – I was a registered nurse and midwife for more than 40 years, and am now retired.</p>
<p>This is crazy. I understand that I might need a small amount of training, but much of it would be unnecessary – while costing a lot of money. Sadly, the NHS’s administrators are wasting funds in this fashion time and again.</p>
<p>Jane DaySouth Warnborough, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – I followed the process to order a lateral flow test kit for home delivery via the NHS website.</p>
<p>On offering this to the pharmacy, I was told that there had been no kits in stock for days, but that the NHS was still issuing codes.</p>
<p>Dr Tony ParkerRingmer, East Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – In your report (<a>December 21)</a> on GP appointments, researchers at the University of Manchester point a finger at “frequent attenders”, who comprise a large proportion of GPs’ workload.</p>
<p>While it may be that 10 per cent of patients account for 43 per cent of in-person appointments, the majority of them suffer from several long-term health conditions, and could reasonably be expected to consult their doctor more than most.</p>
<p>That these figures have increased over 20 years is inevitable when one considers the increasing average age of our population. Additionally, in the era of Covid-19, many who would otherwise be well are requesting appointments to see their doctor.</p>
<p>While some GP appointments may well be avoidable, the blame should not lie with the frequent flyers, nor with those left waiting at the departure gate.</p>
<p>The real problem lies in failing to confront this country’s preventative health needs. Doing so might alleviate the pressure faced by GPs.</p>
<p>Anuraag VaziraniUniversity of Oxford</p>
<p>SIR – Simon Heffer (<a>“Lancastrian was a joyous antidote to today’s bland team of commentators”, Sport, December 22</a>) is absolutely correct in many of his comments.</p>
<p>Test cricket is no longer the premier interest of the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the move to a game that is hardly recognisable as cricket has been further demeaned by the bland, dull commentators currently employed.</p>
<p>Surely there are some lessons to be learnt from Arlott, Blofeld, Johnston and Benaud, who all in their different ways were highly skilled at their art and very knowledgeable.</p>

<h2>Knitting up festive toppings for pillar-boxes</h2>
<p>SIR – Charles Moore (<a>Comment, December 21</a>) asks if we could have a national knitting target for decorating pillar boxes over Christmas 2022.</p>
<p>We in Aldeburgh have been lucky. Residents have been decorating ours with knitting projects throughout the pandemic. At present the theme is, of course, Christmas.</p>
<p>We are also thankful that a resident regularly adorns the statue of “Snooks” – the town’s late doctor’s dog, and friend of everyone – with various costumes to match the seasons of year.</p>
<p>Michael WalfordAldeburgh, Suffolk</p>
<p>SIR – I believe the toppers in Faversham to which Lord Moore refers were knitted by the Gunpowder WI.</p>
<p>Anne O’CarrollFaversham, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Every Christmas my wife and I send about 50 cards to distant family and friends, and receive a similar number back.</p>
<p>Brian HallingStratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – A useful tip for Christmas: my husband has proved that most carols can be sung to the tune of Ghost Riders in the Sky.</p>
<p>Regrettably, he enjoys proving it.</p>
<p>Diane SaundersBungay, Suffolk</p>
<h2>Spurious links between Culloden and slavery</h2>
<a>(report, December 21</a>) shows that its administrators are as ignorant of history as their counterparts at the National Trust in England.
<p>As the site is dedicated to the memory of Jacobite soldiers killed in action or murdered on the spot, it is clearly impossible that they went on to engage in the Atlantic slave trade.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of the captured survivors were despatched to the Carolinas as indentured bondsmen, which was effectively a form of slavery.</p>

<p>Even the Queen cancelled the “lavish feast” (report, December 16) of her pre-Christmas “lunch” this year. One wonders, after such a lavish lunch, what would be eaten for dinner (a light supper, I suppose).</p>
<p>I always thought that dinner was the main meal of the day, and Christmas dinner is surely the meal of the year, never mind of a single day. If an exception is made on Christmas Day to dine at lunchtime, then it is dinner.</p>

<p>SIR – As the treasurer of a parochial church council and a retired intellectual property and competition lawyer, I am aghast at the sums that are demanded of churches for using music long out of copyright (life plus 70 years).</p>
<p>PCCs are in a poor bargaining position against music publishers. The Competition and Markets Authority should hold a sectoral investigation.</p>
<p>Michael VarvillFittleworth, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – Are other readers annoyed by flashing Christmas lights? Most have flashing as the default setting and, if they are controlled by a time-switch, always flash when they come on. This seems little short of tyrannical.</p>

<p>John SharpGreat Glen, Leicestershire</p>
<p>SIR – According to the website electricityinfo.org, on December 21 – the shortest day of the year – wind provided just 2.6 per cent of the United Kingdom’s electricity.</p>
<p>In a sustainable energy future, when we have similar weather with high pressure dominating across Northern Europe, where is the other 97 per cent of our electricity going to come from?</p>

<p>Patrick WalshHighclere, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – The Office for National Statistics estimates that in mid-November 95 per cent of the adult population of Scotland and England would have tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies.</p>
<p>Put another way, at that time at least 95 per cent of the population had contracted the disease, or been vaccinated against it, or both. The percentage with antibodies can only have gone up since then.</p>
<p>According to all medical reports, the symptoms of the now-dominant omicron variant are milder and more typical of the common cold. There are also now a number of anti-viral and other medications for Covid-19.</p>

<p>Peter SweetmanLeigh-on-Sea, Essex</p>

<h2>A choc short of a dozen</h2>

<p>A box contains 11 chocolates, and so the only way to avoid unfair distribution is to share them among a football team. Twelve is such an easily divisible number, as shown by the standard units of time. Why can’t they just give me one more?</p>

<h2>West Side Story inspires in miserable times</h2>
<p>SIR – Celia Walden is so right (West Side Story is proof ‘event cinema’ isn’t over”, Features, December 21)</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg’s production is fabulous and the theme resonates as much today as when the original was released in the 1960s.</p>
<p>If you want to see talent and be inspired in these miserable times, I thoroughly recommend this first-class film. What a talent Spielberg is.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 25 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The recent lack of sunshine and wind should remind everyone that Britain needs far more reliable energy sources than solar and wind power.</p>
<p>The times when renewables meet our requirements are often reported, but there are many occasions when they do not.</p>
<p>Coal and gas should not be demonised, and the Government should accept this fact – otherwise our winters will only get colder.</p>
<p>Alan SimmonsCaterham, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Whenever governments try to fix a market the result is bad.</p>
<p>Forcing a price cap on energy has distorted a working capitalist market and forced bankruptcy on the “disruptive” suppliers that politicians have been so keen to encourage.</p>
<p>If we had ever had a joined-up policy, with lots of renewables and the necessary backup from our own fracked gas and nuclear power, we would not be paying Vladimir Putin’s price for energy.</p>

<p>SIR – During the power cuts earlier this month, I was amazed by how well Britain’s energy companies treated their customers.</p>
<p>I am only 1,400 miles away in Portugal. Less cold, admittedly, but I’ve been waiting 17 months for a connection to mains electricity – and I’m told I’ll have to wait a few months more.</p>
<p>As part of the application process I had to pay Electricidade de Portugal over £9,000 to upgrade the local line.</p>
<p>EDP’s own deadline for completing the connection in March, and I am still waiting for them to start the works.</p>
<p>For all of this, I have received a grand total of €20 in compensation.</p>
<p>Caroline ThomasLuz, Lagos, Portugal</p>
<p>SIR – The impression given in the media is of massive queues to get Covid booster jabs.</p>
<p>Here in Trafford the vaccination programme has been extremely efficient, very well organised and correctly recorded.</p>
<p>My adult family have all been vaccinated and received their booster invitations by text, and there were appointments as early as the following day.</p>
<p>My son received his booster just the other day, and the process was as efficient for him as it was for us in October. He was jabbed by someone who was training another person at the time.</p>
<p>Helen TurnerSale, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – The rise of ageing drivers is a real issue, but the ability of technology – such as lane-assist systems and automatic braking – to prevent accidents is countered by the sheer complexity of a modern car’s cockpit.</p>
<p>Each car manufacturer tries to outdo the others with new models designed by young and middle-aged techies, but they appear not to have considered older drivers, who might have only recently stopped using their analogue cars.</p>
<p>By all means improve the tech – but keep it simple.</p>
<p>Ian WearingWelwyn, Hertfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – It was shocking to learn that there is a drug culture among our MPs in Westminster – one so serious, indeed, that <a>sniffer dogs may be deployed</a> to identify the abusers.</p>
<p>In the NHS, for example, such practices would not be tolerated and would probably lead to dismissal. Why should lower standards apply for those elected to represent us in Parliament?</p>
<p>Malcolm H Wheeler FRCSBonvilston, Glamorgan</p>
<h2>A crackpot way to package eggs</h2>
<p>SIR – My local supermarket sells packs of six free range-eggs in a cardboard box for £2.</p>
<p>It also offers four hard-boiled, ready-peeled eggs of unspecified quality in hard plastic trays with a further outer wrapping of plastic for £1.50.</p>
<p>Who in their right mind buys the latter, and how does the store justify this unnecessary use of plastic?</p>

<p>This, along with the punishing schedule of waking at 4am to “rise and thank God” before getting into the office before 6:45am, was supposed to illustrate how hard the former tech star was on herself. Not hard enough as it transpires.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But, just as the story of the rise of Theranos was accepted too unquestioningly, so the morality tale of its fall is in danger of being somewhat oversimplified.</p>
<a>a blood-testing startup</a> which had grown to achieve a valuation of $9bn (£7bn) at one point, making her the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.
<p>But most venture capital firms didn’t fall for Holmes’s lofty claims. Many were put off by the aura of secrecy and obfuscation around the firm. Much of the financing came from wealthy individuals and naive Davos-types.</p>
<p>Then there is the idea that Holmes’s trial will end <a>Silicon Valley</a>’s “fake it until you make it” culture of overpromising and under-delivering. This is the conclusion that is surely the widest of the mark.</p>
<a>could only perform 12 kinds of tests</a>, not over 200 as she had publicly claimed.
<p>What lesson is Silicon Valley supposed to learn from all this? Not to lie? Not to commit fraud?</p>
<p>Theranos never changed the world as its founder frequently claimed it would. Sadly, Holmes’s downfall is unlikely to alter much either.</p>

<h1> Apple’s $3 trillion valuation betrays a sickness at the heart of corporate America </h1>
<p> The ‘trust-busting’ tradition of the United States urgently needs to be turned against its overmighty tech giants </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Jeremy Warner <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:31pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>When an outstanding chief executive quits or otherwise departs, it’s generally time to sell the stock.</p>
<p>That seemed to be the way to bet when Tim Cook took over at Apple after the untimely death of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs. As we now know, it would have been a very bad bet to take.</p>
<p>Since Cook took up the reins just over a decade ago, the shares have risen in value by nearly 14 times, adding an astonishing $2.7 trillion (£2 trillion) to the company’s market capitalisation.</p>
<p>This week, Apple became the first $3 trillion company in history, almost as big as the total size of the UK economy, the latter as measured by annual GDP.</p>
<p>The trick has instead been one of <a>incremental product enhancement, particularly of the company’s pioneering smartphone,</a> and in steady expansion in spin-off revenue from the app store and ancillary services.</p>
<p>With Apple now worth around 7pc of the entire SP 500, the big has begotten the even bigger, with tracker funds driven to buy Apple shares in ever greater amounts simply to keep up with their growing weight in the index.</p>
<p>There is admittedly some reason in the underlying madness. Some of the biggest commercial winners from the pandemic have been the US tech giants, and especially Apple, whose products are tailor made for home working and social distancing.</p>
<p>Predatory takeovers and abusive market practice have been widely tolerated in a way that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago, and has led to a steep decline in the number of viable competitors, not just in tech but across sectors.</p>
<p>Looking at the origins of this most un-American of trends, it can be traced back to the late 1970s, and publication of a hugely influential book by a former solicitor general, Robert Bork, called The Antitrust Paradox.</p>
<p>This argued that competition law should not be concerned with protecting individual competitors, but instead with promoting pro-consumer, business efficiency.</p>
<p>It has been the refrain of the new monopolists ever since that economies of scale and market power allow them to offer cheaper prices to consumers, providing cover for a great raft of predatory practice.</p>
<p>Only quite recently has the tone of political debate in the US begun to shift back towards a more <a>traditional antitrust mentality.</a></p>
<p>For the time being, however, the politicians remain a threatening but otherwise not particularly troubling cloud on Apple’s horizon. Stock markets don’t yet take the possibility of enforced breakup of the tech titans that seriously.</p>
<p>Perhaps they should, for on multiple fronts so-called FAANGs and their ilk find themselves in growing conflict with large segments of US popular and political thinking.</p>
<a>Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> over a posting she made about Covid vaccines. 
<p>Other social media companies have likewise found themselves accused of trampling over free speech by removing content from known Right-wingers deemed inappropriate or misleading.</p>
<p>There’s not much to admire in the Chinese president, but some might think he’s got a rather better grasp of the future than the Western money managers who have just bestowed a $3 trillion valuation on Apple.</p>

<a> new customs checks would wreck imports from the bloc</a>, with one predicting they would become “more expensive, less flexible and much slower”, it was comically bad timing.
<p>The Prime Minister can talk all he likes about <a>“landmark deals” with Australia and New Zealand</a> but by the Government’s own admission, neither will move the dial when it comes to GDP or cheaper goods.</p>
<p> It has also been pointed out that the UK may be required to make the kind of compromises that Brexiteers persistently cited as one of the main reasons for leaving the EU.</p>
<a>When Boris says the Government will go “further and faster” in 2022</a> to maximise the opportunities of Brexit, he should be held to it.
<p>This is the year when reality should finally match all the hype, otherwise even the most staunch Brexiteers may be forced to question whether they will ever get what they wanted.</p>
<header> <h1> Omicron slams the brakes on eurozone economy </h1> <p> Private sector growth slows to its weakest in nine months as new outbreaks take their toll </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tim Wallace <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:22pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Omicron slammed the brakes on the eurozone economy last month as new Covid outbreaks took their toll on the services and travel industries.</p>
<p>Private sector growth slowed to its weakest in nine months, according to the purchasing managers’ index, an influential survey from IHS Markit.</p>
<p>The eurozone’s index score fell to 53.3, down from 55.4 in November. Any score of above 50 indicates growth, so this decline represents a slowdown rather than a contraction.</p>
<p>However, Germany’s GDP is threatening to go into reverse, with a PMI of 49.9 indicating business activity may be shrinking in the continent’s largest economy.</p>
<p>Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit, warned: “It’s clear that <a>risks to the economy are now greater as tighter restrictions</a> to curb the spread of Covid-19 are more likely. </p>
<p>“The spread of the omicron variant had a particularly profound impact on the services sector, reflecting renewed hesitancy among customers due to the novel strain of the virus,” he said.</p>
<p>Manufacturers expanded faster than services businesses for the first time since the summer, indicating a return to the lockdown-era pattern in which physical goods production and sales are stronger than those requiring face-to-face transactions.</p>
<p>However factory bosses increasingly fear a fresh slowdown, worsening problems in industries <a>already plagued by global supply shortages.</a></p>
<p>German car manufacturers, accounting for about a tenth of its economy, report deepening pessimism for their companies.</p>
<p>Their assessment of the business situation has worsened for five consecutive months, according to the Ifo Institute, a think tank in Germany.</p>
<p>Supply shortages and slumping exports are to blame, the survey found, while mid-sized suppliers are struggling as larger car companies seek new deals with Chinese manufacturers.</p>
<p>However there are still some signs of resilience on the continent.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence climbed last month in France, according to a survey by official statistics agency INSEE.</p>
<p>The index hit 100, up from 98 in November and its highest level since September, raising hopes that households are prepared to spend despite the omicron variant.</p>
<h1> Disgraced Afiniti founder Zia Chishti plots comeback weeks after quitting over harassment claims </h1>
<p> The entrepreneur is trying to rejoin the board of TRG Pakistan, an investment firm that is the biggest shareholder in Afiniti </p>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A technology entrepreneur facing sex assault allegations is plotting a comeback at his star-studded business just weeks after being forced to quit.</p>
<p>Zia Chishti is seeking a return to the business empire behind Afiniti, a software company where Princess Beatrice works as an executive and which until recently employed <a>David Cameron</a> as the head of its advisory board.</p>
<p>In testimony to Congress, Ms Spottiswoode said Mr Chishti had violently assaulted her while on a work trip as part of <a>a pattern of abusive behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>In November, Mr Cameron resigned and Mr Chishti was forced to step down from the Bermuda-based company, whose customers include Sky, Virgin Media and ATT.</p>
<p>Mr Chishti, 50, has said he disputes the allegations and called Ms Spottiswoode's claims "erroneous", but he was ousted as TRG Pakistan’s chief executive shortly after as pressure grew on his position.</p>
<p>After he resigned, the company said it would launch a new investigation into the claims, hiring a former US government prosecutor to look into the allegations.</p>
<p>TRG Pakistan owns a 45pc stake in TRG International, a subsidiary that owns 38pc of Afiniti. When this was combined with his personal stake, it gave Mr Chishti effective control over Afiniti when he was running TRG Pakistan.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, TRG Pakistan said in a notice to the Karachi Stock Exchange that Mr Chishti had nominated himself for election to its board, alongside his elderly mother Sadia Chishti and his half brother George Lear. </p>
<p>Ioannis Demetriades and Jose Ignacio Guerra Holguin, two close associates of Mr Chishti, have also been nominated. </p>
<p>Mr Chishti controls around 15pc of TRG Pakistan, which under election rules should enable him to appoint himself at a minimum. Along with other allies he may be able to gain control of the board.</p>
<p>Shareholders are due to vote on appointments next week. Mr Chishti may muster support from other investors including Ali Siddiqui, <a>Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US</a>, who sits on Afiniti’s advisory board.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron stepped down as the advisory board’s chairman the day after the allegations against Mr Chishti emerged, while other advisers including the former US defence chief Mike Mullen also resigned. </p>
<p>Princess Beatrice, Afiniti’s vice-president of partnerships and strategy, remains at the company and is on maternity leave.</p>
<p>Mr Chishti did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<header> <h1> Chinese surveillance software firm trains staff at British university </h1> <p> UWE Bristol awards degrees to trainees from Neusoft, which has been accused of developing software that targets dissidents </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Cahill <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:39pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A British university is awarding degrees to trainees from a Chinese company accused of developing software that targets dissidents.</p>
<p>The University of the West of England Bristol has launched an education programme for software engineers working at the research institute of the Chinese IT giant Neusoft.</p>
<p>Students in China will study on a four-year course and receive degrees from both the Neusoft Institute in Guangdong and the UWE Bristol.</p>
<p>Neusoft has come under fire following reports the company had secured a contract to build surveillance software specifically targeting journalists, foreign students and members of the oppressed Uyghur population in China.</p>
<p>The company, which is one of the largest software firms in China, has secured the contract from the Chinese province of Henan, according to documents revealed by surveillance analysts IPVM.</p>
<p>Neusoft has been building ties with British universities for many years. It toured the universities of Warwick, Sheffield, Leeds and York as part of a Chinese recruitment fair in 2007. </p>
<p>The company returned to the University of York for a careers event alongside PwC, Shell and IBM in 2010. It has built a string of research institutes across China to provide a pipeline of thousands of trained graduates for its business each year.</p>
<p>Johnny Patterson of campaign group Human Rights Watch said: "British thinking is helping upscale the Chinese surveillance state through these tech partnerships and that is deeply troubling.</p>
<p>"These Chinese firms are extremely large. Some of what they do is relatively anodyne, but some of what they do isn't, and universities need to know what they are getting into."</p>
<p>A spokesman for UWE Bristol said: “The partnership is an educational initiative only and does not relate to Neusoft’s business arrangements.”</p>
<p>Neusoft did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
