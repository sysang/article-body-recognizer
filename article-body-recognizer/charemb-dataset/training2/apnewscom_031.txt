<p>Mikey Saber, the antihero of Sean Baker’s new film, has a bit of a problem during job interviews. He has a hole in his resume — stretching some 20 years.</p>
<p>He explains to the bosses at Dollar General or the local diner that he was “self-employed” or was in “entertainment.” The prospective employers just want to know what he was doing for so long.</p>

<a><div><p>We're so rife with reboots and remakes today that it can take a moment to gauge just what Steven Spielberg's “West Side Story” is. It isn't a papered-over modernizing or a thinly disguised retread.</p></div></a>

<a><div><p>Paolo Sorrentino's films can be overwrought, grotesque and uneven but they are rarely not alive. </p><p>His latest, “The Hand of God,” is a catalog of wonders — of miracles both banal and eternal.</p></div></a>

<div><a><h3>Review: ‘Ron’s Gone Wrong’ has the movie code all jumbled</h3></a><div>By MARK KENNEDYOctober 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>There's a clear message in the new film “Ron’s Gone Wrong” and that message is to stop watching films like “Ron’s Gone Wrong.”</p>

<p>“ Venom: Let There Be Carnage ” is best when it’s not trying to be a comic book movie.</p>

<p>At a certain point, it becomes clear that not only is “The King’s Man” a tonal mess, it’s also just a set-up for a movie with an even more enticing cast that’ll leave you feeling even more conflicted. </p>
<p>But you have to admire a modern franchise that has an appreciation of bespoke tailoring as a core principle. If only “The Kingsman” movies didn’t also hold such juvenile humor in equally high esteem. </p>

<p>His hair is graying. His nerves are fraying. Denzel Washington’s Macbeth is a man quite literally running out of time — even before he meets those witches.</p>
<p>When he speaks of finishing, one hopes he isn’t referring to anytime soon. After all, King Lear awaits – right, Mr. Washington?</p>
<p>But as for his Macbeth, it’s McDormand who perhaps said it best when asked recently about casting the role. “You don’t make lists for a generation’s Macbeth,” she said. “One is born, and then they play it.”</p>
<p>“The Tragedy of Macbeth,” an A24/Apple release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America “for violence.” Running time: 105 minutes. Four stars out of four.</p>

<div><div><h1>Outlets hurt by dwindling public interest in news in 2021</h1></div><div>By DAVID BAUDERDecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — The presidential election, pandemic and racial reckoning were stories that drove intense interest and engagement to news outlets in 2020. To a large degree, 2021 represented the inevitable hangover.</p>
<p>Various metrics illustrate the dwindling popularity of news content.</p>
<p>Cable news networks were the main form of evening entertainment for millions of Americans last year. In 2021, weekday prime-time viewership dropped 38% at CNN, 34% at Fox News Channel and 25% at MSNBC, according to the Nielsen company.</p>
<p>The decline was less steep but still significant at broadcast television evening newscasts: 12% at ABC’s “World News Tonight” and the “CBS Evening News;” 14% at NBC’s “Nightly News,” Nielsen said.</p>
<p>While a Dec. 23 headline on the Los Angeles Times front page — “How Much More Can We Take?” — referred to COVID-19, it could easily be applied to the news appetite in general.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Insurrection prompts year of change for US Capitol Police</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jan. 6 attack posed loyalty test for Indiana Rep. Greg Pence</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jan. 6 committee prepares to go public as findings mount</h4></a></div></li>
<p>For the most part, smart news executives knew the peaks of 2020 were not sustainable.</p>
<p>“It was entirely predictable,” said news media analyst Ken Doctor.</p>
<p>“You become, to some extent, a prisoner of the audience you built,” Rosenstiel said.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, these outlets have turned elsewhere for revenue opportunities, Doctor said. CNN is preparing to debut a new streaming service early next year, and recently poached Fox News’ Chris Wallace to join that effort.</p>
<a>attention-getting programming</a> of the year was a documentary on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by Tucker Carlson, that asserted it was an effort to silence Trump supporters.
<a>was fired</a> after it was revealed how he helped his brother through a political scandal. MSNBC must
<a>replace Brian Williams</a> in its lineup and will most likely see its most popular personality, Rachel Maddow, cut back on her hours.
<a>passed 8 million subscriptions</a> and is on pace to grow further. Doctor said the Times has done an effective job of diversifying beyond politics, most notably with its Wirecutter service of consumer recommendations.
<a>wrestled with how to deal</a> their readers’ dependence on political fare, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company is looking internationally for growth opportunities, Doctor said, a focus that plays to the strength of its
<a>new executive editor</a>, Sally Buzbee.
<p>“People to some degree have focused inward,” Rosenstiel said. “They’re getting the news that they need but it’s not as much news as it was a year ago.”</p>
<p>Particularly for the national news outlets, Rosenstiel said 2021 may best be remembered as a transitional year away from the frenzied news pace of the Trump years.</p>
<p>He’s concerned that concentration on this story has distracted from other priorities, including focusing on local efforts to restrict voting rights, ultimately a more important story.</p>
<p>Some 100 to 120 local newspapers shut down in 2021, a number that is on pace with the declines of the past two decades, said Penelope Muse Abernathy, a professor at Northwestern University.</p>
<p>Yet local news outlets are also expected to have their smallest number of job cuts in 14 years, according to the research firm Challenger Gray Christmas. That comes after 2020 saw the biggest number of lost newsroom jobs since 2008.</p>
<p>He cited the Boston Globe and Minneapolis Star-Tribune as two newspapers that are succeeding in the transition.</p>
<div><div><h1>Polish president vetoes media bill that targeted US company</h1></div><div>By VANESSA GERADecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s president on Monday vetoed a media bill that would have forced U.S. company Discovery to give up its controlling share in Polish television network TVN.</p>
<p>President Andrzej Duda noted that the bill was unpopular with many Poles and would have dealt a blow to Poland’s reputation as a place to do business.</p>
<p>“Contracts have to be kept,” Duda said at a news conference in Warsaw where he announced his veto. “For us Poles it is a matter of honor.”</p>
<p>The bill, recently passed by the lower house of parliament, would have prevented any non-European entity from owning more than a 49% stake in television or radio broadcasters in Poland.</p>
<p>Its practical effect would have targeted only one existing company, Discovery Inc., forcing the U.S. owner of Poland’s largest private television network, TVN, to sell the majority or even all of its Polish holdings.</p>
<p>The ruling party, Law and Justice, pushed the legislation and argued that it was important for national security and sovereignty to ensure that no company outside of Europe can control companies that help form public opinion.</p>
<p>Party spokeswoman Anita Czerwinska said party leaders respect the prerogative of the president, who is a party ally, but were “disappointed” in his decision. </p>
<p>Yet many Poles saw the bill as an attempt to silence a broadcaster with an all-news station, TVN24, and an evening news program on its main channel viewed by millions.</p>
<p>Discovery had threatened to sue Poland in an international arbitration court, saying it would fight for its investment. The network was first bought by another U.S. company, Scripps Networks Interactive, for $2 billion and later sold to Discovery.</p>
<p>It represents the largest ever American investment in Poland and the company now puts TVN’s value at $3 billion.</p>
<p>Duda said the bill would have violated the provisions of a Polish-U.S. economic treaty signed in the 1990s, and Poland could have faced possible penalties reaching in the billions of dollars if he had signed it.</p>
<p>Duda said he agreed in principle that countries should limit foreign ownership in media companies, saying many other democratic countries — including the United States, France and Germany — have such legislation.</p>
<p>He said that he would support such legislation that would affect future investments. But he argued that in the case of TVN, the law would have hurt a business already operating legally in Poland.</p>
<p>He also said that he shared the view of many of his fellow Poles that given other problems, including the pandemic and inflation, the bill wasn’t necessary right now.</p>

<p>Three winners were named in each of three categories: literary criticism, arts writing and journalism. </p>
<p>The recipients for the criticism prize were Los Angeles-based writer Elaine Blair, Oxford associate professor Merve Emre and the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Becca Rothfeld. </p>

<p>For journalism, the winners were Mexican-based writer Alma Guillermoprieto, London-based columnist Nesrine Malik and Berlin-based writer Thomas Meaney. </p>
<div><div><h1>Doyle keeps ‘Untamed’ conversation going in journal, podcast</h1></div><div>By KELLI KENNEDYJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>“It was the most alive I’d ever been,” the 45-year-old Doyle said.</p>
<p>Doyle extended the conversation to podcasting in May, launching “We Can Do Hard Things,” which was No. 1 on Apple’s list of top new shows.</p>
<p>Still, women frequently approached her on her exercise walks, messaged her on social media, and pulled her aside at events, asking the same question.</p>
<p>“People would ask, ‘OK, that’s great that you got yourself untamed,’” she said. ‘That’s great that you were able to do that. How do I do that’?”</p>
<p>So Doyle recently released a companion journal to “Untamed.” She wanted to call it “The Experiment,” emphasizing that no blueprint exists and no one has the answers for someone else’s life, but publishers scrapped it.</p>
<p>Before “Untamed” dropped in March 2020, amid the early unknowns of COVID, her initial reaction was to wait and release it later.</p>
<p>But the forced time out proved fertile ground for her message of stillness, of tuning out the noise and listening to yourself, “your knowing,” she calls it.</p>
<p>“Being still is the hardest thing in the whole world,” she says.</p>
<p>“Mommy martrydom,” she said, can be a heavy burden to pass on to children.</p>
<p>Among her unconventional self-revelations embraced by exhausted women: It’s OK to quit or take a nap. She rarely replies to texts. Divorce isn’t always bad. Sometimes, losing everything is actually the step to freeing yourself.</p>
<p>Doyle hopes the pandemic and journal will encourage others to do some uncomfortable self-examination.</p>
<p>“Some of us found our peace for the first time. I have never been more comfortable in my own skin,” she recently said on her podcast.</p>
<p>“The constant going out in front of other human beings, the constant being out in all of these social situations... that was constantly jarring to me.”</p>
<p>Despite her successes, Doyle says her life is messy like everyone’s, filled with fights, tears and self-doubts.</p>
<p>So what about those days when she can’t get it all done? </p>
<p>“I’m really over beating myself up over everything.”</p>
<p>Instead, she calls quitting a spiritual practice.</p>
<p>“I wake up in the morning and I look forward to quitting,” she said in a recent podcast, adding that might be zoning out with TV and eating comforting carbs. </p>
<p>“If I didn’t quit every single day, I wouldn’t start again.”</p>
<div><div><h1>New laws take effect across US on abortion, policing, taxes</h1></div><div>By WILSON RINGDecember 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Minimum wage increases, animal protections, police accountability, cutting and increasing taxes are all part of a series of new laws taking effect across the country on Saturday, the first day of 2022.</p>
<p>Some of the laws such as abortion restrictions in New Hampshire or police reform measures passed in Illinois, Oregon and North Carolina address some of the most contentious issues of our time. </p>
<p>Others, such as a Maine law passed in the aftermath of a September 2019 explosion that killed a firefighter and injured a number of others, are more narrowly focused and were passed to remedy specific situations.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Parentage Act allows unmarried, same-sex or nonbiological parents to establish parenting rights through a simple form that gives parents legal capabilities immediately after a child is born.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p> Here is a rundown of some of the new laws taking effect Saturday across the country:</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, abortion will be prohibited after 24 weeks of gestation, with exceptions for the mother’s life or physical health.</p>
<p>Democrats have already drafted legislation seeking to repeal the new restrictions. Some also want to include the right to make reproductive medical decisions a constitutional right.</p>
<p>Come Saturday California will have the nation’s toughest living space standards for breeding pigs.</p>
<p>California is allowing the continued sale of pork processed under the old rules, which proponents say should blunt any shortage and price surge.</p>
<p>Maryland will join a number of states with a new law that will prohibit the sale of any new cosmetic product if it contains ingredients that were tested on animals.</p>
<p>In Vermont, a new law outlaws the trade in parts or products from a number of exotic animals, including elephants, giraffes, sea turtles, endangered sharks, whales and certain primates. </p>
<p>Recreational marijuana will become legal in Montana. State voters approved the change in <a>a November 2020 initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Under the new law, only businesses that had been providing medical marijuana prior to Nov. 3, 2020, are eligible to grow, manufacture and sell adult-use marijuana, concentrates and edibles through June 30, 2023. </p>
<p>California will become the first state to <a>require a $15-an-hour minimum wage</a> for businesses with more than 25 employees. A number of other locations across the country have already reached the $15 threshold.</p>
<p>More than 20 other states are also increasing their minimum wages to amounts of less than $15. A handful of states have no state-level minimum wage law, meaning they rely on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. </p>
<p>In both Illinois and Oregon, new laws take effect that ban discrimination based on physical characteristics, such as hairstyle.</p>
<p>In Oregon, the bill known unofficially known as the “Crown Act” will ban discrimination based on “physical characteristics that are historically associated with race,” including hair styles such as braids, locs and twists. </p>
<p>In Illinois, the legislation is known as the Jett Hawkins Law after Gus “Jett” Hawkins, a Black student who at age 4 was told to <a>take out his braids because the hairstyle violated the dress code</a> at his Chicago school. </p>
<p>In Georgia, a new law increases the amount people can earn before they start paying state taxes. The tax cut will save individual tax filers up to $43 a year, and married couples filing jointly up to $63. </p>
<p>Georgia teachers who agree to work in certain rural or low-performing schools could get up to $3,000 a year off their state income taxes for five years. </p>
<p>In Oklahoma, the top individual income tax rate is dropping from 5% to 4.75%. Lawmakers also slashed the corporate income tax rate from 6% to 4%.</p>
<p>In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the state’s Democrat-led Legislature added a new 2.75% surtax on health insurance premiums. </p>
<p>The tax increase will be used in large part to underwrite health-exchange insurance offerings for low- and moderate-income individuals along with employees at small businesses, starting in 2023. </p>

<p>Airlines for America, a trade group for large U.S. passenger and cargo carriers, said in an emergency filing that the FCC has failed to adequately consider the harm that 5G service could do to the industry. </p>
<p>The group wants more time for the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates airlines, to resolve issues around aviation safety related to a type of 5G service called C-Band.</p>
<p>ATT and Verizon Communications previously agreed to a one-month delay in 5G, which provides faster speeds when mobile devices connect to their networks and allows users to connect many devices to the internet without slowing it down. </p>
<p>Verizon spokesman Richard Young said, “We received the letter a short time ago, after 6 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, and we will need some time to review it.” </p>
<p>ATT spokeswoman Kim Hart Jonson said the company was reviewing the letter.</p>
<p>The airline industry trade group warned of significant damage if the 5G rollout goes ahead near major airports.</p>
<p>A4A, as the group is called, said its 11 member airlines face the need to reroute or cancel “thousands” of flights, resulting in losses topping $1 billion.</p>

<p>But with less than two weeks to go before senior U.S. and Russian officials are to meet in Geneva, the chasm is deep and the prospect of finding an exit to the crisis faces no shortage of complications. </p>
<p>“I made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves into Ukraine we will have severe sanctions,” Biden said. “We will increase our presence in Europe with NATO allies.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden’s national security team on Friday turned their attention to preparation for the Geneva talks, set for Jan. 9 and 10, to discuss the Russian massing of some 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine. </p>
<p>The Geneva talks, which are to be led on the U.S. side by senior State Department officials, are slated to be followed by Russia-NATO council talks and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</p>
<p>Biden is scheduled to speak by phone Sunday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two leaders plan to review preparations for the upcoming diplomatic engagements, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The Biden administration and NATO allies have made clear that the Russian demands are non-starters.</p>
<p>The seemingly unrealistic rhetoric has made some in Washington question of how effective talks can be.</p>
<p>The signatories of the statement included several former U.S. ambassadors, including Fried, Russia envoys Michael McFaul and Alexander Vershbow, and Ukraine envoys Steven Pifer and John Herbst.</p>
<p>The Russians for their part continue to make the case that they are facing an existential threat with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Simon Miles, a diplomatic and international historian of the Cold War at Duke University, said it would be a mistake for the White House to let “Russia unilaterally set the tempo of what is about to unfold.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the U.S. can do to keep the Russians on their back foot, as opposed to letting the Kremlin set the agenda, is going to be important to securing a favorable resolution,” Miles said.</p>

<a> their interest in seeing the insurrectionists prosecuted had declined. </a>
<p>To Fiona Hill, who served the previous three presidents across party lines as a Russia analyst, it all adds up to politics in the United States as “Mortal Kombat, the video game.” </p>
<p>That’s the warring America. It plays out in Washington, in decidedly uncivil town meetings across the country and over the airwaves. It infects social media, where people, by their own admission, lose their minds.</p>
<p>There’s another, quieter, America, too. It asks about the family. It commiserates about the water bill and shoots the breeze. It’s a place where people who can be Facebook-nasty are face-to-face polite. Often it meets over coffee.</p>
<p>There’s no question that Trump drove people further into their political corners and made things louder, coarser and more chaotic. And the one-two punch of political distancing and social distancing has taken a toll.</p>
<p>Trump and the pandemic “pretty much ripped a hole through the center of town,” says Kris Consaul, a left-leaning activist and a former town planning commissioner in Lovettsville.</p>
<p>Worship groups, a new-mom gathering and various other coffee klatches have taken root. Political discussions pop up, though rarely a heated argument. And when you sneeze in one cubbyhole, a stranger in another calls out, “Bless you.”</p>
<p>Ferguson was raised in the “FDR Democrat” tradition in Hartford, Connecticut, where the Republicans were wealthy businessmen and Democrats were almost everyone else. </p>
<p>A student of history as well as a career diplomat, Ferguson shudders at the fresh memories of Trump on rally stages, “strutting around, jutting out his chin ... like Mussolini,” the Italian fascist of World War II.</p>
<p>But what of the Democrats? </p>
<p>“They seem to take a sort of smug attitude,” Ferguson said. “They are treating Trump voters as if they’re stupid. That’s a huge mistake. It’s tremendously dangerous to alienate them.”</p>
<p>So when another neighbor made wooden posts for Back Street’s tight parking, Necciai bought the concrete, dug the holes and poured the footings.</p>
<p>“I remember thinking, dear God please let me not die here because this place has nothing in it and I don’t know anybody,” she said. But as the town grew in the years since, so did her attachment to the people.</p>
<p>Now, she says, “I don’t want to live anywhere else. ... I’m very relaxed and chill and I don’t need anybody to think the same things that I think in order for them to be a good person to me.”</p>
<p>PERILS OF ‘MASKBOOK’</p>
<p>Still, Sullivan said, “we do have a kind of dark undercurrent at times.”</p>
<p>In one provocation, a pro-Trump parade that came through town during the 2020 campaign diverted off the main street and stopped outside the home of the activist, Consaul, and her wife, Sheryl Frye, blaring horns to intimidate the couple.</p>
<p>The festive decoration has delighted many in town while upsetting some on the cultural right.</p>
<p>As Consaul describes how 20 people showed up to help paint the fence, her cat sits on her lap on her porch and her roaming chickens stop to listen, heads cocked sideways.</p>
<p>The parade was an overt sign of friction. But behind the shield of social media, where you can spout an opinion and not have to look someone in the eye, the tone has been harsh and confrontational.</p>
<a>named the sale after “krazy” Kris and her neighbor</a> — with a mangled spelling of their names — in a call to “Be Armed.”
<p>Yet on both sides of the divide, people share a consensus on a few things. One is that Lovettsville is a family-friendly place where you can send your 10-year-old to the 7-Eleven alone without worry. </p>
<p>Another point of agreement is that Facebook has given a few ugly voices an outsized megaphone — half-hiding behind the online veil that Moe calls “Maskbook.”</p>
<p>In raw exchanges on the local Facebook group, a downtown home and family displaying multiple pro-Trump banners were denounced as a “Trump dump.” From the other side, vile insults have been flung at gay people and anyone on the left.</p>
<p>Many in town have quit this online competition of cruelties. As if rubbernecking a car wreck, others can’t quite look away.</p>
<p>As she spoke, her cat jumped on the chest-high fence with the 2024 Trump banner and rubbed insistently against the interviewer’s face. </p>
<p>Off Facebook, the Trump supporter has got some liberal friends and doesn’t hesitate to visit Back Street, sizing up Moe as “definitely down the middle.” “We take our little one for milkshakes and things like that.” </p>
<p>So do the radical lefties. So do the moderates. So do the just plain people. </p>
<p>They’ll all shoot the breeze, ask about family, complain about the water bill or something. </p>
<p>Then it’s back to the ramparts. That’s America for you.</p>
<p>“It’s affecting people,” Moe said of the perils of this era. “Not me. Not in my bubble. We’re going to be fine, everyone! We’re going to land on our feet in my coffee bubble.”</p>

<p>Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s call came as the U.S. and Western allies prepared for a series of diplomatic meetings to try to de-escalate a crisis that Moscow said could rupture ties with Washington.</p>
<p>“President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement following the call.</p>
<p>Psaki added that Biden underscored his commitment to the principle of “nothing about you without you,” the tenet that it won’t negotiate policy that impacts Europe without its allies’ input.</p>
<p>Biden has spoken of hitting Russia with economy-jarring sanctions if it moves on Ukraine’s territory, but he said last month that U.S. military action is not on the table.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has demanded that any further expansion of NATO exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. The Russians have also demanded that the military alliance remove offensive weaponry from countries in the region.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said in a Twitter posting after Sunday’s call that “keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchization were discussed.”</p>
<p>“We appreciate the unwavering support,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear that he cannot — I emphasize cannot — move on Ukraine,” Biden said Friday.</p>

<p>Still, Biden said he remained hopeful for the upcoming talks. White House officials say they will consult closely with Western allies.</p>
<p>“I always expect if you negotiate you make progress, but we’ll see,” he said Friday. ”We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Past military incursions by Putin loom large as Biden weighs his next steps.</p>
<p>In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia’s annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage.</p>
<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he feared that Putin was intent on invading Ukraine and “nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The late Sen. Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who served as majority leader during a 30-year career in the Senate, will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda next week.</p>
<p>The leaders of Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, said in a statement Sunday night that ceremonies honoring Reid at the Capitol will take place on Jan. 12.</p>
<p>Events will include a formal arrival and departure ceremony. Details were to be announced later. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony was being limited to invited guests only.</p>
<p>Reid, 82, died last Tuesday at his home in Henderson, Nevada, after battling pancreatic cancer. A memorial service was planned for Saturday in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Beginning with his election to the U.S. House in 1982, Reid served in Congress longer than anyone in Nevada history. He retired from the Senate in 2016.</p>
<div><div><h1>Pentagon chief Austin says he has tested positive for COVID</h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Sunday he has tested positive for COVID-19 and was experiencing mild symptoms while quarantining at home.</p>
<p>In a statement Sunday night, Austin said he plans to attend key meetings and discussions virtually in the coming week “to the degree possible.” He said Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks would represent him in appropriate matters.</p>
<p>Austin said he last met with President Joe Biden on Dec. 21, more than a week before he began to experience symptoms, and had tested negative the morning of that day.</p>
<p>“I have informed my leadership team of my positive test result, as well as the President,” Austin said. “My staff has begun contact tracing and testing of all those with whom I have come into contact over the last week.”</p>
<p>“The vaccines work and will remain a military medical requirement for our workforce. I continue to encourage everyone eligible for a booster shot to get one. This remains a readiness issue,” he said.</p>
<p>In October, another member of Biden’s Cabinet, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now considering including the negative test as part of its guidance after getting significant “pushback” on its <a>updated recommendations last week.</a></p>
<p>The guidelines have since received criticism from many health professionals for not specifying a negative antigen test as a requirement for leaving isolation. </p>

<p>Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said the U.S. has been seeing almost a “vertical increase” of new cases, now averaging 400,000 cases a day, with hospitalizations also up.</p>
<p>“We are definitely in the middle of a very severe surge and uptick in cases,” he said. “The acceleration of cases that we’ve seen is really unprecedented, gone well beyond anything we’ve seen before.”</p>

<a>The Food and Drug Administration</a> last week said preliminary research indicates

<p>A PCR test usually needs to be processed in a laboratory. The test looks for the virus’s genetic material and then reproduces it millions of times until it’s detectable with a computer. </p>
<p>Fauci said if Americans take the necessary precautions, the U.S. might see some semblance of more normal life returning soon.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. denied Fortenberry’s motions to get the case tossed, increasing the odds that he will have to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal court.</p>
<p>“Because Defendant’s allegedly false statements were directed at federal investigative efforts occurring in this district, the Court finds that venue is proper in the Central District of California,” the judge wrote.</p>

<p>“The daily case rates will increase even more substantially in the coming weeks,” Monahan warned.</p>

<p>Monahan said people should wear properly fitted, medical grade KN95 masks or better. Blue surgical masks and cloth masks “must be replaced,” he said.</p>
<p>Mask wearing is “a critical necessity unless the individual is alone in a closed office space or eating or drinking in a food service area,” he said.</p>

<div><div><h1>NY governor seek term limits, ban on officials’ extra income</h1></div><div>By MICHELLE L. PRICEJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to impose term limits on her office and other statewide elected officials and ban them from earning an outside income, changes that implicitly rebuke her predecessor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>Hochul, a Democrat who took office in August after Cuomo stepped down amid sexual harassment allegations, issued a statement Monday saying the proposals are aimed at restoring trust and integrity in the state government. </p>
<p>She did not mention Cuomo in the statement.</p>
<a>an investigation from the state attorney general</a> concluded he had sexually harassed 11 women.
<p>Cuomo has attacked the investigation as inaccurate and biased, denying he mistreating women and saying he resigned to avoid subjecting the state to turmoil.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s spokesman Rich Azzopardi did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Hochul said she also plans to introduce legislation barring those statewide elected officials from earning money outside their government salaries unless it’s for an academic position that’s approved by a state ethics board.</p>
<a>was set to earn $5.1 million</a> for writing a book about his leadership during COVID-19, and was paid a $3.1 million advance. The state ethics commission initially approved the book deal, but
<a>rescinded approval</a> after concluding Cuomo used state property, resources and personnel to write the book.
<p>Cuomo has acknowledged that state employees helped with tasks including editing the manuscript. But he says those employees were volunteering their private time.</p>
<p>New York’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics is seeking to have Cuomo turn over to the state all money he was paid for “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.”</p>
<p>Cuomo’s lawyer Jim McGuire has called the commission’s attempt to seize the book profits illegal.</p>
<p>The governor is expected to offer more details about her plans in her first State of the State address Wednesday.</p>

<a>brought the lawsuit</a> in January 2020, days after
<a>Virginia’s legislature voted</a> to make the Commonwealth the critical 38th state to ratify the amendment. The vote came after years of efforts by advocates who argued the amendment would guarantee women equal rights under the law.
<li><div><a><h4>Sen. Kaine: 'Miserable' commute became a survival project </h4></a></div></li>

<p>Constitutional amendments must be ratified by three-quarters of the states, or 38. But, complicating the matter, Congress enacted a ratification deadline for the ERA that passed decades ago. </p>
<a>issued a legal memo</a> concluding that because the deadline had expired, it was too late for states to ratify. The only option for supporters was to begin the process all over again in Congress, the department said at the time.
<p>The National Archives, which certifies the ratification of constitutional amendments, said it would abide by that opinion “unless otherwise directed by a final court order.”</p>
<p>Nevada and Illinois, which were the 36th and 37th states to ratify the amendment, then joined Virginia in filing suit. </p>
<p>In March 2021, a district court judge granted a request by the Trump administration and a group of Republican attorneys general to dismiss the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The ERA was initially proposed in Congress in 1923 and passed in 1972. Its first section reads: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”</p>
