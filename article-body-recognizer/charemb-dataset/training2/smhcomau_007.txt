<p>With the first Test of the Ashes due to start at the Gabba on December 8, there is still plenty of interest in Langer’s future. His Cricket Australia contract finishes after the scheduled tour of Pakistan in March.</p>
<p>Speaking at the SCG in an official announcement for next year’s men’s T20 World Cup, Clarke said he believed Langer would want to resign on a high if Australia win the Ashes, leaving a new coach to take the squad to Pakistan.</p>
<p>“He wanted Australia to be the best team in the world. He wanted us to play a brand of cricket that he’s proud of, and we’ve just won the World Cup,” he said.</p>
<p>“If we can win the Ashes as well, he’s achieved everything that he’s come here for and knowing Lang [Langer] he won’t coach for the wrong reasons.”</p>
<p>Following Australia’s win over New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday, Langer spoke about the player-driven win and how “embracing fun” had been crucial to the World Cup victory.</p>
<p>Langer reportedly took more of a back-seat role during the tournament with a combination of leadership from support staff, players and captain Aaron Finch the key to success.</p>
<p>Whether the same attitude can be maintained for the Ashes is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>One of the most encouraging sights at the World Cup for Australia was David Warner finding form again. Warner walked away from the competition as Australia’s leading run scorer and the player of the tournament.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old stood up when Australia needed him in must-win matches. Against the West Indies, Pakistan and New Zealand, he made 89 not out, 49 and 53 respectively.</p>
<p>Clarke is confident he will be ready to do it again in the Ashes and said he wouldn’t be surprised if he finished as the leading run scorer.</p>
<p>“He was brilliant throughout the tournament and had the courage to still play his natural game. Yeah, I’ve got no doubt that he would walk into these Test series now full of confidence,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing what runs do for a batter. It’s so important and the only way really to get your confidence back is to score runs.”</p>
<p>Another standout in the World Cup was Mitch Marsh, who Clarke believes is nipping at Cameron Green’s heels in the No.6 spot.</p>
<p>“It’s a tough one as Cameron was brilliant last summer, and fought hard to earn his position,” he said.</p>
<p>“But Mitch Marsh is right there. He’s not far away at all. I think if he gets a crack, he’ll grab it with both hands.”</p>
<div>‘Way too much talk about the coach’: Waugh says no reason Langer can’t continue beyond Ashes</div>
<p>Former Test captain Steve Waugh believes there has been too much scrutiny on Justin Langer’s position and feels the Australian head coach will want to continue in the role beyond the Ashes.</p>
<p>Langer’s coaching methods have been under the microscope in recent months, prompting an intervention by Cricket Australia and senior figures in the team after poor performances from the national side.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Michael Clarke said he thought Langer would stand aside after the Ashes, provided Australia retained the urn against England.</p>
<p>“Looking forward to the Ashes, that’s one of the highlights as a captain and a coach. To win a series in Australia, he’d be focusing on that. I haven’t heard him talk about not continuing on. He loves a challenge.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to think the players take responsibility for winning and losing, not the coach,” Waugh said.</p>
<p>“When I played cricket, sure, you had the coach, but I know as a player you had to take responsibility for winning or losing. You’re the one out there for six hours a day playing a Test match, not the coach.</p>
<p>“I think there has been far too much emphasis on Justin Langer’s performance rather than the players. Realistically [against] India last year they should have won that series comfortably.</p>
<p>Cricket Australia won’t make a call on Langer’s future until after the Ashes. If CA decides to go in a different direction, Waugh believes Langer will understand.</p>
<p>“He would see it as no different to the players. The players get renegotiated pretty much every year,” Waugh said.</p>
<p>“He’s man enough to realise if you don’t perform, you don’t get picked as a player.</p>
<p>“It’s exactly the same thing [as a coach]. He knows there’s no free rides. What he and Tim Paine and Aaron Finch have done since Cape Town has been a pretty amazing transformation.</p>
<p>“Whilst they haven’t won everything in the past 12 to 18 months, they’ve progressed in a lot of other ways.”</p>
<p>“Having lost there last [summer] for the first time in a long time, it’s lost that aura about it and you can no longer say [Australia has been] unbeaten for so long,” Waugh said.</p>
<p>“The first Test is a bit of an unknown. I don’t know who is going to play well or who is the favourite. Both sides will think they can win.”</p>

<div>‘Keeps turning up’: Langer backs Starc after Warne shots, Harris to open at the ’G</div>
<p>Spearhead Mitchell Starc has been branded the “leader of the pack” and backed by key figures in Australian cricket in an Ashes summer when he has fired on-field arrows at Shane Warne’s criticism.</p>
<p>“I honestly thought Mitch Starc was almost man of the match last game. I think his consistency, there has been a lot of talk about Mitch Starc for the last few years, but he just keeps turning up,” Langer said on Thursday.</p>
<p>“He is an unbelievable athlete. He is incredibly fit. Again, he is another one who is much loved around the team. His resilience to just keep coming up over and over and over again is just remarkable really.</p>
<p>That “talk” about Starc has largely come from Warne, who called for Jhye Richardson to be picked ahead of Starc in the series opener in Brisbane.</p>
<p>Australia’s attack for Melbourne is not yet settled. Josh Hazlewood, who missed Adelaide because of a side strain, has rejoined the squad but appears almost certain to miss the Melbourne Test.</p>
<p>Skipper Cummins will return, while Victorian seamer Scott Boland has officially joined the squad, although Langer said the latter was “more precautionary than anything else”.</p>
<p>“Undecided at this stage. Both Michael and Jhye did a great job in the last Test match. We will just wait and see how they pull up. We have got back to back, it’s a tough series - we all know that,” Langer said.</p>
<p>“Five Test matches pretty much in a row - we will just manage our bowlers as best we can. We will put our fittest and most ready to perform out on the park in Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test match.”</p>
<p>Langer has backed Harris, averaging only 22.19 from 12 Tests, with Alec Bannerman the only Australian batter to have opened 20 times or more and have a lower average than Harris, to come good. Harris averages 40 at the MCG in first-class cricket.</p>
<p>“He will play in the Test, no worries about that. This is his home ground. He has played a lot at the MCG. He hasn’t made the runs he would have liked to but he dominates domestic cricket, so he knows how to play,” Langer said.</p>
<p>Langer said there were no specific bowling restrictions on Cameron Green, who was introduced late into the attack on day five in Adelaide. The young all-rounder, who has battled back stress fractures, continues to be closely monitored.</p>
<p>“To bowl three days back to back, as part of fast bowling management, it seemed to make sense,” Langer said.</p>
<p>“We were thankful we always had him up our sleeve, then he came back beautifully. With a young player like him, who has enormous talent and potential, and has had the injuries he has had, you have got to manage him well.”</p>

<div>‘I love my job’: Langer keen for coaching contract extension</div>
<div><div><h5>By Jon Pierik and Andrew Wu</h5><div>Updated <span><time>December 23, 2021 — 7.11pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>12.34pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Justin Langer has declared he has no intention of stepping aside and will seek a new contract with Cricket Australia, but his future lies in the hands of the players who have forced him to change his ways.</p>
<p>Though there are some who have accepted a more chilled Langer, combined with an altered dressing room dynamic behind the scenes, there remains concerns he will revert to form if the team starts losing again.</p>
<p>Langer has cut a more relaxed figure at training during the Ashes, often joking with players as they go about their work, though trivial issues such as his wearing of his cap backwards have raised questions in some quarters.</p>
<p>Heeding the wishes of his players, the coach has taken a more reserved role and delegated to assistants, allowing them to run training sessions.</p>
<p>When the drama over Pat Cummins’ availability for the Adelaide Test unfolded last Wednesday night, Langer was not told until midnight.</p>
<p>Feedback after the World Cup win in the United Arab Emirates was glowing on how the team was being run with Langer in the back seat though, pointedly, players stopped short of publicly calling for the coach to have his contract extended.</p>
<p>While former captain Tim Paine was seen as a conduit between the players and the coach, there can be no doubt this is now Cummins’ team.</p>
<p>The new skipper has repeatedly spoken of his desire for the team to be “calm” under pressure, lavishly praising his teammates for their coolness at the Gabba when England fought back.</p>
<p>Langer, though, is adamant he wants to stay on well beyond this summer.</p>
<p>“I have never thought differently, to be honest. I have been consistent with what I have said for the last four years. I love my job,” Langer said on Thursday, echoing his comments of July.</p>
<p>“The boys are playing well, no doubt about it, it’s a great team to be involved in. So, nothing has changed from my point of view.”</p>
<p>CA has applauded Langer, now more relaxed around the players, for adjusting his style and says a decision on his future won’t be made until after this series is completed.</p>
<p>There is a Test tour of Pakistan slated for early next year - this would be Australia’s first to the region since Mark Taylor took his side there in 1998 - before Langer’s contract expires.</p>
<p>Under Langer, of the blue-chip series, the Australians have twice lost campaigns at home to India but did draw to retain the Ashes in England in 2019. They also reached the semi-finals of the 50-over World Cup in 2019.</p>
<p>His initial role was to overhaul the team’s culture and regain the respect of the Australian public after the ball-tampering scandal of 2018, a key plank he has achieved.</p>
<p>Eddings was a strong supporter of Langer but has since left his post, having lost the majority support of state associations. Paine publicly backed Langer after the emergency meeting but has also since gone, embroiled in a sexting scandal.</p>

<div>Mutinous players will have a say in Langer contract negotiations</div>
<p>The players and support staff who staged a mutiny against Justin Langer four months ago will have an input into the coach’s reappointment.</p>
<p>Langer’s boss, Cricket Australia’s head of high performance Ben Oliver, confirmed there would be wide consultation before any decision was made on whether the coach’s contract would be renewed when it expires in June.</p>
<p>“We always seek feedback from players and staff,” Oliver said. “We’re about trying to get better. And that goes for our coaching staff. It goes through our players and everyone who’s around the team.</p>
<p>“So we’ll do that as a matter of course, after the [Ashes] series is completed, and the players’ feedback on a range of factors, including how we best support them, will be considered in that process.”</p>
<p>“Those conversations were really constructive at the time and great credit to the players, the player leaders were able to provide some feedback that was really constructive,” Oliver said.</p>
<p>“Justin embraced those conversations and ultimately, we’ve created, and he’s helped create, along with the other support staff and the player leaders an environment where the team has been able to perform incredibly well.</p>
<p>“And enjoy a World Cup campaign and enjoy an Ashes series and hopefully that’s also brought some joy to all of the Australians around the country.”</p>
<p>With CA unmoved after failing to act on the players’ long-running concerns about the coach, Paine, Finch and Cummins then each confronted Langer individually.</p>
<p>This forced Langer to take a back seat, leaving the senior players with more autonomy and the day-to-day coaching to assistants Andrew McDonald, Michael Di Venuto and Jeff Vaughan.</p>
<p>Now Test captain, Cummins was non-committal about Langer’s future after the third Test in Melbourne.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll savour this victory today and continue the Ashes,” Cummins said on Tuesday when asked if an Ashes series victory following Australia’s first Twenty20 World Cup triumph would see Langer continue.</p>
<p>“I don’t think today is the day to speculate on that. We’ll all sit down together after this series or whenever his tenure is up. His contract is up for renewal in a few months, and we’ll deal with that then.”</p>
<p>Oliver reiterated that conversations about Langer’s future would start once the Ashes had finished in mid-January.</p>
<p>Australia have a busy schedule, with white-ball series against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in February followed by a tour of Pakistan in March that clashes with a Twenty20 tour of New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We haven’t set a specific timeline on that [Langer’s contract negotiations], we’ll work through the conversations and manage that as we need to. The international cricket schedule is ongoing,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite an increasingly hectic schedule complicated further by COVID-19, Oliver played down the likelihood of splitting the roles with separate Test and white-ball or Twenty20 head coaches.</p>
<p>“Our approach has been to create a team of staff that sit around the players and support them, with that group bringing a set of complementary skills and experiences that support the players across all three formats,” he said.</p>
<p>“The international cricket schedule is demanding. There’s no doubt about that. But certainly, our approach has been a sort of collective team approach in terms of the support that we provide the players.”</p>
<p>Oliver expects the Pakistan tour to go ahead at this stage, despite security concerns and rising COVID-19 cases with the Omicron strain.</p>
<p>“We had a really constructive pre-tour visit to Pakistan, we were able to observe the recent West Indies tour there, that was positive,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re working through with the PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board] our final assessment and preparation for that tour.”</p>

<div>The viral meltdown that landed Chase Buford the job as Sydney Kings coach</div>
<header><div><div><ul><li><a>NBL</a></li></ul></div><h1>The viral meltdown that landed Chase Buford the job as Sydney Kings coach</h1><div><div><p>By Andrew Webster</p><time>December 3, 2021</time></div></div></div></header>
<p>There’s addressing the elephant in the room and then there’s jumping on the back of the elephant and riding it like a short-priced favourite about to get beaten down the straight at Royal Randwick.</p>
<p>In May this year, when the Sydney Kings were interviewing prospective coach Chase Buford via Zoom, club owner Paul Smith rode the elephant as only he can.</p>
<p>With no less than Kings part-owner Andrew Bogut and adviser Luc Longley on the call, Smith threw up this doozy: “Everybody talks about their achievements, but what’s your biggest f--- up?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be a loaded question; rather, a question that smoked out how honest Buford was about his flaws.</p>
<p>Buford, though, thought Smith was talking specifically about the elephant from February last year when he was coaching Wisconsin Herd, the G-League affiliate of NBA powerhouse Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>Having watch his side blow a 21-point lead in the last quarter in a match, Buford promptly destroyed the locker-room in anger, then fronted reporters.</p>
<p>With bulging eyes and wild hair that made him look like the Joker, he unloaded on the referees.</p>
<p>The rant went coast-to-coast across the US on most TV networks. Sportscenter had a lot of fun with it. So did Sports Illustrated. Millions have watched it on social media.</p>
<p>So Buford was ready for the question, answering Smith’s inquiry honestly and directly.</p>
<p>Smith eventually burst into laughter, breaking the tension. It’s also the precise moment he thought, “That’s our guy”. Given his own run-ins with NBL officials, that doesn’t surprise.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, the minor meltdown that eventually landed Buford the job doesn’t seem to match the normally polished, respectful, intelligent way he goes about his business.</p>
<p>It doesn’t match the 32-year-old sitting across from me in popular Bondi Beach establishment Ravesis earlier this week.</p>
<p>There’s no sign of the Joker, although he does have a big toothy grin. Instead, Buford is calm, poised, charming and passionate about the Kings. He’s also a Liverpool FC supporter and fallen in love with rugby league.</p>
<p>“I’m a Chooks fan,” he reports. “I like James Tedesco, he’s terrific.”</p>
<p>Apart from the league suspending him for two matches, much of the commentary was supportive. People were actually on his side.</p>
<p>“Pop” is Gregg Popovich, the legendary coach of the San Antonio Spurs and US basketball team. And with that, you start to understand the pedigree of the new Kings coach.</p>
<p>Popovich picks up the phone to Buford because of Buford’s father, RC, the legendary executive who built a championship dynasty at San Antonio, including five NBA titles.</p>
<p>It meant a young Chase grew up surrounded by basketball royalty, watching the likes of Tim Duncan but mostly hanging out with the other two parts of their famous “big three”: Argentine Manu Ginóbili and Frenchmen Tony Parker.</p>
<p>“I was closest to them,” Buford says. “We went to a lot of dinners with them; my Dad hoping they were OK, that they knew the city. Getting to see those two, to see how they grew, and then Tim, the glue in all that, was amazing.</p>
<p>“I got to meet Thierry Henry [who was playing for Arsenal at the time], because Tony would bring him to the finals every year and he had nobody to hang out with.”</p>
<p>That was one of many valuable lessons Buford learned from his father: how to treat people. The other was about keeping your excuses to yourself.</p>
<p>That’s the philosophy Buford brings to the Kings this season, which starts for them on Sunday afternoon when they host Melbourne United at Qudos Bank Arena.</p>
<p>The new coach effectively has a new team, one that looks big and defensively strong. I ask him if he’s aware of how the health of the fragile NBL often depends on the strength of the Kings and the brand of basketball they play.</p>
<p>Which must be music to the ears of Paul Smith, who has seen three coaches go in as many seasons, all for various reasons. He wants Buford to stick around.</p>
<p>When Buford was getting grilled in his Zoom interview in May, he had just slipped onto the Bucks coaching staff after the G-League was grounded because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I was the ninth assistant,” he says, downplaying his role as the Bucks and superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo claimed the NBA championship.</p>
<p>With that in mind, though, there’s another question worth asking is: Why? Why come to Sydney, to the NBL, when he had his toe in the door in the biggest league in the world?</p>
<p>“For sure it’s a risk,” Buford says. “I’ve never been involved in international basketball at all so it’s all new to me. But this is a chance to grow, to challenge myself …”</p>
<p>Then he glances out the window, with the sun bearing down on iconic Bondi and its beautiful people, and he smiles.</p>
<p>“There’s a foot and half of snow and minus -10C in Wisconsin right now,” he grins, all teeth again.</p>
<p>“I’m happy right here.”</p>
<div>Bold attempt by Storm to swap Brandon Smith for Tigers’ Utoikamanu</div>
<p>The Wests Tigers have flatly rejected an audacious offer from the Melbourne Storm to swap out-of-favour hooker Brandon Smith for gun forward Stefano Utoikamanu next season.</p>
<p>In a further sign of just how much Smith has angered the Storm over the manner in which he signed with the Roosters from 2023, it can be revealed recruitment manager Paul Bunn reached out to the Tigers this week, shopping Smith on a one-year deal.</p>
<p>New Tigers director of football Tim Sheens discussed the matter with Storm coach Craig Bellamy, with whom he has a long-time relationship from their days as coach and player in Canberra.</p>
<p>Sheens considered the idea of signing Smith because the Tigers have struggled to find an established hooker since Robbie Farah retired, but negotiations abruptly ended when the club was told Melbourne wanted Utoikamanu in return.</p>
<p>Also fresh in the Tigers’ minds is the fact Smith wasn’t interested in speaking to them about a long-term deal a few weeks ago because he wanted to join a top-four team.</p>
<p>The Tigers announced on Friday afternoon they had signed premiership-winning Penrith hooker Api Koroisau on a two-year deal, from 2023.</p>
<p>There is growing speculation the Storm have been shopping Smith to other clubs, despite putting out a media release at the start of the week stating he would be there in 2022.</p>
<p>Melbourne counter this by claiming rival clubs have sniffed “panic” when it’s not there, offering to take Smith off their hands if they want to get rid of him.</p>
<p>Melbourne officials deny they made the approach to the Tigers, although Tigers sources were adamant Melbourne made the first approach.</p>
<p>The offer highlights the internal struggle at the Storm about what to do with their once-loved hooker. He has infuriated some club bosses — but can they afford to let him go when they are lacking middle forwards?</p>
<p>With Harry Grant confirmed as the club’s long-term hooker, Smith will likely establish himself as their bankable No.13 should he stay.</p>
<p>Rather, Smith’s teammates accept him for being honest, the loosest of cannons who shoots from the hip.</p>
<p>“That’s just Brandon,” more than one player reported.</p>
<p>To suggest Smith is a dumbo who has carelessly trashed his club on the way out the door is too simplistic.</p>
<p>There’s a conspiracy theory he wanted to anger the Storm so much that it forced a release from the final year of his contract so he could join the Roosters immediately.</p>
<p>What is more likely is Smith’s comments on the podcast were aimed at certain powerbrokers at the Storm who he believes didn’t treat him with respect when contract negotiations commenced.</p>
<p>Indeed, Smith’s family have angered some Storm officials with remarks made on social media, adding to the tension between club and player.</p>
<p>For their part, Melbourne argue they have stuck by Smith through thick and thin, most recently “the mystery white powder” scandal that led to both him and Cameron Munster being fined and banned for one match.</p>
<p>Once considered two peas in a party pod, Smith and Munster appear to be worlds apart, something not lost on the Storm.</p>
<p>While Munster has come out of rehab bright-eyed and training with an energy few have seen from him before, Smith has been on a whirlwind tour of the eastern seaboard, talking to clubs and talking up his drinking prowess.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to see the character drained out of Smith, although rugby league and its media have a way of killing personalities.</p>
<p>But he should be mindful, at the very least, about being used up by people who don’t have his best interests at heart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roosters players have reached out to him, telling him to tone down his public commentary and focus on footy — wherever that might be when the season starts.</p>
<div>Why is Shane Warne so harsh in his criticism of Australian players?</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Why is Shane Warne so harsh in his criticism of Australian players?</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Andrew Webster</h5>Chief Sports Writer</div><div> <span><time>December 7, 2021 — 5.00am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Talk about having a glass jaw. A wax jaw, actually.</p>
<p>In December 1997, Shane Warne bounced into a media conference in Melbourne in great spirits. He was there to unveil a waxwork double of himself commissioned by the world-famous Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.</p>
<p>Warne hammed it up for the cameras, applying his trademark white zinc cream to the figure’s nose and lips.</p>
<p>“Feel free to ask any questions,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>At the time, there had been robust discussion about the leg-spinner’s weight. Australia coach Geoff Marsh had raised concerns, on the record, about Warne’s expanding waistline, even questioning his dietary choices.</p>
<p>“This was obviously done a few months ago,” one reporter said to Warne, referring to the slender depiction in wax. “Which would you prefer?”</p>
<p>The temperature in the room quickly fell below zero. The colour drained from Warnie’s face.</p>
<p>“That’s why I don’t answer any questions from you blokes,” Warne said. “That’s it, you’ve ruined it. Thanks very much.”</p>
<p>Then he stormed off the podium and out of the room, leaving the waxwork version of himself to answer any further questions.</p>
<p>Not too well, I’m thinking. He’d probably ban himself for life, as he did several cricket reporters during his playing career whenever they wrote something he didn’t like.</p>
<p>Warne is entitled to his opinion, of course. More than any of us. That’s what comes with being the greatest at something.</p>
<p>He’s also one of those former players, of any code, who doesn’t tip-toe a line of diplomacy so that nobody gets upset. But there’s a difference between brutal honesty and brutal nastiness.</p>
<p>His vicious attacks on some of the current Australian team reek of a former player saying something outlandish to generate a headline; to remain as relevant in retirement as he was as a player.</p>
<p>He’s a clickbait content producer’s dream.</p>
<p>How do you know Santa’s almost here? Warnie’s giving it to Starc again. Starc is Warne’s modern-day Daryll Cullinan.</p>
<p>The Starc camp has refused to engage in Warne’s comments, which is probably wise, although I like the approach from Usman Khawaja after Warne said two years ago he didn’t exhibit enough “energy”.</p>
<p>At the coin toss for the Marsh Cup final, a grinning Khawaja took three strides and energetically tossed it high into the air, creating a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>I’m not sure Warnie would’ve got the joke.</p>
<p>The only time I ever interviewed him one-on-one during his playing career was in 2003 for Inside Sport magazine.</p>
<p>It had been months in the planning — and only agreed to after promising free ad space for his new wine range, which had been launched in direct opposition to rival leggie Stuart MacGill’s wine range.</p>
<p>I quoted a line from a Peter Roebuck column in the Herald about Warne being “the greatest con artist in history” because of his ability to dismiss so many batsmen with deliveries that came straight on.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know how I’m a con artist,” he spat back.</p>
<p>As much as I tried to explain that Roebuck was speaking to his powers of deception, that he was indeed a genius, Warne still took great offence at the comparison and the question.</p>
<p>When he left, he turned to me and said: “Be good, mate. And if you can’t be good, get a pram.”</p>
<p>The magazine came back from the printers a day before the 2003 World Cup, just as Warne was returning from South Africa after testing positive to a banned diuretic.</p>
<p>He didn’t mellow in retirement, as most players do. In recent years, he’s ingratiated himself with influential media execs, hoping to bury any bad publicity about himself.</p>
<p>In 2015, he took umbrage at a News Corp column written by the late Rebecca Wilson.</p>
<p>Instead of phoning Wilson - I can almost hear her response if he had - Warne defaulted to his preferred mode of communication, sending a barrage of angry text messages to then News Corp boss John Hartigan.</p>
<p>When Ricky Ponting retired, he promised to never become one of those former players who savages current ones. Consequently, he’s the best commentator in the business for Seven.</p>
<p>When Warne speaks about cricket for Fox Sports, providing deep insight into a complex game, calling on years of experience, he’s right there alongside him.</p>
<p>They’re the areas Warne should be bowling to.</p>
<div>SCG makes bold bid for back-to-back Ashes Tests with a pink ball</div>
<p>The SCG will launch an audacious bid to host the fifth Ashes Test as a day-night match with a pink ball.</p>
<p>It has been reported that Melbourne and Hobart are the only two cities slugging it out for the Test after CA announced on Monday that Perth had lost hosting rights because of Western Australia’s hard border restrictions.</p>
<p>The Herald and The Age can reveal Venues NSW chairman Tony Shepherd has been preparing a bid after discussing the matter with NSW Liberal Party deputy leader Stuart Ayres.</p>
<p>Shepherd confirmed the SCG’s interest when contacted on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“We’re very enthusiastic to hold the fifth Test — with a pink ball,” he said. “We think a day-night Test would be very attractive to the local community and visitors who come to Sydney throughout January.</p>
<p>“We’re working with the state government about it right now about making a bid. At the moment, we have a sports-mad premier in Dominic Perrottet, a sports-mad deputy in Stuart Ayres, and a sports-mad sports minister in Natalie Ward.</p>
<p>“They want the match in Sydney.”</p>
<p>Sydney will host the fourth Test from January 5-9, which is traditionally the final Test of the summer. The fifth match is scheduled to begin on Saturday, January 15.</p>
<p>The hard-line stance from WA Premier Mark McGowan about border restrictions forced CA into abandoning the fifth Test at Optus Stadium.</p>
<p>There is a strong push for Hobart to be given hosting rights after the Test between Australia and Afghanistan scheduled for his summer was cancelled.</p>
<p>The MCG, though, is hopeful the fifth Test will be played in Melbourne. There are reports this is the preferred location for broadcasters Fox Sports and Seven.</p>
<p>For some reason, the SCG has been forgotten in the debate, presumably because of concerns the Sydney market could not sustain back-to-back Tests.</p>
<p>Shepherd argues a pink-ball Test would appeal greatly to Sydneysiders.</p>
<p>What will likely decide the matter is money with CA looking to leverage the situation to boost revenue.</p>
<p>When COVID-19 threw the schedule for last summer’s series against India into disarray, the asking price was about $3 million to host a Test outside the traditional venues.</p>
<div>Gilchrist’s wise words to Carey the blueprint for Australian cricket</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Gilchrist’s wise words to Carey the blueprint for Australian cricket</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Andrew Webster</h5>Chief Sports Writer</div><div> <span><time>December 10, 2021 — 5.00am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>It was one of the finest pieces of sports broadcasting seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Before play in the first Ashes Test at the Gabba, wicketkeeping great Adam Gilchrist was asked to present debutant Alex Carey with his baggy green.</p>
<p>The face of Fox Cricket, Gilchrist had his lapel microphone turned on, and it didn’t just take the viewer into the inner sanctum but made us part of it.</p>
<p>Every word Gilchrist spoke was worth bottling, although one part stands out.</p>
<p>During his career, Gilchrist demonstrated you could be a successful Australian cricketer and not be a prick. Not everyone who has worn the baggy green has matched those standards.</p>
<p>There’s a clear difference between entitlement and swagger, between arrogance and aggression.</p>
<p>The national team runs best when it leans towards the latter. The ball-tampering episode in South Africa showed what can happen when it leans to the former.</p>
<p>That entitlement reared its ugly little head during the SCG Test against India last summer when then captain Tim Paine petulantly sledged Ravi Ashwin and was fined for swearing at umpire Paul Wilson.</p>
<p>Some continue to paint Paine as the victim following his dramatic resignation over a sexting scandal involving a Cricket Tasmania staffer, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read that text message exchange understands that Paine was the one using sexually explicit language, while the woman essentially dismissed him. It was Paine who sent an unsolicited image of his genitalia, not her.</p>
<p>That hubris ultimately cost Paine his international career and exposed Cricket Australia as inept in handling important matters.</p>
<p>People argue there’s a demarcation between what happens on the field and off it. That horse, in professional sport, bolted long ago.</p>
<p>There’s also a myth that’s been perpetuated that Australia play their best cricket when acting like a schoolyard bully.</p>
<p>That’s also bullshit, as detailed in Herald columnist Greg Chappell’s recently released book Greg Chappell: Not Out.</p>
<p>He reveals how he confronted former coach Darren Lehmann about turning David Warner into the “attack dog” of the side.</p>
<p>The result was Sandpapergate, an episode Australian cricket might never live down.</p>
<p>Life will be different under new captain Pat Cummins, a cleanskin seemingly made for the front of Weet-Bix boxes.</p>
<p>Australia have resembled cranky bikies kicking cute puppies with steel-capped boots in the first two days of this series, but at no point have they looked like “headbutting the line”.</p>
<p>It’s a long summer, of course. Pressure and fatigue can make players — and especially the skipper — act in ways he regrets.</p>
<p>As the captain who instructed his brother, Trevor, to bowl an underarm delivery in a one-day international against New Zealand in 1981, Chappell understands that more than most.</p>
<p>But there’s a difference between an error of judgement and a team philosophy. Stick with Gilly’s. He usually knows best.</p>
<h3>Hobart in box seat for fifth Test</h3>
<p>The SCG remains hopeful it can host the fifth Ashes Test, under lights with a pink ball, although the smart money is on Hobart.</p>
<p>NSW, Victoria and Tasmania lodged their tenders to Cricket Australia on Wednesday but there’s a belief head office is mindful of how cranky Cricket Tasmania remains over the way it handled the Tim Paine affair.</p>
<p>A true federation, CA needs to keep the states onside.</p>
<p>As Alan Clarkson, another Herald legend, said of Goodman: “There has never been a finer sporting journalist than Tom Goodman, a man who loved all sport and particularly those he covered with such distinction.”</p>
<p>They will be honoured with commemorative panels in the corridor that runs behind the press and broadcast facilities in the Noble Bradman Messenger Stand.</p>
<h3>Abdo goes under the knife</h3>
<p>A big shout out to NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo, who has had emergency surgery to have his gall bladder removed.</p>
<p>One of the hardest workers in the game, Abdo has been privately struggling all year with what he believed were stomach ulcers.</p>
<p>He was in extreme pain in grand final week as COVID-19 infections in Queensland raised the possibility of the match between Penrith and Souths being postponed.</p>
<p>The pain in his tummy only eased on the final morning when state government officials allowed the decider to be held at Suncorp Stadium.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, though, he was rushed to hospital in excruciating pain. He was advised his gall bladder was infected and should be removed before it burst.</p>
<p>Typically, workaholic Abdo was back on deck within days. We wish him all the best.</p>
<h3>Grandmother of all blow-ups</h3>
<p>Fellow director James O’Neill, who owns the Butcher Shop Cafe, fired off a series of cranky emails to this column.</p>
<p>“Stick to rugby league, your [sic] better than this,” O’Neill predictably advised before following up with this missive: “64-year-old grandmother, sounds like you should be back at Newscorpse [News Corp]“.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what O’Neill has against grandmothers — or facts for that matter — but Walker is, indeed, a 64-year-old grandmother.</p>
<p>A clarification, too: Walker isn’t concerned about getting a fair hearing on the appeals panel, should she take that course of action, but the show-cause panel, which is her first avenue if she wants to return to the club.</p>
<p>The Carbine Club will hold its Christmas lunch at the SCG on Friday where a glass — and bread roll, no doubt — will be raised in honour of cricketing great Alan Davidson, who passed away on October 30.</p>
<p>(Davo would famously use a bread roll like it was a cricket ball to demonstrate the point he was making during functions).</p>
<p>The Carbine Club raises invaluable funds for junior sport, something Davidson, as a founding member of the NSW branch, was passionate about.</p>

<div>Rehab has not fixed or cured Cameron Munster</div>
<div><div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Rehab has not fixed or cured Cameron Munster</h1></div><div><div><div><h5>Andrew Webster</h5>Chief Sports Writer</div><div> <span><time>December 17, 2021 — 5.00am</time></span></div></div></div></div>
<p>Here we all were, the jackals of the press, swarming around Todd Carney in the concrete bowels of the old Sydney Football Stadium.</p>
<p>Carney had just played his first match for the Roosters, and his first in the NRL for a year, after being sacked by Canberra for a string of off-field incidents relating to alcohol.</p>
<p>After a year off the grog while playing for the Atherton Roosters in Queensland, he was snapped up by the Bondi club, repaying their faith with a man-of-the-match performance against South Sydney in round one.</p>
<p>There is no easier story to write in sport than the redemption story, but as the media pack circled Carney that Sunday evening, coach Brian Smith looked on with concern. I asked him why.</p>
<p>“Because the hard work comes when he’s not playing,” Smith said. “And that comes at the end of the season.”</p>
<p>Carney went on to have the best season of his career, guiding the Roosters to the grand final against the Dragons while also collecting the Dally M player of the year award.</p>
<p>Then the off-season came, Carney fell into old habits, the grog got the better of him again, and the Roosters released him from the final year of his contract at the end of 2011.</p>
<p>Smith was right: the hard work came when Carney didn’t have the discipline and structure of week-to-week football.</p>
<p>Todd Carney is the cautionary tale for Cameron Munster, who earlier this week laid bare his issues with alcohol and gambling.</p>
<p>In the space of just a few months, the Storm five-eighth has already completed four of the five steps to rugby league redemption.</p>
<p>The first step is the act that gets you in trouble. In this case, being filmed alongside teammates Brandon Smith and Chris Lewis in the vicinity of a “mystery white powder”.</p>
<p>The second step is finding yourself in rehab. Not that long ago, an expensive facility in Thailand was the rehab du jour for troubled footballers. Munster found one in Brisbane.</p>
<p>The third step is returning to training, looking thin and clear-skinned with the whites of your eyes sparkling like diamonds.</p>
<p>Wow! How good does he look?! That rehab really worked, didn’t it? Big year ahead for him! What odds can I get for the Dally M-Clive Churchill double?</p>
<p>The fourth step is the mea culpa interview. Munster ticked that box on Monday in a raw piece with News Corp in which he revealed he had been gambling like Kerry Packer. He also admitted to alcohol issues, but denied he had a problem with drugs.</p>
<p>It was shocking stuff, although I’d heard some of it before, from the man himself.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the Storm invited me to fly to Melbourne to interview Munster.</p>
<p>He’d come off an incredible 2017 season, which included an Origin series win for Queensland on debut, as well as playing for Australia at the World Cup.</p>
<p>A drunken scuffle with Ben Hunt in Darwin, though, gave a portent into what was happening away from football. The Storm were close to cutting him.</p>
<p>During our interview, Munster revealed how he’d turned his life around: he hadn’t drunk alcohol for 10 weeks and was working with leading Melbourne psychologist Jacqui Louder.</p>
<p>He also talked candidly, just as he did this week, about how dark life had become.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of love for Munster in Melbourne right now. He should be applauded for the steps he’s taken, although you sense he had no alternative.</p>
<p>But he’s not cured. He’s not fixed. Addiction is a riddle that’s managed, not solved through the ticking of certain boxes, as Storm chairman Matt Tripp suggested last month.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘If I was preparing him for a Melbourne Cup, you could say he’s doing really well in the early stages of his prep.’</p><cite>Matt Tripp on Cameron Munster</cite></blockquote>
<p>Doubtless, Tripp has the best intentions for Munster, like all his players, but footballers aren’t horses. They might do super-human things on the field but are as fragile as the rest of us off it, perhaps more.</p>
<p>The fifth step of rugby league redemption is the standout season.</p>
<p>Life is far harder. When it comes flooding in, Munster will need all the support he can get.</p>
<h3>Punting sideline for News Corp</h3>
<p>The rumour about ARL Commission chairman and Racing NSW chief executive Peter V’landys heading News Corp’s foray into online wagering has been doing the rounds for about a year.</p>
<p>He’s repeatedly denied it whenever I’ve put it on him, and laughed it off again in response to a Herald report on Monday that the media company’s wagering arm was about to take flight.</p>
<p>V’landys might not be heading up any new bookmaking business but claims from within News Corp that it’s not going to happen appear to be a fallacy.</p>
<p>A document from executive recruitment firm Alex Kaar, which has been obtained by this column, outlines the new role of general manager of wagering brands for News Perform, the News Corp business formed after it bought Punters.com and Racenet.</p>
<p>In other words, here’s some inside mail before you bet up, but if you do your cash on the horsies, fear not — we can spot you until payday!</p>
<h3>Harbour desire for Kyrgios</h3>
<p>Nick Kyrgios’ new love interest? The grand old dame otherwise known as Sydney.</p>
<p>The tennis star has been spotted all over Sin City the past few weeks, including back-to-back appearances at Sydney Kings matches at Qudos Bank Arena.</p>
<p>Last weekend, he was seen sweating it out during a gruelling session with former Davis Cup teammate Jordan Thompson at Sydney Olympic Park.</p>
<h3>Vale ‘Skull’ Mulholland</h3>
<p>It’s with the heaviest of hearts that I report that Raiders recruitment man Peter Mulholland has lost a long, brave battle with cancer.</p>
<p>The news came through late on Thursday that the man better known as “Skull” had passed away, aged 68. He was, quite simply, a ripper. I called him in January to chat footy. He was in the hospital, getting pumped full of drugs.</p>
<p>He loved the game more than anyone I knew. And that’s saying something. Condolences to the Mulholland family, about whom he always spoke with great affection.</p>

<div>Skin in the game: Why rising boxer Harry Garside has icons tattooed on his leg</div>
<p>Harry Garside’s impressive art collection should be framed and hung on a wall. Instead, his gallery is his right leg.</p>
<p>That’s exactly where the 24-year-old boxer, who became a cult figure during the Tokyo Olympics, wants it; nice and close so he can draw inspiration from it whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Garside wasn’t just the man who claimed Australia’s first boxing medal at the Olympics in 33 years with bronze in the lightweight division — he captured the nation’s imagination with his infectious passion for his craft.</p>
<p>The fire in Garside is reflected in the six fighters tattooed on his leg, all of which were done in 2019 by his Balinese friend and tattoo artist Dewa Koko.</p>
<p>It’s some roll call: Muhammad Ali, Bernard Hopkins, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roy Jones jnr, Andre Ward and Vasiliy Lomachenko.</p>
<p>You have to be more than a fighter to get on Garside’s leg, though.</p>
<p>“Mayweather beat up his partner — I’m not supporting that either. They were two unbelievable athletes but the people on my leg I admire for being good humans as well as good athletes.”</p>
<p>The young boxer has the first bout of his professional career when he takes on Fijian southpaw Sachin Mudaliar (9-1, 1KO) on the undercard of the fight between former footballers Paul Gallen and Darcy Lussick at The Star on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Having prepared six world champions including Jeff Fenech, Kostya Tszyu and Jeff Harding, Lewis understands a boxer’s fists can only take him so far. Character means as much as a knockout punch.</p>
<p>Ahead of his pro debut, Garside talked about the six legends that have helped him this far.</p>
<p>Ali was Garside’s introduction to boxing, through necessity as much as anything else.</p>
<p>I ask Lewis if Ali was the greatest boxer he’d seen. The response surprises.</p>
<p>The former undisputed middleweight and light heavyweight world champion provided the type of redemptive story only boxing can produce.</p>
<p>One of the greatest middleweight boxers of all time, Leonard made a name for himself against the likes of Marvin Hagler, Tommy Hearns and Roberto Duran in the 1980s.</p>
<p>When Danny Green knocked out Roy Jones jnr in December 2009, much of Australia rejoiced. Garside was one of the few who did not.</p>
<p>No boxer has had a greater influence on Garside’s career from afar than the Ukrainian, who had a long amateur career before going pro.</p>
<p>That’s why Garside has two tattoos of Lomachenko on his leg, not just one.</p>
<p>Much was made during the Olympics of how Garside started doing ballet to hone his skills.</p>
<p>Lewis is adamant that Australia’s latest world champion, George Kambosos jnr, would have Lomachenko’s measure if they ever fight fought — but is pleased Garside looks up to the Ukrainian.</p>
<p>“I love work rate in my fighters,” Lewis says. “Harry was talking about not being a hard puncher. He’ll have a good KO record when it’s all over because of the volume of punches he’ll start throwing.</p>
<p>“He can turn it into a game of chess. Lomachenko optimises that. That was something Kostya could do, too. I’m certain Harry can do the same thing.”</p>
<p>The last fighter Garside added to his leg is American Andre Ward, who shocked the boxing world in 2017 when he retired at the age of 33 at the top of his game. He undefeated having won world titles at super middleweight and light heavyweight.</p>
<p>“Of all the pictures in Harry’s art gallery, Andre Ward is the bloke I want to see him emulate the most,” he says. “Get out on his terms. Get out 10 fights too early instead of one too late.”</p>
<p>And if Garside does that, if he becomes Lewis’ seventh world champion, will he contemplate making the blank canvas of his left leg a tattooed tribute to himself?</p>
<p>“Nah,” Garside smiles. “I like seeing a bit of skin.”</p>

<p>There’s a scene in the third season of the TV series Succession in which image-obsessed Kendall Roy issues a directive to underling cousin Greg Hirsch.</p>
<p>Kendall: “I might need you to slide the sociopolitical thermometer up the nation’s ass and take a reading, K?”</p>
<p>Greg: “Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. Media monitoring department over here.”</p>
<p>I’m not certain you’d want to go anywhere near Australia’s ass right now, let alone have any chance of finding a sociopolitical thermometer on the empty shelves at Coles.</p>
<p>Which brings us, of course, to Novak Djokovic, who has been positioned - by himself, his family, and his supporters - as some modern-day Muhammad Ali, oppressed by The System.</p>
<p>But come on. Come on! He did four days in a dodgy Melbourne hotel. Not four years.</p>
<p>Djokovic has been emboldened by many people, but none more than Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley, who is less known in tennis circles as a tournament director than a name-dropping fanboy to the world’s leading superstar players each January.</p>
<p>Sometimes it really does pay to say nothing — or at the very least keep your mobile phone in its holster.</p>
<p>Djokovic has a bigger fanboy than Tiley. His is Nick Kygrios.</p>
<p>Nicky K believes the media are to blame for all this — who else? — while also reminding all concerned about Djokovic’s support during the bushfire appeal two summers ago like it is somehow relevant.</p>
<p>This argument from Kyrgios about himself and other players, dropping the names of foundations and charities they’re involved with, is wearing thin.</p>
<p>Charity doesn’t buy you anything; whether it’s favourable press or free passage at the border. You do something for those less fortunate because it’s the right thing to do, not to trumpet it down the track at a convenient time.</p>
<p>“If this was a normal person, they wouldn’t have to deal with this media side bullshit,” Kyrgios said when Djokovic was detained. “His life is probably hard enough as it is. I know what that’s like.”</p>
<p>He’s right. Normal people couldn’t possibly understand how hard life is for Novak Djokovic, who has an estimated personal wealth of $302 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bernard Tomic figured this was the right time to play the COVID card while bombing out in Australian Open qualifying.</p>
<p>Of all the inventive ways Tomic has lost matches during his train wreck of a career, this one’s the best.</p>
<blockquote><p>The inability to read the room isn’t limited to tennis players. Some rugby league players couldn’t read the room with Google Translate.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I cannot believe nobody’s getting tested,” Tomic fumed at the chair umpire. “They’re allowing players to come on the court with rapid tests in their room. Come on. No official PCR testing.”</p>
<p>Tomic on Thursday revealed he had tested positive for the virus, like tens of thousands of people in this country, but that doesn’t mean he has to take it out on the poor chair umpire.</p>
<p>Tomic has decided he wants Australia in is his corner from now on. “I just want the Australian public to get behind me,” he said before his match against Russian Roman Safiullin.</p>
<p>A tip for free, Tank Engine: Australia will rally behind you if you try, regardless of the result. It’s less likely to get around you when you start whinging to the umpire about having COVID while trailing 1-2 in the second set.</p>
<p>The inability to read the room isn’t limited to tennis players. Some rugby league players couldn’t read the room with Google Translate.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, it’s just forcing players and staff to isolate.</p>
<p>They’ve also banned public transport and limited visitors to houses to 10 people. There are no restrictions on outdoor activities.</p>
<p>They are also required to get a rapid test, which is provided by the club, every day. My kingdom to find just one under $50.</p>
<p>Imagine it. Having to drink schooners in a beer garden. Or sipping a latte outside a cafe. To keep the comp going. To save your multimillion-dollar contract.</p>
<p>Some players have reacted angrily via social media, wondering why they got vaccinated, while the RLPA wants players to live and work under the same conditions as the rest of the community.</p>
<p>From now on, all players can work from home. Just email in that weights session. Ball work? Let’s Zoom it.</p>
<p>And when the season starts, if a squad is decimated by COVID positives or close contacts, just grab a few blokes off the street to satisfy the big, fat broadcast contract that delivers the players enormous salaries each year.</p>
<p>Players keep reminding us about the sacrifices they’ve made in the past two years to keep the competition going.</p>
<p>Let’s examine that for a moment.</p>
<p>For the past two seasons, players have taken pay cuts, like most areas across the game. This season, though, the NRL is handing back $6m after finishing last year with an unexpected surplus of $50m.</p>
<p>“Thought I was getting the stupid vax so I didn’t have to do another year of this shit,” Canberra five-eighth Jack Wighton fumed on social media.</p>
<p>No, you got the stupid vax so you wouldn’t get sick, wouldn’t infect others — and keep your job.</p>
<p>Alternatively, just remove your head from your own. That’ll do it.</p>

<div>‘I muted it’: Schutt relishing Ashes return after TV frustration during break from game</div>
<p>A few months ago, Australia’s star bowler Megan Schutt did something she had never done before. She watched the team play on television.</p>
<p>Normally, even when she’s not playing, she is on the sidelines; cheering, yelling and making her opinions heard.</p>
<p>Watching from afar was not something she enjoyed - but she has had to adapt to many new experiences since the birth of her first child, Rylee.</p>
<p>“I must admit, I muted it,” she said of watching the Indian series in September from her living room.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t stand to hear any of the commentators as I really disagreed with a lot of it. It was strange. I’ve just never watched the girls on telly before.”</p>
<p>As she prepares for the women’s Ashes, Schutt has opened up on her break from international cricket and the balancing act of being a cricketer and a mother.</p>
<p>The decision to step away from cricket was huge for Schutt. She had not missed a series since 2014.</p>
<p>Her wife Jess Holyoake gave birth to Rylee in August following an emergency caesarean section after 28 weeks and six days of pregnancy. The couple spent the first few months of Rylee’s life in and out of hospital.</p>
<p>Despite those difficulties, Schutt is giving herself no excuses before the Ashes and has set herself the goal of being the series’ leading wicket taker.</p>
<p>“That has always been my goal, and yes it’s been a while since I’ve played, but hopefully I can just get back into the swing of things,” she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘I reckon [for] three days I was down-and-out proper, it wasn’t nice.’</p><cite>Megan Schutt on catching COVID-19</cite></blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been playing long enough now that I back my skill set. Hopefully [my teammates] back me to jump straight back into it as well.”</p>
<p>Schutt’s goal was made even more difficult when the couple contracted COVID-19 just after Christmas.</p>
<p>She said she originally had no concerns about being physically able to return to action - until the virus hit.</p>
<p>“Getting back into running, that was a bit of a shock to the system,” she said. “I got knocked down quite a bit ... I reckon [for] three days I was down-and-out proper, it wasn’t nice.”</p>
<p>Schutt hopes getting the virus in December means she will get through the Ashes and World Cup without catching it again.</p>
<p>“It was just good to get around them [the players] again, to be honest, they’re a good bunch,” she said.</p>
<p>“But the protocols are a bit different, like having to wear a mask any time apart from when you’re bowling is a bit strange.”</p>
<p>The squad is preparing for a warm-up match on Tuesday against the Australia A side before the first Twenty20 clash in the multi-format series in Adelaide on Thursday.</p>
<p>Another playing returning to the side after an extended break is spinner Jess Jonassen, who missed the India series due to a leg injury.</p>
<p>Jonassen said she was looking forward to guiding team newcomer Alana King.</p>
<p>“I’ve looked at myself as trying to lead this spin group any time I’m a part of it,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been fortunate enough to play for Australia for a number of years and be involved in the set-up for a number of years. I just try and impart whatever experiences I’ve had with whoever the other spinners are.”</p>
<div>Five burning questions following a one-sided Ashes series</div>
<p>With Test tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the coming months, plenty of hard work and hard decisions lie ahead. Here are five key questions to emerge from the five-Test series.</p>
<p>England’s immediate future has more tough questions to answer but their best-possible bowling attack is still capable of serving it up to the tourists in the 2023 Ashes series in England.</p>
<h3>What needs to go right for Australia for them to conquer the world?</h3>
<p>Marcus Harris needs to kick on otherwise the openers berths are a potential weakness with David Warner and Usman Khawaja both 35. Australia do not need Alex Carey to be the next Adam Gilchrist.</p>
<p>If he can be as safe with the gloves as Gilchrist and scrounge backs to the wall type runs that will be enough. Get these three areas right and Australia will have a side capable of returning to the top and staying there.</p>
<h3>Will Scott Boland keep his place in the XI when all the fast bowlers are fit?</h3>
<p>A more pertinent question is how often Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc will all be available together given the busy schedule and question marks over player availability in Pakistan.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for Boland to tip out a fit Hazlewood, but selectors should now be confident the Victorian, who made his name on the once lifeless MCG track, can make an impact in any conditions.</p>
<h3>How good is Cameron Green?</h3>
<p>Call off the search, Australia have found their next Keith Miller. What a luxury it is for Pat Cummins to have a player who can hold down No.6 and knock over top-line batters with 140 km/h seamers.</p>
<p>Even if his batting fell away, Green, with his pace, accuracy and steep bounce, would vie strongly for a berth as a frontline speedster.</p>
<h3>What’s eating Steve Smith?</h3>
<p>It is hard to comprehend the man hailed as the best since Don Bradman has hit just the once century since the 2019 Ashes. Though many players would accept Smith’s current numbers, he is nowhere near the levels we have come to expect from him.</p>
<p>Opposition sides are having success targeting his body and packing the on-side to prevent find a relieving single. It has also muddled his radar, leading to un-Smith-like snicks and misses.</p>
<p>The great batter is a player who thrives on matches to be at his best, but the pandemic has denied him this volume. He may just need time to return to his pomp.</p>
<h3>Can England recover from such a shattering defeat and challenge Australia next year?</h3>
<p>As pathetic as England were, they have enough talent with the ball to compete with Australia for the urn at home.</p>
<p>Improvement will have to come quickly as Joe Root and Ben Stokes are their only world-class batters.</p>
<div>‘Fat shaming’ and drinking: Inside England’s Ashes tour from hell</div>
<p>This was the theory: “We want to travel to Australia fitter, faster, leaner, more ready than ever before,” said England head coach Chris Silverwood last year.</p>
<p>This, according to one player, was the reality: “Everyone has got a story about how shambolic it has been”.</p>
<p>From the moment England’s players set off for Australia on November 4, everything that could go wrong did go wrong, although the disaster was set in motion well before even then.</p>
<p>When the issue of England’s awful selections for the first two Tests was put to Silverwood, he said the series was “a marathon, not a sprint”.</p>
<p>Leach was not picked because England had been spooked by how he was mauled in Brisbane. They ended up using two part-timers, with Ollie Robinson bowling off-spin, while Nathan Lyon took five wickets for Australia.</p>
<p>Selection was made mainly by the coach and captain, but also chief scout James Taylor, with Bobat contributing. Players were frustrated that Taylor, who was not even in Australia, could have so much influence from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Fitness levels clearly dipped for some players as the tour went on. Robinson’s conditioning was an issue from the first Test – when he spent time off the field – but became a recurring theme in every game.</p>
<p>There were also concerns over a drinking culture and whether restrictions were loosened too much in the weeks leading up to the series, and before the COVID bubble was tightened when families arrived.</p>
<p>The midnight curfew introduced by Sir Andrew Strauss will certainly return when COVID bubbles go, the players failing to convince the management they can be fully trusted.</p>
<p>Silverwood’s management style was also an issue. He finds press conferences and broadcast interviews uncomfortable and struggles to express himself, which begs the question of how he handles team meetings and speaks to players.</p>
<p>There are mitigating circumstances: Insiders felt it was just because Silverwood had too much on his plate and struggled to delegate to his staff, a situation not helped by him contracting COVID.</p>
<p>Also, minimal communication can be interpreted as strong leadership when the team are winning, but with this particular group – few of whom are natural leaders – more interaction was needed.</p>
<h3>Tactics and performance</h3>
<p>Ultimately, Burns lost his place, not just because of his form, but due to his failure to speak more regularly in meetings. And when communication was clear, it still backfired.</p>
<p>After the Adelaide Test, Silverwood made the batsmen watch footage of their dismissals, but the exchanges became heated as batsmen and bowlers lined up against each other.</p>
