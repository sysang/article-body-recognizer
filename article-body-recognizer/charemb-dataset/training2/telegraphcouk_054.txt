<p>Tracey Stevens never planned to retire young. A 55-year-old mother of three from Maidenhead, she was working as the chief executive officer for a charity when she was involved in a near-fatal accident in 2013. </p>
<p>While rushing between work meetings, she was thrown over her bike’s handlebars and had life-saving brain surgery and facial reconstruction. </p>
<p>‘I was lucky to be alive,’ she says. ‘When I arrived back home, I sat in my lounge surrounded by flowers from friends. It was like witnessing my own funeral. That moment, I knew I wanted to change my life.’</p>
<p>With her two older children at university, Tracey and her husband upped sticks with their youngest, who was nine at the time, resettling in the south of France to live in the small, run-down house they had bought there some years earlier. </p>
<p>‘It was a big shock losing the salary at first,’ she admits. ‘But now, in France, I realise I don’t need much to live a nice life. I have the outdoors and my animals. I love it.’</p>
<p>‘The main compromise I made in those earlier years was in parenting: I never took long maternity leave and I managed my children rather than being emotionally available. But that’s changed now, I’m a better parent.’</p>
<p>She is one of a new wave of women who are quitting their careers and taking early retirement – very early retirement.</p>
<a>Legal General Retail Retirement</a> has found that 1.3 million people plan to retire early due to the pandemic. One in four 18- to 34-year-olds are also setting early retirement as a new financial goal, according to research by wealth management firm
<a>Rest Less</a>, a digital community for midlifers. ‘Many people are deciding that early retirement, even if it means a more frugal existence, is the more attractive option.’
<p>For younger generations, <a>saving this hard can be challenging</a>, especially at a time when many are struggling to get on the property ladder, never mind pay off mortgages very early. </p>
<a>Milestone Mums</a>, helping other women find their purpose.
<p>One solution is to synchronise your retirement date with your partner’s. ‘When we work with clients, we try to make their retirement dates the same so that they can enjoy their new lives together,’ explains Tamsin Caine.</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t plan to get pregnant at 16. The summer before I was due to go to sixth form, I dropped out of school, and moved out of my parents’ home in west London into temporary housing an hour and a half away. </p>
<p>They were supportive but I needed to be independent. I was with my baby’s father, trying to make it work, but he didn’t live with me. A month after my 17th birthday, I gave birth to Luke.</p>
<p>When I was still pregnant with Luke, I was enrolled on a young mums project in Kensington and Chelsea, my home borough. It was a lifeline. Before I joined the group I was pretty lonely. </p>
<p>Through the programme I gained a sense of structure and purpose. Before that, I had felt pretty rudderless, sitting at home with a baby, but once a week I had to do an hour of volunteering, complete some form of exercise and learn a skill. </p>
<p>Later, I got a job as a youth worker off the back of my volunteering and by the time I was doing my Gold Award, when Luke was seven, I was a full-time professional youth worker and had a degree in youth work.</p>

<p>It’s three days into January and that new year’s resolution list is already looking unsustainable. Still, it’s not too late to rescue a scintilla of self respect – if you follow our handy swap list:</p>
<h2>You want to… give up alcohol for January </h2>
<p>You swap for… not drinking at home in the week. Unless a friend comes round/you get some good news/you get some bad news/you come across the last of the special burgundy that got hidden behind the hurricane lamp in the larder. </p>
<h2>You want to… step up your grooming </h2>
<p>You swap for… buying a new washbag to replace the toothpaste encrusted mildewed one.</p>
<h2>You want to… take up boxing</h2>
<p>You swap for... vigorously plumping up the sofa cushions morning and evening.</p>
<h2>You want to… beef up your exercise routine</h2>
<p>Particular emphasis is placed on weight bearing (walking the dog is Not Enough) </p>
<p>You swap for… standing on one leg while brushing your teeth/hopping across the kitchen every morning. </p>
<h2>You want to... lose your Covid stone plus the Christmas 4lbs </h2>
<p>You swap for… skipping teatime/all cake/all crisps/all non slimline mixers/puddings/Danish pastries/chocolate. And you might skip breakfast if you’ve had a reasonable night’s sleep.</p>
<h2>You want to… buy fewer clothes</h2>
<p>You swap for (because there are some cracking bargains in the sales)… banning the purchase of coats and jeans until further notice.</p>
<h2>You want to… eat less meat </h2>
<p>You swap for… having a 100 per cent vegetarian breakfast/avoiding bacon and sausages when possible.</p>
<h2>You want to… watch less TV </h2>
<p>You swap for… only watching TV featuring Olivia Colman, Stephen Graham, Claire Foy, Dominic West, David Tennant or Keeley Hawes. Which gives you something to watch pretty much every night of the week.</p>
<h2>You want to… garden more </h2>
<p>You swap for… rewilding your back lawn, eg not mowing.</p>
<h2>You want to… go wild/cold water swimming </h2>
<p>You swap for… buying all the gear in preparation, especially the after swimming wear (Dryrobe, Wylding boiler suit, etc.), packing it all in the back of the car, and keeping an eagle eye on tides, wind etc. </p>
<h2>You want to… stop talking about the same old stuff for yet another year. </h2>
<p>Topics to be avoided will include: Is Covid or Brexit to blame? Can you get the same strain twice? When is a party a work meeting and vice versa? </p>
<p>You swap for… not being the first to mention Meghan and Harry.</p>
<h2>You want to… move out of your “tired” house</h2>
<p> ...and into a manageable flat with Hive and underfloor heating and a utility room. </p>
<p>You swap for… scrolling through Right Move properties every night in bed and buying The Week for the property spread of heaven, as you have done for years.</p>
<h2>You want to… see A Lot More of your family in 2022 (after the many disappointments of the past couple of years) </h2>
<p>You swap for… texting them to say you want to see A Lot More of them this year and must get something in the diary as soon as possible. </p>
<h2>You want to… read a classic a week </h2>
<p>You swap for…listening to an audio book in the car instead of Absolute Radio 70s.</p>
<h2>You want to… be more Beatles/wife of Beatles (thanks to seeing so much of them in 2021) </h2>
<p>As in look cool, wear hats and big sunglasses and swingy coats.</p>
<p>You swap for…getting out your mum’s pearls and a fake fur shrug and channelling Margaret, Duchess of Argyll. </p>
<h2>You want to… drastically reduce your screen time </h2>
<p>You swap for… not taking your phone into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Here’s to a less stressy 2022.</p>

<header> <h1> Elizabeth Holmes' lawyers argue 'inflammatory' media coverage risks biased Theranos fraud trial </h1> <p> Lab testing start-up founder's lawyers argue trial coverage is 'pervasively negative' and could bias the jury </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Field <time> 28 May 2021 • 11:19am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Lawyers for Elizabeth Holmes, the former chief executive of collapsed lab testing start-up Theranos, have demanded a California court extend its jury selection over media coverage labelling her a “raging psychopath”.</p>
<p>Ms Holmes, who was dubbed the “female Steve Jobs”, <a>is accused of defrauding investors and doctors</a> through her company, which promised fast and accurate blood tests using just a pin-prick of blood.</p>
<p>At one stage, Theranos was valued at $9bn (£6.3bn) and had its testing machines installed at pharmacies. But prosecutors allege the devices were ineffective and gave inaccurate results.</p>
<p>However, lawyers for Ms Holmes filed a motion on Thursday arguing negative media coverage of the founder could bias the jury and have demanded the court expand its search. </p>
<p>In a filing, the lawyers said: “The publicity is pervasively negative. [Ms Homes is] routinely referred to in derisive and inflammatory terms that are directly relevant to the wire fraud charges in this case.</p>
<p>“Media coverage describes her as a ‘fraud’, ‘fraudster’, ‘con artist’, ‘disgraced Theranos founder’, ‘scam artist’, and ‘raging psychopath’.”</p>
<p>Ms Holmes, 37, and former Theranos president Sunny Balwani face two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud for exaggerating the company’s potential revenues. </p>
<p>Ms Holmes will deny wrongdoing and claim her investors, who <a>included News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch</a>, knew they were betting on risky technology.</p>
<p>The collapse of the company was the subject of the book Bad Blood with plans for a film adaption.</p>
<p>Ms Holmes dropped out of Stanford at 19 to found Theranos in 2003. It collapsed in 2018.</p>

<div> <div> <p>When inspectors came to the site, staff would falsify results. Unsurprisingly, it became a workplace beset by paranoia, secrecy, and strict NDAs.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Some who felt uncomfortable with the deception began to leave, including Tyler Shultz (grandson of investor and board member George Shultz) and Erika Chung, both of whom would become whistleblowers and who feature in Gibney’s documentary.</p>
<p>Another former employee leaked 75 hours of in-house footage, filmed at Holmes’ direction, to Gibney.</p>
<a>Fyre festival documentaries</a>, which also featured extensive in-house footage. "These people are so consumed with self-regard that they are filming their own biography as it’s happening; they don’t see that the downfall is coming."
<p>However, Gibney doesn’t agree with those who call Holmes, who is set to appear in court for a status hearing on April 22, “the Millennial Madoff”.</p>

<header> <h1> Elizabeth Holmes faces moment of reckoning for Theranos blood testing scandal </h1> <p> The Theranos founder, whose trial is due to begin in August, faces criminal fraud charges that could land her in prison for up to 20 years </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Margi Murphy, US Technology Reporter, San Francisco <time> 12 May 2021 • 9:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>When Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes came walking through the office, employees would mutter “E is coming”, under their breath.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to say her name out loud,” says Cheryl Gafner, a former receptionist at the biotechnology company. “It was like Beetlejuice - if you said it three times then s*** would happen.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing quite like Elizabeth Holmes’ case because there’s nothing quite like Silicon Valley,” says Danny Cevallos, a criminal lawyer who appears on MSNBC and NBC News. </p>
<p>Once billed as the "female Steve Jobs" for founding a $9bn (£6.37bn) startup that promised to revolutionise the lab test industry, the 37-year-old’s story has become a cautionary tale among entrepreneurs.</p>
<a> lying about Theranos’ ability to produce accurate test results </a>from tiny amounts of blood, a deceit that cost investors and put patients in harm’s way.
<p>Last week, a pregnant Holmes and her lawyers appeared in federal court in California for a pre-trial hearing, ahead of her criminal trial in August. Balwani will be tried separately next year.</p>
<p>As part of their defence, Holmes’ team attacked the credibility of Stephen Master, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, who will argue against the accuracy of Theranos tests.</p>
<p>Amy Saharia, a lawyer for Holmes, claimed that Master’s opinions are “based on emails and customer complaints” and are “not a scientifically valid way to reach conclusions”.</p>
<p>But, for patients and doctors who say they received inaccurate test results, and investors who lost their cash when <a>Theranos </a>folded in 2018, puffery can only take a company so far.</p>
<p>Holmes also enlisted the help of Balwani, her confidante and would-be lover, to help start the company. Balwani had made his money helping create a software company called CommerceBid and had no experience in biology or medical devices. </p>
<p>Holmes quickly crafted a brand that would be considered the Apple of blood tests, securing more than $700m in investment. </p>
<p>It was only when Holmes began to market her product, an “Edison” device that acted like a mini blood testing lab, that questions began to be raised about Theranos’ promises. </p>
<p>One big name, Walgreens, was left facing shareholder and consumer legal action after it placed Edison machines in some of its shops in California and Arizona. </p>

<header> <h1> Is Eton's rite of passage to Oxbridge diminishing? Why some parents think so </h1> <p> A few years ago, boys at Eton had a very good chance of getting into Oxford or Cambridge. Now, that's changing </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Twigg <time> 13 August 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>According to Orr-Ewing, Oxbridge dons wanting to improve diversity look at more than simply the school, and will be assessing how much help applicants have had in honing their ideas, no matter where they have been educated. </p>
<p>Equally, ambitious parents are only now realising that Eton losing its grip on Oxbridge is perhaps a smaller problem than the vast privilege the school confers, and what that means in certain increasingly egalitarian industries.</p>
<header> <h1> Are nutritionists and wealthy families a recipe for disaster? </h1> <p> Clean eating is in vogue among the rich and famous, but that doesn't mean children should get stuck in too, say experts </p> </header>

<p>Although the Duchess, who employs an exclusive Norland nanny to do most of her family’s day-to-day cooking, may wish her brood would tuck into tempeh and tofu instead, it turns out she might be the one striking the better balance. </p>
<p>Sarah Bushell, a specialist child dietitian who has worked as a consultant to food brands and restaurants, is often asked to unpick problems that arise when families are too obsessed with clean eating. </p>
<p>Bushell adds: “I spend time with parents on how they can talk in a more neutral way about food with their children. And incorporate things like chocolate all the time, even if it’s just once a week on a Friday, for example.” </p>
