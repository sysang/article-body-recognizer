<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Playing the Six Nations in England is price worth paying to get fans in stadiums </h1> <p> Tournament needs crowds to create its unique flavour and all avenues must be explored in these unusual times </p> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Sir Ian McGeechan <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:01pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>No one wants to see the Six Nations go behind closed doors again. Last year’s championship was a pretty soulless affair, and it has been wonderful to see crowds back in stadiums again in recent months.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, that is what we would have over the next few months. But this is not an ideal world. It is an ever-changing situation and going behind closed doors might ultimately prove to be the “least worst” option.</p>
<p>It would certainly be preferable to cancelling the championship or trying to shoehorn it into a non-existent space in the calendar.</p>
<p>But I would like to see the Six Nations exhaust all possibilities first, to allow as many fans as possible to attend. Crowds are what give games energy.</p>
<p>But the possibility must surely be explored, at least for Wales and Scotland. As a player, given the choice of playing in an empty stadium at Murrayfield or a full house of Scots just over the border, I know which I would have chosen.</p>

<header> <h1> Calls to play Six Nations ties in England to avoid behind-closed-doors matches </h1> <p> Plus: Latest player and fan Covid restrictions currently in place for all nations and the matches that will be impacted </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Daniel Schofield ; Tom Morgan ; Kate Rowan and Ben Coles <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:31pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Six Nations organisers are facing calls to consider moving Scotland and Wales home games to England to avoid behind-closed-doors matches if Covid-19 restrictions remain.</p>
<p>Crowds for sporting events in Wales have been banned since Boxing Day while Scotland has limited sporting spectators to 500 in regulations to help restrict the spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Six Nations organisers held talks with the governments and unions on Tuesday and have explored contingency plans for moving some matches behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The challenge of staging the next round of Champions Cup next weekend seems steep enough.</p>
<p>European Professional Club Rugby, organiser of the Champions Cup, is hoping to gain travel exemptions for clubs to send teams to France who banned non-essential travel from the UK last month, which prompted a host of matches to be postponed.</p>
<h2>State of play: Restrictions currently in place for fans and players – and Six Nations games affected </h2>
<p>By Kate Rowan and Ben Coles</p>
<p>Games: Feb 26 v Wales, Mar 12 v Ireland</p>

<p>Current restrictions on fans: No limits, but attendees will be required to show proof of either double vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test result within 48 hours of the event</p>
