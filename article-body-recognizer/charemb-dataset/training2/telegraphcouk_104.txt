<h3>No need for tougher Covid restrictions in England yet, says Sajid Javid</h3>
<p>Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has said that there is nothing in the data to suggest the Government needs to toughen Covid-19 restrictions in England, but that it was still too early to know how hospitals would cope.</p>
<p>Mr Javid said it was an incredibly challenging time for hospitals as the omicron variant of coronavirus surges, including among older people, and around six hospital trusts have declared a critical incident due to a shortage of workers.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in the data at this point that suggests we need to move away from Plan B," he told reporters.</p>

<h3>How a novelty plane restaurant in Palestine is keeping dreams of an independent state alive</h3>
<p>It took two decades, cost a hundred thousand dollars and was nearly scuppered by the outbreak of war. </p>
<p>But the dream of two Palestinian brothers is finally ready for take-off, as they open a patriotic restaurant in a converted Boeing jet atop a mountain, reports James Rothwell.</p>
<p>Ata and Khamis al-Sairafi, both 60, bought the decommissioned plane in 1998 and will fully open the venue in spring with a grand ceremony featuring costumed flight attendants. </p>
<p>It is not the first time a plane has been converted into a restaurant, with similar themed restaurants opening in Costa Rica, Colorado and even Bolton in the UK.</p>

<h3>Thailand has 'no plans' to resume quarantine-free travel</h3>
<p>Thailand will continue with its suspension of quarantine-free travel as the country deals with rising omicron cases, a health ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Opas Karnkawinpong, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said Thailand will not reintroduce the 'Test Go' programme, which allowed international travellers free movement after a negative test on arrival.</p>
<p>"Under the current circumstances, there's no plan to bring back Test Go," Dr Opas told a media briefing.</p>
<h3>China locks down city of 1.2m people after just three Covid cases detected</h3>
<p>China put a city of 1.2 million people under lockdown after detecting only three asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, as the country doubles down on its “zero-Covid strategy” ahead of the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Authorities in Yuzhou, in the central Henan province, announced that starting from Monday evening, all residents had to stay home to control the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Communities were required to set up “sentinels and gates to strictly implement epidemic prevention and control measures.”</p>
<p>The city has halted all bus and taxi services and shuttered schools, shopping malls and tourist attractions. Only businesses providing daily necessities are allowed to continue to operate.</p>

<h3>Sweden sees record daily rise in Covid cases</h3>
<p>Sweden detected a record 11,507 new cases on December 30, health agency data showed on Tuesday, as the omicron variant continues to spread across the country. The previous record of 11,376 cases was set in late December 2020.</p>
<p>The news comes as it's confirmed Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for Covid-19. </p>
<p>"The King and Queen, who are fully vaccinated with three injections, have mild symptoms and are feeling well, given the circumstances," the palace said in a statement.</p>
<h3>Why masks could be on planes forever</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Just like the 100ml liquids rule and other security rituals, the mask directive feels more like theatre than a proven safety measure, writes Oliver Smith.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It’s that time of year when overconfident journalists make predictions. So here’s mine. Masks will remain a requirement for flying, not just for the rest of 2022, but for many years to come – and maybe even forever. </p>

<h3>Travel shares rise as omicron fears allayed</h3>
<p>"As far as markets are concerned omicron is in the rear view mirror," Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The main focus was on a collapse in demand and now because demand has recovered so quickly, the focus is more on the supply... it will prolong supply chain delays and push prices higher rather than push activity down."</p>
<h3>Mexico welcomed a remarkable 31 million international arrivals in 2021</h3>

<p>A number of senior figures in the Government are pushing for this test requirement to be dropped, with ministers insisting that the rapid spread of the omicron variant has made it pointless. </p>
<p>Day 2 PCRs, and the requirement to self-isolate until testing negative, could also be reconsidered. </p>

<h3>10 predictions for travel in 2022</h3>

<p>Of all the seismic shifts in travel right now, it’s our desire for different that over-ridingly informs how we’ll be holidaying in 2022. </p>
<h3>Brazilian cruise ships suspend operations after Covid outbreaks</h3>
<p>Cruise lines in Brazil will pause operations until January 21, after health authorities advised against cruise travel following several offshore Covid outbreaks, reports Reuters.</p>
<p>The industry association Clia said no ships will set sail during the "voluntary" suspension period, which could be extended, while those already at sea will complete their trips.</p>
<p>Last week, Brazil's national health regulator Anvisa recommended cruise companies temporarily halted operations after five ships off Brazil's coast detected more than 300 new Covid cases.</p>
<p>“In the last few weeks, (cruise lines) experienced a series of situations that impacted directly in the operation of their ships, making the continuity of the cruises unworkable at this moment,” Clia said in a statement.</p>
<h3>The easiest last-minute winter holiday options</h3>
<p>With the Government expected to ease testing requirements this week, our experts highlight the best options for a last-minute winter break.</p>
<h2>For hassle-free sunshine</h2>
<p>While countries around the globe have been tightening restrictions in recent weeks, Mexico lingers in a restriction-free, pre-Covid timewarp.</p>
<p>It is mandatory to register on the Mexico Vuela Seguro Platform before boarding your flight to Mexico, and to show a QR code generated by the system upon arrival at the airport. But that’s it. No vaccine requirements, no testing.</p>
<p>The Yucatán Peninsula, a sultry, low-lying limestone plateau full of sinkholes and fringed by white-sand beaches, is the best place for the sort of laid-back holiday we’re all in need of right now.</p>

<h3>Cyprus considers new Covid measures as per capita rate tops world</h3>
<p>Authorities in Cyprus are set to meet today to consider new restrictions to control a Covid infection rate that is now the highest in the world per capita.</p>
<p>Like other European countries, the Mediterranean island has been hit by a surge in cases of the highly contagious omicron variant.</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse figures, Cyprus recorded the world's highest Covid infection rate per capita over the past seven days, standing at 2,505 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Comment: The ongoing demonisation of cruises flies in the face of reason</h3>
<p>Americans have been warned not to sail as the cruise industry is cast as the evil villain of the Covid pandemic once again, writes Sara Macefield.</p>
<p>Cruise case rates are significantly lower than those reported on land and the stringent raft of tests and protocols that cruise companies employ have made their ships some of the safest places to be since cruising resumed.</p>
<p>The CDC ruling – and its decision to place cruises on the highest Level 4 alert footing – was prompted by a spate of Covid outbreaks on cruise ships in the run-up to Christmas that saw some vessels turned away from Caribbean ports.</p>
<p>Yes, case numbers had jumped significantly as the omicron variant rampaged across the world, with the CDC reporting that between December 15-29, Covid cases submitted by cruise ships in US waters reached 5,013.</p>
<p>The authority currently lists 110 ships sailing in US waters, with nearly all of them under investigation. </p>
<h3>Thousands of US flights cancelled amid bad weather and staff shortages</h3>
<p>Thousands of US flights were cancelled over the weekend due to bad weather and Covid-related staff shortages.</p>
<h3>'Good news' for Scottish ski resorts as snowfall set to increase</h3>
<p>Parts of the UK will face localised blizzard conditions and up to 80mph winds as the mild seasonal highs of the past few days are replaced by a cold front, reports PA.</p>
<p>Tuesday will be "noticeably colder across the whole of the country", the Met Office said, with temperatures peaking at 8C or 9C in the South and about 4C or 5C in Scotland.</p>
<p>In England, this might bring snow over the Pennines and North York moors, but it will be "pretty wet stuff", forecaster Simon Partridge said.</p>
<p>In Aberdeenshire and northern and eastern Scotland, winds of up to 80mph could create "localised blizzard conditions", with the Met Office issuing warnings of snow and ice for travellers.</p>
<p>Aviemore, in Scotland, saw five centimetres of snow on Monday, which would be added to overnight, Mr Partridge said, suggesting that this might be "good news" for the Cairngorms town's ski resorts.</p>
<p>"But I'm not sure they'll be overly happy about the strength of the wind," he added.</p>
<h3>France increases aid to tourism firms </h3>
<p>The French government said it will simplify access to crisis funds and could delay loan repayments for businesses struggling as a surge in omicron cases hits tourism and leisure activities across the country.</p>
<p>“We are standing by firms and workers in difficulty,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after meeting with representatives of business groups.</p>
<p>“This method has allowed to relaunch economic activity very quickly and very strongly,” he added.</p>
<p>France has reported record numbers of new Covid infections in recent days but continues to ban travel from the UK.</p>
<h3>Thailand urges uptake of booster shots as omicron cases rise</h3>
<p>Thailand's health ministry on Tuesday called on people to come forward to get booster vaccinations after reporting cases of the highly contagious omicron coronavirus variant had more than doubled over the holiday period.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian country has recorded 2,062 cases of the omicron variant so far, health official Supakit Sirilak told a news conference, up from 740 cases before the holidays.</p>
<p>Health authorities have warned of the risk of a surge of infections after the holidays when people travelled home and gathered at restaurants for celebrations.</p>
<p>Up to now, Thailand has vaccinated 64.1 per cent of an estimated 72 million people in the country with two doses, government data shows, while officials said only 9.8 per cent had received a third booster shot. </p>
<p>The country will suspend quarantine-free travel for overseas visitors from January 10, reverting to its Phuket 'sandbox' programme, where travellers must stay in designated areas. </p>
<h3>Passengers leave Covid-hit cruise ship after five days in Lisbon</h3>
<p>Almost 3,000 guests stuck on a Covid-hit cruise ship moored in Lisbon's port for several days finally began disembarking yesterday.</p>
<p>The AIDAnova has been docked in the Portuguese capital since last Wednesday. The ship had been sailing to Madeira for New Year's Eve, but the cruise was cancelled after Covid cases were detected among the crew.</p>
<p>A total of 68 positive cases, including a few among the passengers have been recorded, port captain Diogo Vieira Branco told the Lusa news agency.</p>
<p>The ship's operator, AIDA Cruises, said all those infected had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>All crew and passengers over 12 had been fully vaccinated and were required to show a negative rapid antigen test before departure, it added.</p>
<h3>France vows to go ahead with vaccine pass</h3>
<p>French government officials have vowed to enact a law to block unvaccinated people from hospitality venues by mid-January, despite the legislation hitting a procedural hitch in parliament.</p>
<p>"January 15 remains our goal," for the law coming into force, Clement Beaune, European Affairs Minister told LCI television.</p>
<p>Until now France has enforced a Covid-19 health pass, which means in order to get into restaurants, cafes or cinemas or board trains, people need to either show a fresh negative test, or proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>The legislation will remove the option of showing a negative test, effectively barring unvaccinated people from hospitality venues or trains.</p>
<p>It has faced fierce resistance but is backed by the government which has a majority in parliament.</p>
<h3>Feature: The forgotten country that's home to some of Europe's best skiing – and still open to Britons</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>With France closed and rules tightening in the Alps, this could be the winter to discover skiers’ secret, Slovakia, writes Peter Hardy.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Germany ends UK travel ban from today</h3>
<p>Germany has officially relaxed restrictions on travel from the UK, plus eight southern African countries that were imposed in response to the omicron variant.</p>
<p>The nine nations were removed from Germany's list of "virus variant areas" today.</p>
<p>Airlines and others are restricted largely to transporting German citizens and residents from countries on the list and all arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p>Germany's national disease control centre had announced on Thursday that it planned to downgrade the countries' risk status but said at the time that "short-term changes" were possible.</p>
<h3>Indonesia cuts quarantine for international travellers </h3>
<p>Indonesia has shortened its mandatory quarantine period for arriving overseas travellers</p>
<p>Most international arrivals will be required quarantine for seven days, down from 10, while those travelling from countries deemed high-risk must quarantine for 10 days, as opposed to 14.</p>
<p>The easing of travel restrictions is in stark contrast to the approach taken in other countries in the Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, which has tightened rules in recent weeks.</p>
<h3>French ski ban costing resorts an estimated 600 million euros</h3>
<p>A UK ski company has highlighted the devastating impact of the ongoing French travel ban, predicting it could cost ski resorts up to 600 million euros over the course of the season</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Oxford Ski Company said:</p>
<p>As French resorts continue to plead with the government to relax the current restrictions, we as a UK agent continue to look ahead into the abyss, with no indication of a review date or restriction shift.</p>
<p>When the initial announcement was made, Christophe Lavaut, director of Val d'Isere, said: 'It's an economic disaster. No business in any sector can make it, losing 42 per cent of its clients in two days.'</p>
<h3>How to prove you've recovered from Covid in order to travel</h3>
<p>Here’s everything that travellers need to know. </p>
<h3>Staff shortages see passengers stranded at stations </h3>
<p>Rail passengers were hit by disruption on the first working day of the year in England and Wales due to a combination of faults and coronavirus-related staff shortages.</p>
<p>Stuart Lovell was left stranded at St Mary Cray when his 7.18am South Eastern service didn't stop.</p>
<p>The provider said: "I am so sorry this didn't stop at the station. The train service manager has informed me there was a shortage of train staff at the station earlier, thus services where unable to stop."</p>
<p>A number of other people said they had been left unable to get to work on time due to cancellations. </p>
<h3>US records one million Covid cases in global daily record</h3>
<p>The US reported more than one million new Covid cases on Monday in a global record. </p>
<p>The figure is almost double the previous record of 590,000 new cases, which was recorded four days previously.</p>
<p>Among the hotspots are Florida, which recorded a 948 per cent rise in cases in just two weeks and New York state, which saw more than 85,000 cases last Saturday compared to 6,700 on December 1.</p>
<h3>Wizz Air saw 2.6 million passengers in December despite travel restrictions</h3>
<p>Budget airline Wizz Air has said 2.6 million passengers booked flights last month despite omicron-related travel rules dampening demand.</p>
<p>The carrier said this was a near-threefold increase on the 666,000 passengers it flew in the same month a year ago, creating a load factor on its planes of 75.4 per cent compared with 56.1 per cent in December 2020.</p>
<p>It meant the airline flew 21.7 million passengers in total in 2021 – up 30 per cent on 2020.</p>
<p>The news comes as the airline announced 14 new routes from Gatwick, including Faro, Palma, Tel Aviv, Mykonos, Milan, Rome, Vienna and Naples. The new flights are slated to launch in March. </p>
<h3>Delhi imposes weekend curfew amid omicron rise</h3>
<p>Authorities in Delhi have announced a weekend curfew in an attempt to slow the spread of the omicron variant. </p>
<p>Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told a news conference new measures were needed due to to steep case rises in the Indian capital in the past few days.</p>
<p>Employers have also been told to keep offices only 50 per cent full. </p>
<h3>Testing holidaymakers 'adds no value to public health', says travel boss</h3>
<p>More travel industry chiefs have been speaking out ahead of the review of international travel rules tomorrow.</p>
<p>Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK's largest independent travel agent group, told The Telegraph:</p>
<p>We are urging the health secretary to remove onerous pre-departure testing immediately along with the need for day 2 PCR testing and isolation until results are received. </p>
<p>The prevalence of Omicron at home makes these tests simply an act of political gesturing to be seen to be doing something but in reality, adding no value to public health.</p>
<h3>Israel to start reopening borders despite omicron surge </h3>
<p>Israel has announced it will reopen to visitors from countries it considers 'medium risk' next week, after being shut to all foreigners since November 28.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry said from January 9, foreign travellers from 199 countries will be allowed to enter if they show proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid.</p>
<p>However, Britain along with the US, UAE, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey remain on Israel's red list. Visitors from those countries require special permission from a committee to enter.</p>
<p>The border reopening comes despite rising cases in Israel.</p>
<h3>'Redundant' testing is killing demand, says airline chief</h3>
<p>Travel industry chiefs have been calling for testing rules to be eased in a government travel review on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, told The Telegraph: </p>
<p>We can't have international travel – and the hundreds of thousands of jobs and livelihoods that depend on it – being treated differently to hospitality and other domestic sectors.</p>
<p>If omicron doesn't warrant further restrictions at home, then the case for continuing with testing for aviation beyond Jan 5 is undermined, especially now it is the dominant variant in the UK. We need consistency, not favouritism.</p>
<h3>New Year's resolutions for the Government to save our holidays</h3>
<p>When it comes to holidays, travellers will be hoping for a smoother 2022. From fixing a passport loophole to ditching draconian Covid rules – here are simple promises would save travel in 2022:</p>
<ul> <li>Never resort to ‘travel bans’ again</li> <li>Remove all tests for travel</li> <li>Reimburse hotel quarantine victims</li> <li>Fix passport expiry grey areas</li> </ul>

<header> <h1> Errol Morris: the master documentary maker on true crime mysteries, CIA conspiracies, and Oscar snubs </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tristram Fane Saunders <time> 15 December 2017 • 5:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In 1953, an American scientist working with the CIA fell through the thirteenth-floor window of a New York hotel room, and plummeted to his death. Was it an accident? Suicide? Or something more sinister?</p>
<p>It is the latest in a recent wave of series investigating unsolved cases and miscarriages of justice, from hit podcasts Serial and S-Town to other Netflix <a>TV</a> miniseries such as <a>Making a Murderer</a> and <a>The Keepers</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Apted, the acclaimed director of Gorillas in the Mist, would later call that decision "one of the most outrageous things in the modern history of the Academy".</p>
<p>Although Morris went on to win a Best Documentary Oscar for The Fog of War, his 2003 study of US general Robert S McNamara, this year Wormwood has brought him into conflict with the Academy once again.</p>
<div> <div> <p>Was Morris annoyed? "Of course!" Before Wormwood appeared on Netflix, it premiered at last year's Telluride Film Festival as a four-hour feature. </p> </div> </div>
<a>Jon Ronson</a>'s The Men Who Stare at Goats.
<a>House of Cards</a>' Molly Parker, they create an eerie, disorientating effect when woven between the more straightforward documentary interviews.
<p>Morris's itch to solve the unsolvable comes across vividly in Wormwood, with its fragmented form and sprawling narrative: it might have a hole at the centre, but that's part of what makes it a bagel.</p>
<p> <b>Wormwood is out today on Netflix</b></p>

<p>We’re lucky that my father lives in his family home, with carers and my sister and husband who live close by as support.</p>
<h2>1. Keep things as calm as possible</h2>
<h2>2. Don’t contradict</h2>
<h2>3. Involve him in family life</h2>
<h2>5. Be home before dark</h2>

<header> <h1> Twixmas was invented by women. Why? So finally, we can switch off </h1> <p> Enter into the spirit of the post-Christmas, pre-new year lull, where none of the normal rules apply </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Judith Woods <time> 26 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>If you’re reading this in loungewear, prone on the sofa surrounded by wilfully esoteric Christmas treats and only a hazy idea of what day it is, then congratulations: you have successfully segued into Twixmas.</p>
<p>No customer, however aerated, genuinely believes that their call will be answered. No parent in their right mind intends to cook – wasn’t it Mary Berry who said: “Let them eat selection boxes…”?</p>
<p>Sure, the kids might be upset the first year you go hiding in plain sight. I remember mine sobbing: “But I’m never allowed to stay up this late! Is this a trick? What have you done with my real Mummy?”</p>
<p>Because Twixmas is indeed a parallel universe. It is not only an antidote to the freneticism of Christmas, but also the very antithesis of Christmas, with all its emphasis on crippling generosity and mandated togetherness.</p>
<p>Now if this sort of RR just sounds like a normal weekend, then you are probably a millennial or a man. I generalise, but with good reason.</p>
<p>Active relaxers might go biking or hiking. Hedonists can avail themselves of dedicated “Twixmas break” hotel and spa deals.</p>
<p>If retail therapy is your thing, the sales will have started online. Best place for them. Do you truly want to engage with what’s going on in the real world outside your front door?</p>
<p>But I should not use the G word: there should be no shame in looking forward to Twixmas just as much as, or not maybe even a little more than, Christmas Day itself. Experts agree.</p>
<p>“It’s more difficult with small children, but these days dads are better at taking up the slack, even if they have to be reminded that Mummy would really love a cup of tea as well.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, my younger teen is now old enough to be bribed and her elder sister is astute enough to recognise burn-out and administer a restorative cheeseboard in companionable silence.</p>
<p>“My advice is to crack open the bath bombs,” advises Boag. “Pour yourself a glass of real champagne and be as nice to yourself as you are to other people.”</p>
<p>Now there is a Twixmas challenge – I for one intend to stay horizontal and rise to it.</p>
