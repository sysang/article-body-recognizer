<div><div><h1>Italian dentist presents fake arm for vaccine to get pass</h1></div><div>December 4, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MILAN (AP) — A dentist in Italy faces possible criminal charges after trying to receive a coronavirus vaccine in a fake arm made of silicone. </p>
<p>A nurse in the northern city of Biella, Filippa Bua, said she could tell right away that something was off when a man presented the phony limb for a shot on Thursday.</p>
<p>“When I uncovered the arm, I felt skin that was cold and gummy, and the color was too light,” Bua told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. </p>
<p>She said she initially thought the 57-year-old man was an amputee and had mistakenly offered the wrong arm. She lifted his shirt and saw a silicone arm. </p>
<p>“I understood immediately that the man was trying to avoid the vaccination by using a silicone prosthetic, into which he hoped that I would inject the drug, unaware, Bua said. </p>
<p>The nurse said the man acknowledged he did not want a vaccine but to obtain a “super” health pass, which from Monday will be required to enter restaurants, cinemas, theaters and other venues in Italy. </p>
<p>He had already been suspended from work because of his refusal to get vaccinated, which Italy requires for medical personnel. </p>

<p> NEWRY, Maine (AP) — Santa is back to “sleighing” it on the ski slope.</p>
<p>More than 230 skiing and snowboarding Kris Kringles took to a western Maine resort on Sunday to raise money for charity.</p>
<p>The jolly ol’ St. Nicks took a break last year because of the global pandemic. But they returned to kick off the ski season in full holiday garb, including white beards, red hats and red outfits.</p>
<p>A sea of red Santa suits descended the mountain, carving wide turns as their beards fluttered in the icy wind. At least one green-costumed Grinch snuck his way into the mix, disguised in Santa’s coat and hat. </p>
<p>The event took place in the western Maine town of Newry, home to the Sunday River Ski Resort, the state’s busiest. </p>
<p>Before dashing through the snow, the Santas must all donate a minimum of $20, which helps support local education and recreation programs. The event raised several thousand dollars for the Sunday River Community Fund, a local charity.</p>
<div><div><h1>‘Cheugy,’ ‘omicron’ among 2021′s most mispronounced words</h1></div><div>By WILLIAM J. KOLEDecember 7, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>“Cheugy” is apparently a lot to chew on. Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Billie Eilish and Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce have something in common — broadcasters butcher their names.</p>
<p>And virtually everyone is having trouble with “omicron.”</p>
<p>All four made it onto this year’s list of most mispronounced words as compiled by the U.S. Captioning Company, which captions and subtitles real-time events on TV and in courtrooms.</p>
<p>The list released Tuesday identifies the words that proved most challenging for newsreaders and people on television to pronounce this year.</p>
<p>The caption company said it surveyed its members to generate the list, which is now in its sixth year and was commissioned by Babbel, a language-learning platform with headquarters in Berlin and New York. </p>
<p>“Newscasters in the U.S. have struggled with 2021′s new words and names while reporting on key sporting events, viral internet trends and emerging celebrities,” said Esteban Touma, a standup comedian and teacher for Babbel Live.</p>
<p>Here’s how Touma breaks down the proper pronunciations for the most commonly misspoken words:</p>
<p>— Cheugy (CHOO-gee): A trendy term popularized by Gen Z and used to mock an outdated and unfashionable aesthetic typically associated with millennials, such as “Live, Laugh, Love” signs.</p>
<p>— Chipotle (chih-POHT-lay): The American fast food chain became the center of a viral trend this year challenging Baby Boomers to pronounce the name.</p>
<p>— Dogecoin (DOHJ-coin): A divisive cryptocurrency that began somewhat ironically before being popularized by Elon Musk, <a>causing its value to dramatically increase</a>.</p>
<p>— Eilish (EYE-lish): The singer Billie Eilish, whose album “Happier Than Ever” was <a>released this year to critical acclaim</a> and nominated for the Grammy Awards’ Album of the Year.</p>
<p>— Ethereum (ih-THEE-ree-um): Another cryptocurrency that skyrocketed in value this year amid the decentralized-currency boom.</p>
<a> blocked the Suez Canal in March</a>, costing billions of dollars in lost trade. Many newscasters mistook the name of the ship as “Evergreen,” the name of the company that owns the vessel, which was printed on its hull.
<p>— Glasgow (GLAHZ-go): The host city of <a>November’s United Nations Climate Conference</a> was mispronounced by both President Joe Biden and former president Barack Obama.</p>
<p>— Kelce (KELs): <a>The Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce </a> revealed on radio this year that his teammates and the media had been mispronouncing his name for years.</p>
<a>new variant of COVID-19 first identified in November</a>, named in keeping with the World Health Organization’s system of identifying variants with Greek letters. (Touma notes it’s pronounced differently in the U.S. and the U.K.)
<p>— Shein (SHEE-in): The Chinese fast fashion company at the center of the “Shein haul” trend, in which participants record themselves trying on numerous different outfits from the company.</p>
<p>— Stefanos Tsitsipas (STEH-fuh-nohs TSEE-tsee-pas): Currently ranked as the world’s No. 4 tennis player, the <a>Greek athlete rose to international prominence</a> when he lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the French Open in June.</p>
<p>— Yassify (YEAH-sih-fai): A popular trend in which multiple beauty filters are applied to well-known pictures or portraits for comic effect.</p>

<div><div><h1>Company weeds out competition, bakes 850-pound pot brownie </h1></div><div>December 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NORWOOD, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts cannabis company is celebrating National Brownie Day on Wednesday with what it believes is the “largest THC-infused brownie ever made.”</p>
<p>MariMed Inc. said the massive confection is 3-feet-by-3-feet (.9-meters-by-.9 meters) square and 15 inches (38 centimeters) tall, weighs 850 pounds (385 kilograms), and contains 20,000 mg of THC.</p>
<p>The brownie was also made to celebrate the launch of the company’s new line of cannabis-infused edibles, called Bubby’s Baked, according to a statement from the Norwood-based company that also has facilities in several other states.</p>
<p>What happens to the brownie now? Company spokesperson Howard Schacter said it will be sent to its Middleborough dispensary and ultimately sold to a medical marijuana patient. As to what the customer plans to do with it, Schacter couldn’t say. </p>

<div><div><h1>Small alligator found a long way from home in Massachusetts</h1></div><div>December 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WEST SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) — A long way from its home, a small alligator was rescued by a Massachusetts fisherman Tuesday after it was spotted in the Westfield River for months.</p>
<p>Jeremy White, a worker for the state’s department of conservation and recreation, said he saw a video of the alligator on the news and decided he was going to see it for himself, The Boston Globe reported Tuesday. </p>
<p>White drove his boat to the area in the river where the alligator was spotted but couldn’t see it and decided to throw in a fishing line. The alligator appeared and White pushed closer to it.</p>
<p>He said the reptile was “trying to warm up in the sun because its eyes were closed. I was able to get up right next to it, so I just reached out and grabbed it.”</p>
<p>According to West Springfield Animal Control, the reptile is in good condition and is in the care of the state’s environmental police.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear how the 3-foot (1-meter) alligator appeared in the western Massachusetts area known as the Berkshires, the newspaper reported. American alligators typically inhabit the southeast.</p>
<p>White said he named the alligator Rambo, after Sylvester Stallone’s infamous action character because of how long it braved the cold New England water.</p>

<div><div><h1>6 years and counting: Ex-treasure hunter still stuck in jail</h1></div><div>December 9, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A former deep-sea treasure hunter is preparing to mark his sixth year in jail for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of 500 missing coins made from gold found in an historic shipwreck.</p>
<p>Research scientist Tommy Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, for that refusal. He is also incurring a daily fine of $1,000.</p>
<p>Despite an investors lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson, 69, <a>still won’t cooperate with authorities</a> trying to find those coins, according to court records, federal prosecutors and the judge who found Thompson in contempt.</p>
<a>pleaded guilty in April 2015 </a> for his failure to appear for a 2012 hearing and was sentenced to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But Thompson’s criminal sentence has been delayed until the issue of the gold coins is resolved.
<p>Federal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson’s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violates conditions of a plea agreement.</p>
<p>After technology problems cancelled Thompson’s latest virtual hearing last week, federal Judge Algenon Marbley scheduled a new hearing for Jan. 7.</p>
<div><div><h1>Footprints show some two-legged dinosaurs were agile</h1></div><div>By EMMA H. TOBINDecember 9, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Not all two-legged dinosaurs were like the lumbering Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>
<p>An analysis of dinosaur tracks from 120 million years ago unearthed in Spain adds to growing evidence that these meat-eating prehistoric beasts belonging to the same group as T.rex could be highly agile.</p>
<p>The findings, published Thursday in Scientific Reports, reveal one of the fastest known sets of fossilized dinosaur footprints. </p>
<p>These tracks join the ranks of other speedy sets found in Utah and Texas, one of which shows dinosaurs running at speeds over 30 mph. The Spanish footprints showed speeds of nearly 28 mph. </p>
<p>To calculate the running speed, scientists measured the length of the footprint and took into account the dinosaur’s hip height and stride length — the distance between two consecutive footprints of the same foot. </p>

<p>Scientists think there may be other faster dinosaurs, but the tracks of theropods have been easier to track down. </p>
<p>Scientists typically predict dinosaur behavior through computer modeling of the creatures’ movement. Physical examination of fossilized footprints confirm the results. </p>
<p>These are “clearly active, agile animals,” said Smithsonian paleontologist Hans Sues, who had no role in the study. </p>

<div><div><h1>Delaware highway exit sign misspells the state’s name</h1></div><div>December 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — A highway sign that recently went up in Delaware was noticeably missing a letter in the state’s name.</p>
<p>The new Wilmington exit sign on Interstate 95 should have said “Delaware Ave” but was misspelled as “Delware,” The News Journal reports.</p>
<p>Delaware’s transportation department and its contractor, Kiewit Infrastructure Company, say the sign was always meant to be temporary and has been replaced.</p>
<p>Exit 7 was previously closed for construction. A subcontractor hurriedly made a placeholder sign after learning the permanent one might not arrive in time for when the northbound exit was scheduled to reopen.</p>

<p>Many squirrels are eating well this fall in New England. But one portly squirrel is so big it earned the nickname, “Fatty McFatterson.” </p>
<p>Most squirrels sprint or scoot. This one lumbers and waddles after supplementing nature’s bounty this fall by helping himself to seeds that fall to the ground from bird feeders.</p>
<p>“He’s clearly the alpha of the yard,” said Beth Ditkoff, of Damariscotta, told The Associated Press. “You think of them as scampering around. He’s bah-boom, bah-boom.”</p>
<p>“Many species of wildlife can pack on some extra pounds, but their thick, fluffy fur coat may also make them appear larger in winter,” she said.</p>
<p>Unlike many other mammals, squirrels don’t hibernate, though they do spend a fair amount of time in their nests in colder weather. </p>
<div><div><h1>Accidental shooting leads police to home with over 70 cats</h1></div><div>December 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>KENSINGTON, N.H. (AP) — An accidental shooting led police in New Hampshire to a house that was overrun with more than 70 cats and was declared uninhabitable because it was covered with feline feces and urine.</p>
<p>Police also went to the home, where they initially found at least 30 cats.</p>
<p>“There was an overwhelming odor coming from inside the residence,” Kensington Police Chief Scott Cain said in a news release Friday. “It was discovered (the) inside was completely covered in feline feces and urine.”</p>
<p>Police called the New Hampshire Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which removed 67 black and white cats on Wednesday. Five more were found on Friday.</p>
<p>Cain said that ammonia levels tested in the house were much higher than what is considered safe. A health officer was contacted, and “it was determined the residence was uninhabitable and was condemned immediately,” Cain said. </p>
<p>He said the cats’ health will be determined before any criminal charges would be brought forward. He said the man would face a charge related to the rifle discharge.</p>
<p>She said the cats, who range in age from kittens to adults, are scared but friendly.</p>
<p>Dennison said the organization just cut the ribbon on a campus expansion last Saturday, and a week later, “we are using every single inch of that new space to quarantine and isolate this very large volume of cats.”</p>
<p>She directed adoption inquiries to the organization’s website.</p>
<div><div><h1>Bah! Humbug! Italy bishop tells children Santa doesn’t exist</h1></div><div>December 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>ROME (AP) — A Roman Catholic diocese in Sicily publicly apologized to outraged parents after its bishop told a group of children that Santa Claus doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post and subsequent comments Friday, the diocese of Noto insisted that Bishop Antonio Stagliano didn’t mean to dash the dreams of the youngsters two weeks before Christmas. </p>
<p>The diocesan communications director, the Rev. Alessandro Paolino, said Stagliano was trying to underline the true meaning of Christmas and the story of St. Nicholas, a bishop who gave gifts to the poor and was persecuted by a Roman emperor.</p>
<p>Italian news reports quoted Stagliano as saying during a recent religious festival that Santa doesn’t exist and that his red costume was created by the Coca-Cola company for publicity.</p>
<p>But, if the public comments section of the Noto page were any indication, the Sicilian parents weren’t having any of it. </p>
<p>“You are the demonstration that, when it comes to families, children and family education, you don’t understand a thing,” a commenter, identified as Mary Avola, wrote.</p>

<div><div>Aurora firefighters rescue Panther, a local cat who's been stuck on top of a 36-foot-high light pole for days, possibly four days on Friday, Dec. 10, 2021in Aurora, Colo. (Philip B. Poston/Sentinel Colorado via AP)</div></div>
<p>AURORA, Colo. (AP) — For at least two days and maybe more, residents of a suburban Denver neighborhood worried about the fate of a black cat called Panther who was perched atop a 36-foot (11-meter) utility pole. </p>
<p>Panther stayed put despite efforts by his co-owner, Alexis Soberanis and others to coax him down in Aurora. Neither pleading nor the enticement of food did the trick, Sentinel Colorado reports. </p>
<p>The cat went missing earlier this week and was first spotted atop the pole on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meadows said she and other neighbors called Aurora animal control and Xcel Energy for help. </p>
<p>“Everyone says they can’t do anything,” Meadows said. </p>
<p>Standard practice, according to another utility is to give cats time to make their way back down on their own, Sentinel Colorado reported.</p>

<div><div><h1>Pandamania: Twin cubs in French zoo take 1st steps in public</h1></div><div>December 11, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PARIS (AP) — First, a steady crawl. Then a short clumsy slide across the slick stone floor at their home at the Beauval Zoo near Paris. Then finally the big show as the twin giant panda cubs took their first steps in public on Saturday. </p>
<p>In a video, released by the zoo on Saturday, the twin cubs are seen clumsily making their way around the territory. At some point both attempt to climb nearby rocks as a caretaker looks on and films them with a smartphone. </p>
<p>The cubs will spend a few years in France before being sent to China.</p>
<p>France’s soccer star Kylian Mbappe and the Chinese Olympic champion in diving, Zhang Jiaqi, are the twins’ godparents after the athletes announced the female cubs’ names during a ceremony in November. </p>
<p>There are about 1,800 pandas living in the wild in China and about 500 in captivity worldwide.</p>
<p>China for decades gifted friendly nations with its unofficial national mascot in what was known as “panda diplomacy.” More recently the country has loaned pandas to zoos on commercial terms.</p>
<div><div><h1>Photo from tornado-damaged home lands almost 130 miles away</h1></div><div>By MIKE SCHNEIDERDecember 13, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>When Katie Posten walked outside Saturday morning to her car parked in her driveway, she saw something that looked like a note or receipt stuck to the windshield.</p>
<p>“Seeing the date, I realized that was likely from a home hit by a tornado. How else is it going to be there?” Posten said in a phone interview Sunday morning. “It’s not a receipt. It’s well-kept photo.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, that’s what happened. </p>
<li>– EXPLAINER: Was tornado outbreak related to climate change?</li>
<p>The fact that the photo traveled almost 130 miles is “unusual but not that unusual,” said John Snow, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma. </p>
<p>In one documented case from the 1920s, paper debris traveled 230 miles from the Missouri Bootheel into southern Illinois. The paper debris rides winds, sometimes reaching heights of 30,000 to 40,000 feet above the ground, he said.</p>
<p>“It gets swirled up,” Snow said. “The storm dissipates and then everything flutters down to the ground.”</p>
<a>A Facebook group</a> was set up after the storms so people could post photos and other items like an ultrasound image they had found deposited in their yards.
<p>Posten plans to return the photo to the Swatzell family sometime this week.</p>
<div><div><h1>‘Large, pink elusive:’ S. Carolina police seek ruinous pig</h1></div><div>December 13, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>SUMTER, S.C. (AP) — Authorities in South Carolina are searching for a pig that they say has been “wreaking havoc” in people’s yards.</p>
<p>On Monday, police in Sumter posted on their Facebook page that the department had received calls over the weekend about a “large, pink and elusive” pig suspected of causing damage in some neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Alongside the post were photos of a large pig, as well as large dirt piles the yard of a home.</p>
<p>Officers warned people not to try to approach the hefty hog, writing that “its size alone is of concern.”</p>
<p>Police say they have asked officials with South Carolina Department of Natural Resources for help in finding the porcine renegade.</p>
<div><div><h1>Florida company offers 2 free homes as worker incentive</h1></div><div>December 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) — While many companies are offering bonuses or higher pay as a way to lure and keep workers, a central Florida business is offering a drawing for two brand new and mortgage-free houses.</p>
<p>Mechanical One, which provides air conditioning and plumbing for new developments, is planning to hold the drawing next December, president and CEO Jason James told the Orlando Sentinel.</p>
<p>“My passion is really trying to reinvent employee appreciation,” James said. “Our business model is really, if we take care of our people, they are going to do more for us than any marketing budget.”</p>
<p>The company has bought two lots for the three-bedroom, two-bath homes and has set aside a $500,000 budget for the project.</p>
<p>James told the newspaper he thought about other incentives, such a giving away a car or a vacation. But then he decided he wanted his employees to be able to enjoy their own homes.</p>
<p>“Many of our employees own a home already, but a lot of them rent,” he said.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>To qualify for the drawing, employees must be with the company for a full year and take a financial literacy class, paid for by the company. They also must perform 20 hours of community service at a nonprofit of the employee’s choosing.</p>
<p>“They get a financial education, which helps them get to the goal of owning their own home anyway, and it has an impact on the community,” James said.</p>
<p>The privately held company of nearly 100 people began operations in July, so no employees qualify yet, the newspaper reported. James announced the drawing during a Dec. 4 employee gathering.</p>
<p>Many fast food chains have offered signing bonuses and corporations including Costco, Amazon and Chipotle have raised their minimum wages to $15 an hour or more.</p>
<p>James, 40, told the Sentinel he was inspired to create a company with an employee focus after a stint with Chik-fil-A, which has twice-yearly outings for employees and their families and has a low-cost health care plan.</p>
<p>He had been working in HVAC and plumbing for about six years before starting his own company.</p>
<p>James said he and other new CEOs are part of a changing of the guard in the industry, incorporating more smart technology in buildings and with a keener eye on the labor pool.</p>
<p>“There’s a labor shortage in these trades because they’re skilled,” he said. “You’ve got to have quite a lot of exposure and training to understand these systems.”</p>
<p>Anthony Mitchell, Central Florida plumbing operations manager for Mechanical One, said excitement is already high throughout the company.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing like coming home to the wife and saying, ‘Honey, I’m bringing home a new house,’” he said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Event featuring teachers crawling for cash prompts apology</h1></div><div>December 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — The organizers of a fundraiser that featured teachers on their hands and knees grabbing for dollar bills at a junior hockey league game in South Dakota are apologizing after the event drew criticism.</p>
<p>Critics on social media called the event demeaning. Loren Paul, president of the South Dakota Education Association, said it showed that the state needs to do better for its teachers and students when it comes to funding education.</p>

<div><div><h1>Black juror: Smollett’s reaction to noose makes no sense</h1></div><div>December 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>If others saw the noose as Smollett’s clumsy effort to portray his attackers as racist, Andre Hope saw much more.</p>
<a>Smollett testified </a> that after the attack in downtown Chicago in January 2019, he returned home and put the rope back around his neck so police who came to his apartment soon after could see it.
<p>Hope was not the only Black person who struggled with Smollett’s use of such a potent symbol of racism in the U.S. to convince authorities he was the victim of a hate crime.</p>
<p>In an interview with NewsNation Now after Smollett was found guilty last Thursday, <a>Eddie Johnson </a> — who was Chicago police superintendent in January 2019 when Smollett said he was attacked — said virtually the same thing. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Report details 'failure' in handling of 1st Smollett case </h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>AP Week in Pictures: Global</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>After Jussie Smollett verdict, more court cases await </h4></a></div></li>
<p>“I was concerned because I don’t think there’s many Black people in America with a noose around their neck and wouldn’t immediately take it off,” Johnson said. </p>
<a>the counter narrative</a> put forth by Smollett’s attorneys that the pair had actually planned the attack on Smollett did not make sense.
<p>“When you just use your common sense as what’s there, yeah it just, it didn’t add up,” said Hope a 63-year-old father of two who lives in suburban Bellwood, west of Chicago. </p>
<p>“I still have not figured out a motive for why he did, why this had to even happen,” Hope said. “He was a star.”</p>
<p>Smollett faces up to three years in prison when he returns to court next year for sentencing. But experts have said it is far more likely that he will be placed on probation and ordered to perform community service. </p>
<p>That would be fine with Hope, who thinks Smollett does not deserve to go to prison. And, he said, he hopes the actor — who testified that he has lost his livelihood — would be given a chance to resume his career. </p>

<p>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) — Two zebras running loose since escaping a Maryland farm about four months ago have been caught.</p>
<p>Prince George’s County Animal Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture weren’t involved in the capture but were told Monday that the animals returned to their herd last week, The Washington Post reported.</p>
<a>fled from an Upper Marlboro farm</a> where officials have said about 40 zebras live. Residents in the region shared sightings of the free-roaming pair on social media, and even Washington’s Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton chimed in on the escape.
<a>got caught in an illegal snare trap</a> on a neighboring property and died soon after the breakout. The county
<a>filed animal cruelty charges</a> against owner Jerry Holly in October after another zebra was found dead inside the farm’s enclosure.

<p>Holly is accused of inflicting “unnecessary suffering or pain on a zebra” and failing to provide “nutritious food in sufficient quantity” or give the herd “proper shelter.”</p>
<p>USDA inspectors said in a recent report that the zebras escaped “during the unloading process.” The herd was moved to Maryland from Florida over the summer, according to County Animal Services Chief Rodney Taylor.</p>
<p>Prince George’s officials worked with the animals’ caretakers for weeks, trying to lure the fugitives into a corral using food and other zebras. </p>
<p>A <a>Twitter parody account</a> for the zebras said Tuesday, “Well, Well, Well...they got us. We had an amazing time and it’s all about being outside.”</p>
