<p>Setting out to solve readers’ money battles is a bit like getting the family to help me tidy up the debris from Christmas Day. Of course they would rather flop on the sofa and watch television.</p>
<p>Every day, as Consumer Champion of this newspaper, I rummage through reams of detail, untangle knotty and complex problems, and demand that reluctant companies and official organisations step up to the mark with their customer services.</p>
<p>Based on my past cases, here is my Consumer Champion’s checklist for keeping your money safer in 2022.</p>
<h2>1) Be 'scamdemic' prepared</h2>
<p>My mailbag was bursting with letters from victims who lost life-changing sums to scammers. Criminals took cynical advantage of our isolation during the pandemic, as many of us worked from home or were cut off from families and friends.</p>
<p>Action: if someone phones, texts or knocks on the door out of the blue and tries to persuade you to part with personal details or cash, do not give them the time of day.</p>
<h2>2) Too good to be true? It is</h2>
<a>invested nearly £90,000 in what he thought was a savings bond from Prudential UK</a>, paying 2pc a year. It was bogus and he lost the lot. Thankfully, his bank, Santander, refunded his losses.
<p>Action: ignore deals offering very high returns, as this is sure to be scammers at work. Check the Fin­ancial Conduct Authority’s list of known scams.</p>
<h2>3) Keep clear of copycats</h2>
<p>Action: when renewing official documents, be wary of the results from an online search. Copycats often pay to appear at the top of the listing. Scroll down to find the link to the official ­gov.uk address.</p>
<h2>4) Know your refund rights</h2>
<a>a £5,000 lumpy sofa</a>, a £4,000 watch that lost time, a leaky dishwasher and
<a>an oven that exploded.</a> Chasing refunds on faulty goods is a perennial problem. But in 2022, I hope that the Covid excuse for refund delays and poor service will be sent to the scrapyard. It will no longer wash with consumers, two years on.

<p>In late 2020 I was contacted out of the blue on WhatsApp by a woman from Hong Kong. Instead of dismissing her, I engaged in a conversation as I have always been interested in different cultures. It was lockdown and so I had some time on my hands.</p>
<p>The conversation continued for months. I told her about my children and she remembered when I had operations (I have a chronic health condition). She told me about her family and different business ventures.</p>
<p>It was close to my son’s birthday and I imagined what presents I could buy him if we had more money, so I decided to take the leap and trade for real.</p>
<p>I transferred about £1,000 but then discovered I could not get my money back out as it had been moved to a digital wallet in Hong Kong. The woman tried to reassure me but I suddenly had a horrible sinking feeling.</p>
<p>So I begin this year with your case, involving a nasty scam that I have not encountered before. I call it “friendship fraud”. It operates like romance fraud, a more common scam, but the perpetrators keep the communications platonic.</p>
<p>It is just as cunning, with criminals going to great lengths to gain trust by asking personal questions to establish a rapid bond. They develop a believable backstory, complete with photographs to support it.</p>
<p>Romance scammers target those looking for love, but the net is widening to include those who simply feel isolated during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Before long the woman started to boast of her success in cryptocurrency trading – and suggested you could emulate this. You were short of money but, with a loan available to dip into, you were highly vulnerable to her ploys.</p>
<p>I understand how sickened and desperate you must have felt when you realised how you had been taken in.</p>
<p>However, a couple of weeks later the bank had an unexpected change of heart and, I am delighted to say, decided you were protected by its guarantee after all. It reimbursed your £1,098.</p>

<header> <h1> The best way to invest an inheritance: stocks, pension or paying off the mortgage? </h1> <p> Receiving an inheritance can be life-changing but what you decide to do with the money is critical. We look at three common scenarios </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 3 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The best use of your money will depend on your age and circumstances. Telegraph Money examines three common scenarios below.</p>
<h2>When you’re young</h2>
<p>Younger inheritors could benefit from holding on to smaller sums to give them more flexibility in the future, said Amy Pethers from wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.</p>
<p>If they know that they will need access to the cash in the short term, for example less than three years, it could be prudent to <a>keep it in cash, perhaps in Premium Bonds or an easy-access savings account</a>.</p>
<p>If they invested £350,000, it would be worth £570,113 after 10 years based on 5pc annual investment growth of £220,113 after fees, Ms Pethers said.</p>
<p>In addition to a taxable investment portfolio and Isas, they could benefit from making additional pension contributions. </p>
<p>This money won’t be accessible until at least the age of 57, however, so a pension is far less flexible than an Isa or taxable investment account and may not be the best option for younger savers.</p>
<p>Ms Pethers added: “They should also work out how much they want to keep as an emergency cash fund. We normally recommend about six months’ essential expenditure.” </p>
<p><a>Overpaying on a mortgage may be tempting in middle age</a>, but investing the money would probably generate more than the mortgage savings in the long run. This is true whether smaller or larger sums are involved. </p>
<p>However, if the £200,000 were invested instead, it could turn into £530,660 over 20 years, assuming a return of 5pc, which is far more than the interest saved on the mortgage.</p>
<a>Isa allowance</a>, they could add more to their pension instead. If they invested £40,000 into their pension, the maximum amount on which tax relief is paid, it could grow to £65,155 over a decade, based on annual growth of 5pc. 
<h2>Approaching retirement</h2>
<p>If a saver already has sufficient money for retirement and wants to pass on the money now, they may want to consider a "deed of variation", which would allow them to pass the inheritance to their children or grandchildren instead, Ms Pethers said.</p>
<p>Depending on their age, they may also need to consider inheritance tax if they decide to keep the inheritance but plan to give some of it away in future. Everyone's estate is taxed at a rate of 40pc above a limit £325,000.</p>
<p>Gifts are subject to the "seven-year rule", whereby a gift made by a parent or grandparent will be free of inheritance tax if it is made seven years or more before their death.</p>
<header> <h1> Money Makeover: ‘How do I turn my house and inheritance into a £10,000 a year travel fund?’ </h1> <p> A reader wants to know if she should build a buy-to-let portfolio or invest in stocks and shares </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 29 November 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>When Tanya Dempsey received an unexpected inheritance after the death of her uncle, she was astonished.</p>
<p>She said she planned to sell the house after a few years as she is adding value and prices are rising. “A similar property around the corner just sold for £380,000,” she said.</p>
<p>She has discussed teaming up with her mother to buy somewhere else to live locally, mortgage free. If she were to set aside £200,000 from a future sale, she would potentially have an extra £180,000 to invest in a few years’ time.</p>
<p>But where should she start? “I am a complete novice with investments, but I’m <a>keen on the idea of buy-to-lets</a> or <a>holiday lets</a>,” said Ms Dempsey.</p>
<h2>Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of SPI Capital, a property consultancy, said:</h2>
<p>Ms Dempsey’s goal of making £10,000 to £15,000 a year is achievable from property investments with the amounts of money she has inherited.</p>
<p>Buy-to-lets offer consistent income and are one of the least risky property investments in terms of cash flow. Demand from tenants for good, affordable rentals is strong and growing.</p>
<p>Ms Dempsey should choose buy-to-let properties worth £70,000 to £150,000 that have a 6pc gross yield.</p>
<p>Assuming typical management costs of 10pc plus VAT and setting aside 15pc each year for voids, maintenance and contingencies, she would have a pre-tax income of £4,172.</p>
<h2>Victoria Ross, chartered financial planner at Progeny, an advisory firm, said:</h2>
<p>This should still be able to generate income in perpetuity of 3pc to 4pc, <a>or £5,700 to £7,600 a year</a>.</p>
<h1> Money Makeover: ‘Taxes killed my buy-to-let empire – where should I invest my £600,000?’ </h1>
<p> One in four landlords have turned their backs on property – our experts have tips on how else to earn a living </p>
<div> <div> By Harry Brennan <time> 6 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Almost a quarter of landlords plan to sell up over the next 12 months as buy-to-let loses its shine and becomes increasingly difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>For Anthony Crowther, a former Royal Air Force flight engineer, managing physical property has become too burdensome in retirement.</p>
<p>“They have been very good investments for us, but taking an hour-long drive to go and manage the property in our golden years has become a headache.”</p>
<p>Mr Crowther joined the forces not long after he turned 17 and served for some 32 years before he moved into teaching aviation and worked on aircraft including the C-130 Hercules and L-1011 TriStar.</p>
<p>“I want the money to at least keep in line with rising inflation,” he said.</p>
<h2>Rob Burgeman, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, a wealth manager</h2>
<p>Given that Mr Crowther’s income is fully covered by generous and reliable pensions, and he already has a cash buffer, he is able to invest all of his profits.</p>
<p>For his portfolio, he should invest 20pc in bonds, 30pc in alternatives such as infrastructure and 50pc <a>in stocks.</a></p>
<p>For alternatives, I recommend 10pc in the JP Morgan Global Macro Opportunities fund, which invests in many different assets, including currencies and complex derivatives, with the aim of delivering returns no matter how stormy markets are.</p>
<p>For stocks Mr Crowther should put 12.5pc each into Scottish Mortgage, Fundsmith Equity, Lindsell Train Global Equity and the Fidelity Global Quality Income ETF.</p>
<h2>Elaine McLachlan, director of private clients at 7IM, a wealth manager</h2>
<p><a>Residential property is losing its appeal</a>. Higher rental yields may be on offer in lower-value houses but the administrative hassle is putting many off. More expensive properties have seen their yields shrink.</p>
<p>What’s more, you cannot put a property into tax-protected savings accounts such as pensions or Isas, and tax rules have become less favourable.</p>
<p>Stocks are the closest asset type to property in terms of the risk-and-reward pay-off – and can be held in the tax-free accounts mentioned above, which should also shield them from future changes in government policy.</p>
<p>They too are “real assets” whose value should rise as inflation does, unlike bonds, which tend to fall in value or see value eaten away in real terms as inflation picks up.</p>
<p>A traditional “medium-risk” portfolio, which we would recommend, is made up of roughly 60pc shares and 40pc bonds.</p>
<p>With rampant inflation and central bank interest rates likely to rise at some point, the outlook for bonds is unattractive, but there are still some decent options.</p>
<p>The outlook for shares is far better, and investors should think about the big themes that companies can tap into to generate future profits. I would recommend the AB International Health Care portfolio.</p>
<p>This will benefit from ageing demographics and the developed world spending more on healthcare. Similarly, a world eventually waking up to the importance of decarbonisation should benefit funds such as Ninety One Global Environment.</p>

<header> <h1> Money Makeover: ‘How do I pass on my £2m estate without paying inheritance tax?’ </h1> <p> Our 90-year-old reader wants to leave his property empire, that pays out more than £100,000, to his children </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 13 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sky-high inheritance tax bills catch out countless families every year and thousands more will face surprise charges in future because tax bands have been frozen.</p>
<p>Planning ahead can shield your heirs from paying the dreaded death duties, but inheritance planning gets trickier the later you leave it. At the age of 90, Keith Webb is worried that he has run out of options.</p>
<p>Mr Webb and his wife, 85, have already taken steps to<a> pass on their wealth</a> to their four children, who are between the ages of 45 and 67.</p>
<p>More than seven years ago the couple gave away 60pc of their £1.5m home under an “Eversden trust”, which removes the value of the property from their estates for IHT purposes while allowing them to keep living there.</p>
<p>The couple have also given their children equal shares in an industrial property that yields £65,000 a year.</p>
<p>Mr Webb still has more than £2m of assets but is worried that a large proportion will be taxed away.</p>
<p>The couple have borrowed £210,000 against their commercial properties via two loans over 15 years. They have been making some early repayments, but intend to clear the outstanding balances when they have both died.</p>
<p>Both Mr and Mrs Webb will receive<a> double inheritance tax allowances</a> as they were both married previously, to spouses who died about 50 years ago.</p>
<h2>Shaun Moore, financial planner at Quilter, a wealth manager</h2>
<p>The Webbs’ ages make conventional inheritance tax planning difficult. Seven years will need to pass for standard gifts to escape it, which might mean that gifting strategies fall short.</p>
<p>To be eligible, they need to avoid leaving the entire estate to the survivor on the first death. Although this would benefit from 100pc exemption, it would limit the claim on second death.</p>
<h2>Olly Cheng, associate director at Saunderson House, a wealth manager</h2>
<p>Linked to this, unless the interest rates are particularly high, they should consider whether it is better to minimise their expenditure on their mortgages and not seek to pay them off early.</p>
<p>These investments would be high risk and more volatile than other shares, so may not be appropriate despite the preferential tax treatment. But they do save 40pc on IHT.</p>

<header> <h1> Money Makeover: ‘I earn £125,000 and want to retire in 16 years – is it too late to start investing?’ </h1> <p> Pilot Will Godwin wants to provide financial security for his family </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 20 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Few sectors have been as impacted by the pandemic as much as the airline industry, with mass travel bans meaning many plans to travel abroad have failed to take off.</p>
<p>Pilot Will Godwin, 39, from Worcestershire, saw his income cut as a result. A father of two children, aged seven and five, he now wants to build more financial stability to protect himself and his family against future shocks.</p>
<p>Over the past year he’s managed to save almost £30,000, some of which has come from his role as an Army Reservist. Half of that has been <a>used to buy Premium Bonds</a> and the rest is in a current account.</p>
<p>He is risk averse and not confident about the prospect of investing, but is open to learning more and wants to build his knowledge in this area.</p>
<p>Mr Godwin and his wife are animal lovers and keep chickens on their land. <a>They plan to move to a larger house</a> once their children have left school.</p>
<p>His current mortgage is £141,000 and he has no other substantial debts.</p>
<p>He earns £110,000 a year from his main job and, £13,000 from the Army, while his wife earns around £13,000 as a part-time primary school teacher.</p>
<p>Mr Godwin contributes 18pc to his workplace pension scheme, with his employer contributing a further 10pc. He is aiming to retire when he reaches 55.</p>
<h2>Joe McGovern, independent financial adviser, MPA Financial Management</h2>
<p>Mr Godwin and his wife are comfortably living within their means and have been able to save a significant amount of money, despite the fact he has been on reduced income. This is a very encouraging starting point.</p>
<p>Mr Godwin currently has <a>£15,000 in a current account</a>, which can act as an emergency fund should it be required. Emergency funds are a vital facet of any good financial plan. </p>
<p>The money should not be subject to investment risk and should remain accessible so that it can be called upon in a time of need.</p>
<p>Mr Godwin already has this level within the Premium Bonds he holds, suggesting he can afford to invest the additional £15,000 should he wish to.</p>
<p>However, this may be a good stepping stone to feel comfortable about long-term investments and provide an opportunity to increase his knowledge.</p>
<p>The couple are saving £1,000 per month. If they are averse to investing more, a sensible option would be for the couple to utilise some of the excess monthly expenditure to reduce the outstanding £141,000 mortgage loan.</p>
<p>Overpayment would result in the loan being paid off before the end of their remaining 18-year term, reducing overall interest payments and helping towards their goal of retiring around the age of 55.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Mr Godwin could consider remortgaging his existing home loan to a five-year fix, currently available as low as 1.54pc. If interest rates rise before his next move, he could insure against that by fixing now.</p>
<p>Mr Godwin’s gross salary of £123,000 means he falls into the “<a>personal allowance trap</a>”. </p>
<p>The personal allowance is an amount every individual can earn before incurring an income tax charge – currently standing at £12,570.</p>
<p>For every £2 of adjusted net income above £100,000, an individual’s personal allowance is reduced by £1. Mr Godwin’s personal allowance has been reduced by £11,500 to leave him with £1,070 remaining.</p>
<p>A great way for him to combat this issue is to make further pension contributions. Not only will he receive tax relief at his marginal rate of tax, he will also extend the basic-rate band by his gross pension contribution. </p>
<p><a>Making further pension contributions</a> will also help him create a bigger savings pot, which can be utilised during his planned retirement.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, to raise £2,000 to £3,000 a month in retirement, he would need a pot worth between £600,000 and £1.2m to facilitate a 3-4pc a year income requirement.</p>
<h2>Nick Onslow, chartered financial planner, The RU Group</h2>
<p>To start off, as Mr Godwin and his wife have young children they need to ensure that their wills name guardians should they die prematurely.</p>
<p>If investing in shares is too scary, then paying off their mortgage debt may be the right solution for them. You can normally pay an extra 10pc a year off your mortgage.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking to save for a period of more than 10 years, such as towards retirement in the case of Mr Godwin and his wife, they should be exposed <a>to higher levels of investment</a>. </p>
<p>Mr Godwin’s wife earns £13,000 as a part-time teacher, and the majority of this income is paid tax-free. She could invest 100pc of her earnings into a pension and receive tax relief of 20pc, which is £2,600.</p>
<a>25pc of this money tax-free</a>. It could be used to pay off any outstanding mortgage debt they have at that time.
<p>If they are concerned about where they invest, then there are many good ethical funds available, but I would recommend the Invesco Summit Responsible Range as they have several risk profiles and a strong track record with a low charging structure.</p>

<h1> Questor: our capital shortfall could disappear in no time but the income problem is tougher </h1>
<p> Questor Income Portfolio: a burst of positive sentiment is all it would take to boost its value; dividend rises will be harder to come by </p>
<div> <div> By Richard Evans <time> 31 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>This week we are looking at the performance of our tips published under Questor’s various formats and today it is the turn of our Income Portfolio.</p>
<p>Some figures here differ slightly from those in the print version of this story. This is because some market prices changed after the print version was finalised</p>
<p>That figure of £26,081 is slightly higher than the £25,848 we expected when we last looked at the portfolio’s performance in late October, thanks to dividend rises from the likes of New Residential Investment Corp. </p>
<p>We are therefore some way short, although the gap is small if we include that special dividend.</p>
<a>London marke</a>t remains unloved by international investors. Sooner or later, they will forgive us for Brexit and return. A sense that we are truly past the worst of the pandemic could also do wonders for share prices.
<p>We need a decent clutch of above-inflation rises in dividends if we are to make up the lost ground – and such increases will be hard to find if the CPI is as high as it is now.</p>

<header> <h1> Nationwide customers face payment delays for third time in a fortnight </h1> <p> Building society queues payments after transactions spike </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nationwide customers face a fresh round of payment delays just two weeks after being blocked from transferring money over Christmas.</p>
<p>Yesterday payments to customer bank accounts were delayed as a result of an "extremely high volume of transactions”, meaning many account holders did not receive their money when they expected to.</p>
<p>The building society said it had processed more than 10 million payments overnight and had implemented a queuing system to help manage the load.</p>
<p><a>Nationwide confirmed</a> that delayed payments were now being processed but did not give a timeframe for when the backlog of payments would be cleared.</p>
<p>This follows an outage four days before Christmas which saw millions of customers unable to send or receive money. Hundreds of customers also reported issues making transfers on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>A Nationwide spokesman said the current issue did not impact bulk payments, direct debits and standing orders.</p>
<p>He said: “As a result of extremely high volumes of transactions on the first working day of the year we took the decision to temporarily queue inbound faster payments. </p>
<p>"Queued payments are now being processed and we would ask members to bear with us as we work through the backlog. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."</p>
<p>The spokesman added that customers could continue to use their cards to pay for goods and services, access online banking and its app and withdraw cash <a>from ATMs</a>.</p>
<p>Another said: “I've got no food and no money. I'm hungry, but I can't do anything because the money sent to feed me has been stuck for hours.”</p>
<p>Some social media users reported that they could not access their mobile banking app. Nationwide said the app was not affected by the issue.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, Nationwide said it would refund any charges implemented by other providers as a result of payment delays. The building society said the same policy would apply in this case. </p>

<header> <h1> Easy ways to save money in 2022: top tips to improve your finances </h1> <p> Give your personal finances a boost with these money-saving ideas </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Marianna Hunt and Telegraph Money <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:32pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>After a tough couple of years many people have started the new year hoping 2022 will be better for both our health and our wealth.</p>
<p>The cost of living crisis has placed huge pressure on household finances, with energy bills, mortgages, fuel and food all seeing sharp cost increases. At the same time, high street bank accounts offer close to zero interest to savers.</p>
<p>However, there are ways to grow your wealth this year, either by making money or reducing unnecessary spending.</p>
<p>Here are a collection of simple ways to increase your income in 2022.</p>
<h2>1) Review your mortgage deal</h2>
<h2>2) Make a proper spending plan</h2>
<h2>3) Cancel subscriptions you aren’t using </h2>
<h2>4) Cut your energy costs </h2>
<p>Working from home has probably pushed up your energy and gas usage and therefore your bills. At the same time energy bills have increased substantially in recent months, leaving households with few options to switch.</p>
<p>Instead you can<a> use less in the first place</a> by turning off appliances that are on standby, replacing old devices with new, more energy efficient ones, and washing clothes at a lower temperature.</p>
<p>There are other upgrades you could make, such as installing double glazing or getting a new boiler, but these tend to be quite expensive.</p>
<h2>5) Don’t forget to haggle</h2>
<h2>6) Before buying anything, see if you can get it for free </h2>
<p>Many people will want to treat themselves to a new sofa or dining table this January. But the good news is there will be lots who are getting rid of old ones. </p>
<h2>7) If not, buy second-hand rather than new </h2>
<h2>8) And sell your old things online </h2>
<p>Getting in all these second-hand items will probably mean you need to get rid of some old ones to make space. You can sell old clothes online on sites such as eBay or apps such as Depop.</p>
<p>There are other specialist sites, including Mazuma Mobile, Music Magpie and Zapper, that will give you money for your old mobile phones, CDs, DVDs and games. eBay is a good one-stop shop to sell almost anything.</p>
<h2>9) Rent out your car or driveway </h2>
<p>More people are ditching public transport for the safety of their own cars and you could make money by offering up your empty driveway as a parking space.</p>
<a> can be £300 or more</a>. 
<h2>10) Compare supermarket prices before filling up your trolley </h2>
<h2>11) Look for the yellow stickers</h2>
<h2>12) Get an app that helps you to save </h2>
<p>There’s a growing breed of apps designed to help people save more, including Plum and Chip. Banks are getting involved too, with digital lenders Monzo and Starling launching new features to get customers to squirrel more away. </p>
<h2>13) Get cashback for shopping online </h2>
<h2>14) Make your savings grow </h2>
<p>Saving will only be harder if you let the value of your money be eroded by inflation. Most banks offer such poor interest rates at the moment that meaning money in cash means its spending power is actually decreasing with time. </p>
<a> here</a>. But remember stock markets can go down as well as up.

<header> <h1> ‘I can’t afford to send both kids to university – can I ask my son to pay for his sister?’ </h1> <p> Moral Money: How can our reader help both of his children equally? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>We have two children who are now young adults. We wanted to avoid them being burdened by the repayment costs of student loans.</p>
<p>We have been able to afford to pay for the tuition and accommodation of our first-born, our son, who is repaying the money to us interest-free now he is earning. </p>
<p>However, we can't afford to do the same for our second child, our daughter. This means that, unlike her brother, she must take out a student loan which will accrue interest. </p>
<p>Can we ask our son to pay his sister's student loan repayments?</p>
<p>In broad terms our eldest needs to pay back £40,000. We plan to ring-fence and invest the money that is paid back to maximise what is available to support our youngest.</p>
<p>As long as our daughter doesn’t have to pay back more than a further £40,000, ie total repayments of £80,000, then in principle that seems fair. </p>
<p>It is admirable that you are trying to help both of your children equally. However, this requires such a delicate balance that one of your children will inevitably benefit more.</p>
<p>If you made it clear to your son that the £40,000 was an interest-free loan from the outset, then he should have no problem paying it back and you should spend it how you see fit.</p>
<p>However, your method could result in your daughter effectively receiving a free degree, and this could lead to resentment no matter how well they get on, so tread carefully.</p>
<p>While your daughter will end up with much more debt than your son, the outcome will only be equal if your daughter makes £80,000 in repayments over the next 30 years, which is incredibly unlikely. </p>
<p>The amount she pays will depend heavily on how much she earns over the next 30 years, at which point the debt will be written off. In 2020 students left with £45,060 in loans on average, according to the Higher Education Policy Institute.</p>
<p>If your daughter left university with £45,000 in debt and started on a salary of £28,000, assuming a 2.5pc annual pay rise, the debt would have grown to £96,829 after three decades, at which point it would be written off. </p>
<p>However, she would have paid just £36,117 over this time – or, more accurately, he would have paid this for her. </p>
<p>There are more variables to consider. The main factor in what they pay will be the difference in their salaries over the next 30 years, as well as any career breaks or life events that will stop them from making payments.</p>
<p>Graduates only begin to pay back their loans once they earn more than £27,295 a year, fixed at 9pc interest of earnings over this amount. This means they will be <a>paying back their respective loans at different rates</a>. </p>
<p>You have also suggested that your youngest could pay the first £40,000 of her student loan before you start to chip in. This means there will still be a disparity if she ends up paying more or less than this amount.</p>
