<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Nine days after a tornado demolished his three-story office building in downtown Mayfield, Kentucky, Sonny “Hoot” Gibson was standing in the rubble when he thought he heard a faint meow.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how anything could’ve survived not just the tornado but the destruction that came along with it,” he said.</p>
<p>Gibson was standing in the rubble Sunday afternoon when he heard the faint noise.</p>
<p>“I thought I heard a meow, and I thought my mind’s playing tricks on me so I hollered his name out, and he meowed again,” Gibson said. </p>
<p>The noise was stifled and he couldn’t locate Madix immediately so he called some employees who came to help search. Soon after, they found the cat in a hole beneath the rubble.</p>
<p>“It was just an incredible feeling to put him in my arms,” Gibson said. “If cats actually have nine lives, he probably used up about eight of them in that nine-day period.”</p>

<p>Other than being very hungry and thirsty, Madix was unscathed. Gibson said he took Madix home, where he will live out the rest of his days as a house cat.</p>
<p>Gibson said the story of Madix the survivor is becoming popular around the town of Mayfield, where a long-track tornado demolished huge parts of the community.</p>
<p>“It’s a blessing for people to hear the story so they can take that and realize that great things can come out of terrible situations. If it’s uplifting to one person, then Madix has served his purpose on this planet.”</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon was carjacked at gunpoint by two men in a south Philadelphia park but wasn’t injured, police and her office said.</p>
<p>Police said they were working with the FBI, which is taking the lead of the investigation.</p>
<p>Scanlon, whose district includes portions of south Philadelphia and neighboring Delaware County, was among elected officials meeting to discuss constituent concerns around ongoing development plans for the park, The Philadelphia Inquirer said.</p>
<p>Her office said Scanlon expressed gratitude to city police for their quick response and to her local police department and the Sergeant at Arms in Washington, D.C., for working with Philadelphia police “to ensure her continued safety.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Another danger to illicit drug users: Animal tranquilizer</h1></div><div>By LISA RATHKEDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Her death has “just ripped us to shreds,” said her mother, Deb Walker, who has four other children.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know Brooke was using drugs. I know absolutely she did not know that that was in there,” she said.</p>
<p>But unlike opioids, there’s no antidote like naloxone, also called Narcan, specific to a xylazine overdose.</p>
<p>The animal tranquilizer is also not a controlled substance and not approved for human use. When used in illicitly produced opioids, xylazine may increase the risk for fatal overdose, the CDC warns.</p>
<p>“It has been going on for a time but there’s also a lot of indications from local authorities that the problem is worsening, particularly here in the Northeast,” said Hadland.</p>
<p>One or more other drugs were also listed as the cause of the overdose deaths, including heroin and cocaine, with fentanyl being the most common, according to the CDC report.</p>
<p>Nationally, overdose deaths have been rising for the more than two decades but surged 30% in the latest year. Health officials say the jump is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.</p>
<p>In the small rural state of Vermont, the number of fatal overdoses involving xylazine combined with opioids tripled from five in 2020 to 15 in the first seven months of this year, according to a report from the Vermont Department of Health.</p>
<p>Lt. Casey Daniell, commander of the Vermont State Police drug unit, said it’s common to see xylazine in the test results for the drugs that police are purchasing undercover.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest issue is the fact that it’s not a controlled substance, so there’s no regulation on it,” he said. “It’s no different than aspirin,” so people cannot be charged for distributing it.</p>
<p>Walker says her daughter was poisoned.</p>
<p>Drugs and addiction had come up many times in their conversations, Walker said, because Goodwin was helping friends who were using.</p>
<p>“She was trying to help them out. She did everything she could to try and help them get clean and they pulled her down,” Walker said while visiting Goodwin’s grave earlier this month.</p>
<p>The more information that gets out there about xylazine, the better, she said. </p>
<p>“There are so many people that would like to not be (using) that haven’t been able to beat it. Those might be the people that would actually hear this and understand this and it might help and that would be super,” Walker said. </p>
<p>Brooke not only lived with her mother but worked with her at Precision Valley Communications, a mapping, engineering and design corporation for the telecommunications and utility industries, where she was a CAD operator.</p>
<p>“All my coworkers just thought she was wonderful and everyone was just so shocked. There was no clue. She was not an addict; however, she was using.” </p>
<p>Brooke died on March 14, 2021, two days after her birthday and a day before her mother’s. She “enjoyed her dog, photography, road trips and investigating the supernatural,” according to her obituary.</p>
<p>She was buried the day before Halloween, her favorite holiday, and people who attended were encouraged to dress up. Now her 9-year-old sisters, who are twins, are asking their mother if the family will get Brooke a Christmas present.</p>
<p>Her friend, Haley Decelle, says Brooke was “kind, calm and level-headed” and the pair had gone on frequent road trips and had matching tattoos. Decelle is pregnant now.</p>
<p>“It sucks because we always talked about doing all this stuff together when one of us got pregnant,” she said. “And now I don’t get to do it.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Hong Kong university removes Tiananmen massacre statue</h1></div><div>By KATIE TAM and ZEN SOODecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>HONG KONG (AP) — A monument at a Hong Kong university that commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre was removed by workers early Thursday over the objections of its creator from Denmark.</p>
<p>Workers barricaded the monument at the University of Hong Kong late Wednesday night. Drilling sounds and loud clanging could be heard coming from the boarded-up site, which was patrolled by guards. </p>
<p>“No party has ever obtained any approval from the university to display the statue on campus, and the university has the right to take appropriate actions to handle it at any time,” the university said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“Latest legal advice given to the university cautioned that the continued display of the statue would pose legal risks to the university based on the Crimes Ordinance enacted under the Hong Kong colonial government.”</p>
<p>The university said that it had requested for the statue to be put in storage and would continue to seek legal advice on follow-up actions.</p>
<p>The organization had said that it was dissolving, citing a climate of oppression, and that it did not own the sculpture. The university was told to speak to its creator instead. </p>
<p>When reached by The Associated Press, sculptor Galschiøt said he was only aware of what was happening to the sculpture Wednesday from social media and other reports.</p>
<p>“We don’t know exactly what happened, but I fear they destroy it,” he said. “This is my sculpture, and it is my property.”</p>
<p>Galschiøt said that he would sue the university if necessary to protect the sculpture.</p>
<p>He had previously written to the university to assert his ownership of the monument, although his requests had gone largely ignored. </p>
<p>The Pillar of Shame monument has been erected for over two decades, and initially stood at Hong Kong’s Victoria Park before eventually being moved to the University of Hong Kong on a long-term basis. </p>
<p>Over the past two years, the annual candlelight vigil in Hong Kong had been banned by authorities, who cited public risks from the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>Some 24 activists were charged for their roles in the Tiananmen vigil last year, during which activists turned up and thousands followed, breaking past barricades in the park to sing songs and light candles despite the police ban on the event.</p>

<p>As they have in the past, cardinals and bishops sat stone-faced as they listened to Francis lecture them in the Hall of Blessings, which was otherwise decked out in jolly twinkling Christmas trees and poinsettias.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Vatican novelty to start New Year as pope urges adoption</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Pope's 3 key words for a marriage: 'Please, thanks, sorry'</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Another COVID Christmas brings anxiety, but also optimism</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The proud who are so inward-looking are consumed with their own interests, the pontiff said. </p>
<p>“As a consequence, they neither learn from their sins nor are they genuinely open to forgiveness. This is a tremendous corruption disguised as a good. We need to avoid it,” he added.</p>
<p>On top of that, Francis added his Christmas greetings in the form of another public brow-beating of Vatican clerics, who normally are treated with the utmost deference by their underling and the faithful at large.</p>
<p>Francis told them to stop hiding behind the “armor” of their titles and to recognize that they, like the Biblical figure of Naaman, a wealthy and decorated general, were lepers in need of healing. </p>
<p>Francis also repeated his call for tradition-minded clerics to stop living in the past, saying their obsession with old doctrine and liturgy concealed a “spiritual worldliness” that was corrupting. </p>
<p>“Seeking those kinds of reassurance is the most perverse fruit of spiritual worldliness, for it reveals a lack of faith, hope and love; it leads to an inability to discern the truth of things,” he said.</p>
<p>Francis this year took his biggest step yet to rein in the traditionalist wing of the church, reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Pope Benedict XVI had relaxed in 2007.</p>
<p> He intensified those restrictions last weekend with a new set of rules that forbids even the publication of Tridentine Mass times in parish bulletins. </p>

<p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — “Home Alone” actor Devin Ratray surrendered to authorities in Oklahoma on Wednesday after he was accused of assaulting his girlfriend, police said.</p>
<p>Ratray, who played older brother Buzz McAllister in the 1990 Christmas movie, was released from jail shortly after his booking on two domestic assault and battery complaints, police said.</p>
<p>Ratray, 44, was in Oklahoma City earlier this month for an event called “Buzzed with Buzz,” which was promoted as a screening of the film along with a question-and-answer session with Ratray.</p>
<p>An affidavit says Ratray choked his girlfriend and said “This is how you die,” but Ratray denies those allegations, Oklahoma City TV station KFOR reported. </p>
<p>“Mr. Ratray denies he ever laid a hand on her or did anything in regards to anything like that,” his attorney Scott Adams said. </p>
<div><div><h1>US adds Merck pill as 2nd easy-to-use drug against COVID-19</h1></div><div>By MATTHEW PERRONEDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators on Thursday authorized the second pill against COVID-19, providing another easy-to-use medication to battle the rising tide of omicron infections.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration announcement on Merck’s molnupiravir comes one day after the agency cleared a competing drug from Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer’s pill, Paxlovid, is likely to become the first-choice treatment against the virus, because of its superior benefits and milder side effects.</p>
<p>Both treatments will be free to patients in the U.S. after being purchased by the federal government. </p>
<p>The FDA authorized Merck’s drug for adults with a positive COVID-19 test, early symptoms and who face the highest risks of hospitalization, including older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease. </p>
<p>Dr. Nick Kartsonis, Merck’s senior vice president of clinical research, said company scientists are still studying the drug and they hope to eventually get it approved for use in children.</p>
<p>The restrictions were expected after an FDA advisory panel only <a>narrowly endorsed</a> the drug last month, warning that its use would have to be strictly tailored to patients who can benefit the most. </p>
<p>Kartsonis said Merck researchers are “very comfortable” with their drug’s safety profile. </p>
<p>He also noted that molnupiravir has been studied in more than a thousand people, and researches saw side effects like diarrhea and nausea in only a small percentage of patients. </p>
<p>“The drug has actually looked very well tolerated,” he said.</p>
<p>Both treatments also should be started within five days of the beginning of symptoms, a deadline that puts pressure on patients to get tested and diagnosed quickly.</p>
<a>nearly 90% among high-risk patients,</a> compared with 30% for Merck’s.
<p>Some experts question whether there will be much of a role for the Merck drug in the U.S.</p>
<p>For now, the FDA decision provides another potential option against the virus that has killed more than 800,000 Americans, even as health officials brace for record-setting cases, hospitalizations and deaths driven by the omicron variant. </p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average for U.S. COVID-19 cases climbed past 160,000 Wednesday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. That’s more than double the average in late November. </p>
<p>Antiviral pills like Merck’s and Pfizer’s are expected to be effective against omicron because they don’t target the spike protein where most of the variant’s worrisome mutations reside.</p>
<p>Researchers have warned that older COVID-19 treatments that are administered by IV are unlikely to work against the new strain. </p>
<p>The FDA based its Merck decision on results showing nearly 7% of patients taking the drug ended up in the hospital and one died at the end of 30 days. That compared with 10% of patients hospitalized who were taking the placebo and nine deaths.</p>
<p>Merck says several hundred thousand treatment courses will be available in the U.S. in the next several days and a million will be available over the next few weeks. The supply of Pfizer’s drug is more limited before ramping up in 2022.</p>

<div><div><h1>He wore a wire, risked his life to expose who was in the KKK</h1></div><div>By JASON DEARENDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — For nearly 10 years, Joseph Moore lived a secret double life.</p>
<p>At times the U.S. Army veteran donned a white robe and hood as a hit man for the Ku Klux Klan in North Florida. He attended clandestine meetings and participated in cross burnings. He even helped plan the murder of a Black man.</p>
<p>One minor mistake, one tell, he believed, meant a certain, violent death.</p>
<p>Before such meetings, he would sit alone in his truck, his diaphragm heaving with the deep breathing techniques he learned as an Army-trained sniper.</p>
<p>“The FBI wanted me to gather as much information about these individuals and confirm their identities,” Moore said of law enforcement officers who were active members of or working with the klan.</p>
<p>“From where I sat, with the intelligence laid out, I can tell you that none of these agencies have any control over any of it. It is more prevalent and consequential than any of them are willing to admit.”</p>
<a> Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, Wayne Kerschner,</a> who was a member of the same group.
<p>His years as an informant occurred during a critical time for the nation’s domestic terrorism efforts. In 2006, the FBI had circulated an intelligence assessment about the klan and other groups trying to infiltrate law enforcement ranks. </p>
<p>The FBI did not answer a series of questions sent by the AP about Moore’s work as a confidential informant.</p>
<p>But he also acknowledges that successful undercover work required him to change into a wholly different person so that he could convince his klan brothers that he was one of them.</p>
<p>It worked, and Moore was given high-level access and trust. </p>
<p>“If you’re not credible, if you’re not engaged on all levels, you don’t get to go home to your family. So you have to jump all in in order to keep you and your family safe,” he said.</p>
<p>When the FBI agents with whom he worked discovered that his wife knew, they ended the relationship with the agency, and Moore sought additional mental and physical health treatment through the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Still, after some time away, the FBI would come back to him and recruit him for his second mission. </p>
<p>“And this wasn’t the only person that they wanted to target,” said Moore. “There were other people in the community that they wanted to target. But this was the one that we could build a case on.”</p>
<p>Over his decade inside, Moore said his list of other law enforcement officers tied to the klan grew. The links, he said, were commonplace in Florida and Georgia, and easier to identify once he was inside.</p>
<p>“I was on track to uncover more activity in law enforcement, but the immediate threat to the public with the murder plot was a priority,” Moore said. “And I was only one person. There was only so much I could do.”</p>
<p>Florida’s Department of Corrections said that’s not true.</p>
<p>After testifying in the murder conspiracy case against the klansmen he’d spent years working with, Moore’s work with the FBI ended. He’d been publicly identified, and in 2018 he began life under a new name.</p>
<p>But he lost close friends, he said, who were angry that he had claimed fraudulent military honors as part of his alter ego.</p>
<p>Today Moore is worried that the men he helped put into prison know where he is and are looking for revenge. They’re all due out in a few years.</p>
<p>Moore has installed motion-detecting surveillance cameras outside the home that allow him to monitor any activity, and carries a gun everywhere he goes.</p>
<p>He said, at this point, he believes coming out of the shadows and publicly discussing his story is the best way to protect himself and his family.</p>
<p>Moore also does not want his work, and those of other confidential informants who put their lives on the line to help expose domestic extremists, to have been in vain.</p>
<p>He said he wants Florida’s corrections and law enforcement leaders to conduct systemwide investigations to root out white supremacists and other violent extremists.</p>

<div><div><h1>Texas governor’s decision: Whether to pardon George Floyd</h1></div><div>By PAUL J. WEBERDecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Doling out pardons is a holiday tradition for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who around every Christmas grants them to a handful of ordinary citizens, typically for minor offenses committed years or decades ago. </p>
<p>But one name stands out on his desk: George Floyd.</p>
<a>unanimously recommended</a> a pardon for Floyd in October.
<li><div><a><h4>Republicans propose incentives for police recruits</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Juror: Kim Potter made mistake but was still responsible </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Court: Woman who threatened Black child violated law </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Man sentenced for Indiana blast that scattered protesters</h4></a></div></li>
<p>A spokeswoman for Abbott did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Pardons restore the rights of the convicted and forgive them in the eyes of the law. Floyd’s family and supporters said a posthumous pardon for him in Texas would show a commitment to accountability. </p>
<p>In February 2004, Floyd was arrested in Houston for selling $10 worth of crack in a police sting. He pleaded guilty to a drug charge and served 10 months in prison. </p>
<a>over a deadly drug raid in 2019</a> that resulted in murder charges against an officer,
<p>Goines has pleaded not guilty and his attorneys accuse Ogg of launching the review for political gain.</p>
<p>“As he’s always said, he is a law and order governor,” West said. “And this would be following the law.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Texas board withdraws pardon recommendation for George Floyd</h1></div><div>By PAUL J. WEBERDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The unusual reversal was announced by Abbott’s office two days before Christmas, around the time he typically doles out his annual pardons.</p>
<p>In October, the board <a>had unanimously recommended</a> that Floyd become just the second person in Texas since 2010 to receive a posthumous pardon from the governor. </p>
<p>“As a result of the Board’s withdrawal of the recommendation concerning George Floyd, Governor Abbott did not have the opportunity to consider it,” Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze said in a statement. </p>
<p>Mathis called the last-minute reversal a “ridiculous farce.” She said the board — which is stocked with Abbott appointees — did not make her aware of any issues prior to the announcement from the governor’s office. </p>
<p>“It really strains credibility for them to say now that it’s out of compliance, after the board has already voted on it,” she said. </p>
<p>Floyd grew up and was <a>laid to rest </a> in Houston. In June, former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for Floyd’s murder, which led to a national reckoning in the U.S. over race and policing. </p>
<p>Pardons restore the rights of the convicted and forgive them in the eyes of the law. <a>But in Floyd’s case</a>, his family and supporters said a posthumous pardon in Texas would show a commitment to accountability. </p>
<a>a deadly Houston drug raid in 2019</a> that involved the same officer who arrested Floyd.
<a>faces murder charges</a>, has denied wrongdoing. More than 160 drug convictions tied to him over the years have since been dismissed by prosecutors due to concerns about his casework.
<p>A number listed for Gutierrez was not answered Thursday. </p>
<a>and floated the idea of a “George Floyd Act” </a> that would take aim at police brutality. But when the Texas Legislature convened months later, Abbott was silent over policing reforms pushed by Democrats and made police funding a priority.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump turned to the Supreme Court on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to keep documents away from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol led by his supporters.</p>
<p>“The Select Committee needs the requested documents now to help shape the direction of the investigation and allow the Select Committee to timely recommend remedial legislation,” lawyers for the committee wrote. </p>

<div><div><h1>5 teenagers charged in armed carjacking of US Rep. Scanlon</h1></div><div>By BRUCE SHIPKOWSKIDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Five teenagers were charged Thursday after the vehicle stolen at gunpoint in Philadelphia from U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon was found in neighboring Delaware, police said.</p>
<p>Scanlon’s blue Acura MDX was located Wednesday night in Newark, Delaware, about 45 miles (74 kilometers) from Philadelphia, Delaware State Police said. The five were apprehended as they tried to flee, police said.</p>
<p>Scanlon was physically unharmed, said her spokesperson, Lauren Cox. Several personal and work items were also taken with the vehicle, police said.</p>
<p>There was no indication the teenagers knew who Scanlon was.</p>
<p>The FBI on Thursday charged Josiah Brown, 19, with carjacking, a weapons charge, and aiding and abetting. He has not yet retained a lawyer to speak on his behalf.</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, Brown was carrying the keys to Scanlon’s vehicle.</p>
<p>The FBI said Brown “provided a written apology to the victim, indicating that he was sorry for stealing the car and for pointing a gun at her.”</p>
<p>A 14-year-old female and three males, ages 13, 15, and 16, were each charged with receiving stolen property. The 15-year-old was also charged with resisting arrest and criminal mischief. Their names were not released because they are juveniles.</p>
<p>All the juveniles were released to their parents or guardians, while the 15-year-old was taken to a detention center, police said.</p>
<p>All the suspects are from Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>Scanlon, whose district includes portions of south Philadelphia and neighboring Delaware County, was among elected officials meeting to discuss constituent concerns around ongoing development plans for the park, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>Scanlon also noted it wasn’t the first time she has been at a crime scene this year, as she was present in the House during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Scanlon said President Biden spoke with her Thursday to see how she was faring after the incident.</p>
<p>Scanlon has also expressed gratitude to city police for their quick response. She also thanked her local police department and the Sergeant at Arms in Washington for working with Philadelphia police “to ensure her continued safety.”</p>
<p>Mayor Jim Kenney said he was “appalled to learn of this violent crime” against the congresswoman, whom he described as his friend and colleague.</p>
<p>“My thoughts are with her during what I’m sure is a traumatic time,” he said in a Twitter post. </p>
<div><div><h1>Kim Potter guilty of manslaughter in Daunte Wright’s death</h1></div><div>By AMY FORLITI and SCOTT BAUERDecember 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<a>former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter</a> guilty of
<a>first-degree and second-degree manslaughter</a>. Potter, 49, faces about seven years in prison under the state’s sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors said they would seek a longer term.
<p>As she was led away in handcuffs, a Potter family member in the courtroom shouted “Love you, Kim!” Potter’s attorneys left the courthouse without commenting and didn’t immediately respond to phone messages or emails.</p>
<a>helped convict Derek Chauvin in George Floyd’s death</a> in the very same courtroom just eight months earlier.
<p>They chanted “Say his name! Daunte Wright!” Some held yellow signs that said “guilty” in large block letters.</p>
<p>Potter, who testified that she “didn’t want to hurt anybody,” looked down without any visible reaction when the verdicts were read. As Chu thanked the jury, Potter made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Potter’s attorneys argued that she should be allowed to remain free until she’s sentenced, saying she wasn’t going to commit another crime or go anywhere.</p>
<p>“It is the Christmas holiday season,” Potter attorney Paul Engh argued. “She’s a devoted Catholic, no less, and there is no point to incarcerate her at this point in time.”</p>
<p>Chu rejected their arguments, though, saying she “cannot treat this case any differently than any other case.”</p>
<p>Though Potter showed no visible emotion in court as the verdicts were read, she was photographed smiling in a mug shot taken later as she was processed at a women’s prison near Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Outside the courthouse afterward, Ellison said the verdict brought a measure of accountability for Potter but fell short of justice.</p>
<p>Ellison said he felt sympathy for Potter, who has gone from being an “esteemed member of the community” to being convicted of a serious crime.</p>
<p>Wright’s mother hugged Ellison and said the verdicts triggered “every single emotion that you could imagine.” </p>
<p>“Today we have gotten accountability and that’s what we’ve been asking for from the beginning,” Katie Bryant said, crediting supporters for keeping up pressure.</p>
<p>“We love you, we appreciate you, and honestly, we could not have done it without you,” she said.</p>
<a>Chauvin standing trial in nearby Minneapolis</a> for Floyd’s death.
<p>“(Expletive)! I just shot him. ... I grabbed the wrong (expletive) gun,” Potter said on video shown to the jury. Moments later, she said: “I’m going to go to prison.”</p>
<p>During her sometimes tearful testimony, Potter told jurors that she was “sorry it happened.” She said the traffic stop “just went chaotic.”</p>
<p>“Sgt. Johnson was clearly not afraid of being dragged,” Eldridge said. “He never said he was scared. He didn’t say it then, and he didn’t testify to it in court.”</p>
<p>Bauer reported from Madison, Wisconsin. Associated Press writers Mohamed Ibrahim in Minneapolis and Kathleen Foody in Chicago contributed to this report.</p>
<p>This story has been corrected to delete a reference to Potter pulling out her gun after she shouted a Taser warning. Body camera video shows her gun was already in her hand at the time.</p>

<p>HONOLULU (AP) — Rescuers trekked through heavy snow and sleet to find a hiker lost in one of the most dangerous places in Hawaii. </p>
<p>Rangers said the hiker registered at the the visitor’s center for Mauna Kea, Hawaii’s tallest peak, before he set off Tuesday morning. But the Center of Maunakea Stewardship said he gave rangers the wrong number.</p>
<p>Rangers tried to contact him after it got dark, but couldn’t reach him. They used the hiker’s 911 calls to connect with him and narrow the search area.</p>
<p>Rescuers hiked about a mile (1.6 kilometers) and found him Tuesday night in a small cave in “thick white-out conditions” at 13,000 feet (3,962-meters) above sea level, the center’s news release said.</p>
<p>He was able to walk out on his own but was taken to a hospital. </p>
<p>The mountain’s summit is dangerous because of “extreme altitude and weather conditions, and emergency services may be two hours away because of its remote location,” the release said. </p>

<div><div><h1>EXPLAINER: What will judge weigh in sentencing Kim Potter?</h1></div><div>By AMY FORLITIDecember 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her Taser when she killed Daunte Wright will be sentenced in February after a jury convicted her Thursday on two counts of manslaughter. </p>
<p>The most serious charge against <a>Kim Potter</a> — first-degree manslaughter — carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Here’s how her sentencing could play out: </p>
<li><div><a><h4>8-year-old girl killed by driver who fled in Brooklyn Center</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Juror: Kim Potter made mistake but was still responsible </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>EXPLAINER: Are more defendants testifying at trial? </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>EXPLAINER: What will judge weigh in sentencing Kim Potter?</h4></a></div></li>
<p>WHAT SENTENCE IS POSSIBLE?</p>
<p>Under Minnesota statutes, Potter, who is white, will be sentenced only on the most serious charge of first-degree manslaughter. That’s because both of the charges against her stem from one act, with one victim.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE AGGRAVATING FACTORS</p>
<a>said her father had health issues</a> before the crash, but that they accelerated after it happened. He’s now in his 80s and in hospice care.
<p>Prosecutors also say Potter abused her authority as a police officer. </p>
<p>POSSIBLE MITIGATING FACTORS</p>
<p>Defense attorney Paul Engh said the defense would be seeking a “dispositional departure” from sentencing guidelines. </p>
<a>The former Minneapolis police officer convicted in George Floyd’s death, Derek Chauvin</a>, has been in solitary confinement for that reason.
<p>Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines were created to establish consistent sentences that don’t consider factors such as race or gender. </p>
<p>“If you stay within the box as far as the sentences being reasonable, it’s a pretty hard thing to argue on appeal,” he said. </p>
<p>HOW LONG WOULD POTTER SERVE?</p>
<p>No matter what sentence Potter gets, in Minnesota it’s presumed that a defendant with good behavior will serve two-thirds of their penalty in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole.</p>

<div><div><h1>Russian court slaps Google, Meta with massive fines</h1></div><div>By ULIANA PAVLOVADecember 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Tagansky District Court ruled that Google repeatedly neglected to remove the banned content, and ordered the company to pay an administrative fine of about 7.2 billion rubles (about $98.4 million). </p>
<p>Google said it would study the court documents before deciding on its next steps.</p>
<p>Later Friday, the court also slapped a fine of nearly 2 billion rubles ($27.2 million) on Meta for failure to remove banned content.</p>
<p>Russian courts had previously imposed smaller fines on Google, Facebook and Twitter this year, and Friday’s rulings marked the first time the size of the fine was calculated based on revenue.</p>
<p>The agency said that Facebook and Instagram have failed to remove 2,000 items despite the courts’ requests to do so, while Google has failed to delete 2,600 such items.</p>
<p>It warned that they may face more revenue-based fines for failure to delete the banned content.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have steadily ramped up pressure on social media platforms, accusing them of failing to purge content related to drug abuse, weapons and explosives and extremist views. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, authorities criticized tech companies for not deleting announcements about unsanctioned protests in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Russian authorities also have demanded that foreign tech giants store the personal data of Russian citizens on servers in Russia, threatening them with fines or possible bans if they fail to comply.</p>
<p>Alexander Khinshtein, head of the committee on information policies in the lower house of Russian parliament, said the massive fine should send a clear message to all IT giants.</p>
<p>He added that Russian law envisages other forms of punishment for failure to comply with court orders, including slowing down traffic and complete blocking.</p>
<div><div><h1>Coroner IDs girl killed by police in Los Angeles shooting</h1></div><div>By STEFANIE DAZIODecember 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Police also fatally shot the suspect Thursday morning at a Burlington store in the North Hollywood area of the San Fernando Valley, police said.</p>
<p>In the last week, LA officers have killed four people — including two men in separate incidents on Saturday, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Officers answered a report of an assault and others of shots being fired, police said. Investigators have not found a gun at the scene.</p>
<p>The suspect was shot and died at the store but one of the bullets went through drywall behind the man and killed the girl, who was in a changing room with her mother, police said.</p>
<p>Officers found the teenager dead after seeing a hole in “a solid wall that you can’t see behind,” LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said.</p>
<p>Investigators didn’t immediately know whether she was in the dressing room before the violence began or ran in there to hide, he said.</p>
<p>Moore promised a “thorough, complete and transparent investigation” into the shooting and said a critical incident video that will include 911 calls, body camera and other video will be released by Monday.</p>
<p>The woman who was attacked is not being identified.</p>
<p>Investigators were trying to determine whether the assault was random or targeted. Choi said they don’t believe the teenager was related to the person who was attacked.</p>
<p>Police found a heavy metal cable lock near the suspect, Choi said.</p>
<p>The California Department of Justice was investigating the shooting, Attorney General Rob Bonta said.</p>
<p>News reports showed a woman with a bloodied face, who appeared to be the assault victim, being placed in an ambulance.</p>
<p>The victim was taken to the hospital with moderate to serious injuries, Fire Department spokesperson Nicholas Prange said. Choi said she had wounds to her head, arms and face.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Times reported that the Burlington store remained closed even though it was supposed to open at 7 a.m. </p>
<p>Multiple signs posted in Spanish and English that read “closed until further notice!!!” greeted would-be shoppers as others left flowers and a flickering candle in a memorial for the teen outside the store.</p>
<p>Edwin Arroyo, supervisor of Nancy’s Cleaning Services, <a>told the Times</a> he discovered blood smeared on a wall in the dressing room, as well as on a cream-colored dress left on a hanger.</p>
<p>“It was a horrible scene,” Arroyo, a father of daughters ages 12 and 18, told the newspaper. “I don’t know how many gunshots there were, but there was a lot of blood everywhere.”</p>
<p>A police bullet killed Melyda Corado, 27, the assistant store manager, as she ran toward the store’s entrance after hearing the car crash.</p>
<p>The suspect, Gene Evin Atkins, took employees and shoppers hostage for three hours before surrendering, authorities said.</p>
<p>Atkins has pleaded not guilty to the killing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors found two police officers acted lawfully when they returned Atkins’ gunfire.</p>
<div><div><h1>Jake’s mice: Searching for answers to the puzzle of autism</h1></div><div>By LAURA UNGARJanuary 2, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>ST. LOUIS (AP) — Jake Litvag leaned in for a closer look as a lab mouse scurried around an enclosure, stopping to sniff a large block.</p>
<p>“Hi, Jakob 1. I’m Jake,” the 16-year-old said, naming the little furry creature engineered to have the same genetic abnormality he has.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>NASA nails trickiest job on newly launched space telescope</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>California adopts water restrictions as drought drags on</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Climate change, new construction mean more ruinous fires</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jake's mice: Searching for answers to the puzzle of autism</h4></a></div></li>
<p>“Oh wow. Cool!” Jake said as he watched a mouse climb down a pole while others scampered in a bin.</p>
<p>Walking out of the lab, tears welled up in Lisa Litvag’s eyes as she thought about the language within her son’s cells helping other kids.</p>
<p>“We’re deeply proud and humbled to be part of this,” said Joe Litvag. “What do we live this life for? It’s ultimately to try to, in one way, shape or form, be of service to others.”</p>
<p>The Litvags realized early on that Jake wasn’t reaching childhood milestones. He couldn’t walk without assistance until he was 4. He struggled to string sentences together in first grade.</p>
<p>At first, no one could pin down why. Jake had a mix of different traits. He was hyperactive and impulsive but also social, warm and funny. It took until he was 5 to get a firm diagnosis of autism.</p>
<p>About five years later, Constantino proposed genetic testing. It revealed the missing copy of the MYT1L gene believed to cause one out of every 10,000 to 50,000 autism cases. Having an extra copy can cause schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The finding brought the family peace. They’d heard lots of people say autism was mostly caused by external factors, like birth trauma. “For a long time,” Lisa Litvag said, “I thought it was something that I did.”</p>
<p>Actually, a large multinational study suggests that up to 80% of the risk for autism can be traced to inherited genes.</p>
<p>“One of the big things it did for us as a family is it made us realize that it’s nothing that we did wrong,” Joe Litvag said. “It’s just that people are born all the time” with genetic differences.</p>
<p>Joe Litvag, an executive in the live music industry, and Lisa Litvag, a partner in a marketing firm, reached out to family and friends and raised the $70,000 needed in about six months.</p>
<p>While scientists can’t go back and see how Jake’s brain developed, Dougherty said, mice allow them to watch the mutation play out through generations.</p>
<p>Dougherty and his colleagues hope what they learn about how MYT1L functions ultimately leads to medicines or gene therapies that improve or even correct the problems the mutation causes. </p>
<p>After meeting the mice, they stopped into another lab, where Jake peered through a microscope at his blue-stained stem cells. </p>
<p>“That’s me! That’s cool stuff. I never saw anything like that in my life,” he said, stepping back to lean into his dad, who pulled him close.</p>
<p>Dougherty used the visit as an opportunity to share some news, a gift of sorts that he wanted to tell the family in person.</p>
<p>The missing gene doesn’t seem to shorten life. The mice live 2 to 3 years, the same as their siblings.</p>
<p>“So, a normal life span?” Joe Litvag asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Dougherty answered. “As far as we can tell, identical. I know that’s a big relief, too.”</p>
<p>Joe Litvag turned to his son. “So Jake, maybe you will live to be 100.”</p>
<p>“I will be 112!” Jake replied with a grin.</p>

<div><div><h1>Brown walks away from Bucs; Brady rallies team past Jets</h1></div><div>By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Antonio Brown was apparently frustrated and angry. So he walked away.</p>
<p>From the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And possibly his NFL career.</p>
<p>The mercurial wide receiver was kicked off the Buccaneers after a bizarre, shirtless exit from the field before Tom Brady coolly led the Bucs on a 93-yard drive in the final minutes for a 28-24 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>Coach Bruce Arians said after the game Brown was off the team.</p>
<p>“He is no longer a Buc,” Arians said. “All right? That’s the end of the story. Let’s talk about the guys who went out there and won the game.”</p>
<p>It appeared to be a show of frustration by Brown, who had three catches for 26 yards.</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about it,” Arians said. “He’s not part of the Bucs.”</p>
<p>Brown was suspended last month for three games for violating the league’s COVID-19 protocols. He also has a history of personal conduct issues and bizarre behavior.</p>
<p>Brady connected with Cameron Brate for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the 4 shortly after Brown’s exit, and the QB finished the Bucs’ rally with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Cyril Grayson with 15 seconds left.</p>
<p>“We did a very poor job of communicating that,” Saleh said, adding that ”it just makes you sick” because a handoff to Berrios would’ve likely been a first down.</p>
<p>Instead, it gave Brady and the Bucs the ball back with 2:12 left.</p>
<p>And that was more than enough time.</p>
<p>He finished 34 of 50 for 410 yards, the three TDs and an interception for Tampa Bay, which had Arians back after he tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Le’Veon Bell ran in the 2-point conversion against his former team, forcing New York to need a touchdown. But the Jets (4-12) ran out of time.</p>
<p>“We’ve been in some crazy situations before,” Arians said, “but this was a very special one to come back and win that game.”</p>
<p>The game featured the largest age gap between starting quarterbacks since at least 1950, with the 22-year-old Wilson facing the 44-year-old Brady.</p>
<p>The Jets took a two-touchdown lead on Ty Johnson’s 1-yard run that capped their opening drive of the second half.</p>
<p>After Brown’s exit and Brady’s TD to Brate, Ryan Succop kicked a 27-yard field goal to cut New York’s lead to 24-20 with 7:36 left.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that we’re going to be talking about the last sequence of events there,” Saleh said, “but I thought our guys were outstanding today. They deserved better.”</p>
<p>Carter had a 55-yard run early in the drive to get the Jets to the Buccaneers 12.</p>
<p>Wilson, who was 19 of 33 for 234 yards and a TD, answered right back with a 9-yard TD pass to Berrios for a 14-7 lead.</p>
<p>It was a costly 13-play, 74-yard drive for the Jets, though, as both Carter (concussion) and left tackle George Fant (left knee) were injured and didn’t return.</p>
<p>A 39-yarder by Succop made it 14-10.</p>
<p>Brandin Echols intercepted Brady on Tampa Bay’s last possession of the first half and returned it 30 yards to the Jets 48. New York turned it into points on Eddy Pineiro’s 51-yard field goal with 1 second left.</p>
<p>Brady, who improved to 31-8 against the Jets, also tied Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers as the only players with three seasons of 40 or more TD passes.</p>
<p>Buccaneers: RB Ronald Jones (ankle) and DB Rashard Robinson (groin) didn’t come back after leaving in the second half.</p>
<p>Jets: In addition to Carter and Fant, TE Dan Brown left in the second quarter with a hip injury and didn’t return.</p>
<p>Buccaneers: Finish the regular season by hosting the Carolina Panthers next Sunday.</p>
<p>Jets: Wrap up their season at Buffalo next Sunday against AFC East rival Bills.</p>

<div><div><h1>Bucs coach: Antonio Brown didn’t claim injury before walkoff</h1></div><div>By FRED GOODALLJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Antonio Brown’s latest messy departure from an NFL team, the Buccaneers, was not about an injury, coach Bruce Arians said Monday. </p>
<p>Yes, the Buccaneers are moving on from Brown, whose NFL career is on hold yet again after another in a series of incidents, including two women accusing him of sexual assault in 2019. </p>
<p>Twice, Arians was asked about Brown claiming he was hurt. Both times, the coach answered “No,” that Brown didn’t tell him he was injured. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty obvious what happened. He left the field and that was it,” Arians said, declining to elaborate on an exchange the coach said he had with the receiver on the sideline.</p>
<p>Pressed for details on what was said and whether Brown claimed he was too injured to play, Arians replied: “We had a conversation and he left the field.”</p>
<p>Asked what specifically was said that might move Brown to react the way he did, the coach added: “You have to ask him, brother. I don’t have a clue.”</p>

<p>The 33-year-old Brown also had messy departures from Oakland and New England — released before ever playing a game for the Raiders and then suiting up just once during a brief stay with the Brady-led Patriots in 2019.</p>
<p>Brown remained in the New York area, sitting courtside Monday night at the Brooklyn Nets’ loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<p>“I took a lot of time off from the game to re-evaluate myself, to look within, to get a better perspective of myself and work on myself within and without,” Brown said in November 2020.</p>
<p>Brady welcomed Tampa Bay’s decision to give Brown a chance and allowed the four-time All Pro to stay with him in a home the quarterback was renting from baseball Hall of Famer Derek Jeter.</p>
<p>“I won’t say I’m a different person, but I’m a better person,” Brown said then. “Learning a lot about myself, working on myself for a year and a half, I think I’m a better person.”</p>
<p>Several members of Arians’ staff in Tampa Bay, including offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, also worked with Brown early in the receiver’s career. Brown said he felt those relationships would help him make the most of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Brown had 45 receptions for 483 yards and four TDs over the final eight games of last season. He also contributed during the playoffs and caught a TD pass in the Bucs’ Super Bowl win over Kansas City.</p>
<p>He signed another one-year deal last May and was off to a strong start when he was sidelined with the ankle injury at Philadelphia in mid-October.</p>
<p>Brown returned to the lineup two weeks ago after serving a three-game suspension for misrepresenting his COVID-19 vaccination status with a fake card, and had 10 catches for 101 yards in a win over Carolina.</p>
<p>He had three reception for 26 yards against the Jets, finishing the season with 42 catches for 545 yards and four TDs.</p>
<p>An impressive streak of six consecutive seasons with at least 100 catches and 1,000 yards receiving ended when Brown’s erratic behavior on and off the field led Pittsburgh to trade him to Oakland in March 2019. </p>
<p>He also tangled with the NFL and threatened to retire if forced to wear a new helmet. He later was fined by the Raiders for what the team said were unexcused absences during camp.</p>
<p>Brown also had an ugly departure from New England after catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in his only game with the Patriots, which released him after the ex-trainer accused him of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Over 12 NFL seasons, Brown has 928 receptions for 12,291 yards and 83 touchdowns. He’s caught a pass in his last 144 games, the longest active streak in the league.</p>
<div><div><h1>Document Prince Andrew claims prevents lawsuit is released</h1></div><div>By LARRY NEUMEISTERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The prince’s lawyers say that language should bar Virginia Giuffre from suing Andrew now, even though he wasn’t a party to the original settlement.</p>
<p>The private 2009 legal deal resolved Giuffre’s allegations that Epstein had hired her as a teenager to be a sexual servant at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>The settlement unsealed Monday also doesn’t mention Andrew, but contains a single paragraph saying it protects anyone “who could have been included as a potential defendant” from being sued by Giuffre.</p>
<p>Attorney Andrew Brettler, representing the prince, has told a Manhattan federal court judge that the agreement should release Andrew “from any purported liability.”</p>
<p>Boies said he wanted the Epstein-Giuffre agreement publicly released “to refute the claims being made about it by Prince Andrew’s” public relations campaign.</p>
<p>Giuffre sued the prince in August, saying he had sexually assaulted her multiple times in 2001 when she was 17.</p>
<p>The prince’s lawyers say Andrew never sexually abused or assaulted Giuffre and that he “unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations against him.”</p>
<p>They also wrote that Giuffre sued Andrew “to achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him. Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre does not justify her public campaign against Prince Andrew.”</p>
<p>Arguments over the request to dismiss the lawsuit are scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Recently, the prince’s lawyers have said Giuffre should be disallowed from suing in the U.S. because she has lived most of the past two decades in Australia and can’t accurately claim to be a resident of Colorado, where her mother lives.</p>
<p>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan has rejected an attempt by the lawyers to halt progression of the lawsuit and to subject Giuffre to a deposition over the issue of where she is a resident.</p>
<p>In late 2019, Prince Andrew told BBC Newsnight that he never had sex with Giuffre, saying, “It didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>He said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her.</p>
<p>The interview was widely panned by critics who said Andrew seemed insensitive to Epstein’s victims. Afterward, the prince stepped back from royal duties.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Giuffre’s lawyers and with Brettler.</p>
<p>Epstein, 66, killed himself in August 2019 as he awaited trial in the U.S. on sex trafficking charges that didn’t involve Andrew.</p>
<p>His former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, was convicted last week in Manhattan on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges related to several women after a month-long trial. Giuffre was not one of the alleged victims in that case.</p>
<p>Judge Alison J. Nathan, who presided over the trial, asked lawyers on both sides to suggest when a sentencing date should be set and when a trial should be scheduled on perjury charges that were severed from the other charges Maxwell faced.</p>
<p>The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they choose to come forward publicly, as Giuffre has done.</p>
<div><div><h1>Navy blocked from acting against 35 COVID vaccine refusers</h1></div><div>By ROBERT BURNSJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge in Texas has granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Navy from acting against 35 sailors for refusing on religious grounds to comply with an order to get vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>There was no indication that the order would affect service members beyond the 35 sailors who sued Austin and the Navy.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said officials are reviewing the injunction and are in discussion with the Department of Justice “as to what options might be available to us going forward.”</p>
<p>In his decision Monday, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor wrote that the Navy’s process for considering a sailor’s request for a religious exemption is flawed and amounts to “theater.” </p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Without commenting on the case in Texas, Kirby last month defended the validity of the military service’s processes for considering religious exemptions.</p>
<p>“Each exemption asked for on religious grounds is evaluated by a chaplain, by a chain of command, by medical experts and is given quite a lot of thought, and they’re all decided case by case individually,” he said Dec. 21.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs’ beliefs about the vaccine are undisputedly sincere, and it is not the role of this court to determine their truthfulness or accuracy,” the judge wrote.</p>
<p>The injunction was first reported by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>The sailors who sued are members of the Naval Special Warfare Command, including SEALs. The suit was filed by First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on defending religious liberty.</p>
<a>USS Theodore Roosevelt</a> aircraft carrier were infected, starting in late March while on a deployment to Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia. The ship was taken out of operation at Guam, its commanding officer was relieved of duty and the crisis led to the

<div><div><h1>Former Theranos CEO Holmes convicted of fraud and conspiracy</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL LIEDTKEJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<ul><li>– Scientist, enforcer, high-flyer: 3 women put a mark on tech</li><li>– EXPLAINER: Why Elizabeth Holmes' fraud case turns on intent</li><li><a>– EXPLAINER: Are more defendants testifying at trial? </a></li></ul>
<a> a complex trial</a> that featured reams of evidence and 32 witnesses — including Holmes herself. She now faces up to 20 years in prison for each count, although legal experts say she is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence.
<p>Her conviction might lower the wattage — at least temporarily — on the brash promises and bold exaggerations that have become a routine part of the tech industry’s innovation hustle.</p>
<p>“Investors are still going to want to make more money on a promising idea.,” Kreitzberg said. “They will always go in for the golden ring.”</p>
<p>During a brief break after the verdict was read, a visibly shaken Evans stepped into the courthouse hallway to get a get drink from a water fountain while apparently trying to compose himself.</p>
<p>Holmes did not respond to questions about the verdicts lobbed at her during a three-block walk from the courthouse to the nearby hotel where she has stayed during jury deliberations.</p>
<p>In a written statement, U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jury for navigating the case through the pandemic and said Holmes must now be held “culpable” for her crimes.</p>
<p>Although she was convicted of bamboozling investors, Holmes received a reprieve from the jury on the fraud accusations involving patients who submitted to inaccurate blood tests that could have endangered their health.</p>
<p>Ring said the charges related to the patients looked more difficult to prove from the outset because Holmes never directly communicated with them, as she did with investors.</p>
<p>The bold dream Holmes pursued when she founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 had become a nightmare by the time she was indicted on felony charges in 2018.</p>
<p>The deception came to light in 2015 after a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal and a regulatory audit of Theranos uncovered potentially dangerous flaws in the company’s technology, leading to its eventual collapse.</p>
<p>Instead, she heaped blame on Balwani, who she secretly lived with while the two were running Theranos. </p>
<p>This story has been updated to correct the counts on which Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty. She was convicted on three charges of fraud and one of conspiracy to commit fraud, not two charges of fraud and two of conspiracy.</p>

<div><div><h1>Trump, Ivanka, Don Jr. subpoenaed in New York AG’s probe</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL R. SISAKJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Last month, it was reported that James’ office had requested Trump sit for a deposition.</p>
<p>James, a Democrat, has spent more than two years looking at whether the Trump Organization misled banks or tax officials about the value of assets — inflating them to gain favorable loan terms or minimizing them to reap tax savings.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>In their own words: House lawmakers remember Jan. 6</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Election officials to rebut claims in Arizona ballot review</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The judge, Arthur Engoron, previously sided with James on other matters relating to the probe, including making another Trump son, Trump Organization executive Eric Trump, testify after his lawyers abruptly canceled a scheduled deposition.</p>
<p>In the past, the Republican ex-president has decried James’ investigation as part of a “witch hunt” along with a parallel criminal probe being run by the Manhattan district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Although James’ civil investigation is separate from the criminal investigation, her office has been involved in both, dispatching several lawyers to work side-by-side with prosecutors from the Manhattan D.A.’s office.</p>
<a> to his successor, Bragg.</a> The new district attorney has said he’ll be directly involved in the Trump matter while also retaining the two veteran prosecutors who led the case under Vance.
<p>Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he and the company evaded taxes on lucrative fringe benefits paid to executives.</p>
<p>Still, it’s exceedingly rare for law enforcement agencies to issue a civil subpoena for testimony from a person who is also the subject of a related criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Both investigations are at least partly related to allegations made in news reports and by Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump had a history of misrepresenting the value of assets.</p>
<p>James’ office has also been looking at similar issues relating to a Trump office building in New York City, a hotel in Chicago and a golf course near Los Angeles.</p>
