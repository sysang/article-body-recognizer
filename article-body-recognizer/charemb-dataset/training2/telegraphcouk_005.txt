<h1> A forced confession, a shocking revelation and an inevitable resignation – how Hancock affair unfolded </h1>
<p> Within 48 hours of CCTV images of the Health Secretary kissing his aide becoming public, his career and his marriage lay in tatters </p>
<div> <div> By Patrick Sawer, Senior News Reporter and Edward Malnick, Sunday Political Editor <time> 26 June 2021 • 10:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>On Thursday evening, Matt Hancock apparently told his wife, Martha, he had something to confess.</p>
<p>The Health Secretary, 42, admitted he had been having an affair with his aide and old Oxford university friend Gina Coladangelo, 43, and that he had decided to leave her.</p>
<p>It now seems premature if not outright wishful thinking for Boris Johnson to have declared that he<a> considered “the matter closed” </a>within hours of those now famous CCTV images of his Health Secretary becoming public.</p>
<p>Indeed within 48 hours, Mr Hancock had been forced to resign from his Cabinet position, the pressure from both the public and a small but growing number of fellow Tory MPs making his position untenable.</p>
<p>His downfall began when he received a telephone call from The Sun at around 6pm on Thursday evening, setting out details of the leaked images obtained by the newspaper which would expose his affair with Ms Coladangelo.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the newspaper published a cringe-inducing<a> set of CCTV stills, showing Mr Hancock in an embrace with his senior aide, </a>who had been appointed as a £15,000 non-executive director in the same department he oversaw.</p>
<p>Jaws fell slack around the country at the sight of the pair kissing passionately on May 6 – at the time when Mr Hancock was urging the public to maintain social distancing to help stem the spread of the new Covid variant.</p>
<p>The scandal only worsened when even more embarrassing moving images from the same CCTV were released by the Sun on Friday night.</p>
<p>By Saturday morning, the clamour for Mr Hancock to go was growing, despite the Prime Minister’s protestations of support.</p>
<h3>Backbenchers round on Health Secretary</h3>
<p>Asked whether Mr Hancock should resign, Mr Baker responded: “Yes”.</p>
<p>As the day went on, he was joined by Esther McVey, the former minister, and Christopher Chope, another backbencher.</p>
<a> “If anything I think it’s worse</a> than the Cummings episode because here you have got the Cabinet minister overseeing the lockdowns himself quite blithely doing what he was telling everyone else they shouldn’t do.”
<p>By now all the parties involved had gone to ground.</p>
<h3>Shockwaves among the families</h3>
<p>Mr Hancock was nowhere to be seen, apparently having retreated to his Suffolk bolthole. Ms Coladangelo was thought to have sought refuge at her wealthy father’s home in Oxfordshire.</p>
<p>As the fallout over those incriminating images continued, flowers were delivered to the house Mr Hancock shares with his wife, Martha. The pink peonies in a glass vase were placed on the front doorstep by a delivery man who arrived just after 10am.</p>
<p><a>Mrs Hancock has remained at the home in London</a> with their children. From here she emerged early on Saturday morning to take her dog for a walk.</p>
<p>Later that day, a friend of Mr Hancock claimed: “Matt and Gina are in love. It started in May but it is serious.”</p>
<p>As the day wore on, a growing number of Conservative MPs who had begun to take the measure of their constituents’ feelings were beginning to report the bad news to senior party figures.</p>
<p>He had to go. And by early Saturday evening it was announced he had.</p>
<header> <h1> Michael Gove's wife Sarah Vine speaks of the 'pressures' on political marriages </h1> <p> Vine said that Hancock's 'behaviour may be shocking, but given the context it is entirely predictable' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent <time> 27 June 2021 • 7:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sarah Vine has spoken about the difficulties of sustaining a political marriage in the wake of revelations about Matt Hancock's affair with his aide.</p>
<p>Michael Gove's wife, a newspaper journalist, wrote in her column for the Mail on Sunday: "Climbing that far up Westminster’s greasy pole changes a person. And when someone changes, they require something new from a partner.</p>
<p>"Namely, someone who is as much a courtesan as a companion, one who understands their brilliance and, crucially, is personally invested in it.</p>
<p>"Not someone who thinks it’s all a monumental nuisance and wishes they would get a proper job that doesn’t involve people poking cameras in your face and commenting on your poor choice of footwear."</p>
<p>Ms Vine, 54 who has been married to Mr Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, for 20 years said that Mr Hancock's "behaviour may be shocking, but given the context it is entirely predictable".</p>
<p>She singled out former Prime Minister David Cameron as being "unique" among all the senior politicians she had ever met in "carving out time for his family".</p>
<p>Ms Vine also praised Samantha Cameron for forcing David to go on "date nights" with her when they lived in Downing Street between 2010 and 2016 and for making sure he never forgot his "obligation" to her and the children.</p>
<p>Ms Vine, referenced both Mr Hancock and former Chancellor George Osborne who left their wives and started relationships with people they had worked with as ministers.</p>

<p>In the end, the market was right, this column was wrong and the stock deserved to be cheap. Sticking to the disciplines demanded by our list, rather than backing hunches, will therefore (once more) be this column’s key new year resolution.</p>
<h2>Our 10-point plan for avoiding portfolio pitfalls</h2>
<p>“Bolt-on” acquisitions designed to supplement existing momentum are fine; big deals that aim to generate momentum from a standing start are usually trouble.</p>
<p>Be wary if management bonuses are easily triggered Paydays or options that linked to earnings per share targets are to be treated with particular caution, as such figures can easily be massaged by the unscrupulous.</p>
<p>Be wary when interest cover is less than two Interest bills must be paid no matter what and if profits barely cover the interest expense there could be trouble ahead should earnings unexpectedly drop.</p>

<header> <h1> Old ships sail on as prices soar on supply chain chaos </h1> <p> Second-hand vessels are in demand amid record freight rates and disruption at ports worldwide </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tom Rees <time> 2 January 2022 • 9:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ship owners are cashing in on global supply chain chaos as old container vessels soar more than 600pc in value and sales in a lucrative second-hand market rocket.</p>
<p>Record freight rates and huge demand for shipping have boosted second hand sales for bulker ships by 50pc and extended the lifespan of vessels by years, according to VesselsValue.</p>
<p>Chaos at ports and supply bottlenecks have disrupted global trade in 2021 but also pushed up shipping rates to all-time highs to help some of the industry’s biggest players post record profits.</p>
<p>Ship owners are taking advantage of the unprecedented demand with the average demolition age of bulkers jumping from 15 to 19 years in just 12 months. </p>
<p>The typical older bulker vessels were sold for twice the price in 2021 compared with 2020, while the cost of buying an old container ship rose seven-fold. The scrapping of bulkers has almost halved amid the surge in demand.</p>
<p>Ynes Benotmane, cargo analyst at VesselsValue, explained that owners are “refraining from sending their older tonnage for demolition, opting instead to seek out opportunities to increase their exposure to the high rates”.</p>
<p>He added: “Age is but a number for bulkers in the current market, with unprecedented demand fueling decade high earnings and lucrative sale and purchase deals.”</p>
<a>spill over into next year</a>, adding to building inflationary pressures. The omicron surge threatens to exacerbate supply problems after ports in Asia were closed to contain outbreaks earlier this year.
<p>However, analysts expect pressures to eventually ease amid signs of cooling shipping costs.</p>
<p>The Baltic Dry Index - which tracks shipping costs for major raw materials - has more than halved since its record peak in October. Container shipping costs also declined in November for the first time since June 2020.</p>
<p>“As labour supply problems throughout logistics supply chains abate and shortages in warehousing space are addressed, seaborne freight looks set to recover in the second half of 2022,” said Kiki Sondh, economist at Oxford Economics.</p>
<header> <h1> Britain’s bins overflow as Covid self-isolation chaos hits return to work </h1> <p> Public transport, supermarkets, rubbish collections and offices all affected as staff absences due to virus soar </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Gareth Davies, Breaking News Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 2:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Britain's attempt to return to work on Tuesday was thwarted by Covid chaos that blighted the railways, with offices remaining ghost towns.</p>
<p>Bin collections <a>were seriously hampered</a>, while the boss of one of Britain's biggest supermarket chains demanded a cut to the isolation period <a>to five days</a>, in line with the US and France, to reduce staff absences.</p>
<a>railway staff</a> were reported absent on the first day back to work after the Christmas and New Year break. One train company said it was reducing its timetable because of a lack of demand as well as the number of Covid cases among employees.
<h2>Disruption on major commuter lines</h2>
<a>did not return to work</a>. Around 10 per cent of rail staff were absent on average across the industry on Tuesday – an estimated 6,000 people including crew and drivers, according to the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators.
<a>cancelled journeys into Victoria</a> for a fortnight, faced significant disruption. Rail operators serving the north of England and the Midlands, including CrossCountry, London North East Railway and Transpennine Express, were similarly impacted.
<p>The Gatwick Express has been cancelled "until further notice", while the concourses at London's Victoria and Waterloo stations in London were almost deserted, even at rush hour.</p>
<h2>Supermarket staff absences ‘double normal levels’ </h2>
<a>hardest hit by the "pingdemic" last year</a>, with up to 30 per cent of the workforce absent after being told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app – meaning many view the current disruption as trivial by comparison.
<a>had risen</a> to five to six per cent of employees currently off.
<p>Food and online deliveries are being prioritised over less high-demand sections in some supermarket branches where absences have been a problem in an effort to ensure shelves are not shorn of essentials.</p>
<p>The Federation of Wholesale Distributors said supply chains were not being disrupted but stressed that the first week after the New Year is traditionally quiet and that next week may pose a bigger test.</p>
<h2>Bin collections disrupted</h2>
<p>Two of Britain's biggest cities announced major <a>disruption to bin collections</a>, with growing evidence of rubbish piling up on streets.</p>
<p>Birmingham and Manchester were among those hit, with Manchester City Council announcing that it would not be collecting food waste or garden bins in order to mitigate the disruption.</p>
<h2>Offices largely deserted</h2>
<p>Many offices remained largely deserted, with the Government's work from home guidance still in force <a>under Covid Plan B measures</a>.</p>
<p>Numbers are hard to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggested most office-based workers stayed at home on Tuesday. It remains a criminal offence <a>to go to a workplace in Wales</a> unless necessary to do so.</p>
<p>Bank customers hoping to pay cash into their accounts in some parts of the country found the doors of their local branches shut. NatWest confirmed that its branch in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, had been "required to close due to staff shortages".</p>

<header> <h1> Secret Whitehall plot blamed for rail chaos </h1> <p> Widespread cancellations attributed to Covid-related staff shortages are part of a strategy, say rail bosses </p> </header>

<p>Commuters are facing chaos on the railways this month because of a secret Whitehall plan to cut more than one in four train services, insiders have revealed.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of travellers were stung by cancellations on Tuesday that have been publicly blamed on Covid-related staff shortages, with services into London and around the country severely reduced.</p>
<p>However, rail bosses privately accused the Government of exacerbating the chaos through their handling of a secret plan, agreed before the Christmas break, to scale back services in response to the omicron surge.</p>
<p>The Telegraph has learnt that an emergency timetable was signed off by Peter Wilkinson, head of passenger services at the Department for Transport (DfT), before Christmas.</p>
<p>In what was supposed to be a coordinated effort, operators agreed to reduce services to approximately 70pc of pre-pandemic levels by Jan 16.</p>
<p>But in subsequent weeks, senior industry sources say that they have since been met with radio silence from Whitehall amid a backlash against omicron curbs on the Tory backbenches.</p>
<p>Rail bosses complain that there had been no coordination by the DfT while the situation has deteriorated. Operators have started to unilaterally cut services and introduce emergency timetables as a result, it is claimed.</p>
<p>An industry source said: “They [the Government] are owning the problem, not the solution. If you do it [cut services] in a haphazard way, it gives the network a bad name.”</p>
<p>Victoria has been hit hardest after Southern rail <a>cancelled all its trains </a>in and out of London’s second-busiest railway station until Jan 10. This disruption alone is estimated to have hit tens of thousands of passengers. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Southern said that the cancellation would not drag on beyond Monday next week.</p>
<p>The Rail Delivery Group, the trade body for operators, said that 6,000 staff, or one in 10 rail workers, are off work.</p>
<p>ScotRail was among those to announce reduced timetables or warn of cancellations.The operator said 160 of its 2,000 daily services would be culled from Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There will be a few twists and turns in this Covid tale until it's over."</p>
<p>Another operator, CrossCountry, said its staff absences are "worsening each day".</p>
