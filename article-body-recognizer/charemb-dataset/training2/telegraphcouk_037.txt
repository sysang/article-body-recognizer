<header> <h1> Vin Murria sparks MC Saatchi bid speculation with 10pc stake </h1> <p> Software entrepreneur was appointed deputy chairman last year after accounting scandal pushed founders out </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:38pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Vin Murria, the software entrepreneur, has raised speculation of a takeover bid for MC Saatchi after her acquisition vehicle bought a 10pc stake in the business.</p>
<p>Her shell investment firm AdvancedAdvT has acquired a 9.8pc holding worth £24m in MC Saatchi, the advertising agency with a history of links to the Conservative Party dating back to Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>Ms Murria, who sold her company Advanced Computer Software to private equity bidders for £725m in 2015 and sits on the boards of Bunzl and Softcat, is already the biggest shareholder in MC Saatchi with a 12.5pc personal stake.</p>
<p>She became deputy chairman of the company last year after the <a>agency's founders were forced to quit</a> in the wake of an accounting scandal. </p>
<p>Lord (Maurice) Saatchi left in 2019 and was followed the next year by David Kershaw, Jeremy Sinclair and Bill Muirhead, known in the ad world as the "three amigos".</p>
<p>London-listed AdvancedAdvT raised £130m last year, saying it was seeking “mid-cap acquisition opportunities in the software sector”.</p>
<p>Ms Murria has a 13pc stake in AdvancedAdvT. Another 15.4pc is controlled by investment company Marwyn, a serial acquirer of public companies which previously owned Peppa Pig owner Entertainment One and BCA Marketplace, the owner of WeBuyAnyCar.com.</p>
<p>MC Saatchi is AdvancedAdvT’s first investment. It said only that it viewed the agency as “a good investment opportunity”.</p>
<p>MC Saatchi said: “It is not our policy to comment on any speculation or questions relating to MA.”</p>
<p>Shares rose 12.8pc on Wednesday to 189p, but remained below the 200p paid by AdvancedAdvT.</p>
<p>The company's share price has doubled in the past year due to improved trading after lockdowns hit the advertising industry and as the company has recovered from an accounting scandal related to overstating profits.</p>

<header> <div> <div> <h1> Oil hits $80 after Opec agrees to boost production </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>Shares in airlines took off yesterday amid growing evidence that the omicron variant is not as deadly as had been feared, raising hopes of a return to normality. British Airways owner IAG topped the FTSE 100, surging over 11pc.</p>
<p>Among the mid-caps, Wizz Air added 12.2pc while TUI and easyJet closed 10.4pc and 9.2pc higher respectively.</p>
<p>Online grocer Ocado, which benefited from the switch to e-commerce during various lockdowns, fell 7.3pc.</p>
<p>Max Kettner, a strategist at HSBC, said: “There are tentative signs that this variant may not be as bad as feared.”</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 gained 1.6pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 closed nearly 1.8pc higher.</p>
<p>The upbeat sentiment was seen elsewhere in Europe too. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index ended 0.8pc higher at 494.02 points, hitting a record high for a second consecutive session. </p>
<p>Widespread optimism and an improved outlook on global oil demand boosted crude prices despite Opec+ members raising output.</p>
<p>The benchmark Brent crude ticked above $80 a barrel after the producing countries approved a 400,000 barrel-a-day increase in production scheduled for February, as expected.</p>
<p>Energy giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell jumped 5.9pc and 4.7pc respectively.</p>
<p>That's all from us on the first day back from the holidays, thank you for reading! Here are some of the most recent business stories:</p>
<li>Mercedes reveals electric car with 600-mile range</li>
<h3>Clifford Chance partner paid record £3.2m following deals boom </h3>
<p>The top earning partner at magic circle law firm Clifford Chance took home £3.2m last year amid a boom in City dealmaking. Simon Foy has more:</p>
<p>According to accounts filed on Companies House, the profit share of the firm’s highest earning lawyer jumped by a fifth compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Clifford Chance refused to confirm who netted the highest sum. In July, it announced that average pay for full equity partners rose 9pc to £1.85m each over the past year.</p>
<p>It came as demand for professional advisers reached unprecedented levels last year amid a record 12 months for mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Clifford Chance's revenues from corporate clients jumped by a tenth to £603m during the year to April, up from £544m in 2020.</p>
<h3>Verizon and ATT postpone 5G networks upgrade over aircraft equipment concerns</h3>
<p>America's biggest telecoms companies have delayed an upgrade to the country's 5G network amid fears that it could interfere with planes. My colleague Ben Woods reports:</p>
<p>Verizon and ATT will postpone Wednesday's switch-on by a fortnight on account of concerns over the impact of the "C-Band wireless spectrum" on aircraft equipment.</p>
<p>It marks an about-turn for the firms after they vowed in a joint letter on Sunday to press ahead with the roll-out regardless of the Federal Aviation Administration's warnings.</p>
<p>Verizon agreed to postpone the upgrade because it "promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January", a spokesman said.</p>
<p>ATT also agreed to delay, but said it would remain "committed to the six-month protection migations" it had previously outlined.</p>
<h3>Outsourcing giant Capita makes progress with disposals strategy </h3>
<p>Outsourcing giant Capita has completed another sell-off in the company's bid to raise £700m from disposals in 2021 and the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>The business has completed the £62m deal to sell its Secure Solutions and Services (SSS) business to NEC Software Solutions UK.</p>
<p>SSS provides software to the emergency services and justice sectors.</p>
<p>Capita has made strong progress towards its disposal target, and agreed deals worth at least £643m last year alone. Shares in the company rose by 4.5pc today.</p>
<h3>FTSE 100 ends first 2022 trading session positively</h3>
<p>FTSE 100 rose in the first trading session of 2022, after its best annual gain in five years, following signs the Omicron coronavirus variant is less likely to derail the global economic recovery.</p>
<p>The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 1.6pc, closing at its highest since February 2020, while the domestically focussed mid-cap index advanced 1.8pc in a catch-up rally after a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>British Airways owner IAG topped the FTSE 100, surging over 11pc, while mid-caps Wizz Air, TUI and easyJet all closed around a tenth higher. Online grocer Ocado, which benefited from the switch to e-commerce during various lockdowns, fell 7.3pc.</p>
<h3>Tecent offloads $3bn of shares in Singapore's Sea </h3>
<p>Chinese internet giant Tencent has sold $3bn (£2.2bn) of shares in Singaporean online gaming company Sea as it seeks funds for new initiatives and philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>Less than a month ago, Tencent announced a plan to hand out more than $16bn of JD.com stock as a one-time dividend in an effort to divest most of its stake in China’s No. 2 online retailer.</p>
<p>The surprise move was seen as being in response to Beijing’s push to curb anticompetitive behaviour and open up closed ecosystems. </p>
<p>It now owns 18.7pc of Sea.</p>
<div> <h3>Handing over</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>That's all from me, thanks for following during a busy start to 2022! My colleague Giulia Bottaro will take things from here.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Southampton FC snapped up by Serbian media mogul in £100m deal</h3>
<p>Southampton FC has confirmed it's been taken over by a company backed by Serbian billionaire Dragan Solak in a deal worth a reported £100m.</p>
<p>The Premier League club said Sport Republic had acquired an 80pc controlling stake from Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng.</p>
<p>Mr Gao took over Southampton in August 2017 with Katharina Liebherr, who inherited the club from her late father Markus in 2010 when the Saints were in League One, holding 20pc. The club said Ms Liebherr would retain her minority shareholding.</p>
<p>Mr Solak, who founded cable TV operator United Group, is the lead investor behind Sport Republic. It also has backing from Rasmus Ankersen, the former Brentford co-director of football, and Henrik Kraft, a London-based investor.</p>
<p>Martin Semmens, chief executive of Southampton FC, said:</p>
<p>Over the last two years, together with the shareholders of our club, we have searched for the right partner to take the club forward. Today we have found the perfect solution for our club.</p>
<p>Sport Republic are experienced investors, but also experienced within the world of elite professional sports. That combination is very hard to find, and we are thrilled to have reached an agreement that secures our short and long-term future.</p>
<h3>Mercedes reveals electric car with 600-mile range</h3>
<p>Mercedes-Benz says it has designed an electric car capable of travelling more than 600 miles on a single charge, about three times the average range of most rechargeable vehicles. </p>
<p>Rachel Millard has more:</p>
<p>The German carmaker said its Vision EQXX prototype consumes less than 10 kilowatt hours of power per 100km due to sleeker design, greater efficiency and higher density batteries. </p>
<p>Unveiling the prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, Mercedes said its prototype “demonstrates just how efficient, sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be”.</p>
<p>Read Rachel's full story</p>
<h3>US manufacturing index falls while price pressures ease</h3>
<p>Staying with the US, a key gauge of US manufacturing fell short of expectations at the end of 2021, reflecting declines in delivery times and prices that overshadowed otherwise solid demand.</p>
<p>The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of December factory activity fell to 58.7, down from 61.1 in the prior month and the lowest level in a year.</p>
<p>Improved delivery times and lower input prices typically indicate softer demand. However, the latest declines suggest capacity constraints are beginning to loosen.</p>
<p>That’s welcome progress for manufacturers who have struggled to keep up with demand because of materials shortages, hiring challenges and transportation bottlenecks.</p>
<h3>Record 4.5m Americans quit their job in November</h3>
<p>A record 4.5m Americans quit their job in November while openings remained high, showing high levels of churn in the US labour market.</p>
<p>The number of available positions fell to 10.6m from 11.1m in October, according to the latest Labor Department figures. Meanwhile, the quits rate increased to 3pc – matching a record high.</p>
<p>While the fall in vacancies was the largest since April 2020, they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The data come ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that the US added 420,000 payrolls in December.</p>
<h3>Expert reaction: Opec decision was 'widely expected'</h3>
<p>Caroline Bain at Capital Economics, says Opec's decision was "widely expected".</p>
<h3>Iceland mulls store closures as staff shortages bite</h3>
<p>Iceland is reportedly considering closing some stores as it battles widespread staff shortages due to self-isolation.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain is experiencing staff absence rates of around 11pc, which equates to roughly 3,300 workers, the BBC reports.</p>
<p>It says the situation has been exacerbated by Covid, though non-Covid absences have also risen.</p>
<p>Iceland is now considering some store closures – something it did at the height of the so-called pingdemic last year. Stores across the UK would likely be affected, but Wales is said to be particularly badly hit.</p>
<p>The retailer said it's kept on temporary Christmas staff to help mitigate shortages and has increased delivery capacity as there is no significant impact on drivers. It is also prioritising orders for vulnerable or self-isolating people.</p>
<h3>Armani cancels Milan and Paris fashion shows</h3>
<p>Georgio Armani is cancelling its fashion shows in Milan and Paris this month due to a surge in Covid cases across Europe.</p>
<p>The Italian luxury fashion house said it had made the decision “with great regret and following careful reflection in light of the worsening epidemiological situation”.</p>
<h3>Wall Street rises amid global rally</h3>
<div> <p>Wall Street has pushed higher at the open, extending gains from Monday's record highs amid a new year rally in global stocks.</p> <p>The SP 500 rose 0.3pc, while the Dow Jones was up 0.5pc. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.1pc.</p> </div>
<h3>Apple set to break through $3 trillion mark... again</h3>
<p>Apple looks set to top $3 trillion in market value when markets open this afternoon after the world's most valuable company briefly broke through the record-breaking milestone yesterday.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker's shares rose 0.5pc to $182.87 in premarket trading. Shares breached $182.86 in intraday trading on Monday to hit the milestone, but ended the session lower.</p>
<p>Apple accounts for nearly 7pc of SP 500 index's value, according to Refinitiv data, the highest for a single stock on the index at a time when the benchmark is perched at a peak.</p>
<h3>Tougher takeover rules come into force</h3>
<p>New rules making it harder for foreign firms to buy British assets came into force today amid growing national security concerns surrounding buyouts by Chinese and US suitors.</p>
<p>The legislation will give ministers closer scrutiny of foreign approaches, allowing them to impose conditions on proposed deals or even block them completely.</p>
<p>Overseas investors and firms must now notify the government if they plan to buy any part of a UK business in sensitive sectors that could imperil national security – such as defence, energy and transport.</p>
<p>The new National Security and Investment Act will be enforced retrospectively to any deals made since 12 November 2020.</p>
<p>The move comes after US buyers swooped on chip designer arm, aerospace group Meggitt and defence firm Ultra Electronics. There's also scrutiny over increased Chinese investment in projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power station.</p>
<h3>Surge in borrowing increases expectations of an interest rate rise</h3>
<p>Households racked up the biggest rise in borrowing for more than a year and dug into pandemic savings, reinforcing expectations of a second Bank of England rate rise next month.</p>
<p>My colleague Russell Lynch has more:</p>
<p>The Bank's latest figures for November showed households borrowed £1.2bn on credit cards and loans over the month, the highest since July 2020 when the economy reopened after the first Covid lockdown.</p>
<p>Households faced with rising prices and the looming Christmas season also saved much less over the month, with £4.5bn in deposits being the lowest since January 2020 and less than half the average of the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>The figures reflect a stronger month for retail sales - up 1.4pc during November - as shoppers began festive preparations early amid fears of empty shelves and supply shortages.</p>
<p>The relative resilience of consumers comes as surging energy bills are poised to push the Consumer Prices Index to a 30-year high of 6pc by April, fuelling concerns among the Bank’s rate-setters about inflation.</p>
<h3>FTSE 100 extends gains</h3>
<p>Time for a lunchtime update on the FTSE 100, which has extended its gains and is now trading up 1.4pc.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index has joined the new year rally for global stocks, with traders welcoming signs that the omicron variant is milder than originally feared.</p>
<p>British Airways owner IAG is still at the top of the index, surging 12pc as travel stocks lead gains. Exhibition group Informa has also jumped 6pc.</p>
<p>The mid-cap FTSE 250 is performing even better with gains of 1.9pc. Again it's travel stocks that are doing the best, with budget airlines <b>Wizz Air </b>and easyJet up 12.5pc and 11pc respectively.</p>
<h3>What to expect in the business world in 2022</h3>
<p>After a tumultuous couple of years, it's a risky business to try and predict the future, but we've given it a shot nonetheless.</p>
<p>From inflation to AI, here's a rundown of what companies will be grappling with as the world cautiously emerges from the pandemic in 2022.</p>
<p>Read the full story: Six themes set to dominate business this year</p>
<h3>Covid-19 is third largest catastrophe cost to insurers, says Howden</h3>
<p>With losses hitting $44bn (£33bn) so far, Covid-19 represents the third largest cost to insurers of any catastrophe, behind only Hurricane Katrina and 9/11.</p>
<p>That's according to London insurance broker Howden, which has highlighted the extent of the financial chaos wreaked by the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it said initial projections of $100bn of Covid-related losses, which were made in the early days of the crisis, now looked "improbable", with insurers excluding Covid-19 from many policies.</p>
<p>Howden also revealed that property catastrophe reinsurance rates rose 9pc year-on-year on 1 January, marking their biggest annual rise since 2009.</p>
<h3>Wall Street set to extend gains in strong start to 2022</h3>
<p>US stocks are set to push higher this afternoon, building on their strong start to 2022.</p>
<p>Global markets are on the rise amid rising hopes that the omicron variant is less deadly than initially feared, with travel stocks the biggest winners.</p>
<b>American Airlines </b>was up 0.9pc. Major tech stocks including Apple,
<b>Facebook</b>, Tesla, Netflix and Amazon all pushed higher after strong gains on Monday.
<p>Futures tracking Wall Street's three major indices are all up 0.4pc.</p>
<h3>Opec set for another modest output hike</h3>
<p>Opec and its allies are expected to maintain their practice of modestly boosting oil output as the spread of the omicron variant is yet to spark a significant dent in demand.</p>
<p>The production cartel has so far resisted pressure to open the taps more widely as high energy prices fuel inflation across the globe.</p>
<p>Opec+ drastically slashed output in 2020 as the pandemic wreaked havoc with demand. Last year the group began to step up production with modest increases reviewed each month.</p>
<p>Analysts expect output to increase by 400,000 barrels per day in February – as they have done in recent months.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate rose 0.7pc this morning, while Brent crude gained 0.8pc to just under $80 a barrel.</p>
<h3>Ministers mull plan to shield companies from carbon costs</h3>
<p>The Government could step in to cut the amount airlines, the power sector and heavy industry pay on their carbon emissions amid a protracted rise in prices.</p>
<p>Companies that are covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) must buy one so-called allowance for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This adds extra cost to dirty fuels such as coal, and makes cleaner fuels, including natural gas, or fully green technologies more economical.</p>
<p>But officials said prices have been high enough for the last four months that they will have to decide whether to step in and make changes by January 18.</p>
<p>It's the second time in two months that officials have triggered the so-called cost containment mechanism, which happens when the carbon price is consistently above expectations.</p>
<h3>Savile Row tailor Gieves Hawkes put into liquidation</h3>
<p>It could be the end of an era for 25-year-old Savile Row tailor Gieves Hawkes, which has been put into liquidation after initial attempts to find a buyer for the brand failed.</p>
<p>The Times reports that the tailor's Chinese owner FTI Consulting and RH Services as joint liquidators after attempts to secure a rescue deal fell flat.</p>
<p>Gieves Hawkes was founded in 1771 and its suits have been worn by royals, Winston Churchill and Lord Nelson. It has around 60 stores in the UK, including its flagship site at 1 Savile Row.</p>
<p>In 2012 it was acquired by Trinity Limited, which is controlled by debt-riddled Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi Technology Group.</p>
<h3>Wildwood owner Tasty eyes restaurant sales as omicron hits trading</h3>
<p>The company behind the Wildwood and Dim T restaurant chains is weighing the sale of several sites after reporting "considerably weaker" trading in December.</p>
<p>London-listed Tasty said the rapid spread of the omicron variant and tougher restrictions had left sales for the month – which is normally its strongest period – "disappointing".</p>
<p>It said new work from home guidance had dented customer numbers, with a particular hit on large Christmas bookings.</p>
<p>Tasty has shut four restaurants out of its total estate of 54 due to predicted weaker sales and labour shortages. These are expected to reopen later this year, though Tasty said it will consider to consider the sale of two or three of these sites.</p>
<h3>Airlines lead FTSE surge on upbeat omicron data</h3>
<p>Airlines are still the biggest winners this morning as travel stocks lead the strong start to 2022.</p>
