<p>Form batsman Travis Head paid tribute to captain Pat Cummins for handing him a licence to thrill in his coming-of-age summer, as Australia eye world domination with the same bold approach which annihilated England.</p>
<p>He joins modern greats Ricky Ponting, Steve Smith and Mitchell Johnson to have claimed the gong in successful home Ashes.</p>
<p>Head revealed No.3 Marnus Labuschagne was the catalyst for Australia’s dashing strokeplay on the first day. Cummins wants his team to play with the same freedom overseas.</p>
<p>“I thought the way Marnus, Trav Head, Cam Green took on the game was a really good template for any conditions that are really foreign,” Cummins said.</p>
<p>“We can be the type of team that are brave enough to take that positivity overseas if we need to. I think that puts us in a great place.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about the upcoming Pakistan tour. We have played really well here in Australia, now it’s up to us to take that overseas.”</p>
<div>‘I felt a sigh of relief’: The significance of Cummins’ classy Khawaja gesture</div>
<p>Khawaja, a proud Muslim man, jumped away from teammates as the alcohol began flowing due to his strict religious beliefs, before being ushered back in with open arms.</p>
<p>“I noticed Marnus [Labuschagne] straight away more than Pat,” Hussain said. “Waking up today and to see everyone talking about how Pat is a great leader … he did it, but they all did it.</p>
<p>Three Australian players - David Warner, Marcus Harris and Mitchell Starc - brought champagne bottles onto the stage with them after the formalities had concluded.</p>
<p>When Khawaja noticed he would be exposed to alcohol, he jumped down and let his teammates be.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old was absent from the first photos taken with the trophy as Warner poured a bottle of Moët over Scott Boland’s head and cheers reverberated around Blundstone Arena.</p>
<p>Khawaja was simply happy to let his teammates celebrate how they wanted.</p>
<p>While much has been made of Cummins ushering teammates to put down the booze and welcome Khawaja back for a team photo, footage shows Labuschagne, Travis Head and even Warner also gesturing to the left-hander to join the celebrations.</p>
<p>The impact was not lost on Hussain.</p>
<p>Cummins elaborated on the gesture on Monday, which was widely shared and lauded on social media.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a really diverse bunch of people and you want to celebrate that and you want to make sure everyone feels comfortable being themselves. That was just one moment,” Cummins told reporters in Hobart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khawaja’s comeback to international cricket will have far-reaching effects on the Muslim community, according to Hussain, who likened his return to an Australian in the NBA.</p>
<p>“Usman being there makes it possible in the minds of a whole bunch of first- and second-generation migrant kids. For them, they can make it. I hope there are more like him.</p>
<p>“It makes you walk a bit taller when you see one of your own people on the team.”</p>
<div>Key players unmoved on Langer despite Ashes, World Cup success</div>
<p>Justin Langer’s coaching fate is expected to be decided before Australia’s mooted Test tour of Pakistan, with key players unmoved on their stance on the coach despite the national men’s team’s recent success.</p>
<p>Cricket Australia high-performance boss Ben Oliver will make a recommendation to the board in the next few weeks over the structure of the head coach role after assessing the team’s upcoming calendar.</p>
<p>It came as Ricky Ponting became the latest and most powerful voice among Langer’s former teammates to throw his support behind the coach.</p>
<p>Oliver’s process will determine if the coaching role needs to be split, which is being seen in some quarters as Langer’s best hope of holding on in some capacity.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, a coach who has won the country’s first men’s Twenty20 World Cup and retained the urn in such convincing fashion would be walking into head office to name his price, but this is not the case with Langer.</p>
<p>Oliver is seen as a confidant of Langer, but players were surprised how sympathetic the NSW-based Hockley was to their views.</p>
<p>At the behest of his charges, Langer delegated more responsibility to senior assistant Andrew McDonald and his support staff.</p>
<p>The highly-rated Michael di Venuto and Jeff Vaughan were added to his support staff in a process one source with knowledge of the matter said was targeting candidates with head coaching experience at domestic level.</p>
<p>Players have spoken glowingly in recent months of the environment within the team now that Langer has taken what Josh Hazlewood described after the T20 world title as a “back seat” role.</p>
<p>There has been minimal interaction from players towards Langer at training as McDonald, di Venuto and Vaughan took a hands-on approach.</p>
<p>Players welcomed Langer onto the dais during the presentation ceremony on Sunday night. Coupled with captain Pat Cummins’ praise for the coach the previous evening, it fed a narrative that tensions had thawed.</p>
<p>Winning, though, masks all manner of problems while there are suggestions from sources with knowledge of the matter that players have adopted a more positive outlook knowing the end is in sight.</p>
<p>Cummins refused to back in the coach for another term when asked on Monday about Langer’s future, the second time he has failed to offer an endorsement in the past three weeks. Hockley too was non-committal during the Boxing Day Test.</p>
<p>After almost a decade where the coach called the shots, there can be no doubt Cummins as captain is now the most influential figure in a dressing room which values calmness over Langer’s intensity.</p>
<p>Whether there has been an orchestrated push among past greats, Ponting joins Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Jason Gillespie and Michael Hussey as greats who have backed Langer.</p>
<p>“Going back to Justin Langer, I can’t see how he cannot be re-signed, simple as that,” Ponting said on Channel 7.</p>
<p>“If he wants to go on in this role, there’s a bit speculation about whether they’ll split the roles and be a Test match coach and a white ball coach.</p>
<p>“On performance, there is absolutely no way that Justin Langer cannot continue on as head coach of this Australian cricket team.”</p>

<div>‘A royal commission into hurt feelings’: The country racing volunteer taking on Racing NSW</div>
<div><div><h5>By Andrew Webster</h5><div>Updated <span><time>December 3, 2021 — 6.52am</time></span><span>first published at <time>5.00am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>For the past 30 years, Colleen Walker has pinballed around Mudgee Race Club as a hands-on volunteer and committee member – and especially on this day when thousands converge on the course for the Mudgee Cup.</p>
<p>On Friday, however, the 64-year-old grandmother will watch from her property overlooking the course after being indefinitely stood down amid allegations she bullied a Racing NSW staff member at a race meeting earlier this year.</p>
<p>“It breaks my heart to not be there,” Walker said. “I just cry. This has broken me. It’s not that anyone can’t be replaced, but you don’t work your guts out and have it taken from you like this.”</p>
<p>Walker and her husband, Max, estimate they’ve already spent $179,000 in legal costs fighting to clear her name through the Supreme Court. Then there’s the toll it’s taken on her health.</p>
<p>“She’s had to go to the doctors several times,” Max said. “It’s ruined her. She can’t talk about it without breaking down because it’s so personal.”</p>
<p>Racing NSW stewards launched an investigation into Walker’s behaviour following a Country Championships meeting on February 28, the day after the Charity Shield match between South Sydney and St George Illawarra.</p>
<p>Camilleri is the daughter of prominent horse breeder and Steggles supremo John Camilleri.</p>
<p>“A royal commission into hurt feelings” is how one Mudgee Race Club director has described the probe, although Racing NSW chief executive Peter V’landys says the complaints are far more serious.</p>
<p>“We have zero tolerance for bullying,” V’landys said when contacted on Thursday.</p>
<p>More than 200 people were interviewed before a two-day inquiry, the transcripts of which have been obtained by the Herald.</p>
<p>Camilleri told the hearing Walker had “snuck” people into the function. She also claims Walker had said, in the presence of 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley, that Camilleri was “making my hair go grey”.</p>
<p>Asked if Walker had sworn or called her names, Camilleri said no.</p>
<p>Some people invariably call the Walkers the “heart and soul” of the club. Others, though, claim the couple treat it as “their personal fiefdom”.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘People have been stopping me in the street asking me why they were being interviewed by Racing NSW.’</p><cite>Colleen Walker</cite></blockquote>
<p>The disparity of opinions about Colleen Walker can be found in the evidence provided to the hearing, especially those on the Mudgee Race Club committee.</p>
<p>One director, James Buchanan, said: “It’s her nature to take all that on and I think Mrs Walker and her husband are very passionate and have a lot of their lifetime supporting the club.”</p>
<p>For her part, Walker claims she is the victim of a witch hunt as Racing NSW investigators gathered information.</p>
<p>Complicating the matter is that the racetrack’s 1600-metre chute, from which the Mudgee Cup will start on Friday, extends onto the Walkers’ property.</p>
<p>The Central West town has been buzzing with speculation a fence will be extended across the chute before the main race, or a marquee set-up near the barriers.</p>
<p>“I built that chute on our land,” Max said. “It’s a magnificent chute. I’ve built that myself: my own equipment, my own time. We’ve built that club. I’ve put $1 million of stuff into it.”</p>
<p>Walker also holds grave concern about the process that has led to her being stood down.</p>
<p>She received a notice from V’landys on March 18, stating the club was suspended until the investigation and inquiry into her conduct took place.</p>
<p>She stood down four days later for the good of the club but since then has been in dispute with Racing NSW about its processes.</p>
<p>Following the inquiry, she was asked to show cause notice to show she is a fit and proper person who should remain director of a race club.</p>
<p>On legal advice, she took the matter to the Supreme Court, claiming the governing body did not have the jurisdiction to sanction volunteers, nor suspend the club as it did.</p>
<p>The court found in Racing NSW’s favour in August on both counts. Walker says she is considering an appeal but is weighing up the financial cost.</p>
<p>Walker fears she will not get a fair hearing because the appeal’s panel is likely to have Racing NSW employees on it.</p>
<p>“Am I suspended?” she said. “What would you call it?”</p>

<div>Langer posts intriguing LinkedIn message as Agar comes to coach’s defence</div>
<p>Ashton Agar has thrown his support behind Justin Langer after the coach posted a puzzling message on social media about staying true to himself at a time when players have told him to change his ways.</p>
<p>The post on LinkedIn has left players and sources close to the team perplexed, with some construing it as a jab at players who have grown weary of his abrasive and intense management style.</p>
<p>Langer quoted, though not entirely verbatim, a piece by Lebanese-Canadian activist, feminist and poet Najwa Zebian titled “A Taste of Your Own Medicine” stressing the importance of being who you are and not changing to appease others.</p>
<p>“A wise man once said: Don’t give them a taste of your own medicine. If they lied, let their medicine be honesty,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“So be patient. Stay true to yourself. And remember this: it is better for people to value you for who you are, not who you pretend to be. Who you are lasts a lifetime. Who you pretend to be changes like the change of seasons.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to be yourself, even if it means removing yourself from lives you want to be in. You are, no doubt, worthy of being valued for who you are. So be who you are.</p>
<p>“The wise man says: BE YOURSELF. YOU ARE UNIQUE and YOU ARE SPECIAL. Be happy, be healthy, be calm, be strong and BE YOURSELF.”</p>
<p>While many not familiar with Langer’s methods will find his latest post bizarre, he often shares quotes and proverbs he comes across as a source of motivation for his team on WhatsApp and other forums, though the practice has grated some.</p>
<p>Agar, who has credited Langer with helping him through mental health struggles, sympathised with the coach over the criticism he had received publicly.</p>
<p>“He’s got strong values and morals as a person and he sticks to them unwaveringly,” Agar said. “Knowing him over 10 years now a lot has changed, and I respect him a lot for that.</p>
<p>“And I think everyone respects that he has listened, and he’s doing whatever he can to suit the needs of the team, so you can’t help but respect that, and we’ll back him in 100 per cent in this tournament and going forward.</p>
<p>“I just think we have to have a bit of understanding around how horrible that experience would have been and respect someone coming out of that and still doing their best.”</p>

<div>Glut of stars in line to replace Latrell highlights Indigenous fullback depth</div>
<p>The depth of Indigenous fullbacks in the game has never been greater.</p>
<p>That is the inescapable conclusion when considering the candidates to replace Latrell Mitchell in the Indigenous All Stars’ No.1 jersey.</p>
<p>Mitchell will miss the February clash against the Maori All Stars as part of his lengthy ban for his shot on good friend and Sydney Roosters rival Joey Manu.</p>
<p>Sloan burst on to the scene for the Red V last season and said he would love nothing more than to feature in the game he has always highlighted on his calendar.</p>
<p>The youngster has piled on more than 12 kilograms in the past year to help him cope with the physicality of the NRL, and wanted it known he was keen to be in the Indigenous conversation.</p>
<p>“We have Indigenous Round and we have the All Stars game, but we could do even more to celebrate the Indigenous culture, be it more camps or more education.</p>
<p>“My nan [Colleen] raised me since I was two months old, and she taught me a lot about my Indigenous heritage. That is a goal, for sure.”</p>
<p>While the race for the Indigenous No. 1 jersey is wide open, Sloan knows he has a decent battle on his hands for the Dragons fullback spot with his good friend Ramsey pushing hard for the honour.</p>
<p>Coach Anthony Griffin has stressed the need for the pair to try and be “the best defensive fullbacks in the game”, and Sloan said it was one area he under-estimated when given the first of five NRL games late in the season.</p>
<p>The Dragons have plenty of older players on the payroll, but there are just as many juniors rising through the ranks like Sloan.</p>
<p>One player who has benefitted from the full pre-season without any off-field distractions is Jack de Belin, says Sloan, with the lock forward quickly establishing himself as a comeback candidate for Origin.</p>

<div>‘I had tears in my eyes’: Davey injured in bittersweet win for Magpies</div>
<div><div><h5>By Sarah Burt</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 9, 2022 — 7.13pm</time></span><span>first published <time>January 7, 2022 — 9.31pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>A hush fell over Ikon Park when Collingwood co-captain Brianna Davey fell to the ground with a suspected right knee injury late during the Magpies’ 19-point win over Carlton on Sunday.</p>
<p>Davey received a warm applause as she entered the race and the siren went.</p>
<p>“It’s never nice to see anyone go down, we saw that with Izzy last night,” Collingwood co-captain Steph Chiocci said post-game. “I had tears in my eyes. We just hope Bri is OK… that’s footy.</p>
<p>“Obviously she’s the biggest player in the league, so it’s going to be of significant impact, but we pride ourselves on the depth of our group.”</p>
<p>The Blues were looking to rectify their poor start to last year’s season, while Collingwood started their road to healing their heartbreak from a premature finals exit.</p>
<p>Five players pulled on the navy blue for the first time, while Collingwood debuted two new draftees in former Blue Alison Downie and former Tiger Sabrina Frederick.</p>
<p>Young Blue Lucy McEvoy got the opener in just their second inside 50, the Pies were managing repeat entries, but inaccuracy left them with four behinds into the first break.</p>
<p>Schleicher slotted one off the back of a 50-metre penalty and Downie followed suit, booting one after the half-time siren and declaring her new Collingwood allegiance.</p>
<p>Abbie McKay also found her first AFLW goal, thanks to Darcy Vescio, as fatigue and the heat visibly kicked in for both sides.</p>
<p>A spectacular set shot from tight in the pocket from Jordyn Allen, and one that bounced through from Sophie Alexander left the Magpies 21 points up with nine minutes to go.</p>
<p>Blues’ day of milestones</p>
<p>Vescio and Nicola Stevens played their 40th consecutive senior games, tallying 10 and five disposals respectively.</p>

<h3>Huntington injury adds to Bulldogs’ pain in loss to Demons</h3>
<p>Huntington, the current No. 1 contested marker, was injured in the club’s 24-point loss to Melbourne on Saturday night.</p>
<p>It is another bitter blow for Huntington, who has overcome a broken leg and anterior cruciate ligament injuries in her left and right knees to become one of the AFLW’s top players.</p>
<p>The former top draft pick and All-Australian defender ruptured her right ACL in 2018, ending her debut season, the same one in question on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Since recovering from those earlier injuries, she had cemented her place in the AFLW’s top tier, winning both the Bulldogs’ best and fairest medal and NAB AFLW Rising Star award in 2020.</p>
<p>She went down after twisting in a contest, and was on crutches at game’s end.</p>
<p>Casey Sherriff and Maddison Gay got the Demons off to a flying start, with Eden Zanker continuing their clean play, as the Dogs notched just one behind by the first break.</p>
<p> Huntington booted a goal before suffering the knee injury late in the first term.</p>
<p>A shaken Bulldogs side then struggled to focus, failing to add to Huntington’s goal in the second, as the Demons edged further ahead thanks to a major from Kate Hore as they dominated their inside 50.</p>
<p>Skipper Ellie Blackburn was strongest for the Bulldogs heading into the main break, with 12 disposals, while former Bulldog Libby Birch led the Demons with seven kicks, three handballs and two marks as they took a 23-point lead.</p>
<p>It was a seemingly different Bulldogs side in the second half, with Bonnie Toogood gettting the side back on the board, closely followed by a captain’s goal from Blackburn.</p>
<p> Harris announced her arrival at the Demons as the decorated former Blue slotted a goal heading into the final break, the Demons still leading the inside-50s.</p>
<p>In a congested final quarter, Hore sealed the deal for Melbourne in the dying moments.</p>
<p>HARRIS HAILS FROM IKON PARKTayla Harris pulled on the red and blue for the first time, with the key forward part of a three-way deal with GWS and Carlton. Harris arrives with 37 games and 29 goals to her name.</p>
<h3>Kangaroos fight back to down Geelong in opener</h3>
<p> North Melbourne came from behind to edge out the Cats by eight points in a rematch of last year’s season-opener on Saturday.</p>
<p>It was a far cry from the 62-point loss the Cats suffered last time the sides met but even with a new-look cohort and an eight-point lead in the third term, they were unable to hold off the Kangaroos.</p>
<p>In the off-season the Cats worked hard to address this, with a new head coach in Dan Lowther and nine new players, including Adelaide premiership player Chloe Scheer, experienced former Demon Chantel Emonson and Irish Gaelic star Rachel Kearns.</p>
<p>The Cats also had the long-awaited return of explosive midfielder Nina Morrison on their side, returning from her second ACL injury in as many years.</p>
<p>North Melbourne were without skipper and five-time All-Australian Emma Kearney as she recovers from COVID-19 but debuted four recruits in Amy Smith and former Bulldog Kim Rennie, as well as draftees Tess Craven and Jasmine Ferguson.</p>
<p>It was a goalless first term before Jenna Bruton earned the Kangaroos a free kick and converted in the final minute, remaining the only goal-scorer for the first half.</p>
<p>In a high-pressure defensive contest, the Kangaroos had 55 contested possessions to Geelong’s 48, with each side managing repeat entries into the forward 50 but unable to convert.</p>
<p>All-Australian Kangaroo Ash Riddell dominated with 18 disposals. She had 35 by the final siren, and was assisted by Kaitlyn Ashmore as they tried to fill the void left by their skipper.</p>
<p>Heading into the second half, Geelong’s Amy McDonald had 12 disposals and 11 handballs, but it was Morrison and Georgie Prespakis who managed to live up to the hype surrounding them in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Cats came out with a quick goal in the third through experienced forward Phoebe McWilliams. It was salt in the wound for the Kangaroos as Ashmore hobbled to the sidelines visibly in pain.</p>
<p>Cat Julia Crockett-Grills added another soon after, as Geelong dominated time in the forward half, however premiership player Scheer was sidelined for a concussion test.</p>
<p>Daisy Bateman then out-ran a tiring Geelong defence to leave the Kangaroos within two points at the final break, with things also looking up as Ashmore returned to play.</p>
<p>North’s Jasmine Garner and Emma King helped Mia King to a major in the fourth, closely followed by one off the boot of Ashmore.</p>
<p>Geelong skipper Meg McDonald was on the sidelines in a world of pain as the final siren went, while debutant Kangaroo Rennie also exited with a head knock.</p>
<h3>Dominant Tigers kick season off in style with win over St Kilda</h3>
<p> Richmond have booted 10 goals to overpower St Kilda in the first AFLW game of the season at Skybus Stadium, Frankston.</p>
<p>After failing to win a game in their maiden season of 2020, Ryan Ferguson’s new-look Tigers, with just 16 of the 30 inaugural players, powered to a 38-point win on Friday night.</p>
<p>Former Saints star Nick Dal Santo made his coaching debut after replacing Peta Searle last August, but was left without last year’s two strongest players in Georgia Patrikios and Tyanna Smith.</p>
<p>Both sides booted two goals in the first term, a promising start given that the last time the teams met Richmond were kept to just three points in St Kilda’s 39-point victory.</p>
<p>The Tigers led by nine points at half-time, with All-Australian Monique Conti notching 13 disposals and two inside 50s, while counterpart Tilly Lucas-Rodd clocked 12 disposals for the Saints.</p>
<p>Dal Santo urged his side to “be brave” at the final break, notably moving former Tiger Alana Woodward to tag Conti.</p>
<p>Bernardi scored her second, so too did Megan Kiely as the Saints became visibly frustrated with a margin of 38 and Lucas-Rodd limped to the sidelines, joining Richmond’s Poppy Kelly with a taped right knee.</p>
<p>Having not scored a goal since the first term, the Saints slotted one in the dying seconds off the boot of Jess Matin, but it was cold comfort in a clinical Richmond performance.</p>

<div>Father-son embrace completes premiership fairytale for Clearys</div>
<p>Ivan Cleary embraced son Nathan as he took to the stage to collect the Clive Churchill Medal on Sunday night. An emotional note to end an emotional NRL season.</p>
<p>Nathan Cleary was in tears as the Panthers were pummelled by Melbourne in last year’s decider.</p>
<p>So it was a remarkable comeback for the halfback who can now lay claim to being the best No.7 in the game.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked so hard to get here, we’ve finally done it, we’ve climbed Everest,” Cleary said. “Everyone back at Penrith, I love all you guys, we can’t wait to get back and party, baby.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream come true. I’ve dreamt about this moment since I was a little kid. It still doesn’t feel real.</p>
<p>“Any of the boys could have got this [medal], it was a big group effort, and every time you pull on the Panthers jersey it means so much more.”</p>
<p>After he enjoys a few well-deserved beers, Cleary will dust off the hangover in a few days and undergo shoulder surgery. He dislocated his right shoulder at the same Suncorp Stadium venue back in June during Origin II.</p>
<p>He has clearly been in a lot of discomfort but never wanted to let his teammates down.</p>
<p>Penrith were on the front foot for most of the night, which made it difficult for Souths players to apply any kick pressure.</p>
<p>Pressuring Cleary was a huge storyline last month when they came up against Souths in the qualifying final.</p>
<p>Similar to Ivan, Nathan has had no shortage of knockers in recent years. But Nathan has a premiership ring at just 23 years of age and will only get better.</p>
