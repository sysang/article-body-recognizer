<div>Musk accused of dancing to Beijing’s tune to build Tesla</div>
<p>Elon Musk is many things, but a professional dancer is not one of them. As the first Tesla Model 3s rolled off the electric car maker’s Shanghai “gigafactory” production line, Musk let the euphoria get the better of him.</p>
<p>Appearing at an on-stage event to mark the occasion, the chief executive threw off his blazer and treated the cheering crowd to some decidedly questionable moves, which became instant online meme fodder.</p>
<p>Tesla has become the leading electric vehicle maker in the UK and US in recent years. Last year its Model 3 was the second-best selling new car in Britain. The company is expanding with new factories in Berlin and Texas.</p>
<p>But much of its ascendance to becoming the world’s most valuable car company, and Musk being crowned as the world’s richest person, has been down to China.</p>
<p>But Tesla may struggle to keep up momentum. While many Western technology companies are already frozen out of China, those left are finding life increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Musk also found himself at odds with Beijing when it recently lodged a UN complaint over Starlink, the entrepreneur’s space internet service, saying its satellites had been involved in near misses with Chinese astronauts.</p>
<p>“The question would be, ‘Hey do you want China to get a hold of that technology? So it can drive its battle tanks without any drivers?’ I think they will look at that at some point.”</p>
<p>Before long, Musk could find himself doing a different kind of dance in China.</p>

<p>Queensland cattle farmer Melinee Leather has seen permanent creeks dry up, temperatures soar to new highs and flooding in areas that don’t usually flood.</p>
<p>As the weather becomes more unpredictable and extreme, Leather has trained herself to stop being surprised.</p>
<p>“We started to think, there’s nothing that couldn’t happen,” she says. “That thought process of, ‘that wouldn’t happen here’, is probably not true.”</p>
<p>The changes are partly driven by shifting consumer demand that favours ethical farming, partly because Leather believes it’s the right thing to do, and partly because banks and investors have started to require it.</p>
<p>“To have a successful business, you have to protect your environment,” she says. “Without doing that, you’re putting yourself at financial risk.”</p>
<p>Farmers are at the forefront of an emerging type of financial risk that investors are starting to factor into decisions around whether to provide finance, and at what price.</p>
<p>‘Nature risk’ is related to climate risk, but looks beyond carbon emissions to measure how a company is impacting a broader range of natural assets, including biodiversity, water, soils and landscapes.</p>
<p>World Economic Forum research found $44 trillion, more than half of the world’s total gross domestic product, is moderately or highly dependent on nature, with agriculture being in the top three industries that are most exposed to nature loss.</p>
<p>At the heart of the problem, Turner says, is that nature has been under-valued.</p>
<p>“So we need to start to value nature more appropriately.”</p>
<p>“Much of our system of food is dependent on pollination,” she says. “Two thirds of the world’s pollinators are at risk. These are material issues, they’re being noted and now coming to prominence.”</p>
<p>NAB is now working with its agricultural customers to ensure they’re businesses are protected against biodiversity loss, as well as other natural capital risks, such as soil health and water availability.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘There’s always a risk of regulation if we do nothing. We as an industry need to be proactive. We need to be transparent.’</p><cite>Melinee Leather, Cattle farmer</cite></blockquote>
<p>“The investor response to climate change risks and opportunities holds several lessons for the treatment of biodiversity. The two risks are closely interlinked, and are similar in scale and urgency,” the report said.</p>

<p>US group Block has received the final regulatory approval for its $39 billion takeover of buy now, pay later group Afterpay, capping off the biggest deal in Australian corporate history.</p>
<p>Afterpay told the ASX on Tuesday that it had received final approval from the Bank of Spain, which was the final hurdle the deal need to clear before being completed.</p>
<p>With the approval from Spain’s central bank now in hand, the deal is expected to be formally completed on February 1.</p>
<p>“Afterpay, its leadership and team have shown that groundbreaking fintech innovation built in Australia can reach global proportions,” Afterpay’s chairman, Elana Rubin, said.</p>
<p>“The team are incredibly excited at the prospect of beginning an extraordinary next phase with Block and look forward to implementation on February 1.”</p>
<p>“Since the announcement of the proposed acquisition, Afterpay shares have been trading largely in line with Block,” Macquarie’s team of technology analysts led by Wei Sim said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of 2022, however, the discount gap has widened, in our view reflecting potential risk that the deal would not go ahead due to delays from Bank of Spain approval.</p>
<p>“This has created a short-term opportunity for Afterpay shareholders as the gap between the two should now close as all regulatory approvals have now been received.”</p>
<p>The deal caps off an incredible run by the Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen founded group since it listed on the ASX in 2016 following an initial public offering where it raised $25 million at $1 a share.</p>
<p>The fall in Afterpay and Square’s share price has also altered the valuation of the all-scrip deal which now sits at about $24 billion.</p>

<div>Digital mortgage battle to erupt as fintechs eye home loans</div>
<p>As more of Generation Y enters prime home-buying age, it is sparking a new wave of fintech competition in the most lucrative business in Australian banking: mortgages.</p>
<p>For years, banking giants have warned of the threat from technology-based rivals, and much of this has initially focused on payments and consumer credit, such as Afterpay, or Apple’s digital wallet.</p>
<p>Now, banks are gearing up for a digital battle in the $1.9 trillion home loan market, as new players eye off tech-savvy younger customers seeking to buy a home.</p>
<p>It is a fight the biggest players can’t ignore. Mortgages dominate the big four banks’ loan portfolios, generating industry-wide profits estimated at $20 billion a year by Evans and Partners analyst Matthew Wilson.</p>
<p>The challenge for banks is that younger clients, such as 31 year-old Anthony Lieu, are increasingly open to doing all of their banking online, giving fintechs an opening.</p>
<p>His attitude reflects a wider trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic: younger customers are embracing digital finance, whether it is in payments, investing apps, or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Upcoming moves from Afterpay and the neobank Up into home loans show how new players that started in areas such as payments are attempting to pick off younger home buyers, albeit with backing from established banks.</p>
<p>Afterpay plans to start selling mortgages in 2022 through its recently launched banking app that is targeted at Gen Y women (those born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Z (those born from 1997).</p>
<p>Afterpay’s mortgages will be funded by Westpac, but even so, it shows the potential of fintech apps to move into the banks’ core territory.</p>
<p>Bendigo-backed Tic:Toc, which will provide technology for Up to approve digital loans, is another example of a fast-growing digital mortgage business - it also relies on Bendigo for funding.</p>
<p>Non-bank lenders such as Nano Digital Home Loans and Athena Home Loans are also eyeing a piece of the action, alongside older businesses such as Loans.com.au, owned by Firstmac.</p>
<p>With other digital businesses like REA Group’s realestate.com.au also targeting home loans, Starkey argues there’s an opportunity for the business to make finance more “embedded” in the wider process of buying a home.</p>
<p>Nano’s co-founder and chief executive Andrew Walker argues COVID-19 has accelerated the shift to digital applications, arguing digital home loans are “rapidly becoming the norm”.</p>
<p>“If you look at the global data, you’ll see that Australia is far behind the rest of the world, where currently less than 3 to 5 per cent of mortgages are originated digitally, compared to 30 per cent in the US,” Walker says.</p>
<p>“We originally anticipated it to be 3-5 year market shift, but we now believe that it will take place over the next 12 – 18 months.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced that digital home loans are set to take over.</p>
<p>Given the complexity and high stakes of taking out a home loan, mortgage brokers arrange a large share of new loans, and some survey data suggests even young digital-savvy customers still want to deal with a human when taking out a loan.</p>
<p>But in any case, there is little doubt that digital home lending is emerging as a key battleground in banking - just as approval processes were a critical issue for lenders in 2021.</p>
<p>In the longer term, experts predict even more sweeping changes to mortgage lending from “open banking,” a system that allows consumers to securely share their financial data when applying for a loan.</p>
<p>“I think it will happen slowly, and then it will happen fast,” Cameron says of the disruption in mortgages. “The good banks will be able to keep up with these trends,” he says.</p>
<p>Technology giants such as Apple and Google are also lurking in the background, as they muscle into the payments market through their digital wallet apps.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘I think it will happen slowly, and then it will happen fast.’</p><cite>James Cameron, AirTree Ventures</cite></blockquote>
<p>The intentions that giants such as Apple have in banking are unclear, but they would be formidable competitors if they sought to gain a bigger slice of the banking market beyond payments.</p>
<p>Even so, it is clear that as digital finance takes off, the banks are only going to face growing competition from technology-based players. And while that could be challenging for bank shareholders, it could be better news for customers.</p>
<p>“You can’t stop big tech and fintech from coming into the Australian market. It’s exciting, it’s good for competition,” he says.</p>

<div>Decarbonise or die, world’s biggest investor warns business chiefs</div>
<p>One of the world’s most powerful investors is again urging that chief executives rapidly and boldly embrace the green economy or be swept aside by a wave of faster, smarter competitors.</p>
<p>Or in Larry Fink’s more colourful language, chief executives today cannot avoid the global transition now unfolding, but they can choose whether to recast themselves as unicorns, phoenixes or dodos.</p>
<p>The New York Times wrote Mr Fink’s focus on “stakeholder” interests rather than those of shareholders marked a watershed moment in capitalism.</p>
<p>He writes that in BlackRock’s view responding to issues such as climate change by embracing rapid decarbonisation is not only necessary to retain a social licence, but good business.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke.’ It is capitalism.”</p><cite>Larry Fink</cite></blockquote>
<i>It is capitalism</i>, [his emphasis] driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper.”
<p>Citing the speed at which the world’s major car manufacturers have pivoted to electric vehicles over the past two years, Mr Fink says that any company not prepared for rapid decarbonisation will be brushed aside by disruptive competitors.</p>
<p>Mr Fink believes the COVID-19 pandemic will not distract from innovation and change, but accelerate it, in part because the economy is awash with stimulus cash.</p>
<p>“With the unprecedented amount of capital looking for new ideas, incumbents need to be clear about their pathway to succeeding in a net zero economy,” he writes.</p>
<p>The businesses that flourish will be those that boldly leverage their advantages in expertise, market knowledge and capital during a period of fast transition to a decarbonised economy, he writes.</p>
<p>“We do run a lot of money on behalf of retirees globally, and we have a responsibility to ensure that corporates are doing the thinking about long-term return,” he said.</p>

<div>Crown game too rich for wounded Star</div>
<div><div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Crown game too rich for wounded Star</h1></div><div><div><div><h5>Elizabeth Knight</h5>Business columnist</div><div> <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 3.25pm</time></span></div></div></div></div>
<p>Crown shareholders who are expecting or even hoping that Star Entertainment will attempt to outbid Blackstone’s indicative takeover offer for the James Packer-backed casino group will be disappointed.</p>
<p>The $13.10 per share indicative offer that Blackstone delivered to the Crown board last week was the king hit of takeovers in pricing terms.</p>
<p>This game is now too rich for a wounded Star.</p>
<p>So, there was never any chance that the Crown board was not going to look favourably on Blackstone’s offer.</p>
<p>Of course Crown was going to engage with Blackstone, welcome it in to look at Crown’s detailed financials and recommend the deal to its shareholders. It was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Had the Crown board been any less than welcoming to Blackstone, they would have been run out of town by shareholders wielding pitchforks and Packer would have been at the head of the pack.</p>
<p>Packer’s delightfully understated response to the offer said he was “encouraged” by Blackstone’s announcement. More than likely Packer’s private response (and that of the Crown board) would be air-punching exuberance.</p>
<p>It’s a price that Crown hasn’t seen since 2019. Since then, a series of legislated changes have been proposed or enacted that will eat into its earnings. In addition, casinos have been badly disrupted by the pandemic for two years.</p>
<p>This must be a Eureka moment for Packer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not only is Blackstone’s indicative price generous, it is also exquisitely timed. At $13.10 the stakes are now too rich for Star to re-enter the race.</p>
<p>Star could only ever contemplate a scrip deal - where it offered its own shares to pay Crown shareholders. Star’s share price has fallen since it made (and later withdrew) a lower offer for Crown last year.</p>
<p>If Star re-entered the fray at these lofty prices, its own shareholders would be significantly diluted and would aim THEIR pitchforks at the Star board.</p>
<p>COVID certainly hasn’t helped Star over the past eight months, with temporary closures, social distancing, staff shortages and border closures eating into cash flow and applying pressure to its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Just as importantly Star has been placed in an unofficial corporate holding pattern by regulators who will publicly examine the company in March around money laundering issues. The outcome will likely not be known until the middle of the year.</p>
<p>Blackstone has seized that opportunity to deliver the indicative offer to Crown in the hope that it can wrap up a deal with Crown shareholders by May.</p>
<p>Realistically the only way Star could get back in the game is if Blackstone walks away from the $13.10 price and presents Crown with a revised lower price.</p>
<p>Packer will be desperately hoping that Blackstone stays the course with its current indicative price. He was a seller of Crown before the regulatory wreckage and the pandemic damage.</p>
<p>And despite Packer’s mistakes, history has shown the timing of his asset sales to be pitch perfect.</p>

<div>Powell says Fed will lift rates if needed to contain ‘severe threat’ of inflation</div>
<p>Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell pledged to do what’s necessary to contain an inflation surge and prolong the expansion, while steering clear of fresh details on the path of US monetary policy.</p>
<p>Prices rose 5.7 per cent for the 12 months ending November as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred benchmark.</p>
<p>While stressing that the Fed doesn’t prioritise its congressional mandate for price stability more than the goal for full employment, Powell said that the emphasis can shift and at the moment there was more focus on inflation.</p>
<p>Financial markets took Powell’s remarks in their stride. Stocks erased losses, with the SP 500 and the Nasdaq 100 pushing higher while bonds fluctuated.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘To get a long expansion we are going to need price stability. And so in a way, high inflation is a severe threat to the achievement of maximum employment.’</p><cite>Fed chair Jerome Powell</cite></blockquote>
<p>Fed officials in December said they would accelerate the end of their asset purchase program, and forecast they would raise rates three times this year. Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs Group are forecasting as many as four increases.</p>
<p>“The balance sheet is much bigger and so the runoff can be faster. So I would say sooner and faster -- that much is clear,” he said.</p>
<div>Political rhetoric insufficient to help Aussies own their own home</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Political rhetoric insufficient to help Aussies own their own home</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Jessica Irvine</h5>Senior economics writer</div><div> <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 5.30am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>After two years of being largely confined to them, our homes have become the ultimate symbol of comfort and safety for many.</p>
<p>So, it was perhaps no surprise to see unified appeals to the great Aussie dream of homeownership from both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese in exclusive interviews published in this newspaper over the past week.</p>
<p>Admittedly, we are still in the “throat-clearing” stage of the election cycle, where lines are road-tested and honed and details of policy substance remain thin on the ground.</p>
<p>When asked by senior writer Deborah Snow for some of some big picture ideas for Australians to chew on, Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered the following as part of his vision:</p>
<p>This unified appeal to Australians’ deep desire to “own their own home” has, of course, a long running place in our political history.</p>
<p>Despite rising concerns about housing affordability as far back as 2003, then prime minister John Howard famously pronounced he’d never had anyone complain about rising home values to him on the street.</p>
<p>Sadly, this desire is today an unmet need for a rising proportion of Australians.</p>
<p>The decline is most pronounced among younger Australians. In 1971, 64 per cent of 30- to 34-year-olds owned a home. By 2016, only 50 per cent did.</p>
<p>And while the upcoming election looks set to be long on rhetoric about the joys of home ownership, it is also looking decidedly short on policies of real substance to actually stop runaway home values or help achieve higher rates of ownership.</p>
<p>Labor, of course, has ditched its two signature housing affordability policies of halving the tax discount on capital gains on investment properties and abolishing negative gearing on new properties.</p>
<p>While helpful for getting some aspiring borrowers over the line, such policies do nothing to reduce long-term upward pressure on home values.</p>
<div><p>Younger Australians deserve more than just piecemeal policies and soothing words when it comes to fixing the continuing crisis in housing affordability. Now, that to me – that’s a big idea.</p></div>

<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>The headline rate of growth in China’s GDP of 8.1 per cent last year that was disclosed on Monday is deceptive, given that the reference point was the COVID-affected economy in 2020.</p>
<p>While the fourth quarter GDP growth of 4 per cent was stronger than most economists had forecast (and attracted some scepticism as a consequence) it continued the succession of lower growth numbers posted through last year.</p>
<p>In the first quarter last year (where the base was the worst-affected moment of the pandemic) the economy grew 18 per cent; in the second 7.9 per cent and in the third 4.9 per cent.</p>
<p>The authorities responded, hours before the December quarter accounts were issued, by cutting two key interest rates.</p>
<p>The PBOC actions to stimulate economic activity are occurring even as other major central banks are heading in the opposite direction, preparing to raise rates and tighten liquidity.</p>
<p>China’s inflation rate has been falling even as inflation in the developed world has been threatening to spiral out of control, hence the divergence in monetary policies. That divergence also, however, reflects something deeper.</p>
<p>There are two broad sets of domestic policies, policies peculiar to China, that help explain the slowing of its economic growth.</p>
<p>Perhaps of greater continuing impact, given that the authorities have eased some of the measures impacting property development and appear to have completed their make-over of their tech sector, is, however, China’s approach to COVID.</p>
<p>Its strict zero-COVID policy has evolved slightly, from hard lockdowns of entire cities to more targeted restrictions, but it is still being reflected in significant economic disruptions.</p>
<p>Despite getting control of the Delta variant late last year there are still, according to Barclays Bank, 11 provinces, accounting for about 42 per cent of national GDP, that are or that have been labelled as medium to high risk by the authorities.</p>
<p>Ominously, there’s also been the first locally-transmitted case of Omicron in the port city of Tianjin, close to Beijing.</p>
<p>With the authorities responding to each outbreak with large-scale lockdowns, closing ports, factories, schools and other services and restricting travel, the hardline approach to COVID translates directly into reduced economic growth.</p>
<p>That will affect the economy and make growth more volatile.</p>
<blockquote><p>The anxious response of the authorities to the decline in birth rates suggests they see it as a major threat to China’s longer-term growth and position within the world order.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the modest, by China’s remarkable standards, GDP numbers were released, gloomier longer-term data also emerged.</p>
<p>Population growth has underpinned China’s extraordinary rise – and its increasing contribution to global growth -- over the past 40 years so its stagnation and potential decline could have repercussions within and outside China.</p>
<p>Certainly, the anxious response of the authorities to the decline in birth rates suggests they see it as a major threat to China’s longer-term growth and position within the world order.</p>
