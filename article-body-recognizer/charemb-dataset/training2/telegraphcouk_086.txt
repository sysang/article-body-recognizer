<h2>Last <a>Moral Money</a>: ‘My staff want to work from home – is it wrong to force them to come to the office?’</h2>
<p>I own a small business that does strategic communications for a number of mid-sized companies. I have eight full-time employees, most of whom have been with me for at least four years.</p>
<p>Everything used to run so smoothly but it has gotten out of hand at times during the pandemic. I have asked my staff to keep coming into the office every day, even after Boris Johnson asked people to work from home, but I feel I have good reason. </p>
<p>Working from home was always meant to be a temporary measure. I can say without a doubt that my employees are more productive when they are working from the office. At home, things that should take five minutes take days.</p>
<p>They are more productive, more collaborative and finish their work much faster in the office. There is a real team feeling, too, which improves the quality of their work. I feel they are being lazy and looking for an easy ride.</p>
<p>Some have threatened to quit because they refuse to come in. Am I being unreasonable and can I keep insisting on their presence?</p>
<h2>Is it right for our reader to force his employees to work from the office?</h2>
<p>Yes, he should put the business first: 65pc</p>
<p>No, he is being selfish: 28pc</p>
<header> <h1> Thousands risk losing their homes as bank repossession ban ends </h1> <p> Cost of living crisis has left homeowners struggling to repay their mortgage </p> </header>
<p>Tens of thousands of homeowners face eviction after banks ended a Christmas ban on repossessions.</p>
<p>Mortgage lenders had collectively agreed not to repossess any homes over the festive period, but this moratorium has now lifted and evictions will once again take place.</p>
<p>Over the same period, banks repossessed 410 homes, a 242pc rise compared to the previous year, when a separate repossession ban was in place.</p>
<p>Richard Lane of StepChange, the debt charity, said: "While the Christmas moratorium on mortgage possessions was welcome, it was only going to be a sticking plaster for people looking to resolve their problems and keep their homes.</p>
<p>"As households face greater financial challenges with the rising costs of living, the risk of falling behind on priority debts such as mortgage payments may increase." </p>
<p>Average mortgage rates were at record lows in November, according to the Bank of England, but have started to climb following last month's Bank Rate rise.</p>
<p>Millions of borrowers on tracker-rate mortgages have already seen their bills increase by £186 on average as a result.</p>
<p>Tax changes coming in April could add an extra £600 onto household bills, <a>the Resolution Foundation think tank said</a>.</p>
<p>Food and fuel prices have soared in recent months. Other bills are expected to rise dramatically. Rail tickets, phone contracts, car taxes and duties on flights and cigarettes will also climb.</p>
<header> <h1> How to supercharge a pension in your 40s </h1> <p> Middle-aged savers can afford to take a few more risks </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:18pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Retirement may still seem a long way off to anyone in their 40s but it is never too soon to start saving extra.</p>
<p>There are some important dos and don’ts when it comes to how you invest, depending on your age. </p>
<h2>How to boost your pension in midlife</h2>
<p>The good news is that pension nest eggs are locked away until age 55 so they still have time to recover from any surprise swings in the stock market. </p>
<p>Laith Khalaf of AJ Bell, the stockbroker, said this meant pension savers could afford to take a high degree of risk in their 40s. They should invest all their money into stocks and shares, he said. </p>
<p>The Fidelity Index World, a passive fund that tracks the global stock market, is a simple, hands off investment that is also cheap, at 0.12pc per year, he said. </p>
<p>One fund that invests in large companies from the developing world that are priced at a discount relative to their worth, is the Lazard Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>Dan Lane of Freetrade, a stockbroker and Sipp provider, said investors should not follow the traditional split of 60pc stocks and 40pc bonds because it has become outdated. </p>
<p>Bond yields are at such lows that “it’s no wonder a lot of investors have chosen to chuck out the bonds and climb the risk ladder into stocks instead”, he said. “Bonds haven’t been playing their part.”</p>
<p>Instead, those in their 40s should put 80pc of their savings in the stock market and 20pc in bonds, Mr Lane said.</p>
<p>It is important to set out your savings goals. If you want to fund a healthy retirement but will have no income from a final salary pension then retirees will need income-paying stocks and fast-growing companies too. </p>
<p>One trust that offers both is the Finsbury Growth and Income, according to Mr Lane, as it invests in long-term winners that have a good dividend track record. </p>
<p>Rather than investing in bonds, there are alternative investment types such as real estate investment trusts. </p>
<p>“Warehouse Reit carries a decent dividend and isn’t laboured with expensive legacy flagship stores on once popular high streets,” Mr Lane said.</p>
<p>"Warehousing has been the saving grace for ecommerce retailers and, unless you think internet shopping is going away, holds the opportunity for growth as well as income.”</p>

<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Retirees have more options than ever before when it comes to how they want to spend their pension pot. But with choice comes more responsibility, and more room for error. </p>
<p>The once-favoured annuity has fallen in popularity as rates have dropped to the extent most buyers are unlikely to get even their initial investment back.</p>
<a>more flexible option</a> of dipping into their nest egg as and when they need the cash, known as “drawdown”. While this may work for most retirees, a guaranteed income for the rest of your life does have its merits.
<h2>Which is the best for retirement income: annuity or drawdown?</h2>
<p>Retirement planning is highly personal and will depend on various factors, including how much you need to live on, your health and how much you have saved.</p>
<p>But whether you have £100,000, £500,000 or £1m saved up in your pension pot, drawdown will <a>always give you the highest income</a>, according to figures compiled for Telegraph Money by financial planners at Brewin Dolphin.</p>
<p>This is largely down to a <a>deterioration</a> in annuity rates. The secure source of income has lost value in five out of the past six years. </p>
<p>Running out of money during retirement is the biggest risk with this flexible approach so it is important that those opting for drawdown do not withdraw too much, too soon. </p>
<p>Similarly, someone with £500,000 saved up could secure a guaranteed income of £19,695 with an annuity. But they could draw £25,126 through to age 95 if they dipped into their pension flexibly. </p>
<p>The larger the pension, the wider the disparity between the amount of income you can receive with an annuity versus drawdown.</p>
<p>For example, a £1m pension pot would afford a yearly income of £39,499 as an annuity but those in drawdown could live off £50,252.</p>
<p>That is not the case for those who buy an annuity with all their savings, however, as typically the policy dies with the owner.</p>
<p>The good news is that annuities are not an all-or-nothing option. Retirees can get the best of both worlds by using a portion of their pension to purchase a steady stream of income that guarantees they will not run out of money.</p>
<p>David Stevens of LV, an annuity and pension provider, said “It’s so important to stress that there are no rights or wrongs between annuities and drawdown.</p>

<blockquote><h4>The Secret Landlord is a new monthly column by an anonymous buy-to-let investor, pulling back the curtain on the highs and lows of renting property and answering readers' questions</h4></blockquote>
<p>This spring, given the hot property market, I decided the time had come to sell one third of my portfolio. It didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>The whole debacle gave me time to reflect and rethink: why am I landlord? </p>
<p>The fact remains: people need somewhere to live. Demand is very strong, and rental prices post-Covid are increasing to much higher than anticipated levels.</p>
<p>This job isn’t for the faint-hearted. Being a landlord does mean you get to collect monies on assets you own, but there’s a lot more to this than just cashing a rent cheque.</p>
<p>Many of my tenants have stayed with me for years, some almost as long as I’ve been a landlord. I like to think that says something about the service levels I provide. And this is a service business – don’t forget that.</p>
<p>I know there are rogue landlords out there, but I’m not one of them. I’m not perfect, and sometimes I get it wrong. I want the opportunity to be honest and share the good, the bad and, hopefully, the useful.</p>

<header> <h1> Want 12pc yields on a buy-to-let property? Make the council pay </h1> <p> Severe shortage of local authority housing means councils are guaranteeing rents for property investors </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 15 May 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Landlords are earning rental yields of up to 12pc by having the local authority pick up the bill.</p>
<a>severe shortage of social housing</a>, which has forced some councils to secure properties for tenants by other means.
<a>yields in some areas can nudge 12pc</a>. There is the added bonus that the tenancy is stable, and rent is paid on time and in full, said Max Armstrong, of North East Property Investment, a buy-to-let specialist.
<p>But supply cannot keep up with demand. Government data show that in the entirety of 2020, only 70 local authority homes were built in the North East, a drop of 63pc compared with 2019.</p>
<p>In the East Midlands, 80 local authority homes were built last year. This was actually double the 40 homes built in the region in 2019.</p>
<p>“Because of how competitive the market is, local authorities are competing with normal tenants. In some scenarios, they pay more than market rates,” said Mr Kingswood.</p>
<p>The strategy is not well known, but awareness of the benefits is growing among investors. “It is starting to filter to the mainstream,” said Mr Jones.</p>
<header> <h1> Tax crackdown cuts landlord sales by a third </h1> <p> Rental market 7pc smaller than 2017 and rents are rising six times faster than inflation </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Rachel Mortimer <time> 17 May 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Government's buy-to-let crackdown led to landlords buying a third fewer properties in the last five years.</p>
<p>Property investors have bought more than 700,000 homes have been since April 2016, according to estate agency Hamptons. </p>
<p>But it found that this figure could have been at least 36pc higher if the punitive tax changes had not been introduced. Now, the rental sector is 7pc smaller than it was at its peak in 2017, which is helping to boost rental prices.</p>
<p>Hamptons estimated that investors would have bought an additional 249,800 homes in the past five years had it not been for the changes. </p>
<p>Aneisha Beveridge, of Hamptons, said: “The tax changes introduced from 2016 onwards have undoubtedly taken the heat out of the buy-to-let market. </p>
<p>“Landlord purchases have dropped and consequently the rental sector is 7pc smaller than it was at its peak in 2017.”</p>
<p>This shrinking market has in turn pushed up the cost of renting, with rents across the UK rising by 5.9pc in the year to April, the fastest rate since January 2015. </p>
<p>An exodus of tenants from London during the pandemic meant this growth was driven by regions outside the city, with average rents falling by 2.6pc in the capital over the last year. </p>
<p>The South West and South East, where average rents jumped by 11.3pc and 10.3pc respectively between April 2020 and April 2021, recorded the biggest rental growth, spurred by tenants in search of green space.</p>
<p>“The longer-term impact of fewer rental homes is driving rental growth now, with rents rising six times faster than inflation,” said Ms Beveridge.</p>
<p>This divide could be set to reverse, however, with property website Zoopla reporting last week <a>renters were returning to city centres</a> after the pandemic-fuelled exodus which saw urban populations plummet. </p>
<p>The revival comes as prospective tenants hunt for a bargain, especially in London where affordability is now at levels not seen in the past decade. </p>
<header> <h1> Leaving London? The best commuter villages to buy a home in for less than £300k </h1> <p> The new part-time commute a few days a week means buyers can look further from train stations where house prices are lower </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 29 March 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Coronavirus has expanded commuter belts, diminishing the importance of proximity to work while house-hunting in favour of more space.</p>
<p>Buyers are no longer happy to sacrifice a bigger home and greenery for the sake of a shorter train journey, because many now only need to stomach the <a>commute once or twice a week</a>.</p>
<p>The result has been a well-documented surge in <a>demand for village properties</a> in rural locations with extra bedrooms and outdoor space.</p>
<p>But now that you’re no longer chained to your train station, where should you buy around London?</p>
<p>Savills estate agents has analysed property prices in village parishes within 10km of all stations within less than a 45-minute train journey of the capital. </p>
<p>In the first of a four-part series, we take a look at where you can move with £300,000. You're priced out of the commuter belt <a>south west of the capital</a>, but there are 22 village parishes within budget across the other compass points.</p>
<p>There is a “race for space” said Mr Henson. “Before the pandemic, 30pc of our buyers were London commuters, but since Covid that has jumped to 50pc." </p>
<p>Little Paxton, where the average home costs £270,208, sits on the outskirts of St Neots, two miles' walk from the town centre. It has a primary school and is also home to Paxtons Pits Nature Reserve.</p>
<p>Prices are up 5pc year-on-year across the county, said Mr Henson. “That’s the strongest market growth we’ve seen in eight or nine years.”</p>
<p>Steve Thompson, of Fine Country estate agents in St Neots, said: “The big thing is garden space, people moving out of London don’t want flats,” said Mr Thompson. </p>
<p>Brampton, where the average home costs £298,205, is home to an airfield which is being redeveloped into new homes. </p>
<p>Outside Cambridgeshire, further east, in Silver End in Essex, homes cost £236,765 – the second best value village within commuting distance of London.</p>
<a>south London stations</a>. Many of the village parishes surrounding these stations are on former brownfield industrial redevelopment sites.
<p>But some also come with scenery. Andrew Harwood, of Strutt Parker estate agents, said: “Burham and Wouldham are two standouts on the edge of the Kent Downs with great accessibility.”</p>
<p>Vigo, where homes cost £288,617, is a little further out, but commuters can get to London in 43 minutes from Snodland station. </p>
<p>Newington, where homes cost £265,028, has a 38-minute journey to London via Chatham station but is the most picturesque, with a 12th century church.</p>
<p>Buyers can also benefit from Kent’s 40 or so grammar schools. However, the supply of second hand homes for sale in this area has dropped by 50pc year-on-year, said Mr Harwood. </p>
<p>Most of the commuter villages within this price bracket to the <a>north west of London</a> are concentrated in Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>Beyond Bedfordshire, Coldharbour in Buckinghamshire is near Haddenham Thame Parkway station where trains are 41 minutes to London Marylebone. Homes here cost on average £277,012.</p>
<p>In Berinsfield in South Oxfordshire, the average property price is £249,726. The train journey time from Didcot Parkway station to London Paddington is 41 minutes.</p>
<p>Value for money is key: homes in Berinsfield sell for 15pc to 20pc less than equivalent properties in the nearby towns Abingdon or Wallingford, said Mr Jeffery.</p>
<p>The Government-backed 95pc mortgages announced during the Budget are providing a further boost. “We are getting buyers coming out viewing properties in preparation for when the mortgages come out in April,” said Mr Jeffery.</p>

<header> <h1> Want to buy your first home? These property hotspots offer the best value </h1> <p> Our new four-part series finds the best places to buy a home in England at every stage of life, from first-time buyers to downsizers </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 30 November 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The pandemic has disrupted the usual path of getting on the housing ladder. For many first-time buyers, it no longer exists.</p>
<p>In the old days, renters saved deposits to purchase one-bedroom flats in towns and cities, with many planning to make a second move outwards when they started thinking about schools for their children.</p>
<a>houses with gardens</a>, often in locations that are
<p>These are the best places to purchase a first home in every region in England.</p>
<p>Bromley, in south-east London, <a>offers relative value</a> compared to its neighbours. The cheapest homes cost £375,000.</p>
<p>Emily Williams, of Kinleigh, Folkard Hayward estate agents, said first-time buyers account for 60pc to 70pc of the market. They are largely moving from the likes of Tooting, Clapham, Streatham, Dulwich and Balham in south London. </p>
<p>Prices for houses have climbed 15pc year-on-year. The value of apartments, by contrast, has flatlined. </p>
<p>These first-time buyers are also planning further ahead. Schools are a key draw, said Ms Williams. Highfield infants and junior schools, St George’s, La Fontaine Academy and Raglan Primary School are particularly popular.</p>
<p>Those seeking more value can opt for neighbouring Bexley, which stretches between Bromley and the Thames. Here, homes cost 15pc less at £320,000.</p>
<p>Jordan Rogers, of Connells estate agents, said the share of first-time buyers has more than doubled from 15pc before the pandemic to 35pc to 40pc today.</p>
<p>There has been an influx of buyers from Berkshire and Surrey who no longer need to work in the office every day, said Mr Rogers, drawn by the town's good commuter links, with direct trains to London Paddington in 50 minutes.</p>
<p>They are bringing their larger London salaries with them down the M4 in search of more space and value for money.</p>
<p>Some out-of-towners looking for property in the town have become frenetic. “We had a house with an asking price of £230,000, and a first-time buyer moving from Hounslow only saw it via video and offered £240,000.”</p>
<p>Broadland, which sits on the northern side of Norwich, near the Norfolk coast, came top in the East of England. The cheapest homes here cost £220,125.</p>
<p>Eden, which spans the east side of the Lake District National Park and the west side of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Cumbria, was the best place in the country for first-time buyers, according to Savills' metric.</p>
<p>Value for money has been key, said Ms Lancaster. The average price of the cheapest homes in Eden is £160,000. “But the main thing is they want a nice work lifestyle balance,” said Ms Lancaster. The Lake District is a major draw.</p>
<p>Penrith’s surrounding villages of Lazonby, Langwathby, Armathwaite, Low Hesket and High Hesket are particularly popular. House prices in the town have jumped by between 8pc and 12pc year-on-year, said Ms Lancaster.</p>
<p>Movers who want more value for money can opt for Redcar and Cleveland on the north-east coast. This is the cheapest first-time buyer hotspot on the list, with the least expensive homes on average £95,500.</p>
<a>predominantly rural</a>. For first-time buyers who still want to be close to amenities, Leeds was the top city. Here, the least expensive homes are on average £155,000.
<p>But first-time buyers face fierce competition from investors, said Scott Bacon, of William H Brown estate agents. Local house prices have jumped 30pc year-on-year and supply is incredibly low.</p>
<p>The East Midlands accounts for a further three of the national top 10: South Derbyshire and High Peak in Derbyshire, and Hinckley and Bosworth in Leicestershire. The employment rate here is <a>exceptionally high at 71.3pc</a>.</p>
<header> <h1> Leaving London? The best commuter villages to buy a home in for less than £700k </h1> <p> Moving away from the central hub stations means bigger country homes come into budget </p> </header>

<a>£500,000</a>. Now here's what £700,000 can buy.
<a>gardenless flat for a country home</a> is a well-established pattern. But now remote working means Londoners can make their money go much further. They are no longer tied to living near mainline stations and the price premium those areas command.
<p>Savills estate agents has analysed property prices in village parishes within 10km of all stations within<a> less than a 45-minute train journey </a>of the capital. </p>
<p>In the first two parts of the series, we <a>looked at where you can move with £300,000</a> and <a>£500,000</a>. Now, here's where you can buy with a larger budget of £700,000.</p>
<p>With this budget, many places open up, so we have only included villages with top primary schools.</p>
<a>come out of London</a> and look at Ascot and Sunningdale and think it doesn’t feel rural enough, it feels like south-west London. Chobham is a real village, it has quintessential pubs and feels like the countryside.”
<p>Across the border in Hampshire, buyers can pick up homes in Eversley for £665,627 and commute to Waterloo via Farnborough Main’s 40-minute line.</p>
<p>In Hertfordshire, buyers in Wigginton and Welwyn can commute via Tring (38 minutes) and Welwyn North (20 minutes). Homes cost £647,264 and £624,575 respectively.</p>
<p>Ingatestone and Fryerning is a parish in Essex that encompasses two villages. The average house price in the parish is £628,635, but there is a significant difference between them.</p>
<p>It's a good option for commuters, said Stephen White, of Savills estate agents. “There is cheap all-day parking and you will get a seat on the train.”</p>
<p>The area is popular with buyers moving out from Shoreditch, Wapping, Islington and west Essex, said Mr White. As a result, the market is hot. “We have three times more buyers than houses,” he added.</p>
<p>In Hertfordshire, buyers in the parishes of Braughing and Hunsdon can commute to Bishops Stortford (38 minutes into London) and Harlow Town (35 minutes). Respective house prices are £606,478 and £640,200.</p>
<p>Sevenoaks station in Kent, which is a 34-minute journey into Charing Cross, as well as having a direct link to Blackfriars, is a <a>commuter hub</a> for a series of highbrow village parishes. </p>
<p>Riverhead sits on the outskirts of the town and many homes are within walking distance of the station. Properties here cost £644,126. </p>
<p>In the adjacent parish of Chevening, homes are £682,682. The property market here is centred around the village of Chipstead, which has a lake with a sailing club.</p>
<p>Some properties in the area are selling for 12pc over their asking prices after bidding wars, but many buyers are wary about overpaying. “I can’t say it is blanket brilliant at the moment,” said Ms Goodwin. </p>

<header> <h1> Gas price rise: when will energy bills increase and what you can do about it </h1> <p> What can you do to stop your bills rising? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 12 October 2021 • 8:43am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Britain is in the midst of a cost of living crisis and all the signs suggest it is going to get worse before it gets better. </p>
<p>Natural gas prices have rocketed to an all-time high, putting pressure on already struggling energy suppliers and sparking fears the energy crisis will fuel inflation and hamper the economic recovery. </p>
<p>Six in 10 households have already made cutbacks amid rising costs, according to fund shop AJ Bell. Some 72pc of households that have tightened the purse strings have done so over worries about rising energy costs.</p>
<p>There are some protective measures in place, but eventually consumers will feel the pain. So, when will your bill rise and, crucially, is there anything you can do about it?</p>
<h2>When will energy bills rise and why?</h2>
<p>A rise in wholesale prices has sparked an energy industry crisis and many gas and electricity suppliers are still at risk of collapse.</p>
<p>Government rules mean no households will be left without an energy supply, but seeing your provider exit the market can be a frustrating, and expensive, experience. </p>
<p>Ofgem said it would "try to get the best possible deal" for you if you’re in this situation, but there's no guarantee your bills will not rise. </p>
<p>Those who cannot secure a new fixed-term deal will be moved to their supplier's standard variable tariff, also known as a default tariff.</p>
<p>Analysts at HSBC warned that the further rise could lead to a 15pc increase on bills when the price cap is next reviewed in February. This could potentially push the cap up to £1,468 from April next year, a further £192 increase.</p>
<h2>What can you do about it?</h2>
<p>If you are moved to a new supplier, or your fixed-term deal comes to an end, be very careful before locking in to a new fixed-term deal.</p>
<p>For example, last month the cheapest fix was £1,177 while today the cheapest fix is round £1,700, according to Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert. </p>
<h2>What happens if my supplier goes bust?</h2>
<p>If your supplier goes out of business, Ofgem will switch you to a “supplier of last resort”, and any credit with the older energy provider will be transferred across.</p>
<p>Affected households should take meter readings as they will need to pass these on to their new supplier. </p>
<p>Gillian Cooper of Citizens Advice said: “If you’re a customer of a failed supplier, Ofgem will move you onto a different one. This can take a few weeks, but your gas and electricity supply will continue in the meantime. </p>
<p>"Your new supplier will contact you and it’s good to be prepared beforehand. Take a note of meter readings, keep old energy bills and make a note of your account balance. </p>
<p>"Wait until your new supplier is appointed before cancelling any direct debits. This should all make the transition easier.”</p>
<h2>Which energy suppliers have gone bust?</h2>
<p>Hub Energy closed its doors in August, followed by PFP Energy, MoneyPlus Energy, Utility Point and People's Energy in September. </p>
<p>Green and Avro, Igloo Energy, Symbio Energy and Enstroga have also stopped trading. </p>

<blockquote><p>Do you want to relocate your family and give your children access to an excellent free education? In this four-part series, we are looking at the best places to buy near England's grammar schools with different budgets</p></blockquote>
<a>catapulted home offices</a> to the top of buyers’ priority lists. But one trend stood firm during the Covid overhaul. No matter what, families want to be
<p>According to a buyer survey by Savills estate agents, half of purchasers with pre-school or school-aged children said that proximity to schools was in their top two priorities. </p>
<a>grammar schools</a> can offer property discounts. This is because schools do not have tight catchment areas and parents must gamble on their children's ability to pass the entrance exams.
<a>a budget of £200,000</a>.
<h3>Where to buy in the North West</h3>
<p>In Birkenhead, the average house price is £195,484 – a 13.7pc discount compared to the local authority average in Wirral. In Bebington, homes cost £193,625, a local saving of 14.5pc.</p>
<p>But competition for homes in these areas is fierce. Lesley Hooks, of the eponymous estate agents in Bebington, said: “We have 25 available properties and seven of those are in the process of offers. Normally we would have 70."</p>
<p>Homes in Port Sunlight, a village with a series of Victorian Arts and Crafts houses that were built for factory workers, are particularly popular, she said. </p>
<p>Prices have jumped fast. “A normal, three-bedroom semi that would have got £190,000 pre-pandemic will now get £230,000 to £250,000,” said Ms Hooks. </p>
<h3>Where to buy in the East Midlands</h3>
<p>Lincolnshire has five grammar schools in towns and neighbourhoods where homes cost less than £200,000.</p>
<p>A 45-minute drive south of Skegness, there are two more in the market town of Boston: Boston High School and the Boston Grammar School. Homes here cost £179,367, a discount of 8.4pc.</p>
<p>Lewis Brooks, of Pygott and Crone estate agents in Boston, said the Victorian and Georgian houses on the roads near the grammar schools and the Pilgrim Hospital are the most expensive. Prices can hit £600,000.</p>
<p>“Stock is at an all time low, and demand is at an all time high. A property can go live on Friday, we will have 15 viewings by Sunday and five offers on the Monday," he added. Prices have jumped 20pc in the area since the pandemic began.</p>
<h3>Where to buy in the West Midlands</h3>
<p>The neighbourhood of Aston in inner Birmingham also comes with big savings. Homes cost £183,394, a saving of 25pc compared to local house prices. The King Edward VI Aston School offers a free education, but it is boys only.</p>
<p>These relocators are driving price wars. Eight in 10 properties are selling with competitive bids, said Ms Pickering. “We have 37 listings on our books, normally we would have 70. There’s no sign of it slowing down.”</p>
<p>A 45-minute drive north in Trent Vale, St Joseph’s College is a mixed grammar school. Homes cost £164,049, but this is 16.9pc higher than local values.</p>
<h3>Where to buy in Yorkshire</h3>
<p>All three local grammar schools – the Heckmondwike Grammar School, and Halifax’s Crossley Heath School and the North Halifax Grammar School – are mixed.</p>
<p>Jonathan Marsh, of Marsh Marsh estate agents in Halifax, said the share of buyers who are relocating has more than doubled.</p>
<p>Unlike most parts of the country, however, Halifax is not short of supply. “We have 139 properties for sale, while normally we would have 100,” said Mr Marsh. “I’m chock-a-block with market valuations.”</p>
<h1> Do you live on one of the UK's favourite streets? Here's where house-hunters really want to buy </h1>
<p> Two fifths of buyers know where they want to move down to the exact road, according to Zoopla. These are the most sought after addresses </p>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 5 March 2020 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The residents of Nether Edge Road in Sheffield are nonplussed to hear that they live on one of the most sought-after streets in the UK.</p>
<p>The postcode of S10 on the other side of Ecclesall Road has long been better known for its grander houses. Nether Edge Road is not the most posh, nor the most expensive place to live.</p>
<p>But then that, of course, is what many buyers want. They are a picky bunch: “Forty per cent of households know the house or street they want to live on next,” says Richard Donnell, research director at the property portal Zoopla.</p>
<p>This is because they have insider knowledge. The majority of house moves are within a 10-mile radius of where buyers already live, he adds. So what can we learn from the local wisdom?</p>
<p>They moved here after Gudjonsson took her two children on an outing to journey the length of the No 97 bus with a picnic. “When we got off the bus at Nether Edge I had a huge <a>sense of coming home</a>,” she says.</p>
<p>The houses are mostly detached and built in varied styles, apart from a block of low-rise flats at the bottom of the hill, where both the Gudjonssons and the Rees family <a>moved their elderly mothers.</a></p>
<p>It is common to hear owls in the woods here, says David Pierce, the recent chair of the 900-strong Nether Edge Neighbourhood Group. But it is the sense of community that really sets this area of Sheffield apart.</p>
<p>Is that tradition over? “Well,” says Pierce, taking off his glasses with aplomb, “I might change my mind.”</p>
<p>Pierce was part of a small group who founded the farmers’ market in 2008. It has grown to an event with 80 stalls and has so far raised £80,000 for charity. The roads are pedestrianized for the market, and there’s entertainment.</p>
<p>“Obviously we have had Morris dancers, and belly dancers,” says Pierce. “And there’s nothing better than <a>the orchestra in the fresh air</a>.”</p>
<p>“It’s a rather ostentatious street that has a huge number of unoccupied properties, some of which are used as a vehicle to store capital by offshore entities,” says Thea Carroll, a buying agent.</p>
<p>But it is also home to some high spec new developments, including Crossways, a collection of nine apartments that share a chandeliered entrance hall. Homes are due to complete in the summer.</p>
<a>Edinburgh</a>, which is the borderline between The Meadows and the Quartermile development, the Foster + Partner-designed regeneration of the eight-acre former Royal Infirmary site.
<p>Developer marketing campaigns will play a key role in the street’s popularity on Zoopla, she says. She recalls seeing an advert for the Quartermile development on a trip in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The new-build flats on Simpson Loan also offers something different to typical Edinburgh properties. The city’s historic stock is freehold and apartments share responsibility for their communal areas.</p>
<p>The result is that “we got used to going into the most disastrous hallways,” says Pinnock. On Simpson Loan, she pays about £500 per quarter in service charges, which includes management of the stairwells.</p>
<p>Her current apartment is now on the market with Savills for £345,000. <a>Prices have been climbing fast</a> in Edinburgh: values in January were up 5.9 per cent on January 2019, according to Zoopla, the steepest rise in the UK.</p>
<p>The small residential offering consists of small, period townhouses. “It’s almost a time capsule of yesteryear Lincoln,” says Kyle Leeman, assistant manager at the street’s Duke William Hotel.</p>
<a>south-east London</a> to find a family house within
<a>easy commuting distance of the capital</a> (the train journey to Euston is 28 minutes). They have been on Cowper Road ever since.
<p>Her son is currently at Boxmoor Primary School and her daughter has just started at The Hemel Hempstead School, a 12-minute walk away, which is a positive mission by Cowper Road standards.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the street is a small cluster of shops, including a florist. “They did my wedding flowers”, says McDonald.</p>
<p>“Everyone is dead friendly, but not overly so,” she adds. The family are planning to upsize locally. Their home is for sale with David Doyle for £495,000.</p>

<header> <h1> How to use up leftover roast turkey this Christmas </h1> <p> ... not to mention surplus sprouts and an overflow of roast potatoes. Transform them into flavour-packed meals to brighten your mood </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Pip Sloan <time> 24 December 2021 • 2:27pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Christmas leftovers can be both a blessing and a curse; the initial joy of the Boxing Day turkey sandwich, so satisfying with its hit of sweetness from a spoonful of chutney, can quickly become tiresome when repeated meal after meal.</p>
<p>Not to mention a surplus of sprouts and rather too many roast potatoes... which means we're going to have to get even more creative in the kitchen to use up the extra food bought in for the big day. </p>
<p>Use up the last of your bird in Asian-style salads with plenty of bright and fold flavours, a pepped-up pie, and a stunning soup that also stars parsnips and leeks. </p>
<h3>Roast potatoes, sprouts, carrots and more</h3>
<p>Transform your leftover cooked vegetables (or surplus fresh ingredients) into soups, salads and a Spanish omelette that can be used as a blueprint recipe at any time of year. </p>
<h3>Christmas pudding (and other treats)</h3>

<p>Even in the best of times, I’ve never been much of a fan of Dry January, despite it becoming so fashionable of late. But this year in particular, giving up drink altogether feels to me like the very last thing we need.</p>
<a>Covid</a>, we have so far endured
<a>one all-but-cancelled Christmas</a> and are just coming out of another that had a big shadow hanging over the festivities. Why choose more abstinence when we have had so little chance of plenty since March 2020?
<p>Dry January began as a public health campaign about (very sensibly) dialling things down after too much Christmas and New Year partying. If there is one thing the pandemic has done its best to stop, it is partying. </p>
<p>In its place, lots of us have adopted a steady-as-we-go, not-too-much-not-too-little approach to everything in life that has kept us sane during the huge domestic, social and economic disruption of this Covid emergency.</p>
<a>The Fish House</a> for a few weeks. 
<p>The staff could do with a break, the customers are few and far between and there is maintenance to do. This year, though, the bookings are unusually strong and the bank balance is low, so the maintenance is going to have to wait.</p>
<p>Instead of a Dry January, we have decided to offer our own antidote this month to any creeping gloom. We are staging the first of our ‘meet-the-producers’ events in the pub with the local <a>Black Cow vodka distillery</a>. </p>
<a>The Fox</a> and have, since last spring, been giving us somewhere to serve food outdoors even on the coldest of nights.
<p>Without the mutual support of other local businesses down here in west Dorset, mine and many others might well have gone under in this storm we are living through.</p>
<p>Plenty has been said – much of it prematurely, as it turns out – about the many ways in which Covid will leave us changed when it finally relinquishes its grip. </p>
<p>So, as long as I continue with my new habit of not listening to the news, I am anticipating the best of all worlds is round the next corner. What other choice have we got?</p>
<p>As told to <a>Peter Stanford</a></p>
