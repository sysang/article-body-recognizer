<p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban didn’t take the Afghan capital — they were invited, says the man who issued the invitation.</p>
<p>Karzai, who was the country’s president for 13 years after the Taliban were first ousted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, refused to leave.</p>
<p>The countdown to a possible deal began Aug. 14, the day before the Taliban came to power. </p>
<p>Early on the morning of Aug. 15, Karzai said, he waited to draw up the list. The capital was fidgety, on edge. Rumors were swirling about a Taliban takeover. Karzai called Doha. He was told the Taliban would not enter the city.</p>
<p>Karzai was adamant that there would have been an agreement for a peaceful transition had Ghani remained in Kabul.</p>
<p>He added: “An end to that can only come when Afghans get together, find their own way out.”</p>
<p>The former president has a plan. In his talks with the Taliban, he is advocating the temporary resurrection of the constitution that governed when Afghanistan was a monarchy. The idea was also floated during earlier Doha talks. </p>
<p>At the same time, a traditional Loya Jirga — a grand council of all Afghans, including women — would be convened. It would decide the country’s future, including a representative government, a constitution, a national flag. </p>
<p>But until it happens, Karzai says, the world has to engage with the Taliban. Afghanistan needs to operate. Government servants have to be paid. Health care facilities need to function.</p>
<p>Asked to describe the Taliban, Karzai said: “I would describe them as Afghans, but Afghans who have gone through a very difficult period in their lives as all other Afghans have done for the past 40 years.”</p>
<p>Kathy Gannon, Associated Press news director for Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been covering the region for more than 30 years.</p>
<div><div><h1>The AP Interview: CDC chief says omicron mostly mild so far</h1></div><div>By MIKE STOBBEDecember 29, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>She said “the disease is mild” in almost all of the cases seen so far, with reported symptoms mainly cough, congestion and fatigue. One person was hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, CDC officials said.</p>
<p>The omicron variant was <a>first identified in South Africa</a> last month and has since been reported in 57 countries, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The first U.S. case was reported on Dec. 1. As of Wednesday afternoon, the CDC had recorded 43 cases in 19 states. Most were young adults. About a third of those patients had traveled internationally.</p>
<p>Fewer than 1% of the U.S. COVID-19 cases genetically sequenced last week were the omicron variant; <a>the delta variant</a> accounted for more than 99%.</p>
<p>Scientists are trying to better understand <a>how easily it spreads</a>. British officials said Wednesday that they think the omicron variant could become the dominant version of the coronavirus <a>in the United Kingdom</a> in as soon as a month.</p>
<p>The CDC has yet to make any projections on how the variant could affect the course of the pandemic in the U.S. Walensky said officials are gathering data but many factors could influence how the pandemic evolves.</p>
<p>Another key question is whether it is better at evading vaccines or the immunity people build from a bout with COVID-19.</p>
<p>This week, scientists in South Africa reported a small laboratory study that found antibodies created by vaccines were not as effective at preventing omicron infections as they were at stopping other versions of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, vaccine manufacturer Pfizer said that while two doses may not be protective enough to prevent infection, lab tests showed a <a>booster increased levels</a> of virus-fighting antibodies by 25-fold.</p>
<p>Blood samples taken a month after a booster showed people harbored levels of omicron-neutralizing antibodies that were similar to amounts proven protective against earlier variants after two doses, the company said.</p>

<div><div><h1>The AP Interview: Japanese tourist says space trip ‘amazing’</h1></div><div>By HARRIET MORRIS and VLADIMIR ISACHENKOVDecember 29, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MOSCOW (AP) — A Japanese space tourist on Monday rejected criticism from those who questioned his decision to pay a fortune for a trip to the International Space Station, saying the “amazing” experience was worth it.</p>
<p>Maezawa deflected the criticism from those who questioned his decision to spend money on his space travel instead of using it to help people back on Earth, saying that “those who criticize are perhaps those who have never been to space.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Tech founder out after antisemitic, anti-vaccine screed</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Rabbi wounded in synagogue shooting sentenced for fraud</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Fire reignites at South Africa's Parliament in Cape Town</h4></a></div></li>
<p>“The most memorable moments were when I saw the International Space Station from Soyuz just before the docking and when we entered after the docking,” he said.</p>
<p>He admitted that space tourism is mostly for the super-rich now, but added that those who embark on space travel must be prepared for other challenges.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that taking a nap still presents a challenge.</p>
<p> “I am not sleeping well, to be honest. A sleeping bag has been provided but it is too hot so I am not using it,” he said.</p>
<p>He was happy with the length of his trip.</p>
<p>“Twelve days was about right for me,” Maezawa added. “I am getting over the motion sickness so I can enjoy the remaining days. I am returning on the 20th and starting to miss Japan. Once I return, I want to have sushi!”</p>
<p>Maezawa and Hirano, who was filming his mission, blasted off for the International Space Station on Wednesday in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.</p>
<p>Space Adventures, a Virginia-based company that organized his flight, had previously sent seven other tourists to the space station in 2001-2009. </p>
<p>He and Hirano will be returning to Earth with Misurkin on Sunday.</p>
<p>Before the flight, Maezawa had compiled a list of 100 things to do in space during his mission after asking the public for ideas. </p>
<p>“I am looking forward to doing some sports inside the space station – badminton, table tennis and golf,” he told the AP. “What I am not looking forward to that much is toilet-related stuff. ”</p>
<p>Maezawa made his fortune in retail fashion, launching Japan’s largest online fashion mall, Zozotown. Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>The tycoon has also booked a flyby around the moon aboard Elon Musk’s Starship, which is tentatively scheduled in the next few years. He’ll be joined on that trip by eight contest winners.</p>
<p>“I am planning to go to the moon in 2023 – we are in the final stages of selecting the 8 people for the Dear Moon project,” he said. </p>
<div><div><h1>Democrat-led New Mexico delves into political redistricting</h1></div><div>By MORGAN LEEDecember 6, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Efforts to draw new political maps in New Mexico began in earnest Monday as a Democrat-led Legislature convened a special legislative session on redistricting.</p>
<p>Map recommendations have been provided to legislators by a citizens’ advisory panel under a hybrid redistricting system. Legislators can adopt, modify or discard the suggested maps and start from scratch.</p>
<p>“You would strip representation from people that I represent, many of whom are Hispanic, simply because it benefits you at the ballot box,” Candelaria said.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham holds veto authority over the redistricting process. It’s the first time in 30 years that the process is being overseen by both a Democratic governor and Democratic majorities in the Legislature.</p>
<p>New Mexico presents unusual challenges in efforts to comply with the U.S. Voting Rights Act and preserve communities of interest and give minority voters a fair shot to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
<p>Boundaries are likely to change significantly for a congressional swing district in southern New Mexico that flipped to Republican control in 2020, amid population growth in a major oil-production region.</p>
<p>Those changes have national implications. Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on climate change, the economy and other issues.</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold two congressional seats out of three for New Mexico.</p>
<p>The special session also is open to proposals for spending roughly $1.1 billion in federal pandemic relief.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court ruled in November that those relief funds must be appropriated by the Legislature and not just the governor.</p>

<p>Strong winds in Los Angeles toppled some trees overnight that fell on homes, cars and powerlines. No injuries were reported. </p>
<p>Nearly 64,000 customers were without power Thursday in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties and more than 150,000 others could have their power cut off, Southern California Edison said.</p>
<p>The critical fire weather conditions also prompted San Diego Gas Electric to cut power to 5,000 customers, the utility said.</p>
<p>Red flag warnings were expected to remain in effect through much of Friday due to predicted strong gusts and very low relative humidity, forecasters said.</p>

<div><div><h1>Cash coming to Tahoe animal center where burned cub escaped</h1></div><div>By SCOTT SONNERNovember 26, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>It was the first escape in the 45-year-history of the center in South Lake Tahoe, California.</p>
<p>Two days later, volunteers spotted and photographed a cub clinging to a tree 40 feet (12 meters) up in a nearby forest. They became convinced it was the 6-month-old escapee, decided to leave him alone and now believe he’s doing just fine.</p>
<p>The contribution the Bentley Foundation and MH Buckeye announced this week may just be the happy ending they’ve been looking for.</p>
<p>“We’ve turned the corner,” center spokesman Greg Erfani told The Associated Press. As of Wednesday, they were only $180,000 short of the $1.05 million needed to begin construction in the spring and finish by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“It’s going to build the first animal hospital in the Lake Tahoe area,” he said.</p>
<p>Erfani said supply-chain challenges have delayed immediate repairs but the center should be fully up and running by next month, bears and all.</p>
<p>The tale of his rescue-turned-escape began July 26 when a homeowner in Markleeville, California, spotted the cub crawling on his knees because his paws were so badly burned. </p>
<p>Photos of the bandaged black bear at the rescue center flooded social media and drew mention in international news coverage of the devastating fire that forced thousands of evacuations.</p>
<p>The center announced his escape Aug. 3, warning anyone who spotted him to stay away and report sightings to wildlife officials.</p>
<p>Another flurry of publicity followed, less flattering than before.</p>
<p>“We got lambasted on social media. People were being nasty,” Erfani recalled. “It was very emotional for us because we had connections with him. A lot of people were really upset.”</p>
<p>It paid off with the sighting of the cub clinging to the tree.</p>
<p>“We could tell he had all the same markings. But he appeared safe, and once released into the wild, we don’t bring them back,” he said.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t happy being contained, pacing a lot. So, when we got him to a point where he could climb, that’s all he really needed. Once he got that defense ... his instincts kick in.”</p>
<p>Tamarack wasn’t like older bears who — because of issues including drought-driven food shortages — abandon the woods to rummage through garbage and sometimes break into Lake Tahoe homes.</p>
<p>“They become ‘urban’ bears,” Erfani said. “Until the fire, (Tamarack) was from the backcountry, out in the wild. He never saw a house, never saw a car.”</p>
<p>“We like to believe he’s out there now in the wild, living the bear’s life.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Utilities restoring power as Southern California winds ease</h1></div><div>November 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Santa Ana winds declined in strength across Southern California on Friday and utilities restored power to thousands of customers whose electricity was shut off to prevent wildfires.</p>
<p>The seasonal dry winds produced fierce gusts on Thanksgiving Day, toppling trees and causing other damage while “public safety power shutoffs” in high-risk areas interrupted traditional dinners.</p>
<p>Winds shredded material covering a big dome built in Burbank as a studio for developing entertainment content to be used in Las Vegas productions.</p>
<p>One location in Los Angeles County had an 89 mph (143 kph) gust early Thursday, but the National Weather Service said winds Friday were not nearly as strong.</p>
<p>No major wildfires were reported during the peak of the winds.</p>
<p>By afternoon, Southern California Edison’s website showed the number of customers still without power was down to about 21,000 but power was entirely restored by nightfall. San Diego Gas Electric restored power to about 1,100 customers.</p>
<p> Benign weather was predicted through the weekend.</p>
<p>“There will be a few puffs of wind each morning Saturday and Sunday but nothing near advisory levels,” the weather service said.</p>

<p>PILOT MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — Fire crews in North Carolina are working to control a fire in Pilot Mountain State Park that has already burned hundreds of acres.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the N.C. Forest Service announced Monday a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits statewide until further notice.</p>
<p>The fire that covered about 300 acres Monday grew by about 75 acres overnight, North Carolina Forestry Service spokeswoman Christie Adams said by telephone. </p>
<p>A team was expected to arrive Monday to take over management of the fire, Adams said. There were about 30 to 40 people involved in the fight Monday morning, she said. </p>
<p>“The fire is not contained, but it’s well within the containment lines,” Adams said. No structures are threatened, she said.</p>
<p>The fire was first reported Saturday evening in the area of the Three Bear Gully Trail. The cause hasn’t been determined, Adams said. </p>
<p>The North Carolina State Parks and Recreation Department has said the park likely will be closed all week. The park northwest of Winston-Salem is known for its iconic knob that rises about 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain.</p>

<p>PILOT MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — A wildfire at North Carolina’s Pilot Mountain State Park had grown to more than 1,000 acres (400 hectares) by Tuesday afternoon, twice its size of a day earlier, authoritiess said. </p>
<p>Officials said the blaze, which has burned more than 1,050 acres on Pilot Mountain, is about 20% contained and is burning only inside the park, news outlets reported. </p>
<p>Compounding the situation is that the area has received only 0.3 inches of rain in November with no significant prospect for precipitation for the rest of the week. Average rainfall for November is 3 inches (7.6 cm)</p>
<p>N.C. Forest Service officials believe the fire, which started near a trail on Saturday, was caused by human activity, according to Jimmy Holt, forest service ranger for Guilford County.</p>
<p>He said law enforcement will investigate to determine what sparked the blaze. The park remains closed.</p>
<p>Officials issued a statewide outdoor burning ban Monday, citing dry conditions across the state.</p>
<div><div><h1>Wind-pushed fires force evacuations, burn homes in Montana</h1></div><div>December 2, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Fergus County Sheriff’s Office evacuated the approximately 300 residents of Denton and the Red Cross had a shelter set up at the Civic Center in Lewistown. Denton schools reported evacuating students at about 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The size of the fire was not available, officials said.</p>
<p>South of Great Falls, a fire that was reported at about 2:40 a.m. was pushed so quickly by strong winds that it skipped over some patches of grass as it spread to burn 112 acres (46 hectares), Great Falls Fire Rescue Chief Jeremy Jones said.</p>
<p>“At this point we’ve lost 11 houses, seven garages and 11 outbuildings,” Jones told the Great Falls Tribune. “That doesn’t even begin to count the vehicles and things of that nature.”</p>
<p>About 65 people evacuated. No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire has not been determined.</p>
<p>Tribal offices were also closed and about 100 people in the community of Blackfoot evacuated, with a shelter set up at Browning Middle School, officials said. </p>
<p>The fire burned up to 3/4 of a square mile (2 square kilometers) and its cause was unknown, Carter Gallineaux with Blackfeet Fire Management told the Great Falls Tribune.</p>
<p>The fire started at about 4:20 a.m. and was declared contained at around 11 a.m., <a>Montana Right Now</a> reported. </p>

<div><div><h1>Wildfire destroys 24 houses in central Montana town</h1></div><div>By AMY BETH HANSONDecember 2, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The fire started late Tuesday north of the town of Stanford and it was not initially considered a threat to Denton.</p>
<p>Crews had the fire “pretty well put out other than hot spots” by daylight Wednesday, said Brock Linker, a volunteer firefighter. “Pretty much the same time the sun came out the wind started blowing really, really hard.” </p>
<p>The fire flared up again.</p>
<p>“The dirt and the smoke were blowing so bad you couldn’t even see the flames and we didn’t even know where the fire was a lot of the time when it was out in the prairie,” Linker said Thursday. </p>
<p>Linker was working near a house close to where the fire had started at midday Wednesday when he got a call saying the fire had moved into Denton after having traveled across at least 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) of drought-stricken land.</p>
<p>The grain elevators near the railroad tracks caught fire first, said Undersheriff Tracy Lewellyn.</p>
<p>“The south side is where it really ripped through the houses, all the buildings in town, pretty much straight in line east of town from the elevators,” Linker said.</p>
<p>The power outage due to the downed power lines that sparked the fire shut off water pumps, leaving the town without water, officials said.</p>
<p>The evacuation order was lifted at noon Thursday, Lewellyn said. Only essential traffic was being allowed in the area and some residences that survived the fire were still without power. </p>
<p>Crews were using skid steers, backhoes and excavators to turn over debris and put out hot spots in town, Linker said.</p>
<p>Montana Highway 81 west of Denton was closed because a bridge was destroyed by the fire. A railroad bridge in the same area was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Highway 81 is one of only two ways in and out of Denton on a paved road, Linker said.</p>
<p>Other fires have been burning in Montana in recent days as gusty winds fanned the flames amid drought and unseasonably warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Areas of Montana east of the Continental Divide have had down-sloping west winds for about a week, the National Weather Service said.</p>
<p>With such winds, the air warms and wind speeds increase as the air moves down the slope of the Rocky Mountains, said Cody Moldan, a meteorologist in Great Falls.</p>
<p>Several areas of the state saw record wind gusts on Wednesday and the town of Jordan in central Montana reached a high temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit (26 Celsius).</p>
<p>Central Montana is among several areas of Montana that are experiencing exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. </p>
<p>Other fires that burned in Montana on Wednesday included one south of the city of Great Falls that burned 11 homes and seven garages along with sheds and vehicles. About 65 people evacuated, Cascade County officials said.</p>
<p>There were two grass fires near Browning, where there were also power outages because the wind was knocking trees into power lines, officials said.</p>

<p>U.S. Army Pfc. Morris E. Swackhammer, 20, of Binghamton was accounted for June 28, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. His family only recently received a full briefing on his identification.</p>
<p>Swackhammer was hit by German machine gun fire on Nov. 22, 1944 in woods northwest of the village of Fraize in France’s Alsace region. His squad had to leave his body behind in the face of the enemy attack.</p>
<p>U.S. personnel in 1945 recovered an unidentified body from a cemetery in Fraize they thought could have belonged to Swackhammer, but they could not confirm it. </p>
<p>Swackhammer was identified by scientists who relied on DNA, dental and anthropological analyses. </p>
<p>He will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia at a date to be determined.</p>

<p>PHOENIX (AP) — The Tonto National Forest has received funding to pay for replacing dozens of miles of fencing damaged or destroyed in grazing areas by a massive wildfire in east-central Arizona last summer.</p>
<p>Forest officials announced Tuesday that the funding for fencing repairs needed because of the Telegraph Fire near the town of Superior comes from a program that normally focuses on mitigating post-wildfire flooding on federal lands.</p>
<p>According to forest officials, the fencing work will be performed under a pilot program authorizing repairs of minor facilities and infrastructure damaged or destroyed by wildfires.</p>
<p>Range workers identified 66 miles (106 kilometers) of grazing allotment boundary fencing damaged and over 61 miles (98 kilometers) of interior pasture fencing destroyed, forest officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>The fire also destroyed numerous homes and other structures and its cause is still under investigation.</p>
<div><div><h1>Father, son arrested in wildfire that threatened Lake Tahoe</h1></div><div>By DON THOMPSONDecember 9, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>David Scott Smith, 66, and his son, Travis Shane Smith, 32, are accused of reckless arson in a warrant issued before formal charges are filed, the El Dorado County District Attorney’s office said.</p>
<p>Mark Reichel, the attorney for both men, said they were arrested Wednesday afternoon and that reckless arson means starting a blaze by accident but “to such a degree that it was considered reckless.”</p>
<p>The fire destroyed more than 1,000 homes and other buildings while crossing a mostly remote forested area of seasonal cabins.</p>
<p>It was one of two massive fires last summer that for the first time in modern history crossed the Sierra Nevada range.</p>
<p>El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson provided few details about the arrest of the Smiths, citing the investigation. </p>
<p>Reichel, the men’s lawyer, said: “They are absolutely 100% innocent.” </p>
<p>Reichel said he did not know details of the accusation, such as how authorities allege the fire was set.</p>
<p>He said Travis Smith is an electrician and was with his father near where the fire started. The son called 911 to report seeing flames, Reichel said.</p>
<p>The son made several 911 calls because the calls kept dropping in the rugged area, and both men also warned campers about the fire, Reichel said.</p>
<p>“Neither one has ever been in trouble with the law in their life. They’re very law-abiding people,” he said.</p>
<p>The pair have a scheduled court appearance on Friday, Reichel said.</p>
<p>The district attorney’s office said the case was developed with the U.S. Forest Service, California’s firefighting agency and the California Department of Justice, with help from the Sacramento County District Attorney’s crime lab.</p>

<div><div><h1>3 men face arson charges after fires burned 13 homes</h1></div><div>By AMY BETH HANSONDecember 9, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Galvinn Coates Munson, Brandon Cordell Bennett Jr., and Jevin James McLean were charged Wednesday with arson by accountability or an alternative charge of negligent arson by accountability.</p>
<p>Home surveillance video of a car seen in the area where the fires started, tips from the public and videos of the fires briefly posted on social media helped lead to the arrests, Slaughter said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Justice of the Peace Dave Grubich set bail at $100,000 for Munson, who was out on bail at the time of the fires after being charged earlier this year in a rape that reportedly happened in July 2019. Munson has pleaded not guilty to the rape charge.</p>

<p>Bail was set at $50,000 each for Bennett, 18, and McLean, 19. All are subject to GPS monitoring if they are released, County Attorney Josh Racki said Thursday.</p>
<p>None of the men entered a plea and all requested public defenders, but attorneys have not been appointed, Racki said. The men remained jailed Thursday,</p>
<p>A short time later, Munson asked McLean to pull the car over again and Munson used a lighter to set another fire, his co-defendants said, according to charging documents.</p>
<p>Bennett and McLean acknowledged taking cellphone video of Munson starting the fires using the Snapchat app, investigators said. </p>
<p>The men went home without reporting the fires, prosecutors said. The fire also burned 16 outbuildings, numerous vehicles and other property, court records said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Father, son charged with starting wildfire plead not guilty </h1></div><div>December 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges, said Emily Idleman, assistant to the chief of investigations in the district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>The men were arrested Wednesday and remain in El Dorado County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail each. A bail reduction hearing is scheduled for Monday. </p>
<p>Five people were injured and about 1,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed.</p>
<p>The complaints said both men illegally possessed a firearm silencer between Aug. 11 and Sept. 23 and that Travis Smith converted or manufactured a machine gun between Aug. 9 and Aug. 14. </p>
<p>Mark Reichel, the attorney for both men, said previously that the two were near where the fire started and called 911 to report flames. </p>
<p>The Caldor Fire scorched more than 346 square miles (900 square kilometers) from east of Sacramento to the Nevada border, threatening ski resorts and other prominent recreational areas.</p>

<p>LAWTON, Okla. (AP) — A grass fire in southwestern Oklahoma that forced evacuations was about 95 percent contained by Friday evening, emergency officials said.</p>
<p>Some roadways in the area were also closed due to smoke, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>Hawkins said they don’t yet have an estimate on the number of structures damaged. </p>
<p>The cause of the blaze was also unknown, Hawkins said.</p>
<p>“We probably won’t know what started it, it could be something as simple as someone throwing out a cigarette butt,” Hawkins said.</p>
<p>Winds were gusting to 25 mph (40 kph) in the area, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>The weather service had issued a warning that weather conditions in the area were producing an increased risk of fire danger. </p>

<p>Visitors were warned to bring their own food and water since none is available in the grove.</p>
<p>The Giant Forest includes the General Sherman tree, the largest living thing on earth by volume. The grove had been closed since mid-September, when a fire complex caused by lightning tore through the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>The measures helped save the Giant Forest but they couldn’t be deployed everywhere.</p>

<p>PINNACLE, N.C. (AP) — Nearly all of a northwestern North Carolina state park is reopening after a wildfire burned over 1,000 acres before it was contained earlier this month. </p>
<p>The Yadkin River section of Pilot Mountain State Park reopened Saturday. Most of the rest of the park will be accessible to visitors starting Monday, the Winston-Salem Journal reported.</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Trail will remain closed until a protective fence damaged by the fire can be rebuilt, North Carolina State Parks spokeswoman Katie Hall said. </p>
<p>The fire began Thanksgiving weekend due to an escaped campfire and ultimately covered about half of the park, officials said. </p>
<p>The N.C. Forest Service reported the fire was fully contained on Dec. 4, but firefighters remained onsite to remove dead trees that could fuel flare-ups. Park workers are now managing the remnants.</p>
<p>“There are a few smoldering spots that our staff is still monitoring,” Hall said. It has cost $513,000 to fight the fire, according to a report from the National Interagency Coordination Center.</p>

<p>LAWTON, Okla. (AP) — A wildfire that forced evacuations in rural southwestern Oklahoma last week destroyed five homes, 14 barns and nine vehicles, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>Three of the burned homes were unoccupied, said Comanche County Emergency Management spokeswoman Amy Hawkins.</p>
<p>The fire, which started Friday, burned about 2.3 square miles (6 square kilometers) just east of Lawton, Hawkins said. As the fire burned Friday, winds gusted to 25 mph (40 kph) in the area, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Hawkins said there were no deaths or injuries from the fire.</p>
<p>The fire was 95 percent contained by Friday evening and 100 percent contained Monday, she said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>
<p>About 1,310 residents were evacuated from around the community of Pumpkin Center, Hawkins said. More than 130 people from over 30 agencies helped combat the fire.</p>

<p>The World Meteorological Organization said the temperature “more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic” was registered on June 20, 2020, during a heat wave that swept across Siberia and stretched north of the Arctic Circle. </p>
<p>Average temperatures were up to 10 degrees Celsius more than usual in Arctic Siberia, playing a key role in forest fires, loss of sea ice and global temperature rises that made 2020 one of the three hottest years on record.</p>
<p>“This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement. </p>
<p>Verkhoyansk is about 115 kilometers (70 miles) north of the Arctic Circle and a meteorological station there has been observing temperatures since 1885, WMO said. </p>

<div><div><h1>Father, son blamed for California wildfire out on lower bail</h1></div><div>December 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Smiths were arrested Dec. 8 and charged in El Dorado County with recklessly starting a fire and illegal possession of a silencer. Travis Smith is also charged with illegal conversion or manufacture of a machine gun. </p>
<p>“They’re very happy to be out,” Reichel said. “They weren’t very happy to be arrested.” </p>
<p>Prosecutor Nora Hall argued that potential prison sentences — at least a dozen years for each man — made them potential flight risks and that Shane Smith’s social media posts indicated a lack of concern for proper firearms safety. </p>
<p>But El Dorado Superior Court Judge Ralph Marks said a bail reduction was warranted because there was no evidence the men acted maliciously or with intent. The charges also did not indicate they posed a danger to the community, the judge said. </p>
<p>Reichel and Linda Parisi, attorney for the elder Smith, said the men were in the area where the fire sparked and called 911 to report flames. </p>
<p>The criminal complaints do not specify how the machine gun and silencer tie into the Caldor Fire, and the DA’s office has not offered an explanation. It declined on Tuesday to release additional statements about the case.</p>
<p>The fire crossed three Northern California counties, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate the resort town of South Lake Tahoe and surrounding areas before it was contained in October.</p>

<div><div><h1>Powerful storm drenches Southern California with heavy rain</h1></div><div>By JOHN ANTCZAK and JANIE HARDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The National Weather Service reported remarkable rainfall in several parts of the state. </p>
<p>“The circumstances surrounding these three separate vehicles and their journey down the LA River remain unclear,” a Fire Department statement said.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to get stuff done so I don’t have to be on the roads any more,” he said.</p>
<p>The powerful system is a so-called atmospheric river that sucks up moisture from Pacific Ocean and dumps it at lower elevations as rain and in the mountains as snow. </p>
<p>Residents near the Alisal Fire burn scar in California’s Santa Barbara County were ordered Monday to evacuate over concerns that heavy rains might cause flooding and debris flows. The order was lifted Tuesday afternoon. </p>
<p>In Orange County, south of Los Angeles, about 800 canyon homes were under evacuation orders Tuesday after a flash flood warning was issued in the area scorched by a 2020 wildfire. </p>
<p>After a cloudburst calmed to a drizzle, Lori Bright leaped a puddle in LA’s Highland Park neighborhood, determined to get her daily steps in despite the soggy weather. </p>
<p>“There’s a lull, so I decided to go for it,” Bright said. “I don’t really mind getting wet. Just happy to have any rain.”</p>
<p>She crossed her fingers in hopes that the deluge might make a dent in the state’s drought. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center, said the storm won’t be a drought-buster, but water watchers are excited about all of the snow it’s dumping in the Sierra Nevada. </p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California regulators approved a settlement Thursday placing more than half a billion dollars in fines and penalties on the utility Southern California Edison for its role in five wildfires in 2017 and 2018. </p>
<p>Investigations found utility equipment sparked the fires.</p>
<p>Southern California Edison reached the settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission’s safety and enforcement division; it was then approved by the five-member commission.</p>

<p>California has seen increasingly destructive wildfires in recent years, made worse by climate change and drought. Utility equipment has been blamed for sparking some the state’s worst fires.</p>
<p>Southern California Edison serves 15 million customers and is one of the state’s three major investor-owned utilities. In signing the agreement, the utility is not admitting any fault. </p>
<p>SCE spokesman Ben Gallagher called the settlement “fair and reasonable.”</p>
<p>He said it “puts one additional uncertainty behind us as the utility continues to implement its comprehensive wildfire risk mitigation measures.”</p>
<p>Safety measures, to which the utility must put $65 million of shareholder money, include things like system enhancements, community engagement and contributions to fire safety-focused nonprofits, according to the agreement. </p>

<div><div><h1>Fires remain a concern across Kansas after strong wind storm</h1></div><div>By MARGARET STAFFORDDecember 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Fires that erupted across Kansas continued to burn Thursday as the state responded to a wind-whipped storm that also churned up dust and reduced visibility for drivers, causing three fatalities.</p>
<p>The storm system on Wednesday carried winds that reached up to 90 mph in some areas. The winds combined with low humidity and dry vegetation and grasses to fuel fires in parts of western and central Kansas.</p>
<p>The dust reduced visibility on roads across the state, causing three fatalities, 20 injury accidents and 51 non-injury accidents, the Kansas Highway Patrol said.</p>
<p>Numerous homes, outbuildings and other structures were destroyed but no fatalities were reported by Thursday afternoon. The fires also killed an unknown number of cattle and horses, officials said. </p>
<p>Most of the state was under an enhanced, significant or critical fire outlook, state officials said. </p>
<p>Russell County Administrator John Fletcher said the fires burned between 200 and 250 square miles in the county and caused millions of dollars in damage, KAKE-TV reported. Between between seven and 10 houses and structures were destroyed.</p>
<p>She said some of the fires were in remote areas that were up to 10 miles apart. </p>
<p>“We can’t get to them because of the distance and because, frankly, we don’t have the resources to get there,” she said. </p>
<p>Kansas deployed helicopters and other firefighting equipment from the Kansas Army National Guard and the Kansas Forest Service to western and central counties to help with fire suppression efforts. </p>
<p>Gov. Laura Kelly declared a state of emergency because of the elevated danger of wildfires Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Hartman said it will take several days to completely extinguish all the fires.</p>
<p>The three fatalities in two separate accidents in southwest Kansas were “definitely” caused by low visibility from blowing dust, trooper Mike Racy said Thursday. </p>
<p>Two people died in Grant County after multiple vehicles collided. Racy said investigators were trying to determine what happened. </p>
<div><div><h1>2 dead in Kansas wildfires fueled by windy, dry weather</h1></div><div>By MARGARET STAFFORDDecember 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Two men have died from injuries suffered in wildfires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres across Kansas this week, authorities said Friday. </p>
<p>The Ellis County sheriff’s office said Friday that the remains of Derrick Kelley, 36, were found near his burned vehicle in a rural area of the county. The coroner identified the remains, the sheriff’s office said.</p>
<p>Kelley was last seen in Hays on Wednesday, shortly before his fiancee reported him missing. The sheriff’s office said he was believed to be driving on county roads toward Natoma. </p>
<p>In the small town of Paradise in Russell County, one family was counting its blessings but also mourning the loss of their home and cows. </p>
<p>His wife escaped before their home was destroyed, and the family’s grain elevator business was also spared, said Caity Thompson, a teacher in Jetmore who returned home when she heard about the fire.</p>
<p>“We fought fire and winds 50 miles an hour before, but nothing like maybe 100 miles an hour. So we just kind of did what we could,” he said. “As far as damage, I mean I guess catastrophic would be the right word.”</p>
<p>Several smaller fires across the state were contained by Friday and crews were monitoring them to prevent reignitions, said Shawna Hartman, spokeswoman for the Kansas Forest Service. </p>
<p>But several larger fires were still burning , some in areas that were inaccessible to ground crews, she said. Officials were using helicopters to dump water on those fires, in an attempt to knock back the flames and heat and allow ground crews in. </p>
<p>It will take several days to determine how many acres burned and to completely contain the blazes and make the areas safe, she said.</p>

<div><div><h1>Fauci says Fox’s Watters should be fired for comments on him</h1></div><div>By DAVID BAUDERDecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News defended Jesse Watters on Tuesday after he used the phrase “kill shot” in a speech urging young conservatives to confront Dr. Anthony Fauci in public with a hostile interview.</p>
<p>Fauci, asked about it on CNN, said that Watters should be fired “on the spot” but predicted he wouldn’t be held accountable for his language.</p>
<p>Fox said Watters’ words had been “twisted completely out of context.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<p>“Now you go in for the kill shot, the kill shot with an ambush, deadly, because he doesn’t see it coming,” Watters said.</p>
<p>He suggested an interviewer say, “you know why people don’t trust you, don’t you?′ Oh, he is dead. He’s dead. He’s done.”</p>
<p>The interviewer should make sure the encounter is filmed and the footage given to conservative media, Watters said. It’s a confrontation technique that has been used elsewhere in conservative politics by the group Project Veritas.</p>
<p>“Just make sure it’s legal,” Watters said.</p>
<p>A partial clip of Watters’ speech, beginning with the “kill shot” quote, spread around the internet, with some commentators suggesting that he had advocated assassinating Fauci.</p>
<p>Fauci noted that for two years, he’s been encouraging people to protect themselves against COVID-19 by practicing good public health practices and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Fauci, in a “60 Minutes” interview in October, discussed death threats he had received and his need for a security detail.</p>
<p>Watters’ reference to “kill shot,” however, baffled some people in television news.</p>
<p>Last month on Fox, Tucker Carlson compared Fauci to Italian World War II dictator Benito Mussolini, while Lara Logan said Fauci, to some people, represented Josef Mengele, the Nazi death doctor.</p>
<p>Fox has not commented on the statements that Carlson and Logan made about Fauci. Logan, a contributor to the Fox Nation streaming service who had appeared as a commentator on the television network, hasn’t been on since.</p>

<div><div><h1>Maxwell trial jury finishes first full day of deliberations</h1></div><div>By TOM HAYSDecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The jury had begun deliberating late Monday, working less than an hour before going home after closing arguments consumed most of the day.</p>
<a>sexual abuse of teenage girls </a> from 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors say she recruited and groomed the girls, making them feel that sexualized massages of Epstein were normal behavior.
<p>Maxwell’s lawyers say the government has used her as a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in 2019 as he awaited his own sex trafficking trial.</p>
<p>She also said Epstein climbed into bed with her and pressed himself against her before she fled to a bathroom until he left her room.</p>
<p>Maxwell has been held without bail since her July 2020 arrest.</p>
<p>This story has been corrected to show that Maxwell was arrested in 2020, not 2019.</p>
<div><div><h1>Hubble telescope’s bigger, more powerful successor to soar</h1></div><div>By MARCIA DUNNDecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The Hubble Space Telescope’s successor is a time-traveling wonder capable of peering back to within a hair’s breadth of the dawn of the universe. And it’s finally on the brink of flight.</p>
<p>It will be the biggest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever to leave the planet, elaborate in its design and ambitious in its scope. At a budget-busting $10 billion, it is the most expensive and also the trickiest, by far, to pull off.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s worth taking risks. That’s why it’s worth the agony and the sleepless nights,” NASA’s science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said he’s more nervous now than when he launched on space shuttle Columbia in 1986.</p>

<p>“There are over 300 things, any one of which goes wrong, it is not a good day,” Nelson told the AP. “So the whole thing has got to work perfectly.”</p>
<p>Liftoff from the coast of French Guiana in South America was set for Friday but has been postponed for at least a day, until Christmas at the earliest, because of high wind. </p>
<p>Named after the man who led NASA during the space-trailblazing 1960s, the 7-ton James Webb Space Telescope is 100 times more powerful than Hubble.</p>
<p>The <a>31-year-old Hubble</a> — increasingly creaky but still churning out celestial glamour shots — focuses on visible and ultraviolet light, with just a smattering of infrared light.</p>
<p>NASA has never attempted such a complicated series of steps remotely. Many of the mechanisms have no backup, so the failure of any of 344 such parts could doom the mission.</p>
<p>Webb will be too far away for a rescue mission by NASA and its European and Canadian partners.</p>
<p>To avoid a repeat of the Hubble fiasco, Zurbuchen ordered an overhaul of Webb after joining NASA in 2016, 20 years into development. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor.</p>
<p>The sunshield ripped during a practice unfurling. Tension cables for the shade had too much slack. Dozens of fasteners fell off in a vibration test. All this and more led to more investigations, more delays and more costs.</p>
<p>The problems continued even after Webb’s arrival at the South American launch site in October. A clamp came loose and jolted the telescope. A communication relay between the telescope and rocket malfunctioned.</p>
<p>It will take another five months for chilling and checking of Webb’s infrared instruments before it can get to work by the end of June.</p>
<p>The <a> Space Telescope Science Institute</a> in Baltimore operates Hubble and will also oversee Webb. At least five to 10 years of observing are planned.</p>
<p>His colleague, Christine Chen, who will focus on budding solar systems, finds serendipity “perhaps the most exciting aspect” of Webb. “The universe is more weird and wonderful than astronomers can imagine.”</p>

<li><div><a><h4>German watchdog puts Google under closer antitrust scrutiny</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Will Elizabeth Holmes' conviction sober up Silicon Valley?</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Elizabeth Holmes saga still has some loose ends to resolve</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Tech founder out after antisemitic, anti-vaccine screed</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Balwani, whose lawyer adamantly denied Holmes’ accusations, is facing similar fraud charges in a separate trial scheduled to begin in February. </p>
<p>At its height, privately held Theranos was valued at $9 billion, with half of that paper wealth belonging to Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford University in 2003 to start the company when she was just 19.</p>
<p>It all came crashing down in 2015 and 2016 when revelations about Theranos’ testing flaws emerged in a series of articles in The Wall Street Journal and the findings of an audit by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department filed its charges against Holmes nearly three and a half years ago, but the trial was delayed by the pandemic and then by Holmes’ pregnancy.</p>
<p>The case can also be seen as a warning shot aimed at the zeitgeist in Silicon Valley, where ambitious young entrepreneurs often get lost in their own hubris and hyperbole as they pursue fame and fortune.</p>
<div><div><h1>AP sources: NHL to withdraw from Olympics after COVID surge</h1></div><div>By JOHN WAWROW and STEPHEN WHYNODecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The NHL is not sending players to the Beijing Olympics over concerns that the pandemic will disrupt the league’s ability to complete a full season.</p>
<p>The people spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity because an announcement had yet to be made. An announcement was expected Wednesday.</p>
<p>A week ago, the NHL attempted to halt the spread of the omicron variant by reintroducing more restrictive COVID-19 protocols, which included daily testing and limiting player gatherings, especially on the road.</p>
<p>The decision comes long before the league faced a Jan. 10 deadline to pull out without financial penalty. As a result, the men’s Olympic hockey tournament will go on without NHL players for the second consecutive time.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, the likely U.S. Olympic starter, expressed displeasure Tuesday with the decision not to go and called the rash of postponements overkill.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby already was bracing for the possibility of the NHL not participating and, at the age of 34, ending what could be his final chance to represent Canada at the Olympics one more time.</p>
<p>While the NHL and NHLPA agreed on Olympic participation last year as part of a collective bargaining agreement extension, the deal to go to Beijing was contingent on pandemic conditions not worsening.</p>
<p>“It’s a thing you’ve been looking forward to for a very long time,” Hedman said. “For us to not be able to go, it’s going to hurt for a while.”</p>
<p>Russia, which won gold at the Pyeongchang Games, immediately becomes the favorite without NHL players leading the Americans thanks to an influx of homegrown talent playing in the Kontintental Hockey League.</p>
<p>McDavid referred to the potential five-week quarantine requirement as “unsettling.”</p>
<p>“I’m still a guy that’s wanting to go play in the Olympics,” McDavid said. “But we also want to make sure it’s safe for everybody. For all the athletes, not just for hockey players.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Mike Sullivan will be missing his first opportunity to serve as coach of the U.S. national team. He had been holding out hope for NHL participation earlier Tuesday.</p>

<div><div><h1>Secret Service: Nearly $100B stolen in pandemic relief funds</h1></div><div>By JENNIFER McDERMOTTDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Nearly $100 billion at minimum has been stolen from COVID-19 relief programs set up to help businesses and people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, the U.S. Secret Service said Tuesday.</p>
<p>While roughly 3% of the $3.4 trillion dispersed, the amount stolen from pandemic benefits programs shows “the sheer size of the pot is enticing to the criminals,” Dotson said.</p>
<p>Most of that figure comes from unemployment fraud. The Labor Department reported about $87 billion in unemployment benefits could have been paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud. </p>

<div><div><h1>US probes potential of drivers playing video games in Teslas</h1></div><div>By TOM KRISHERDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>ATHENS, Ohio (AP) — The U.S. has opened a formal investigation into the potential for Tesla drivers to play video games on a center touch screen while the vehicle is in motion.</p>
<p>In a document posted Wednesday on its website, the agency says the feature, called “Passenger Play,” may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash.</p>
<p>The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers about 580,000 electric cars and SUVs from model years 2017 through 2022.</p>
<p>The NHTSA documents do not list any crashes or injuries caused by the problem.</p>
<p>An investigation can lead to a recall. A message was left early Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.</p>
<p>Curious to see for himself, Patton drove his own 2021 Tesla Model 3 to an empty community college parking lot, activated a game called “Sky Force Reloaded” from a menu and did a few loops.</p>
<p>“I was just dumbfounded that, yes, sure enough, this sophisticated video game came up,” said Patton, a 59-year-old retired broadcast journalist who lives near Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>He tried Solitaire, too, and was able to activate that game while driving. Later, he found he could browse the internet while his car was moving.</p>
<p>Patton, who loves his car and says he has nothing against Tesla, worries that drivers will play games and become dangerously distracted.</p>
<p>“Somebody’s going to get killed,” he said. “It’s absolutely insane.”</p>
<p>So he filed the complaint early last month.</p>
<p>In the Mercedes case, drivers could browse the internet or watch television while the cars were moving. The automaker said it intended to disable the features while the cars are in motion. The issue was corrected by updating a Mercedes server.</p>
<p>Tesla says neither system can drive vehicles and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. </p>
<div><div><h1>Israeli archaeologists find treasures in ancient shipwrecks</h1></div><div>By MOSHE EDRIDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israel Antiquities Authority announced Wednesday the discovery of remnants of two shipwrecks off the Mediterranean coast, replete with a sunken trove of hundreds Roman and medieval silver coins. </p>
<p>They were found during an underwater survey conducted by the IAA’s Marine Archaeology Unit in the past two months, said Jacob Sharvit, head of the unit.</p>
<p>Among the other artifacts recovered from the site near the ancient city of Caesarea were figurines, bells, ceramics, and metal artifacts that once belonged to the ships, such as nails and a shattered iron anchor. </p>
<p>The IAA made its announcement just days ahead of Christmas, and underscored the discovery of a Roman gold ring, its green gemstone carved with the figure of a shepherd carrying a sheep on his shoulders. </p>
<p>Robert Kool, head of the authority’s coin department, called the item “exceptional.”</p>
