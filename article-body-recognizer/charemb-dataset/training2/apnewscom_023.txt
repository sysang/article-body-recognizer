<div><div><h1>Biden urges concern but not alarm in US as omicron rises</h1></div><div>By ZEKE MILLERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>“You can still get COVID, but it’s highly unlikely, very unlikely, that you’ll become seriously ill,” Biden said of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Compared with last year, more Americans are employed, most kids are in classrooms, and instances of death and serious illness are down — precipitously so among the vaccinated.</p>
<p>“We’re in a very different place than we were a year ago,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki when asked if the country had lost control of the virus.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<a>have seen dire warnings</a> about hospitals reaching capacity amid staffing shortages, thousands of holiday flight cancellations in part because crews were ill or in quarantine, and intermittent
<a>reports of school closures</a> because of the more-transmissible variant.
<p>While most schools across the country remain open, Biden took aim at those that have closed, saying he believes they have the money for testing and other safety measures. “I believe schools should remain open,” he said.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said that combined with other therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, 4 million treatments that are effective against the omicron variant would be available by the end of January. </p>
<p>The pills are “a game changer and have the potential to dramatically alter the impact of COVID-19, the impact it’s had on this country and our people,” Biden said.</p>
<p>“On testing, I know this remains frustrating. Believe me it’s frustrating to me, but we’re making improvements,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Pressed when the first tests would reach Americans, Psaki said, “I don’t have an update on that at this point in time.”</p>
<p>White House officials have noted that the spike in testing demand is driven not just by omicron, but by people seeking to travel safely during the holidays and return to school after, and that the shortages are global in nature.</p>

<p>The CDC also maintained that, for people who catch COVID-19, testing is not required to emerge from five days of isolation — despite hints from other federal officials that the agency was reconsidering that.</p>
<p>It similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine, from 10 days to five.</p>
<p>CDC officials previously said the changes were in keeping with evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<a>the new recommendations</a> were crafted and why they were changed amid a spike in cases driven largely by the highly contagious omicron variant. Some also
<a>expressed dismay</a> that the guidelines allowed people to leave isolation without getting tested to see if they were still infectious.
<p>The CDC also took up the question of why it didn’t call for a negative test before people emerge from isolation. </p>
<p>On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci — the White House’s top medical adviser — <a>said the CDC was considering</a> including the negative test as part of its guidance.</p>
<p>It did offer tips for those who have access to the tests and want to check themselves before leaving isolation. </p>
<p>Dr. Eric Topol, the head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, accused the agency of furthering confusion. He agreed that it is appropriate to shorten isolation time, but only with testing.</p>
<p>“We do need to come up with a strategy that limits isolation time, but we don’t want it to be one that’s adding to the spread of the virus and unwittingly leading to the virus circulating,” he said.</p>
<p>The agency acknowledged people weren’t following the longer recommendations: Research suggests only 25% to 30% of people were isolating for a full 10 days under the older guidance, the CDC said. </p>

<div><div><h1>Washington’s new secretary of state mandates vaccines</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — In one of his first acts as Washington secretary of state, Democrat Steve Hobbs has told his some 300 staff to become vaccinated against COVID-19 by Feb. 25, or face losing their jobs. </p>
<p>“I am confident that this will help protect the employees of this office, as well as the citizens that we serve,” Hobbs told the Northwest News Network and other media outlets.</p>
<p>Inslee appointed former longtime lawmaker Hobbs as secretary of state in November after Wyman said she was resigning to take a top election security post with the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The secretary of state’s office estimates that more than 200 of its employees, or about 70%, have been vaccinated. </p>
<p>Hobbs said his office is adopting Inslee’s vaccine policy which allows employees to seek an exemption and accommodation to continue working.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Thousands held on Hong Kong cruise ship for COVID testing</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major fall in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The secretary of state’s office operates 27 locations and is responsible for elections, corporation and nonprofit registrations and operation of the state archives and library.</p>
<p>In an interview last fall, Wyman — Washington’s only Republican statewide officeholder — defended her decision not to require vaccines, although she was vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t willing to fire someone who, for whatever reason, didn’t want to share with me their vaccination status,” Wyman said. </p>
<p>Asked how Hobbs would respond to a staff member who doesn’t want to get vaccinated, Hobbs held firm: “Being fully vaccinated brings you greater protections, even if you were to get infected by omicron.”</p>
<p>For now, booster shots for secretary of state staff will not be required.</p>
<p>Among state employees covered by Inslee’s mandate, about 3% — or just over 2,000 — left their jobs or were terminated because they did not want to get vaccinated, according to the state Office of Financial Management.</p>
<div><div><h1>Harris: ‘Omicron spreading like wildfire’ in Alabama</h1></div><div>By KIM CHANDLERJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama’s state health officer on Tuesday said the highly infectious omicron variant of COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire in Alabama as the state sets record numbers for cases.</p>
<p>“We are unfortunately not in a real good place right now. We are seeing the highest daily case numbers we have seen since the pandemic began,” State Health Officer Scott Harris said in a briefing with reporters.</p>
<p>“It is just spreading like wildfire,” Harris said, adding that, “omicron will infect a very large number of people in Alabama before it finally subsides.”</p>
<p>“So, we really need people to do the single most important thing they can do which is to be fully vaccinated and boosted when it’s appropriate to do so.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Why are so many vaccinated people getting COVID-19 lately?</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In locked down Chinese city, some complain food hard to get</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Oregon shatters state record of daily COVID case count</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Harris: 'Omicron spreading like wildfire' in Alabama</h4></a></div></li>
<p>“We had 41 people die yesterday. We don’t have that with the flu. We don’t have that with common colds. It’s just not the same thing,” Harris said.</p>
<p>There were more than 1,249 people in state hospitals with COVID-19 on Tuesday, although that is far fewer than the 3,000 people hospitalized at the peak of earlier waves.</p>
<p>Dr. Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, on Monday said about 32% of hospitalized patients had been vaccinated, but he did not yet have numbers on what percentage had booster shots.</p>
<p>Williamson said the number of medical workers who are out because of COVID-19 or flu is “creating some staffing issues” at hospitals across the state.</p>
<p>Less than 48% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, giving Alabama one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates despite months of work by health officials to promote the shots.</p>
<p>With more than 16,450 dead of the illness, Alabama has the nation’s third-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Many Alabama students returned to K-12 classrooms this week, although some systems opted for temporary remote learning. The Alabama Department of Public Health recommends students and educators wear masks, guidance that has remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The University of Alabama announced this week that people will be required to wear masks in most campus settings.</p>
<div><div><h1>Oregon shatters state record of daily COVID case count</h1></div><div>By SARA CLINEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The Oregon Health Authority reported 4,540 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday — shattering the state’s previous record of daily cases, set just five days earlier. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<p>In addition 18.2% of COVID-19 tests administered over the long weekend were positive for the virus, the Oregon Health Authority said. That’s the highest positivity rate seen in the state so far. </p>
<p>But officials say that increase threatens the state’s already strained hospitals who are still dealing with the influx of patients hospitalized during the delta surge. </p>
<p>Currently there are only 59 available adult intensive care unit beds and 94% of the state’s staffed adult non-ICU beds are full.</p>
<p>During previous surges, to free up space hospitals have postponed elective procedures. </p>

<div><div><h1>Prosecutor drops groping charge against former NY Gov. Cuomo</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL HILL and MARINA VILLENEUVEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo won’t face criminal prosecution over an allegation that he fondled an aide, after a prosecutor said Tuesday he couldn’t prove the case.</p>
<p>Three days before the Democratic ex-governor was due to answer the misdemeanor charge in court, Albany County District Attorney David Soares asked a judge to dismiss a criminal complaint the county sheriff filed in October.</p>
<p>Soares, a Democrat, didn’t detail why he felt it would be tough to win a conviction.</p>
<p>Soares said his office considered other potential criminal charges, but none fit the allegations.</p>
<p>Cuomo, who has vehemently denied the allegation, had no immediate comment on the development, first reported by The Times-Union of Albany.</p>
<p>The charges against Cuomo were based on allegations by Brittany Commisso, one of the governor’s executive assistants before he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations in August.</p>
<p>Commisso says Cuomo slid his hand up her blouse and grabbed her breast when they were alone in an office at the governor’s mansion in Albany in late 2020.</p>
<p>Her lawyer, Brian Premo, said in a statement Tuesday that she “had no control over the filing or prosecution of criminal charges. She had no authority or voice in those decisions.”</p>
<p>“The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,” he said.</p>
<p>In a statement to the Times-Union, Commisso said her “disappointing experience of re-victimization with the failure to prosecute” was “just another example of where our criminal justice system needs to do better.”</p>
<p>“I knew, and he knew, too, that that was wrong,” Commisso told investigators for the attorney general’s office.</p>
<p>Cuomo denied he had groped her, telling the attorney general’s investigators “it would be an act of insanity to touch a woman’s breast and make myself vulnerable to a woman for such an accusation.”</p>
<p>Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin has said Commisso had an “evolving version” of what happened.</p>
<p>In October, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple’s office filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo in connection with Commisso’s allegation.</p>
<p>Apple has said the court paperwork was processed quickly, before he had a chance to consult with the district attorney. But he said he was confident in the case’s strength.</p>
<p>The Associated Press doesn’t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done in interviews.</p>
<p>The development in Albany comes after two prosecutors in New York City suburbs separately announced Cuomo wouldn’t face criminal charges for allegations involving other women.</p>
<p>A Long Island prosecutor <a> announced Dec. 23</a> there would be no charges after a state trooper on Cuomo’s security detail told state investigators that Cuomo ran his hand across her abdomen at an event at Belmont Park in September 2019.</p>
<p>Five days later, the district attorney in Westchester County <a>announced Cuomo would not face charges </a> stemming from allegations by the same trooper and another woman that the former governor planted unwanted kisses on their cheeks.</p>
<p>In both instances, the prosecutors said the allegations were credible, but that they couldn’t pursue criminal charges.</p>
<p>Mariann Wang, a lawyer for two women who told independent investigators Cuomo harassed them, said her clients were disappointed by Tuesday’s news, but not surprised.</p>
<p>A November report from a law firm hired by the Assembly’s Judiciary Committee said it found “overwhelming evidence” Cuomo sexually harassed state employees.</p>
<p>Cuomo could face civil litigation by Commisso and others.</p>
<p>On Monday, a lawyer for Cuomo said the Manhattan district attorney’s office told him it had closed an investigation into how Cuomo’s office handled nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. The office declined to comment.</p>
<a> his administration’s reporting of nursing home residents’ deaths</a> and over an order that
<a>barred the homes</a> from turning away recovering hospital patients because they had COVID-19.
<p>Federal prosecutors have also been investigating the nursing home death data issue.</p>
<p>The state attorney general, meanwhile, has been investigating Cuomo’s use of aides to help craft and promote his pandemic memoir. Cuomo said they volunteered, using their personal time.</p>

<p>The Democratic-majority Senate Facilities and Operations Committee met via Zoom to discuss the COVID-19 protocols for the 60-day session that begins Monday. The final vote was 4-3, with all three Republicans on the committee voting against it.</p>

<p>After the meeting, Senate Republican Leader John Braun said that with the testing, masking and distancing protocols that are in place, lawmakers should be able to safely meet in person, and the public should have more access.</p>
<p>“If we believe it’s working for our kids in schools, why on earth wouldn’t it work in the Legislature,” he said.</p>
<p>All House lawmakers and staff who work onsite will need to be tested three days a week, with the House covering the cost.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the state had more than 888,000 confirmed or probable cases since the start of the pandemic and 9,909 deaths. Nearly 78% of the population age 5 and older has received at least one dose of vaccine, and nearly 71% is fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Cincinnati sacks leader Trey Hendrickson and three other starters are among five Bengals who were placed on the COVID-19 reserve list Tuesday.</p>
<p>Center Trey Hopkins and left guard Quinton Spain were sidelined along with safety Vonn Bell. The fifth player is linebacker Akeem Davis-Gaither, who has been out with a foot injury.</p>
<p>The Bengals (10-6) have clinched the AFC North title for their first trip to the playoffs since the 2015 season. Cincinnati has an outside chance to earn the AFC’s No. 1 seed Sunday with a win over Cleveland and some help.</p>
<p>The NFL is allowing players to return five days after a positive COVID-19 test if they don’t have symptoms. The reduction last week from the previous isolation time of 10 days includes unvaccinated players.</p>
<p>Hendrickson is fifth in the NFL with a career-high 14 sacks. Pittsburgh’s T.J. Watt leads with 21½.</p>
<p>About the same number of players — approximately 20 — went on and came off the COVID-19 list Tuesday. </p>
<p>Arizona, which has qualified for the playoffs and can still win the NFC West, activated four players off the list and added two. The Cardinals play Seattle on Sunday.</p>
<p>San Francisco, which needs a win over the Los Angeles Rams or a New Orleans loss to reach the postseason, had two backups sidelined in defensive backs Dontae Johnson and Jimmie Ward.</p>
<p>The Browns placed running back D’Ernest Johnson on the COVID-19 list. Johnson has been a solid backup to Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt, rushing for 411 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Browns got linebacker Elijah Lee back off the COVID-19 list and activated quarterback Nick Mullens and safety Cedric Thompson off the practice squad COVID-19 list.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ondrej Palat had two goals and an assist as the Tampa Bay Lightning trounced the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-2 on Tuesday night to break a three-game losing streak.</p>
<p>“Our team game was better,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “Obviously, it helped to get out to the lead we got out to in the beginning. We played with a little bit of confidence today, so it was good.”</p>
<p>Gus Nyquist provided a goal and an assist for an illness-ravaged Columbus team, which dropped its fourth in a row against the Lightning. Dean Kukan also scored for the Blue Jackets. </p>
<p>Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 20 shots in his 17th win, tying Frederik Andersen of Carolina for the NHL lead.</p>
<p>Joonas Korpisalo made 29 saves for Columbus in his first start since Nov. 27, a span that included a stint in COVID-19 protocols.</p>

<p>Nyquist got the Blue Jackets within two again on his seventh goal of the season at 4:16, but Maroon made it 5-2 with Tampa Bay’s third power-play goal only eight seconds into Columbus’ fourth penalty of the night.</p>

<div><div><h1>Djokovic given medical exemption to play at Australian Open</h1></div><div>By JOHN PYEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Jaala Pulford, the state’s acting minister for sports, on Wednesday said “no one is or will be receiving special treatment because of who they are or what they have achieved professionally.”</p>
<p>“Lots of people in the Victorian community will find this to be a disappointing outcome, but the process is the process,” Pulford said. “Nobody has had special treatment. The process is incredibly robust.”</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was a matter for the government of Victoria, where Melbourne is the state capital. </p>
<p>The decision is being widely debated in a city where most people endured months of strict lockdowns and harsh travel restrictions at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Reaction on social media quickly turned to questions about the grounds for Djokovic’s exemption.</p>
<p>Reasons for exemptions can include an acute major medical condition, serious adverse reaction to a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, or evidence of a COVID-19 infection within the previous six months.</p>
<p>Tiley said he wasn’t aware of the grounds for Djokovic’s exemption, adding: “The only way we could access that information is if an individual decides to share it.”</p>
<p>But, he said, it would be “helpful” if Djokovic chose to explain.</p>
<p>“I would encourage him to talk to the community about it,” Tiley said. “We have been through a very tough period over the last two years and would appreciate some answers to that.”</p>
<p>There’s no cap on crowd numbers for the 2022 tournament and no strict hotel quarantine for players, although proof of double vaccination for COVID-19 is a requirement for entry and players will undergo daily testing.</p>
<p>Djokovic will avoid hotel quarantine upon arrival, with visitors to Australia who have medical exemptions for the vaccination treated the same as fully vaccinated people.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Djokovic has won nine of his 20 major titles at the Australian Open. He shares the men’s record for most majors with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.</p>
<p>Djokovic hasn’t played at tour level since the Davis Cup Finals in early December. His posts on social media announcing his plans to travel to Australia were accompanied by a photo of Djokovic leaning on a tennis bag at an airport.</p>

<p>The team returned to practice a week ago, with everyone from coach Mick Cronin to several players having recovered after being laid low by the coronavirus. Just three scholarship players did not test positive.</p>
<p>UCLA will host Long Beach State on Thursday. Only family members will be allowed to attend because of rising COVID-19 cases. The Beach is making its second visit to Pauley Pavilion this season, having lost 100-79 on Nov. 15.</p>
<p>“It was a wild ride,” Cronin said. “I feel better now. Being in the bedroom for 10 days was no fun at all.”</p>
<p>Games against North Carolina in Las Vegas and Cal Poly at home were canceled. After winning their Pac-12 opener on Dec. 1 against Colorado, the Bruins had four other league games postponed.</p>

<p>UCLA thought it would be hosting Arizona State on Wednesday, but then the Sun Devils came down with COVID-19 issues. It’s up to the Pac-12 office to schedule league games; the Bruins can line up any nonconference games themselves.</p>
<p>Rival Southern California may get a phone call. After all, the seventh-ranked Trojans (12-0) are just 12 miles across town and they’ve been idle since beating Georgia Teach on Dec. 18.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if we flip a coin,” Cronin said, referring to deciding a game site.</p>
<p>The Trojans, who had COVID-19 issues of their own, are faring slightly better with their schedule. Road games this week at California and Stanford were still on as of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Next week isn’t looking much better for either UCLA or USC. The Oregon schools are due in Los Angeles, but both the Ducks and the Beavers have COVID-19 issues.</p>
<p>USC said Tuesday night that its home games — and all other indoor athletic events — will be played without the general public through Jan. 14. Only families and guests of team members will be allowed.</p>
<p>“We all want to play, but we understand what it’s like for other teams that are going through it,” UCLA starting guard Jules Bernard said Tuesday via Zoom.</p>
<p>The Bruins’ COVID-19 woes coincided with the Christmas break, leaving Bernard alone in his off-campus apartment. With no classes and no access to a gym, he played video games in between doing push-ups and stretching.</p>
<p>“Nothing can prepare you for coming back to work out after 10, 12 days not touching a basketball,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bruins found that out when they finally reconvened.</p>
<p>“We tried to run one sprint and had guys throwing up in the garbage can,” Cronin said. “Working out and practicing is one thing. Game legs are totally different.”</p>
<p>The players stayed in touch via group text messages and met with the coaching staff over Zoom.</p>
<p>Like Bernard, Jaime Jaquez Jr. resumed his old habit of playing video games. He compared the days in quarantine to an extended respite similar to the NBA’s All-Star break.</p>
<p>“COVID caught up to us,” he said, referring to last season when the Bruins didn’t have a single case.</p>
<p>Cronin is cautious about easing eager players back into the regime of practicing and playing so they don’t get hurt.</p>
<p>“We’re always chomping at the bit,” Bernard said, “and staying ready for any game.”</p>

<p>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — The rust was almost inevitable. Still, Isaiah Stevens and his Colorado State teammates found a way to grind through it.</p>
<p>That’s the trademark, Stevens maintained, of a tough team. </p>
<p>Stevens scored 15 points as the 20th-ranked Rams remained undefeated by shrugging off some sluggishness following a nearly month-long layoff due to COVID-19 concerns and holding off short-handed Air Force 67-59 on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“We were sharp enough to win,” Stevens said. </p>
<p>The Rams (11-0, 1-0 Mountain West) have captured 11 in a row to match the 1988-89 NCAA Tournament team for the second-longest winning streak in school history. The top mark was 14 straight by the 2014-15 squad.</p>
<p>“Man alive. Those backdoor cuts are demoralizing,” Rams guard Chandler Jacobs said. </p>
<p>Air Force tied it at 48 on a 3-pointer by Carter Murphy with 10:48 remaining.</p>
<p>The turning point, though, was a four-point play by John Tonje, which gave the Rams a late cushion. Roddy sealed it on an emphatic dunk with 53.1 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>“That’s what tough teams do and we want to be a tough team,” Jacobs said. “We’re a good team so we’ve got to keep going.”</p>
<p>The Falcons used just seven players, with Jake Heidbreder — the reigning Mountain West freshman of the week — Camden Vander Zwaag and Ethan Taylor playing all 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Taylor led the Falcons with 19 points, with Murphy adding 13 while Heidbreder and Vander Zwaag contributed 12 each.</p>
<p>Air Force: The Falcons fell to 4-87 against ranked opponents. Their last win over a ranked squad was on March 9, 2013 over No. 12 New Mexico.</p>
<p>Colorado State: This win should help keep the streak going — the Rams have been ranked for four straight weeks in the AP Top 25 for the first time in program history.</p>
<p>Air Force football coach Troy Calhoun sat a few rows behind the Falcons’ bench. ... Colorado State coach Niko Medved improved to 7-0 against Air Force.</p>
<p>The Falcons turned the ball over 14 times while the Rams had just six.</p>
<p>“Too many turnovers,” Scott said. “These experiences against these good teams are going to make us grow.”</p>
<p>Stevens became the 32nd member of Colorado State’s 1,000-point club.</p>
<p>Air Force: Hosts UNLV on Saturday.</p>
<p>Colorado State: Is scheduled to play at Boise State on Friday. Boise State had its game Tuesday at Utah State postponed due to COVID-19 concerns within the Broncos’ program. </p>

<p>BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s health minister is advocating tougher curbs on contact between people as the country prepares for a new rise in coronavirus infections fueled by the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Lauterbach also renewed an appeal for vaccine holdouts to reconsider. He said people who remain unvaccinated in Germany can’t expect contact restrictions for them to be lifted “in the short- or medium-term.” </p>
<p>Scholz and the governors also are expected to consider shortening required quarantine periods, something that many other countries already have done. </p>

<p>WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has tested positive for COVID-19 but has no serious symptoms, an aide said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Duda, 49, has been vaccinated against the coronavirus and received a booster shot last month, Szrot said. The president got tested this week because of cases among employees in his office. </p>
<p>Duda previously tested positive in October 2020 and was reported at the time not to have experienced significant illness. </p>
<p>Poland on Wednesday reported over 17,000 new cases and more than 630 additional deaths related to COVID-19. The country, which has a population of 38 million, has registered over 4 million cases and almost 99,000 deaths in the pandemic. </p>

<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Republican Virginia Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin is continuing to build out his cabinet and staff with a mix of experienced professionals from both the government and private sector ahead of his Jan. 15 inauguration. </p>
<p>The political newcomer announced a handful of key appointees this week, including his chief of staff, counselor, secretary of veterans and defense affairs and secretary of agriculture and forestry. </p>
<p>Among them was Jeff Goettman, who has served as the transition director post-election and has been tapped to serve as chief of staff, according to the news release. </p>
<p>Goettman formerly worked in private equity, at the U.S. Department of Treasury and as the executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
<p>Richard Cullen, a prominent Richmond lawyer and former Virginia attorney general, will serve as counselor to the governor, the news release said. </p>

<p>He also announced that Matt Lohr, a former state delegate, fifth-generation farmer and former Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, would serve as his secretary of agriculture and forestry. </p>
<p>Youngkin also announced this week the selection of: </p>
<p>— Rebecca Glover, who most recently worked on media relations campaigns the Brunswick Group, as deputy chief of staff and communications director.</p>
<p>— Eric Moeller, currently a partner at McKinsey Company, as “chief transformation officer,” a role not described in the transition news release. </p>

<p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) — More than 1,000 sexual abuse victims of a University of Michigan sports doctor would get a window in which they could sue the school for damages under new bills that the Legislature will consider.</p>
<p>Under bills announced Tuesday, a 30-day period would be created for victims of the late Dr. Robert Anderson to file a lawsuit regardless of the statute of limitations. The university could not use the government immunity defense.</p>
<p>Staff at the University of Michigan <a>missed many opportunities</a> to stop Anderson over his 37-year career, according to a law firm hired by the school.</p>

<div><div><h1>5 things to know as Nebraska lawmakers begin new session</h1></div><div>By GRANT SCHULTEJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska lawmakers will kick off their 2022 session with several big questions to answer, including whether to build a new $230 million prison and how they’ll spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic money.</p>
<p>Here are five things to know about the session:</p>
<p>Nebraska is getting a $1.04 billion share of the federal government’s latest pandemic relief package, creating a lot of opportunities for the state and plenty of outstretched hands from organizations that want a piece.</p>
<p>Stinner said many of the requests he has seen focus on mental health services, economic development and workforce needs to address Nebraska’s severe labor shortage.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Will Elizabeth Holmes' conviction sober up Silicon Valley?</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Elizabeth Holmes saga still has some loose ends to resolve</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>New auto sales up in 2021, but long way before full recovery</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Biden says deal with telecoms avoids flight disruptions </h4></a></div></li>
<p>On Tuesday, two Omaha senators announced their own proposal that calls for spending the money on public health services, housing, job training programs and neighborhood development projects in north Omaha.</p>
<p>Sens. Justin Wayne and Terrell McKinney, both Democrats, said the pandemic has exacerbated public health disparities in their districts, which encompass many low-income, minority-heavy neighborhoods with higher-than-average unemployment.</p>
<p>“It is time that we, as a state, make investments in our communities hit hardest by COVID,” McKinney said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nebraska is in strong financial shape even without the latest round of federal money, thanks to higher-than-expected tax collections that leave the state with $412 million in extra, unallocated cash.</p>
<p>“The state is in terrific shape right now as it relates to revenues,” Stinner said.</p>
<p>Stinner said he has also received about $300 million in deficit requests from state agencies, including $115 million from the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and $117 million from the state Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>He said one big expense he anticipates is salary increases for state employees as both wages and expenses rise nationally due to inflation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will continue to debate whether to build a new, $230 million prison to replace the aging Nebraska State Penitentiary and accommodate a growing inmate population.</p>
<p>Ricketts and state corrections officials have said the project is needed to maintain public safety, but some lawmakers remain fervently opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Steve Lathrop, chairman of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, said he expects to focus this year on “charting a long-term course for our criminal justice system” to try to reduce prison crowding and recidivism.</p>
<p>Lathrop said he’s still waiting on a master facility study to determine whether a new prison is necessary or an effective approach. He said he has some concerns about both the building and annual operating costs and wants more information.</p>
<p>“That’s going to be a consequential number,” he said. ”... What we need to do is step back and have a broader conversation as stewards of taxpayer dollars about how to get the best outcomes.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will once again look for ways to cut taxes, with a bigger expected emphasis this year on income taxes.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, of Omaha, said she expects to see bills to reduce individual income tax rates and speed up several tax cut measures that were approved last year.</p>
<p>Lawmakers agreed last year to lower corporate income tax rates and phase out taxes on Social Security income over several years. With extra money in the state’s coffers, Linehan said lawmakers will try to shorten those timelines.</p>
<p>“If we have more revenue than we have budgeted for our needs, it’s immoral to take that extra money from people,” Linehan said. “I think there is enough that we can cut taxes and satisfy our needs.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers are also preparing to debate measures that would further restrict abortion access, expand gun rights and other issues that pop up every year in the Legislature, with mixed results.</p>
<p>The makeup of the Legislature hasn’t changed since last year, however, so it may be difficult for any issue to gain traction if it failed in 2021.</p>
<div><div><h1>Taylor drops out of U.S. Senate race, endorses Durant </h1></div><div>By KIM CHANDLERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Businesswoman Jessica Taylor dropped out of Alabama’s U.S. Senate race Tuesday and threw her support behind Mike Durant in the Republican primary. </p>
<a>Taylor</a> wrote in a tweet.
<p>Taylor is the owner of a grant-writing business and finished third in the 2020 GOP primary for the 2nd Congressional District, narrowly missing the runoff in that race. </p>
<p>Durant thanked Taylor for her endorsement in a statement released by his campaign. </p>
<p>“For too long, career politicians who have never held a real job in their life have made poor decisions that have left Alabama families behind and put America last. I’m running to change that,” Durant said.</p>
<p>Durant was piloting one of two Black Hawk helicopters shot down by Somali militiamen in 1993 in the capital of Mogadishu. </p>
<p>Shelby, one of the Senate’s most senior members, announced last year that he would not seek reelection in 2022, igniting a messy GOP primary.</p>

<p>A formal written order will follow in the days ahead, but Jones said at the end of a 2.5-hour hearing in federal court in Reno on Tuesday, “I’ve made up my mind.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to stop construction and progress for 90 days. That will give the plaintiffs an opportunity to get to the appellate court,” he said.</p>
<p>The Reno-based Ormat Technologies Inc. had intended to begin bulldozing work this week at the site in northern Nevada’s high desert about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Reno. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Dec. 15 by the Center for Biological Diversity and Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe said the project would turn a “pristine and unique location of ecological value and spiritual significance” into an industrial site.</p>
<p>“I am not yet persuaded there is a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits,” he said.</p>
<p>Formed by natural springs, Dixie Meadows is a critical wetland ecosystem in a desert oasis that is home to the Dixie Valley toad found nowhere else in the world, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Tribal leaders have argued that their ancestors have lived in the Dixie Valley region for thousands of years and long recognized the hot springs as “a sacred place of healing and reflection.”</p>
<p>Ormat argues it already has invested $68 million in the project and it could be jeopardized by any delays.</p>
<p>“Even a few weeks of delay in construction of this project ... may spell disaster for the financial viability of the project,” the company said in recent court filings.</p>

<p>Clearing weather over much of the eastern United States raised hopes that air-travel disruptions will ease after a dreadful start to the new year.</p>
<p>By late Tuesday morning on the East Coast, airlines had scrubbed more than 1,200 flights for the day. That’s a very high number but not compared with Monday’s disruptions, which included more than 3,200 canceled flights.</p>
<p>Southwest Airlines canceled more than 300 flights, or 10% of its schedule Tuesday.</p>
<p>The number of canceled flights began rising Dec. 24, and several airlines blamed it on crew shortages due to the spreading omicron variant of COVID-19. Over the weekend, the sickouts were compounded by winter storms that swept across the country.</p>
<p>About 2,700 U.S. flights were canceled on Saturday and a similar number were grounded Sunday. Thousands more were delayed. In all, about 20,000 U.S. flights have been canceled since Christmas Eve, according to FlightAware figures.</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — For the second time in a decade, Californians will face mandatory restrictions governing their outdoor water use as the state endures another drought and voluntary conservation efforts have fallen short.</p>
<p>The action comes as Californians have failed to meet Gov. Gavin Newsom’s call for a voluntary 15% reduction in water use compared to last year. Between July and November, the state’s water usage went down just 6%.</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Rain and snow showers lingered over Northern California on Tuesday as the latest weather system moved through.</p>
<p>The storm added to substantial early season precipitation dropped by powerful December systems that cut power to thousands but also allowed a drought-stricken hydroelectric plant to resume operations. </p>
<p>Forecasters billed the front that arrived Monday as weak but it left some high rainfall totals in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Mount Tamalpais north of the Golden Gate recorded more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) in 24 hours. The San Mateo and Santa Cruz coastal ranges received 1 inch to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters).</p>

<p>California Assembly member Phil Ting of San Francisco unveiled a bill on Tuesday modeled after the New York law, which is being challenged in court by gun-makers. </p>

<p>The goal is to “create an environment where the gun industry is held accountable,” Schardt said.</p>

<p>“As a matter of policy, to try and shift the blame for the criminal misuse of a lawful product that is used far more often to save lives and protect lives than to take them is a terrible idea,” he said. </p>
<div><div><h1>Man free after 37 years due to ‘sex for lies’ false witness</h1></div><div>By MARYCLAIRE DALEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia man was freed from prison Tuesday after 37 years in a case marred by detectives who allegedly offered a witness sex and drugs at police headquarters in 1983 in exchange for false testimony.</p>
<p>The trial witness was charged with perjury just days after Willie Stokes was convicted of murder in 1984. But Stokes didn’t learn about that perjury plea until 2015, decades into a life sentence.</p>
<p>Stokes, 61, walked out of a state prison near Philadelphia eager to get a hug from his mother and a corned beef hoagie. His mother was too nervous to come after several earlier disappointments, so he greeted other family members instead.</p>

<p>Stokes’ mother, now elderly, has been planning for his homecoming as his appeals gained traction, only to face repeated setbacks, she told The Philadelphia Inquirer, which first reported on the case. </p>
<p>But Lee’s mother also played a role early on.</p>
<p>His mother told the woman not to go down to the station again. Instead, police secured him a sex worker the next time, Lee said.</p>
<p>One surviving prosecutor, now in private practice, did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday. However, he has given a statement saying he doesn’t remember either case, according to court files. </p>
<p>Philadelphia police offered no immediate comment on the case.</p>
<p>The U.S. magistrate who heard the appeal called the omission an “egregious violation of (Stokes’) constitutional rights,” and a U.S. district judge agreed, overturning the conviction last week. </p>
<p>As for Lee, he ended up serving 35 years on the rape, murder and perjury charges. He got out of prison two years ago and now works as an assembly line supervisor.</p>
<p>He apologized to Stokes in court “for the problem I caused.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to take his tears to indicate he’s accepting the apology,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol Sandra Moore Wells said. </p>

<div><div><h1>Arizona governor wants schools open despite virus surge</h1></div><div>By BOB CHRISTIE and PAUL DAVENPORTJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday took what he called “preemptive action” to keep public school students in classrooms despite rising coronavirus hospitalizations as the more contagious omicron variant spreads. </p>
<p>Ducey is tapping $10 million in relief funds to give parents up to $7,000 a year to pay tuition and education costs. Applicants can earn up to 350% of the federal poverty level — $92,750 for a family of four.</p>
<p>No Arizona public schools have announced plans to close or return to remote learning, but the president of the state teachers union said Tuesday it may happen if enough staff are sidelined by illness.</p>
<a>Salmon accused Thomas of pushing for closures</a> and said he would ban hybrid learning and promote expansion of the state’s private school voucher programs.
<p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday said hat there’s no reason to believe omicron is worse for children than previous variants and noted $130 billion in federal virus relief to keep schools safe and open.</p>
<p>The money is for testing, improved ventilation, distancing and other mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Ducey’s program is effective as of Jan. 3 and the <a>governor’s website</a> will have an application portal by later this week. </p>
<p>The governor in August also created a $163 million grant program only available to schools in high-income areas that do not have mask mandates. </p>
<a>Ducey rejected the Treasury demands in November</a> and did not halt the programs.
<p>A Treasury spokesperson said Tuesday that the department is monitoring uses of coronavirus relief funds and “expects any government that uses them in violation of the eligible uses to repay the misused funds to the federal government.” </p>
<p>Karamargin said the new voucher program provides parents with options.</p>
<p>“The goal here is to give parents a lifeline in the eventuality that a school closes,” Karamargin said.</p>
<p>Thomas called for the governor and the Legislature, which starts its 2022 session on Monday, to return to the pandemic’s early days when schools could react to local conditions.</p>
<p>“They need to go back to their playbook when we started all of this, where they were giving districts flexibility,” Thomas said, </p>
<a>state’s coronavirus dashboard.</a>
<p>Monday saw 14,192 additional cases, the most on a single day since January 2020, which reflected both the surge and lower reporting the day before because of the New Year’s holiday. </p>
<a>said Tuesday on Twitte</a> r. The increased use of at-home tests means there are likely more cases.
<p>In northwestern Arizona, the Mohave County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 for a resolution recognizing a public health crisis due to severe staffing shortages at hospitals in the county, a generally conservative area with low vaccination rates.</p>
<p>The declaration approved Monday reverses a December board vote rejecting a request by hospital officials to declare a state of emergency, <a>Today’s News-Herald reported</a>.</p>
<p>Kingman Regional Medical Center CEO Will McConnell said the board’s official recognition of the crisis will allow hospitals to make a stronger case for state and federal help with getting more nurses.</p>

<p>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford on Tuesday announced that Nevada intends to reverse course and join a multi-state opioid settlement that months ago he rejected as insufficient.</p>
<p>Nevada was one of several states that did not join a $26 billion settlement with the nation’s three major drug distributors and Johnson Johnson in July. Ford said at the time that Nevada would seek separate compensation.</p>
<p>“After multiple new developments, I ultimately decided that it was in Nevada’s best interest to join this settlement,” Ford, a Democrat, said.</p>
<a>reached</a> in bankruptcy court in September likely meant the delivery of settlement dollars to Nevada would be delayed.

<p>That’s a much faster timeframe than most of the settlements between other states and Johnson Johnson, many of which are payable over a period of nine years, he said.</p>
<a>faced</a> a deadline on Sunday to sign onto the proposed settlement with the Johnson Johnson and the distributors. Ford said between January 2019 and October 2021, 1,300 Nevadans died from opioids, not including overdoses and emergency room visits.
<a>Washington </a> is taking the three distributors to trial.
<p>Nevada sat out the agreement and ultimately <a>struck</a> its own $45 million with the consulting firm — more than three and a half times larger than the average settlement with other states.</p>

<p>Rhode Island lawmakers overwhelmingly approved spending $119 million in federal pandemic relief money Tuesday when they returned to the State House to start the new legislative session. </p>
<p>Democratic House Speaker Joseph Shekarchi said the “historic investment” is the first down payment on federal funding that will boost the economy and help families and businesses.</p>

<p>Both chambers also voted to override two vetoes by Democratic Gov. Dan McKee. The last such veto override was in 2012, according to the speaker’s office.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Lauren Carson, of Newport, said Tuesday it’s a large, growing business and the state has a responsibility to record where the rentals are and register them. </p>
<p>McKee also vetoed legislation regarding auto body insurance claims that he said would ultimately burden consumers. </p>
<p>They must also vote on how legislative and congressional districts should be reapportioned. After each 10-year census, the state constitution mandates redistricting for the General Assembly districts and the two congressional districts. </p>

<p>Sen. Tim Kaine was on his way to Washington when a seemingly simple commute stretched into a 21-hour ordeal that became “a kind of survival project.”</p>
<p>They were among hundreds of people who got stranded on the East Coast’s main north-south highway in freezing temperatures after a winter storm snarled traffic and left some drivers stuck in place for as much as a full day.</p>
<p>Hundreds of motorists spent the night in their vehicles, worrying about a lack of food, fuel and water as temperatures fell into the teens. One family reported that they went more than 18 hours without eating.</p>
<p>There were no reports of serious injuries or deaths, but there was plenty of anger among drivers.</p>
<p>As stranded motorists waited in their cars, many posted desperate messages on social media. Between midnight and 3 a.m. Tuesday, traffic came to a complete standstill, state officials said.</p>
<p>Finally, around midmorning Tuesday, a tow truck driver appeared and cleared away snow, allowing the Raos and other cars back up and take the exit.</p>
<p>“He was a messenger from God,” Rao said. “I literally was in tears.”</p>
<p>The affected section of the interstate was not pretreated because heavy rain preceded the snow, which fell at times as fast as 2 inches an hour, said Marcie Parker, a state Department of Transportation engineer.</p>
<p>“That was entirely too much for us to keep up with,” she said.</p>
<p>The storm also left passengers on an Amtrak train stranded in Virginia. Amtrak’s Crescent left New Orleans on Sunday on its way to New York and got stuck near Lynchburg on Monday morning, when downed trees blocked the tracks.</p>
<p>Passenger Sean Thornton told AP that Amtrak provided food, but toilets were overflowing and passengers were furious. Amtrak planned for the train to complete its trip once the tracks are clear. </p>
<a>Monday’s blizzard</a>, according to the National Weather Service, and state police had warned people to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary, especially as colder nighttime temperatures set in.
<p>Compounding the challenges, traffic cameras went offline as much of central Virginia lost power in the storm, the transportation department said.</p>
<p>Kaine left his home in Richmond for his usual two-hour commute to the U.S. Capitol after Monday’s snowstorm, expecting to preside over the Senate on Tuesday morning. Instead, he <a>spent the night alone in his car on I-95</a>.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Kaine said. “I will never forget this.”</p>
<p>Kelly Hannon, a spokeswoman for the transportation department, apologized to motorists and said the department would take an “exhaustive look” at the incident.</p>
