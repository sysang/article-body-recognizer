<p>“This shameless attempt by union leaders to pretend they have not had the chance to work with the federal government is a charade,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms McManus said it was “disappointing” the government was trying to score political points during the crisis, particularly when businesses and the unions are aligned on the need for free and accessible rapid tests.</p>
<p>Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said governments were changing the requirements “almost daily” for rapid testing of staff and the government should provide support to businesses to purchase the tests.</p>
<p>Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar also said his organisation had been calling for free and widely available tests since September.</p>
<p>“Rapid antigen testing is an important tool as part of a broader arsenal ... in ensuring employees can safely return to the workplace,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late for national cabinet to change its mind and provide free and accessible rapid antigen testing for small businesses across all states,” he said.</p>
<p>Without enough tests available, he said employers could not reasonably be expected to provide them.</p>
<p>“The argument could be made that if tests aren’t available, even though that’s not the fault of employers, they may need ... to shut down workplaces until tests are available,” he said.</p>
<p>However, he said any organised walk out from work was likely to be unlawful unless there is an “immediate threat” to each specific worker’s health.</p>
<p>Leading industrial law barrister Ian Neil SC said the debate about who should provide the tests was entirely theoretical until enough supply was available.</p>
<p>“It might be possible to argue that provision of rapid antigen tests is a necessary element or a reasonably necessary element of a safe system of work. Those arguments have only just begun to be raised,” he said.</p>
<p>“There’s a very strong argument ... that they’re the very type of thing the government should provide free of charge to everyone free of charge, not just employers or employees.”</p>

<div>Belgrade falls quiet as deported national hero Novak Djokovic flies in</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Belgrade: The Serbian President had called for the country’s hero to return to his homeland following his humiliating mistreatment by the Australian government and authorities.</p>
<p>But there was no presidential welcome awaiting when he touched down in Belgrade. There was no public rally held outside Parliament, as is customary for a returning sports star.</p>
<p>The handful of fans made their views clear and were mostly polite when it came to their feelings about Australia.</p>
<p>“We are so excited to see him and I just wish him all the best in the world,” said 20-year-old Teodora from Belgrade, who was waiting with her parents and 75-year-old grandmother.</p>
<p>“No, definitely not,” said Senad, also from Belgrade, when asked the same question. “Serbians have always been a people who are giving their lives for freedom, the way we think is free.”</p>
<p>He agreed that Djokovic could make things easier by just getting vaccinated but insisted: “This is the free world. Why is choice the problem?”</p>
<p>Petar Civkovic, 18, and his friends were more plain-speaking.</p>
<p>“Get deported, get deported,” they jeered when I introduced myself as an Australian journalist.</p>
<p>Similarly, construction workers toiling on Nikola Tesla airport’s upgrade who gathered and watched the media throng waiting for Djokovic’s Fly Dubai flight to touchdown teasingly sought out any Australian journalists among the pack.</p>
<p>“Deport,” a pair of men cried out, followed up by smiles, laughs, winks and blown kisses. Both encounters were without malice.</p>
<p>But not everyone feels the same way. Both of my cab drivers were ready to admit the Serbian was not faultless.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about this Novak stuff,” one said, complaining of how much the drama in Melbourne had dominated the news in Belgrade.</p>
<p>“He’s stupid, I don’t go to any country where I’m not welcome.”</p>
<p>Despite the fiery Serb rhetoric and a prediction of a hero’s welcome for their beloved son, Djokovic himself appeared to read the room.</p>
<p>He slunk back into Belgrade into silence, after granting a few fans air side a happy snap but denying the few outside a glimpse, smile or wave.</p>
<p>On the streets of the Serbian capital there was little to show the national hero was home.</p>
<p>Australia’s casting of Djokovic as the globe’s anti-vax pin-up boy has left a stain on the tennis player.</p>
<p>Vucic himself has to be careful how much his patriotic patronage of Djokovic is interpreted as endorsing the player’s refusal to be vaccinated as he faces an election in April.</p>
<p>Serbia began rolling out its shots in December 2020, months before Australia got going. It offered its citizens a choice of two Chinese jabs, Russia’s Sputnik and Pfizer. Twelve months on, less than half of the population has been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The requirement that athletes be vaccinated to compete could be lifted by May. The thought of another leader with one eye on an election should leave the Djokovics in no doubt about how drastic electioneering leaders can be.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Germany’s Olaf Scholz both warned the superstar that he would have to abide by the health rules of their countries too.</p>
<p>Testing positive for COVID-19 and heading out to meet reporters for an interview anyway won’t be behaviour the Serb can expect to get away with any longer. The precedent has been set by Australia.</p>
<p>More worryingly for Djokovic there are signs his sponsors are considering a little social-distancing of their own.</p>
<p>French clothes manufacturer Lacoste said it wanted a word with the tennis star ASAP.</p>
<p>“As soon as possible, we will be in touch with Novak Djokovic to review the events that have accompanied his presence in Australia,” Lacoste said.</p>
<p>Dusan Janjic has known Djokovic’s father Srdjan for 20 years and Novak since 2012.</p>
<p>Speaking over coffee and ice cream at one of the tennis centres he frequents, having hit many a ball against Srdjan over the years, the 84-year-old said the Djokovics were clearly at a crossroads, with Novak’s entire career at stake.</p>
<p>“He needs to prepare himself to realise that this is possibly the beginning of the end of his career,” Janjic said.</p>
<p>“He will do that because at the end of the story he is a pragmatic guy.”</p>
<p>But he said this would require Novak to end his nationalistic Serbian social media publications as well as his public embrace of wellness fads that suggest vaccine scepticism at best and outright anti-vaxxer views at worst.</p>
<p>“He basically has not been educated to believe in science, it’s more believing in some kind of destiny.”</p>
<p>In short, Djokovic needs fewer visits to Bosnian “energy-mountains” for their positive ions and some healing words.</p>
<p>“Learn from Federer, learn from Nadal, say ‘sorry guys,’” Janjic said.</p>
<div>‘It’s amazing to be back’: Australian Open better for Murray’s second coming</div>
<p>Andy Murray d Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4</p>
<p>With his translucent complexion, lugubrious manner and in an all-blue ensemble that melds into the court colour scheme at Melbourne Park, Andy Murray makes a good ghost.</p>
<p>“Here” was both a mindset and a place, this tournament, this very arena.</p>
<p>Basilashvili is all hitting power and minimal guile. He doesn’t really have a game, just a range of ideas as they come to him. He has plenty. It is to be hoped that he passed a police check before acquiring his forehand.</p>
<div><p>Suffice to say that there’ll be no re-screening of the Murray tribute tape just yet.</p></div>

<div>Tennis Australia board backs Tiley, admits ‘lessons to learn’ from Djokovic saga</div>
<p>“Tennis Australia has been working closely with both the federal and Victorian government for the past year to deliver a COVID safe Australian Open for the players, staff, and fans,” it said.</p>
<p>“Embarking on a major international sporting event during a global pandemic that continues to evolve and challenge us all, is profoundly demanding for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Two separate medical panels - one convened by TA and the other by the Victorian government - had granted Djokovic permission to play.</p>
<p>Mr Colbeck said TA had perhaps been asking and answering “different questions” about Djokovic’s ability to play, “rather than the primary question of whether he could come into the country”.</p>
<p>“Craig and I talked a lot. If he wanted to get some advice on something he would ring, particularly with respect to the issues around vaccination,” Mr Colbeck said.</p>
<p>“It’s such a large reputational risk ... If it’s just been run by management, I’d say, why weren’t the board involved?” he said.</p>
<p>Tennis great John Newcombe also queried the board’s level of involvement, saying Mr Tiley should have been supported in such high-stakes talks with the federal and Victorian governments.</p>
<div>Twice weekly tests for all students part of back-to-school plans</div>

<p>Students would be asked to take rapid antigen tests at home twice a week before class under the NSW government’s preferred strategy for controlling the spread of COVID-19 when school resumes this month.</p>
<p>Independent school principals have also been told they could ask parents to volunteer to supervise students in classrooms amid concerns that up to 20 per cent of teachers at a single school could be off sick at once.</p>
<p>NSW and Victoria are working together to develop a shared back-to-school plan to present to national cabinet later this week, sources from both states said on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p>
<p>This would involve parents being given enough rapid antigen kits to test each student twice a week before school. Those who tested positive would have to stay home, but their classmates could continue attending school without daily testing.</p>
<p>A Victorian government source said the state was also leaning towards surveillance testing. However, neither state has yet finalised their plan.</p>
<p>There are about 1.2 million school students in NSW, so a twice-weekly testing system would require 24 million rapid antigen tests over a 10-week term - a huge number in a global shortage. Another four million would be required for staff.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists say the best approach is to combine surveillance and test to stay strategies, although they acknowledge that supply has become an issue. NSW schools used the so-called test-to-stay strategy in November and December.</p>
<p>The NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos has called on the NSW government to employ both strategies.</p>
<p>“Rapid antigen testing clearly has an important role to play as a line of defence, and we would support its use as surveillance but also complemented by test to stay provisions,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several hundred private school principals were given information about the impact of COVID-19 on staffing, school operations and activities at a briefing by the Association of Independent Schools of NSW on Monday.</p>
<p>However, non-teaching staff could not teach the curriculum. One option was to have a non-teacher supervising students in a classroom while a teacher delivered a class remotely.</p>
<p>They were also told they could ask parents to volunteer for supervision, but volunteers would have to undergo training in child protection and duty of care.</p>
<p>There would be no restrictions on activities, but schools would have to do their own risk mitigation assessments. They were asked to carefully consider high-risk activities in term one, such as overnight camps and sports carnivals.</p>
<p>South Coogee parents Valent and Caroline Lau said they would do whatever was needed for their children Nicholas and Nathan, who are starting kindergarten and year 5, to return to classrooms.</p>
<p>“We’re keen to do whatever it takes but it seems the messages are changing all the time.”</p>

<div>State agencies among groups to criticise Warragamba Dam proposal</div>
<p>NSW state agencies are among the latest groups to criticise the government’s controversial Warragamba Dam project to raise its wall, calling the proposal inadequate and in need of further consultation.</p>
<p>Of the 2067 submissions on the dam’s environmental impact statement (EIS) released by the state government on Monday night, more than 1930 expressed objection, with 45 in support.</p>
<p>The $1 billion-plus plan to raise the dam’s wall by 14 metres has proven controversial, with opponents arguing it would potentially have an impact on the world heritage-listed Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>“The EIS makes incorrect assumptions about how to determine World Heritage values, and therefore how to evaluate impacts on those values ... There is insufficient analysis of World Heritage values related to biodiversity,” the EES noted.</p>
<p>It also notes the project would result in 284 kilometres of upstream waterways potentially being inundated up to the most probable maximum flood level.</p>
<p>“Minimal assessment has been undertaken of the aquatic ecology in these inundation areas, despite them containing known locations of threatened species,” the report noted.</p>
<p>Heritage NSW noted in their feedback that the presence of Indigenous dreaming stories and song lines in the archaeological record of the Burragorang Valley was unique.</p>
<p>“The intangible values are specific to the Burragorang Valley and even if similar sites, related to other intangible values, were to exist elsewhere, these will not offset the impact to the stories specific to this area,” they noted.</p>
<p>Among the other submissions were ones from conservation and cultural groups, councils and local MPs.</p>
<p>A submission by the Insurance Council of Australia opposed the project, noting there was inadequate appraisal of alternative interventions, a lack of transparency in measuring benefit and the degradation to the World Heritage area.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Water NSW, one of the authorising bodies on the project, said it would review the submissions during the public exhibition and address the issues in a report to the Department of Planning and Environment.</p>
<p>General manager of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness Harry Burkitt said the project had become the “biggest legal, political, financial and environmental failure of the NSW government in decades”.</p>
<p>“Today’s agency advice demonstrates the farcical nature of the entire EIS process.”</p>

<div>Thousands of booster jab appointments unfilled as over 60s make up bulk of admissions</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Tens of thousands of booster appointments in NSW have gone unfilled in the past week with new data revealing that people in their 70s were most likely to be hit with severe COVID-19 and admitted to intensive care in the first two weeks of January.</p>
<p>NSW hospitals were flooded with 3500 coronavirus hospital admissions in the past fortnight, according to data provided to the Herald, with people aged over 70 making up more than 40 per cent of hospitalisations and ICU admissions.</p>
<p>NSW Health data from January 3 to 16 shows 157 children aged under nine and 107 adolescents aged 10 to 19 were hospitalised, representing about seven per cent of the total 3532 admissions.</p>
<p>NSW reported almost 30,000 infections on Tuesday, with Dr Chant warning earlier this week that fatalities would rise in the coming days.</p>
<p>Premier Dominic Perrottet said Tuesday was a “very difficult day” after 36 deaths from the virus was recorded. It represents the highest daily death total since the start of the pandemic in January 2020.</p>
<p>A comparison of the age breakdowns of COVID-positive people in hospitals shows the number of older people requiring hospital treatment now more closely resembles the makeup of wards before vaccination was widely available.</p>
<p>Paediatric infectious diseases specialist Professor Nigel Curtis said for the few children who need admission more were presenting with “croup-like illness” than seen with previous strains.</p>
<p>“That reflects the fact Omicron seems to be better at invading upper airway mucosa, but this is generally easily treated,” Professor Curtis said.</p>
<p>“With young children, particularly those under five, we frequently admit them for brief periods as a precautionary measure and have low threshold for admission as we do for many other respiratory viral infections.</p>
<p>“Young children with mild infection are also admitted for social reasons because their parents have COVID-19 and may not be able to care for them.”</p>
<p>There have been three deaths in children aged under 10 during the pandemic, all who had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>About 14 per cent of children aged 5 to 11 in NSW have received their first shot.</p>
<p>Last week officials said it was likely NSW’s hospitalisations would plateau within days, but Dr Chant said it was too early to say if the state has reached a peak.</p>
<p>NSW Health had already initiated partnerships with private hospitals under its surge plans announced earlier this month.</p>
<p>Of NSW’s new cases, 13,763 were detected from at-home kits and 16,067 were from PCR testing. Dr Chant said the mix of rapid tests and PCR results mean numbers are more difficult to predict than in previous outbreaks.</p>
<p>There are 2850 people in NSW hospitals with the virus, of whom 209 are in intensive care with 63 ventilated.</p>
<p>Dr Chant said nine are on ECMO, which oxygenates a person’s blood around their body, providing relief for their heart and lungs. The 36 deaths eclipsed Friday’s previous highest daily tally of 29.</p>
<p>Across Australia, more than 98 per cent of people aged over 70 have been double-jabbed.</p>
<div>‘Super dodgy’: TGA investigating rapid antigen test resale rort</div>
<div><div><h5>By Marta Pascual Juanola and Cassandra Morgan</h5><div> <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 4.39pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration is investigating reports retailers are selling repackaged rapid antigen test kits for a premium, despite warnings of multimillion-dollar penalties for companies that breach labelling rules.</p>
<p>The tests, often bought in bulk initially, are resold inside zip-lock bags at petrol stations, convenience stores and small supermarkets, and are sometimes missing crucial components for their correct use, such as vials or instruction sheets.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old said the tests appeared to have been pulled out of their original box, repackaged individually, and placed inside envelopes with a photocopied sheet of instructions that missed key information about how to perform the test.</p>
<p>“It was cut out with wonky scissors, so it was all just super dodgy,” Alice said.</p>
<p>“I felt really ripped off and just infuriated that people, individuals, are making a profit out of a crisis situation.”</p>
<p>Alice, who reported the incident to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said she walked in on petrol station staff repackaging the bulk tests when she went back to complain about the purchase.</p>
<p>“I just can’t believe that in this day and age in Australia these businesses are getting away with selling individual items for profit when they should just be sold in their package,” she said.</p>
<p>Ben, who lives in Footscray in Victoria and also asked that his surname not be published, said he bought repackaged rapid antigen tests from a petrol station in Williamstown for $25 each.</p>
<p>The tests were in zip-lock bags, and instructions in them directed users to stand the test vials up in the kit’s box - which was not included.</p>
<p>“That’s how we 100 per cent knew it was taken out of a [bigger box],” Ben said.</p>
<p>He said he was not surprised to see retailers trying to make a premium off the sought-after tests. “People seem to keep taking advantage of the situation,” Ben said.</p>
<p>Multiple people on social media reported buying rapid antigen tests in plastic bags without instructions from a gift shop at Ballarat in Victoria.</p>
<p>One user, who asked to remain anonymous, turned to Facebook for help on how to use the tests.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a bit strange that the tests came in a plain clear bag,” she said.</p>
<p>“I actually went back to the store and refunded three of the five tests I bought.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman from the Therapeutic Goods Administration confirmed the watchdog was investigating allegations testing kits had been repackaged and relabelled illegally.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, COVID-19 tests can only be removed from their original packaging with the authorisation of the manufacturer.</p>
<p>“This includes opening bulk boxes of kits not intended for individual resale, and supplying them in smaller quantities,” the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>“Any updated packaging and labelling to be supplied with the devices must be TGA-approved versions that have undergone review as part of a regulatory submission.”</p>
<p>Breaching the rules carries fines of up to $888,000 for individuals and $4.44 million for corporations, or civil penalties of $1.11 million and $11.1 million respectively.</p>
<p>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said on Monday it was “beyond outrageous” for retailers to be selling single rapid test kits for more than $30.</p>
<p>The consumer watchdog revealed it had received nearly 2000 reports of rapid tests being sold for as much as $100 per test. This was despite the tests costing between $3.95 and $11.45 at a wholesale level.</p>
<p>The commission was contacted for comment on Tuesday, over reports some retailers were offering rapid antigen test kits as a gift when customers purchased other products.</p>

<div>Smoking out the rats: WA forensic auditors uncover potential public sector corruption</div>
<p>In the wake of the Paul Whyte corruption scandal, Western Australia’s Auditor-General hopes a crack forensic team set up to probe fraud in the public sector won’t find anything; but concedes they probably will.</p>
<p>“But I think the realist in me says that we’re probably going to find something.”</p>
<p>The audits cover periods ranging between 3 and 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr Whyte was a senior bureaucrat who defrauded taxpayers of $27.4 million over several years to help fund gambling habits and pay for his lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>He used his senior positions at the Department of Housing and the Department of Communities to approve invoices and credit card transactions to three shell companies, which had not actually done any work for the government.</p>
<p>The Corruption and Crime Commission investigation started the initial investigation into Whyte in 2018 after a tip-off, and he was jailed for 12 years in November.</p>
<p>The saga rocked the public sector and shocked the state government which stumped up more than $8 million for the forensic audit team.</p>
<p>An Australian Federal Police officer who was formerly the country’s liaison with Interpol helped set up the team, which is expected to grow to 20 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>“I won’t take a backward step when it comes to improving oversight and accountability across our public sector,” Premier Mark McGowan said in 2019 after announcing the new team.</p>
<p>The team works in the shadows: after red flags are identified during normal auditing processes of public sector organisations they apply a greater level of scrutiny and if they find anything will refer it to the CCC or WA Police.</p>
<p>Ms Spencer said if the team had existed while Mr Whyte’s frauds were occurring, they would have spotted it.</p>
<p>“This is risk-based across the sector because of our unique mandate where we can go into any public sector entity and conduct examinations, investigations and audits,” Ms Spencer said.</p>
<p>“Where something gets identified high risk as an entity in a high-risk activity, that’s going to be a target for a forensic audit.”</p>
<p>Ms Spencer said aside from integrity officers, government departments will not know the forensic auditing team is poking through their books unless they find something, and it is referred.</p>
