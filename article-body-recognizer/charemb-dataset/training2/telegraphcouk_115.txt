<h1> Ridley Road star Agnes O'Casey: 'I didn't think I'd need to practise the Nazi salute…' </h1>
<p> Did you know Nazism was thriving in Sixties Britain? BBC's new drama will open your eyes – and make O'Casey a household name </p>
<div> <div> By Helen Brown <time> 2 October 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>‘My dad made a lot of jokes about how my first job would be Body Number Three on Casualty,” says 25-year-old Agnes O’Casey, grinning. “And then I got the lead in a primetime BBC period drama.”</p>
<a>played by Rory Kinnear</a>). It’s edge-of-the-seat stuff which viewers who didn’t live through the period will find hard to process. It’s shocking to see
<a>Brits giving the Nazi salute</a> in a recreation of the National Socialist rally in Trafalgar Square, just 17 years after the Second World War had ended.
<p>Ridley Road begins on BBC One at 9pm on Oct 3</p>
<h1> ‘Jewface’ debate risks excluding great actors from the stage, says Holocaust play director </h1>
<p> Patrick Marber, who directed Sir Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt, speaks out on whether non-Jewish people should play Jewish roles </p>
<div> <div> By Gabriella Swerling, Social and Religious Affairs Editor <time> 31 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The “Jewface” debate risks “excluding” great actors from the stage, the director of Sir Tom Stoppard’s award-winning Holocaust play has said. </p>
<p><a>Patrick Marber, the Jewish comedian, playwright, actor and director</a>, has dismissed the notion that “lived experience” should be critical to casting, as he spoke out on the debate. </p>
<p>The term refers to the casting of people who are not Jewish in conspicuously Jewish roles and is a play on the historically racist practice of donning “blackface”.</p>
<p>Mr Marber directed Sir Tom Stoppard’s latest play, Leopoldstadt - an exploration of the playwright’s own personal Jewish history, set in Austria, which <a>won the Olivier award in October 2020 for Best New Play</a>.</p>
<a>Tamsin Greig said in a recent interview with The Telegraph</a> that she “probably shouldn’t” have played a Jewish mother in Friday Night Dinner, the television comedy.
<p>Ms Greig, who is a practising Christian and has some Jewish ancestry, played the role of Jackie Goodman in <a>Channel 4’s long-running sitcom</a> about a Jewish family living in North London. </p>
<p>“I think, given our sensitivity today about these issues, I probably shouldn’t have been in that show,” she said. “We are much more conscious today than we were when that show was first aired.”</p>
<p>However, Mr Marber told the Jewish Chronicle that he disagreed with this idea. </p>
<p>“I really want us Jews to fight our corner, but to not be exclusive and excluding. I want us Jews to be liberal-minded and generous. </p>
<p>“I think a gentile can play a Jew and a Jew can play a gentile. I don’t like it when someone plays a Jew and gets it wrong.”</p>
<p>However, he added: “I don’t like quotas. I don’t like laws. I think we should be better than that, we Jews.”</p>
<p>In December Maureen Lipman, the Jewish actress, made headlines by <a>declaring that cancel culture was killing comedy</a>. </p>
<p>She also told the Jewish Chronicle that she was uncomfortable with <a>Helen Mirren, the Oscar-winning actress</a>, who is not Jewish, playing Golda Meir, former Israeli president, in the forthcoming film, Golda. </p>

<p>Prep time: 15 minutes </p>
<p>Cooking time: 45 minutes </p>
<li>1 celeriac (about 500g trimmed weight)</li>
<li>Handful of parsley stalks</li>
<li>4 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1 litre vegetable stock</li>
<li>4 x 400g tins basic chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>6 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
<li>Tip the lentils into a bowl, cover with cold water and set aside to soak. Trim and roughly chop the onion, celeriac, leek, celery and mushrooms and peel the garlic.</li>
<li>Place the pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the veg, stir, cover and cook over a low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, then remove the lid.</li>
<li>To store, allow the bolognese to cool and then portion up and freeze flat in freezer-safe bags as this makes it super quick to defrost when you want a quick supper.</li>

<header> <div> <div> <h1> Jackfruit larb with baby gem lettuce and soy dressing recipe </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>Is it a salad? Is it a wrap? No. It’s larb, and it’s here to make your lunchtime tastier. This is a brilliant healthy-but-tasty finger-food meal for when you have friends over and want to serve something fun and informal.</p>
<p>Prep time: 10 minutes </p>
<p>Cooking time: 35 minutes </p>
<p>Four (as a lunch or starter)</p>
<li>2 x 400g tins jackfruit</li>
<li>2.5cm piece fresh ginger</li>
<ul> <li>2 limes</li> <li>1 banana shallot</li> <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li> <li>1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce</li> </ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas mark 7. Drain and rinse the jackfruit, then pat dry with a clean tea towel. Spread out on the lined baking tray and roast in the oven for 20 minutes. Use two forks to pull apart and shred the jackfruit.</li>
<li>To make the dressing, squeeze the lime juice into a bowl. Add the sliced shallot and squash it slightly to break it down. Add the soy sauce and sweet chilli and stir.</li>
<li>Spoon the jackfruit mixture into the lettuce leaves, drizzle over the dressing, garnish with the coriander, mint leaves, broken peanuts and a few slices of chilli if you like it extra kicky!</li>
<header> <div> <div> <h1> Baked ratatouille with basmati rice recipe </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>In the <a>BOSH! kitchen</a>, we find simple ratatouille to be a little boring, so we wanted to make something truly outstanding. This Mediterranean-flavoured dish tastes as good as it looks.</p>
<p>Cooking time: 1 hour and 30 minutes</p>
<li>12 large or 25 small garlic cloves</li>
<li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>½ tsp ground fennel</li>
<li>½ tsp Italian herbs</li>
<li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>

<header> <h1> What happens to your body when you turn vegan: changes to expect on a plant based-diet this Veganuary </h1> </header>

<a>can cause irritable bowel syndrome</a>.
<h3>Three to six months later</h3>
<a>deficiency has been linked with cancer</a>, 
<a>helping to prevent</a> heart disease, stroke and reducing the risk of diabetes. As the intake of nutrients like iron, zinc and calcium are reduced on a vegan diet, our bodies 
<a>get better at absorbing them from the intestine</a>. The adaptation may be enough to prevent deficiencies in some people but not for everyone, in which case supplements can fill the shortfall.
<h3>From six months to several years on</h3>
<a>Symptoms of B12 deficiency</a> include breathlessness, exhaustion, poor memory and tingling in the hands and feet.
<a>B12 deficiency is easily prevented</a> by eating three portions of fortified food per day or taking a supplement, but managing it is very important, as any deficiency would negate the benefits of a vegan diet for 
<a>heart disease and stroke risk</a> and can cause permanent nerve and brain damage.
<a>our bones can’t absorb minerals anymore</a> and so getting enough calcium when we’re young is vital.
<p>After the age of 30, our bodies harvest the calcium from our skeleton for use in the body, and if we don’t replenish the calcium in our blood through our diet, our bones fill the deficit and become brittle as a result.</p>
<a>30pc increased risk of fracture among vegans</a> when compared to vegetarians and omnivores. Plant-based calcium is also harder to absorb and therefore supplements or plenty of fortified foods is recommended.
<a>our appetite for meat overall is declining</a>. With the right preparation, a vegan diet can be good for human health.
