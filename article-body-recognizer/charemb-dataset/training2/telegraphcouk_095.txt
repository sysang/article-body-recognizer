<header> <h1> Gardening jobs in January: what to plant and tidy in your garden </h1> <p> From sowing radishes to picking out the perfect potatoes, January is far from quiet in the garden </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lia Leendertz <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:24pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Provided the ground is not frozen, this time of year is a good opportunity to plant bare-root roses. </p>
<p>This winter I am planting three plants of opulent, ruffled, deep purple 'Charles de Mills’, a gallica rose, highly scented and perfect for edible use, just in case I fancy mixing handfuls of petals into a perfumed, summery cake. </p>
<p>But the hard work doesn't stop there. Here is everything you can do in your garden right now.</p>
<h2>What to do in the garden in January</h2>
<p>I have chanced a proper sowing of radishes this week, in pots in the greenhouse, tucked up with horticultural fleece for warmth. 'Mirabeau’ is a fine variety for early sowings, cylindrical and shiny red and white.</p>
<p>My <a>houseplants</a> are looking desperate: central heating is not their friend. Give them a treat by wiping their leaves then standing them on trays of pebbles and water to increase the humidity around their poor, dried out leaves.</p>
<p>Dahlia cuttings produce bigger flowers than tubers. So pull your tubers out of dormancy, nestle them into trays, water, then stand them on a heated propagating bench. When the shoots reach 3-4in you can start taking cuttings.</p>
<p>January calls for clean sweeps and I find myself itching to clear collapsed herbaceous plants. I try to leave most stems to provide homes for insects but chop out the bent stems and pile them in a corner so the bugs can snooze until spring.</p>
<p>The urge to sow is getting stronger, but its outlets are still necessarily limited. A jar or three of sprouting seeds will fend it off until a more sensible time of year, and provide fresh, crunchy salad ingredients, too.</p>
<p>Collect up ash from your all-wood fires (i.e. only those without coal) and sprinkle it around fruit trees and roses. It is rich in potassium, so encourages good flowering in spring, and hence good fruiting in autumn.</p>
<h2>Time to choose tomatoes</h2>
<p>Clear away fallen leaves wherever they lie over the shoots of bulbs or the crowns of perennials. This will give fresh spring growth the best chance of emerging unscathed and beautiful.</p>
<h2>Sow early-cropping peas</h2>
<p>On frosty mornings check your bird bath and melt the ice with a little boiling water. <a>Hanging a fat ball</a> will also help make your garden a life-saving calling point on these chilly days.</p>
<p>Prune your apple and pear trees. The general aim is to open up the centre, creating an elegant “goblet” shape. Remove dead and diseased branches completely, then reduce by a third the longest branches.</p>
<p>Order and plant out bare-root raspberries: much cheaper than container grown and often quicker to establish, too. I am planting a row of yellow 'All Gold’ and deep purple 'Glen Coe’, for rainbow fruit salads.</p>
<p>Don’t wait until spring to check your <a>mower</a> over, or you will find yourself at the back of the repair shop’s queue as the grass grows long. Clean it of old, dry grass, oil it, and start it up just to check.</p>
<p>This is an excellent moment for searching through borders and digging out perennial weeds that were hidden by growth all summer. Use a fork to ease them out, roots and all, and be one step ahead of them come spring.</p>
<h2>Think about evergreens</h2>
<h2>Protect dwarf nectarines</h2>
<p>I still have plenty of Oriental mustards and parsley in the ground, as well as a few winter lettuces, but they look mud-splattered and unappetising after rain or hail. Cover leafy winter veg with cloches and new leaves will be much more tempting.</p>
<p>There is still time to sow broad beans: I do it once outdoors in autumn, once now under cover, and, finally, outdoor sowing in April.</p>
<p>Sow hardy 'Aquadulce Claudia’ or 'Super Aquadulce’.</p>
<p>Pick the occasional sprig of winter scented shrubs lonicera, sarcococca and daphne and bring them indoors, where they will fill the entire house with their spring-like scents.</p>
<p>Get new garden infrastructure in now. I have put in an archway and a pair of matching obelisks: they provide height and structure and are in place in time for plants to scramble up them.</p>
<h2>Cut hazel support poles</h2>
<p>Make sure newly planted trees and perennials haven’t been lifted by frost, and firm them gently back into the soil with your boot if they have.</p>
<p>Clean out your water butts: few plants need watering now and we can be fairly sure of more rain to come. Drain, then scrub out with hot water and a stiff brush, or blast them with a power washer if you don’t mind a bit of slime in your hair.</p>
<p>Winter weather lays bare all my lawn’s shortcomings. Make a note to get onto the lawn during drier spells to push a garden fork straight down into it at intervals of about 12in (30cm), so allowing water to drain away.</p>
<p>Check the ties on young trees for looseness and stakes for wobbles. Some of the wildest winter weather could still be ahead of us.</p>
<p>January is the month for potato buying.</p>
<p>The best source of the best possible varieties – and to buy in handfuls rather than bagfuls if you favour diversity over bulk – are potato days, held in village halls and garden centres around the country. </p>
<p>This guide is kept updated with the latest advice.</p>

<a>No Time to Die</a> at the end of September led to the sector’s most successful October since 2012, with 16.4 million admissions recorded over the course of the month. (October 2012, in case you’re wondering, was Skyfall.)

<a>Mark Millar</a>, which cocked a streetwise snook at the brooding solemnity of the Daniel Craig Bond era. But the original Kingsman film, released in 2014, had enough lad’s mag allure – suits, babes, mayhem,
<a>vulgar humour</a>, and so on – to pull a significant crowd. Three years later, its puerile, smirking, infinitely worse sequel found just as much commercial success, which surely explains why this latest instalment feels so compromised.

<header> <h1> The 20 best films of 2021 </h1> <p> After the washout of 2020, picture palaces threw open their doors. Cinema was back with a vengeance – but what was the best film of the lot? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Robbie Collin, Film Critic <time> 17 December 2021 • 6:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Catchy songs, great choreography, an indecently attractive cast – Jon M Chu’s screen adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical was an ideal welcome-back gift when opening restrictions finally eased.</p>
<p><a>Read the full review</a></p>
<p>Ben Wheatley’s trippily macabre sylvan horror sprouted during the initial 2020 lockdown, brilliantly pinning down the percolating terror of the moment.</p>
<p>18. The Tragedy of Macbeth</p>
<p>Working in bone-chilling monochrome, Joel Coen reframes Shakespeare’s Scottish tragedy as the original film noir folie à deux. (Cinemas from Boxing Day.)</p>
<p>Rebecca Hall’s directorial debut: a radiant period piece about two female friends (Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga) navigating issues of racial identity in Jazz Age Harlem.</p>
<p>Riz Ahmed astounded in this moving, insightful, ingeniously sound-designed drama about a rock drummer suffering from hearing loss.</p>
<p>Seduction and sleaze intertwined in Edgar Wright’s time-shifting psychological thriller, which conjured an uneasy dream of 1960s London through immaculate craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Maggie Gyllenhaal’s riveting Elena Ferrante adaptation was a noir and melodrama tinged women’s picture for our times. Another terrific directorial debut from a gifted actress.</p>
<p>13. The Mitchells vs the Machines</p>
<p>Animation soared in 2021, and Sony Pictures Animation outdazzled even Disney and Pixar with this visually inventive techno-caper about a loveable dysfunctional family quelling a robot revolt.</p>
<p>After some build-up, Daniel Craig’s fifth and final outing as James Bond brought Britain flocking back to cinemas in earnest. Glitz and thrills were there in giddy abundance, along with a note-perfect send-off.</p>
<p>In a busy year for new musicals, this offering from Leos (Holy Motors) Carax and the art-pop duo Sparks was one of the best – and unquestionably the weirdest. With Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard and a singing puppet baby.</p>
<p>The first of two films this year from Sir Ridley Scott was one of the 84-year-old master’s best yet: a muscular, provocative, sometimes fiendishly comic moral fable about the rape of a noblewoman in medieval France.</p>
<p>Kristen Stewart dug rivetingly deep to play Princess Diana in this fairy-tale-tinged royal chamber piece from Pablo Larraín, which unfolds over a historically tense Christmas at Sandringham in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In 19th century Oregon, two enterprising settlers pilfer milk from the territory’s lone bovine in order to bake their way to prosperity. A gorgeous, absorbing hymn to human ingenuity and comradeship from Kelly Reichardt.</p>
<p>Adapted from a viral Twitter thread about two strippers on a chaotic road trip, Janicza Bravo’s electrifying underworld caper perfectly captured the zonked surreality and cryptic stakes of modern online life.</p>
<p>Three tall tales from a fictional French ville form the spine of Wes Anderson’s teeming comic fantasia – a celebration of creative niches far from home, and the wit and pluck they take to carve.</p>
<p>As a malevolent Montana cattle rancher, Benedict Cumberbatch gives the best (and perhaps least-expected) performance of his career in Jane Campion’s masterful psychological Western.</p>
<p>A tender and lyrical portrait of life on the margins of modern America from Chloé Zhao, with Frances McDormand as a middle-aged widow on a meandering road trip.</p>
<p>This dreamily pristine Haruki Murakami adaptation marked out Japan’s Ryusuke Hamaguchi as a world-cinema star in the making. A wonderful film about the interplay of life and art.</p>
<p>Denis Villeneuve’s magisterial adaptation of the classic Frank Herbert science-fiction novel reminded us just how singular and strange blockbuster cinema can be.</p>
<p>1. West Side Story </p>
<p>Better even than the iconic original, with some of the finest musical numbers ever committed to film, Steven Spielberg’s first musical was his greatest work in 20 years.</p>

<p>“In the olden days,” my six-year-old son confidently told me earlier this week, “you couldn’t have two boys dancing together.”</p>
<p>“That’s the best thing about John and Johannes,” his eight-year-old brother continued. “They’re kind of starting a new tradition.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” I said. “Why do you think it wasn’t allowed before?”</p>
<p>They both looked confused. “I don’t know,” the eight-year-old finally replied. “It was just really weird.”</p>
<p>Hurrah for changed times – and hurrah to John and Johannes for helping change them.</p>

<h1> Licorice Pizza, review: screwball meandering that feels seductively real </h1>
<p> Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest is a gently surreal romance that's not only set in the 1970s but feels as if it was actually made then </p>

<a>Bradley Cooper</a> almost steals the film as the volcanically tempered producer (and beau of Barbra Streisand)
<a>Jon Peters</a>. Meanwhile, reality intrudes in the form of a nationwide fuel shortage: a sequence in which a removal van runs out of petrol at the worst possible moment has a hair-raising Laurel and Hardy comic finesse.
<p>Anderson captures the essence of the time so effortlessly it feels almost accidental. But this kind of meandering requires consummate precision and artistry to pull off.</p>
