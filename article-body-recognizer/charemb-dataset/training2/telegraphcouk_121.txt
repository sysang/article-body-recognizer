<h1> There was no Christmas party in No10... and anyway, the guests followed all the rules </h1>
<p> Throughout a week of damaging allegations, ministers’ attempts to kill the story have been embarrassingly inept </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Michael Deacon <div>Columnist</div> <time> 7 December 2021 • 7:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Of course, investigating the claims now might seem like a waste of police time. But members of the public who held parties last Christmas were fined £10,000 each – on order of the Government.</p>
<p>Since the Government is so determined to move on from things that happened a year ago, perhaps Mr Raab should quietly reimburse them all.</p>
<p>As it happens, the university is in Liverpool, so the students might have been expected to have some experience of “Northern English” culture already. But perhaps they’ve been warned not to mix with the locals too closely.</p>
<p>I hope the Labour party is taking notes, so that it can provide similar trigger warnings to all candidates selected to stand in “Northern English” seats.</p>
<p>“Inhabitants of ‘Red Wall’ constituencies may express opinions on immigration, the EU and Jeremy Corbyn that many Labour candidates may find upsetting.”</p>
<h2>Cracking the Covid code</h2>
<a>the Telegraph letters page</a> has been
<a>the demise of school recorder lessons</a>. So this anagram may be the shadowy global elite’s way of warning us that the clarinet is next to go.
<p>At any rate, we should avoid calling Ms Spicer a conspiracy theorist. Because she would doubtless retort that that cruel slur is an anagram of ATROCITY CENSORSHIP.</p>
<p>Honestly. This shadowy global elite are simply too clever for their own good.</p>

<p>Agatha Christie’s Poirot, 9.00pm</p>
<p>New episode. The Belgian sleuth (David Suchet) takes on his toughest case yet, as a leading politician asks him to investigate whether or not a series of wild parties took place over a period of six weeks inside his own home.</p>
<p>I’ve only watched the trailer, but it looks terrific.</p>
<p>“So, Monsieur Johnson… you are telling me zat, on perhaps half a dozen separate occasions, as many as 50 people entered your abode and drunkenly played loud Christmas music for several hours, wizzout you ever noticing?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, Inspector… I’m a very heavy sleeper.”</p>
<p>“You slept right through, each time? Even though zeeze people were behaving as if zey were, how you say, backstage with Mötley Crüe?”</p>
<p>“I do have quite a stressful job, Inspector. So I always make sure to get a good night’s kip. That’s why, until this week, I’d never even heard about any of these parties.”</p>
<p>“I see, Monsieur. But you were not invited to attend zeeze parties zat were taking place inside your very own place of dwelling?”</p>
<p>“No. Never. But then, everyone knows I’m a terribly shy and retiring sort of chap. Not much of a party animal.”</p>
<p>“Have you tried reporting zis matter to the police?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but they got back extremely promptly to say that they couldn’t possibly investigate because there was absolutely no evidence that the parties ever took place.”</p>
<p>“Mais Monsieur, if the parties never took place, why has a young lady in your employment resigned over them?”</p>
<p>“I say, that’s a jolly good point. It does seem a bit odd, now you put it like that. Perhaps you could investigate that mystery, too.”</p>
<p>I can’t wait. It promises to be Poirot’s most gripping case since the mystery of the man who discovered to his shock that someone had paid to cover his flat in expensive designer wallpaper.</p>
<h2>Saving the world, one pair of Pampers at a time</h2>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, has issued the world with a stark warning. If we don’t start having more children, he says, civilisation will crumble.</p>
<p>In my view, we should follow the excellent example set by our Prime Minister, who, according to the latest estimates, now has at least seven children. At this rate he’ll save civilisation all by himself.</p>

<p>These days, it seems, there is no area of our lives in which we are free from being lectured. Now even our advent calendars are at it.</p>
<p>If customers complain that they’ve been ripped off, the company can tell them that this constitutes an important lesson about Western capitalism, too.</p>
<h2>Boris’s biggest fault: he’s simply too hard-working</h2>
<a>a series of riotous parties that took place last Christmas inside his own home</a>. Now it all makes sense. Our poor Prime Minister is suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
<p>None the less, his supporters will naturally be worried. Escaping the EU Working Time Directive may be a benefit of Brexit. But no one should be working a 168-hour week.</p>
<p>If the Prime Minister cannot be persuaded to take at least the odd half-hour break, Conservative MPs may feel they have no choice but to stage an intervention, and remove him from office for his own good. His health must come first.</p>
<a>owners may be made to undergo compulsory training</a>.
<p>Of course, it’s possible that in some cases the training will not succeed, and the owners will go on behaving in a dangerous manner. So as a precaution, it may be wise to make them wear muzzles, or even have them neutered.</p>
<p>But if all else fails, then, very sadly, there may be no alternative but to take them to a vet and have them destroyed.</p>

<h1> Don’t like how Boris is handling the pandemic? Think how much worse it would have been under Corbyn </h1>
<p> At this point, we might have been waving quartz healing crystals over our omicron-decimated chakras... </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Michael Deacon <div>Columnist Assistant Editor</div> <time> 15 December 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>All right, so the outlook isn’t entirely rosy right now. But let’s try to look on the bright side. Because there’s at least one thought that should lift our spirits.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson’s handling of the pandemic may not be drawing unanimous admiration. But under Jeremy Corbyn, things would have been an awful lot worse.</p>
<a>Richard Burgon</a> setting light to his lab coat with a Bunsen burner.
<p>Perhaps these visions are unfounded, and Professor Burgon would have produced a vaccine at a speed to make Moderna gasp. The question is: what would have been in it? </p>
<p>For Corbyn, this might have been a problem. Because he thinks it’s none of the public’s business. </p>
<p>A perfectly reasonable statement to make – if you’re a normal member of the public. Coming from a PM during a pandemic, however, it would have been less than ideal. Imagine him saying it at a Downing Street press conference.</p>
<p>“My scientists have assured me that this vaccine is safe.”</p>
<p>“So will you be having the jab yourself, Prime Minister?”</p>
<p>“No comment.”</p>
<a>scandals about lockdown-busting parties at No. 10</a>. But then I remembered that, last year, Mr Corbyn apologised after a photo was published of him attending a dinner party
<a>that broke the rule of six</a>. So even there we can’t be sure.
<p>Whatever we think of the current PM’s actions, then, we can at least tell ourselves that things could be worse. Then again, some people might not agree. Perhaps even Tory MPs.</p>
<p>“What a waste. He’s the greatest leader the Tories never had.”</p>
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> No, I will not let you know what I thought of my purchase </h1> <p> Please, no more emails pestering us for customer feedback. Plus: a solution to the Rod Liddle row... and Liz Truss’s startling new look </p> </div>

<p>It has enabled companies to pester us at all hours of the day and night, begging us for feedback on whatever it is we’ve bought from them.</p>
<p>Then again, I probably shouldn’t complain. Otherwise companies will start sending emails asking us what we thought of their email asking us what we thought.</p>
<p>“Good morning, madam, I’m from the Royal Mail. I wonder whether you could spare five minutes to let us know what you thought of our service this morning. You could win a discount on the next parcel you post.”</p>
<p>“Well… all right. I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, madam. Out of five, how would you rate the way I posted your letters through your letterbox?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Five, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, madam. And what about the way your post landed on your doormat?”</p>
<p>“Er… five again?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, madam. And would you recommend the Royal Mail to a friend?”</p>
<p>“The Royal Mail?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Er… yes. I suppose. But, to be honest, it’s not something that would normally come up in conversation.”</p>
<p>“So you wouldn’t recommend the Royal Mail to a friend?”</p>
<p>“Well… look, all right. Next time I see one of my friends, I’ll recommend to them that, if they’re thinking of posting a letter, they should consider using the Royal Mail.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, madam. Your feedback is very important to us.”</p>
<p>What a gracious offer. I urge the university authorities to accept it at once. Keep Prof Luckhurst, and let all the protesters go. </p>
<a>trying to look like Margaret Thatcher</a>. Now, however, the Foreign Secretary has upped the ante. Because she’s released a photo that seems designed to make her look like a figure of even greater stature than Lady T.
<p>I would however offer her a word of caution. In surveys about national treasures, one figure who always scores highly is Sir Trevor McDonald. I strongly advise Ms Truss not to pose for a photo in which she tries to look like him.</p>
<p>'Way of the World' is a twice-weekly satirical look at the headlines while aiming to mock the absurdities of the modern world. It is published at 7am every Tuesday and Saturday</p>

<p>Yesterday’s excuses were the most feeble yet. A newspaper had published a leaked photo of the Prime Minister and a large number of staff enjoying drinks in the Downing Street garden in May 2020, during the first, and strictest, lockdown.</p>
<p>At any rate, no one seems to have come up with a satisfactory alternative. Because when Dominic Raab, the Justice Secretary, was sent out on to the airwaves yesterday to defend what happened, he flapped and floundered like a fish on a dock.</p>
<p>Still, whatever the truth, good luck to everyone in Downing Street in their efforts to explain away the next set of allegations, whenever they emerge.</p>
<p>Organisers of real-life quidditch contests are planning to change the sport’s name, in order to “distance” themselves from <a>JK Rowling</a> after her comments on trans issues. I for one find this news deeply disturbing.</p>

<h1> Publicly rebuked, held in isolation and denied entry - Novak Djokovic's Australian Open dream unravels </h1>
<p> A day after sparking uproar over exemption from vaccination rules to play in Melbourne, world no 1 was sent packing over cancelled visa </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Rumsby <time> 5 January 2022 • 10:37pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It took barely 24 hours after he gleefully announced he had been allowed to enter the Australian Open by the back door for <a>Novak Djokovic’s plan to do so to unravel in spectacular fashion.</a></p>
<p>Just a day after his chance to win a record 21st grand slam looked to have been rescued, it was on the brink of being wrecked after he was dramatically denied entry to Australia and told he was being deported.</p>
<p>Djokovic was already aboard a 14-hour flight from Dubai to Melbourne when the first report emerged of an “issue” with his Australian Travel Declaration that would plunge the defence of his title into fresh doubt.</p>
<a>some of the strictest rules of any nation</a> when it comes to combating the disease, one in which an unprecedented regime of lockdowns has been inflicted on its citizens.
<p>The decision to grant Djokovic such an exemption was said to have been taken following what Tennis Australia proclaimed had been “a rigorous review process involving two separate independent panels of medical experts”.</p>
<p>All this put Djokovic – who has previously refused to reveal his vaccination status but has made it clear he opposes compulsory inoculation – under major pressure to disclose the criteria under which he had been granted an exemption.</p>
<p>Tennis legend Rod Laver told the Herald Sun it would be in Djokovic’s “best interests to own up”, adding: “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then ... we should know it.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re a great player and you’ve performed and won so many tournaments, so, it can’t be physical. So what is the problem?”</p>
<h2>'They are holding my son captive'</h2>
<p>He was questioned for hours by Australian Border Force (ABF) officials, with his father, Srdjan, telling Serbian radio station B92 his son was being held isolated in a room.</p>
<p>He later told Australian breakfast show Sunrise: “They are holding my son captive. If they don’t release him in the next half an hour, we will fight them on the street.”</p>
<p>In what was fast becoming a major diplomatic incident, Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic said his country was doing “everything to see that the harassment of Novak Djokovic is brought to an end immediately”.</p>
<p>“Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia.”</p>

<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Novak Djokovic is no victim but it's hard to stomach Scott Morrison's cynical opportunism </h1> <p> The world No 1 is being punished for political gain because Australia is now Covid-central </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Oliver Brown <div>Chief Sports Writer</div> <time> 6 January 2022 • 1:43am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Amid the riveting spy-novel drama of Novak Djokovic’s detention at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport, it was difficult to escape a sense that the vast majority of Australians were savouring every moment of his public humiliation. </p>
<a>sport’s most prominent vaccine sceptic</a> seemed, to put it politely, like a snub. Or, to put it in the words of one of his former opponents, New South Wales’ Sam Groth: “It spits in the face of every Australian.”
<p>It is not difficult to see how the Morrison government would rush to make political capital out of such scenes, crowing that even the world’s best tennis player was being held to the same standards as everybody else. </p>
<p>Mr Morrison, after all, is in the grip of a crisis. From being the land the pandemic forgot, Australia is now Covid-central, with 34,994 cases in New South Wales on Thursday and 21,997 in Victoria. </p>
<p>Mr Morrison’s message, delivered with Djokovic still at the airport, smacked of a leader already in full campaign mode. </p>
<p>“No one is above these rules,” he said. “Our strong border policies have been critical to Australia having one of the lowest death rates in the world from Covid, and we are continuing to be vigilant.”</p>
<p>Very few in tennis or beyond are much inclined to see Djokovic as a victim. The most prevalent view is that he only has himself to blame, that he could have saved himself the trouble by being vaccinated, just like most of his peers. </p>
<p>That unease is magnified by the posturing of Mr Morrison and his ministers, which suggests Djokovic is less the architect of his downfall than a pawn in a cynical political game.</p>
<header> <h1> Novak Djokovic refused entry to Australia as visa cancelled amid Covid vaccine row </h1> <p> World No 1 forced to fly home and could miss Australian Open following outcry over his 'medical exemption' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben Rumsby <time> 6 January 2022 • 4:29am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novak Djokovic has been dramatically refused entry to Australia, potentially wrecking his defence of his Australian Open crown <a>barely 24 hours after it looked to have been rescued.</a></p>
<a> major diplomatic incident,</a> Djokovic was told he was being deported after he was detained at Melbourne Airport amid claims he had attempted to enter the country using invalid documents following a mix-up with his visa.
<a>has said he is "opposed" to vaccines</a>. 
<p>Australian court documents show Djokovic's injunction request against his visa cancellation has been listed for a hearing at 4pm local time (5am GMT) in the Federal Circuit and Family Court.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australian Border Force said: "Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled.</p>
<p>"Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia."</p>
<p>Djokovic was taken to a government detention hotel on Thursday but while his lawyers appeal the visa decision the next movements of the world's best male tennis player remains unclear. The Australian Open begins on January 17.</p>
<p>He is staying at the Park Hotel in Melbourne, which is also used by the Australian Government to detain refugees.</p>
<p>Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that Djokovic had failed to provide sufficient proof to receive a medical exemption to enter the country and insisted that the Serb was not "singled out" for scrutiny over his visa cancellation.</p>
<p>He said: "Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders". </p>
<p>"In line with all standards of international public law, Serbia will fight for Novak Djokovic, justice and truth."</p>
<h2>Tennis star detained for hours</h2>
<p>Srdjan also told Australian breakfast show Sunrise: “They are holding my son captive. If they don’t release him in the next half an hour, we will fight them on the street.”</p>
<p>The Serbian was detained for hours upon arrival, with each passing minute appearing to increase the likelihood he would be thrown out of the country and denied the chance to go for a record 21st Grand Slam. </p>
<p>There was mounting speculation that the basis for Djokovic’s exemption was a rule designed to apply to those to have recovered from Covid-19 in the previous six months rather than one covering those with underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Tennis legend Rod Laver told the Herald Sun it would be in Djokovic’s “best interests to own up” about the criteria used in his case, adding: “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then ... we should know it.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Australian papers reacted with fury:</p>
<p>“We’ve always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the Federal Government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors.”</p>
<p>The Association of Tennis Professionals said last week that 95 of the world’s top 100 had been vaccinated against Covid. But Djokovic appears to be an exception. </p>
<h2>Anger at Djokovic's exemption</h2>
<p>In a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone”, Andrews said: “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements.</p>
<p>“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.</p>
<p>“Since Dec 15 2021 fully vaccinated eligible visa holders can travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption, and enter eligible states and territories quarantine free.</p>
<p>“If an arriving individual is not vaccinated, they must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons to be able to access the same travel arrangement as fully vaccinated travellers.</p>
<p>“Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our strict border requirements.”</p>
<p>After weeks of debate over Djokovic’s presence – or otherwise – at the Australian Open, the news had finally emerged via his own social media channels on Tuesday morning. </p>

<p>Smith was a study in torment at his untimely lapse. You would have thought he had just squandered the series, not inspired his players to a 456-run lead before lightning stopped play. Such are the unfeasible standards he demands of himself. </p>
<a>that he should have no role in any leadership group</a>. “If something happens to Pat Cummins and they make Smith captain, goodness me, I think there’ll be an outrage,” Warne argued.
<p>It was perhaps apt that his premature exit on 93 stifled any hysteria about redemption. But England could be in no doubt they had been in the presence, once again, of infernal genius.</p>
