<p>Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City educators, questioned whether the new testing initiatives will be available in every school by the time schools reopen Monday.</p>
<p>“We are moving closer to a safe reopening of school next week. But we are not there yet,“ he said.</p>
<p>Out of more than 13,000 school districts nationwide, relatively few have announced plans to start remotely after winter break.</p>
<p>Masks also will make a return in some districts after break, including Hopkinton High School, the first Massachusetts public school to lift the mandate, in October. It was reinstated just before break. </p>
<a> a Jan. 10 deadline for students 12 and older was postponed until fall of 2022. </a> Officials said the earlier date would have barred about 27,000 unvaccinated students from campuses.
<p><a>The District of Columbia on Dec. 22 </a> said all students, whether in public, private or charter schools, must be fully vaccinated by March 1.</p>
<p>In Ohio, where hospitalizations for COVID-19 hit a record high this week, the Ohio Hospital Association is asking schools statewide to consider mandatory mask wearing as cases continue to spike.</p>
<p>The patchwork of responses also includes Woodbury, New Jersey’s plans to bring students in for half days for the first week, sending them home with lunch so they don’t have to remove masks in the building to eat.</p>

<div><div><h1>Chicago teachers punished as classroom no-shows protest</h1></div><div>By SOPHIA TAREENJanuary 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago teachers punished for refusing to show up for the start of in-person classes over COVID-19 concerns, demonstrated Wednesday outside the school board president’s home. </p>
<p>Roberts said none of the 22 kids in her class returned for in-person instruction and her two co-teachers and a substitute were teaching in her absence. </p>
<p>With strong objections from the Chicago Teachers Union, the nation’s third-largest district has experienced a bumpy start to its gradual return to in-person instruction after going remote last March. </p>
<p>The union argues that the roughly 355,000-student district hasn’t gone far enough to protect teachers and seeks better metrics to determine reopening, widespread vaccinations and better classroom ventilation. </p>
<p>District officials released data late Wednesday showing about 73% of the expected 1,708 teachers reported for duty, slightly up from earlier in the week. Among all school employees, the rate was higher at roughly 78%. </p>
<p>Nearly 200 employees failed the health screening Wednesday. District officials said 100 employees, most of them teachers, still had not shown up to work without a valid excuse. </p>
<p>Illinois logged 5,862 new confirmed and probable infections and 97 additional deaths Wednesday, according to the state’s Department of Public Health. Overall, Illinois has reported more than 1 million cases and 17,840 deaths.</p>
<p>Chicago health officials say the city has recently averaged around 1,000 daily COVID-19 infections.</p>
