<p>The two are said to have met through events connected to a mutual interest in ocean preservation. They were pictured together while speaking at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Iceland in 2013.</p>
<p>Maxwell sold her Manhattan townhouse and they began living together in Manchester-by-the-Sea in 2016, which is said to be <a>around the time they wed</a>, although a marriage licence has never been found. </p>
<p>In 2019, Maxwell reportedly bought a $1.07 million mansion in Bedford, New Hampshire, about an hour's drive away. It was there that she was arrested by the FBI in an early-morning raid last July.</p>
<p>Details of their marriage emerged in July 2020, when court papers indicated that Maxwell had transferred all of her assets to a trust controlled by him.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to a federal judge in<a> support of her bail application</a>, Mr Borgerson called Maxwell a "wonderful and loving person" and said he believed she "had nothing to do" with Epstein's crimes.</p>
<p>The money offered up by the couple as a security bond represented the entirety of their joint assets, Maxwell's lawyers claimed.</p>
<p>A source quoted in The New York Times said Maxwell had been smitten with Mr Borgerson, calling him "hot" and "brilliant".</p>
<p>What she made of his vanishing act in her darkest hour is unknown. Both Mr Borgerson and Ms McGinn declined to answer questions when approached.</p>
<header> <h1> Who is Scott Borgerson, Ghislaine Maxwell’s 'secret' husband ? </h1> <p> First, the US tech millionaire offered $25m bail to free his British socialite wife – then it was revealed she was already divorcing him </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Guy Kelly <time> 19 December 2020 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<a>a bail application agreeing to a $22.5m (£16.6m) bond</a>, with five additional bonds totalling $5m (£3.7m) co-signed by seven of Maxwell’s close friends and family, appeared to confirm it.
<a>the Ghislaine I know is a wonderful and loving person</a>.”
<a>she was already in the process of divorcing him</a> at the time she was arrested by the FBI.
<p>Compared with almost everything else to do with Maxwell, Epstein and his murky web of high-profile connections that spans the past three decades, the story of how she met Borgerson at a conference seems almost refreshingly mundane.</p>
<a>Epstein died in jail</a>, Maxwell had vanished, leading the world’s media, authorities, amateur detectives and conspiracy theorists on a manhunt.
<p>“Ghislaine Maxwell is not at my home and I don’t know where she is,” Borgerson told Business Insider. “I’m passionate about ocean policy and wish people were as interested in ... joining the law of the sea.”</p>
<p>The law could wait. The scrutiny intensified, but Maxwell remained hidden, throwing the media a bizarre but successful red herring, by releasing an edited photograph showing her eating a burger on the opposite side of the country.</p>
<p>Today, Maxwell is in a 9ft by 7ft cell, <a>checked by guards every 15 minutes</a>, 24 hours a day. Her lawyers say she has lost 15lb in weight and her hair is falling out, though public sympathy is even thinner on the ground.</p>
<p>In October it was revealed that Borgerson, meanwhile, had stepped down from CargoMetrics after her arrest, to “ensure his presence would not become a distraction from the work he believes in so deeply”.</p>
<p>Now he stands by, seemingly willing to do whatever it takes – and whatever it costs – to free the wife who may have already been divorcing him. He’s #OpenToWork, though. And he may soon need the cash.</p>

<h1> How Ghislaine Maxwell went from privileged childhood into Jeffrey Epstein's arms - and finally prison </h1>
<p> Socialite daughter of Robert Maxwell is likely to die in jail after being found guilty of five counts related to the sexual abuse of girls </p>
<div> <div> By Jamie Johnson, US Correspondent <time> 29 December 2021 • 11:33pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>She stood with her hands folded as the jury filed out, poured a glass of water, hugged one of her lawyers and glanced at her siblings before being led from the courtroom herself.</p>
<p>Shuffling past the judge, the British socialite disappeared behind a heavy metal door where she was placed in four-point shackles, marched down three flights of stairs and ushered into a prison van.</p>
<p>Five guilty verdicts had been returned on the six charges she faced, including the most serious - trafficking a minor for sex.</p>
<p>The courtroom remained in stunned silence.</p>
<p>A lifetime of luxury first provided by her father, media mogul Robert Maxwell, and then by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein evaporated.</p>
<p>She will now likely die in prison after a jury of 12 New Yorkers found that she procured underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Some accusers claimed that she joined in with the abuse.</p>
<h2>The apple of her father's eye </h2>
<p>Born in 1961 on Christmas Day in Maisons-Laffitte, just outside Paris, Ghislaine was the youngest of nine siblings and the apple of her Czechoslovakian father’s eye.</p>
<p>He married French-born researcher Elisabeth Meynard in 1945 after meeting her following the liberation of Paris. At that point he was a captain in the British army and won a Military Cross for storming a German machine gun nest.</p>
<p>The family lived at the 53-room Headington Hill Hall in Oxford and Ghislaine attended Marlborough college, the private boarding school in Wiltshire. She later went on to earn a degree from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1985. </p>
<a>resting a high-heeled boot</a>” on the thigh of the current Prime Minister by his sister, Rachel. It was also at this time when Ghislaine Maxwell first met Prince Andrew, and maintained a friendship with him for the following two decades.
<p>In the late 1980s she founded the Kit Kat Club, a salon held in a variety of locations, designed to bring together women from the arts, politics and society. She was the definition of a socialite.</p>
<p>But her life was turned upside down when her father’s naked body was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean, having fallen from his 55-metre superyacht named in her honour - the Lady Ghislaine.</p>
<p>Soon after, Epstein and Ms Maxwell <a>started a romantic relationship</a>. Photographs released in court show them in loving embraces at various times and in various places across the world - including at Balmoral the Queen’s Scottish estate.</p>
<a>her social contacts and his vast wealth</a> (thought to be up to £630million) they rubbed shoulders with presidents, pioneers and royalty. But under the surface, a dark web of paedophilia and abuse was being spun.
<a>first approached a 14-year-old girl</a> eating ice cream with a group of classmates at an arts summer camp in Michigan. Jane, as she was referred to giving evidence in
<a>Ms Maxwell's trial</a>, said her family in Palm Beach, Florida, were struggling financially after her father's death the year before.
<p>Jane described her early impression of Ms Maxwell as “<a>like an older sister</a>”. “She seemed odd and quirky. She would tease me at times. She was nice.”</p>
<p>On several occasions she claimed other young girls joined them and it would “turn into an orgy” with them each performing acts on one another. “I was abused pretty much every time I went to his house. I became numb to it.”</p>
<p>Ms Maxwell made young girls feel comfortable around Epstein because she was a woman, another accuser, Annie Farmer, said. She betrayed that trust time and time again.</p>
<p>Bank statements published in court for the first time detailed wire transfers of $18.3 million in 1999, $5million in 2002 and $7.4million in 2007 from Epstein to Ms Maxwell.</p>
<p>All the while, and even after Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2007, the couple were able to maintain their social status.</p>
<h2>A close friendship with Prince Andrew</h2>
<p>Ms Maxwell made regular trips to the spa at Mar a Lago, owned by another friend, Donald Trump. It was there that the court heard that she met <a>Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a> for the first time.</p>
<a>Juan Alessi, the Palm Beach house manager</a>, described how Ms Maxwell told him to stop the car so she could talk to Ms Roberts Giuffre. Hours later, she arrived at
<a>Epstein’s house</a>. Ms Roberts Giuffre, who was not part of Ms Maxwell's trial alleges that she became a “sex slave” for Epstein and was pimped out to other men - including Prince Andrew. He strenuously denies the claims.
<p>Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, Ms Maxwell kept a Belgravia Mews house, where one British accuser says she was sexually assaulted by Epstein. </p>
<a>she massage her boyfriend.</a> This is the same house where Prince Andrew has been pictured with his arm around Virginia Roberts Giuffre, though he has suggested the photograph may have been faked.
<p>With the money, the photographs, the flight logs and the testimonies, the case against Ms Maxwell became insurmountable. In closing, defence lawyers said: “Everyone knew Jeffrey was keeping secrets from Ghislaine, except Ghislaine.”</p>
<p>The jury did not believe it, and instead found that Maxwell was integral to Epstein’s nexus of abuse.</p>
<a>find Ghislaine Maxwell guilty </a>on five counts and the 60-year-old is now facing up to 70 years in prison.
<h1> The fall of Ghislaine Maxwell: How the socialite I knew thought she was untouchable </h1>
<p> Glamorous, cold and calculating, I saw her dazzle – but she was never a girls’ girl and it was always men who defined her </p>
<div> <div> By Anna Pasternak <time> 31 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The key is surely Robert Maxwell who, incidentally, introduced her to Epstein in the late Eighties, when Epstein was working as an international arms dealer and possible spy, under the guidance of Maxwell himself. </p>
<p>I spent my early childhood in Oxford, where the Maxwell family loomed large. My older sister, Jane, went to prep school with Ian and Kevin Maxwell, and was invited to parties at the family home, Headington Hill Hall. </p>
<p>She is, it seems, an extraordinary character – conjured almost from the pages of a novel – who only beats to the drumming demands of a rich man without questioning morality or consequence. </p>
<a>Interestingly at the trial, she was heard speaking with her siblings</a>, Ian, Kevin, Christine and Isabel, who attended daily, in French.) 
<p>I attended a few of these gatherings, where Ghislaine dazzled. At the time, I felt in awe of her for championing women. It’s a thought that chokes me now, when she went on to betray the sisterhood in such a despicable, depraved way.</p>
<p>Aged 22, her father made her a director of Oxford United Football Club. Then, in the spring of 1991, he put Ghislaine in charge of “special projects” for the American tabloid he had acquired, the New York Daily News. </p>
<p>But that gilded existence came to a stunning halt barely six months later when Maxwell fell to his death into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Perhaps none of us should be surprised. Ghislaine’s incredible lack of human empathy or concern for anyone or anything but her own material comfort and status was always there in plain sight. </p>

<h1> Lawyer who won Ecuador oil case against Chevron back in court fighting 'most vicious corporate counterattack in US history' </h1>
<p> Case centres on decision by Ecuador courts to order company to pay $9.5bn in damages to people blighted by decades of polluted air and water </p>
<div> <div> By Josie Ensor, US Correspondent <time> 10 May 2021 • 10:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It was a decade ago that Steven Donziger seemed to have brought Chevron to its knees, winning a landmark $9.5 billion (£6.7bn) settlement against the oil giant for dumping toxic waste in Ecuador. </p>
<p>The verdict, experts say, could set a terrifying precedent in efforts to hold global corporations accountable for wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters, Susan Sarandon and other supporters gathered outside the courtroom to press for Mr Donziger’s acquittal. </p>
<p>The New York prosecutors’ office refused to take on the case, leaving the prosecution to be handled by a firm that has previously worked for Chevron.</p>
<p>The case centres on a decision by the Ecuador courts to order the US multinational company to pay $9.5bn (£6.7bn) in damages to people blighted by decades of polluted air and water, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind.</p>
<p>In order to avoid paying the damages, Chevron moved its assets out of the country. Refusing to pay, they claimed “shocking levels of misconduct” and fraud by Mr Donziger, 59, and the Ecuadorian judiciary.</p>
<p>In an unexpected twist, the company counter-sued, alleging in 2014 that Mr Donziger’s team ghost-wrote what should have been an independent assessment and offered a $500,000 bribe to sway the judgment. </p>
<p>As part of its case, Chevron subpoenaed and sued dozens of people who helped Mr Donziger’s case, legal records show, as well as requesting documentary film outtakes that featured the Harvard-trained lawyer.</p>
<p>Mr Guerra later admitted that parts of his testimony were untrue.</p>
<p>Mr Donziger denied any wrongdoing and the Ecuador supreme court later affirmed the original ruling. But Chevron won their case.</p>
<p>Mr Donziger was made liable for millions of dollars in Chevron’s legal costs and the company was granted seizure of his laptop and phone. </p>
<p>When he appealed, claiming the devices contained sensitive client information, the judge hit him with criminal contempt charges that led to an unprecedented 600-day house arrest.</p>
<p>Mr Donziger’s New York law license was revoked and his bank accounts were frozen. </p>
<p>He has been confined to his apartment in Manhattan with an ankle monitor bracelet for nearly two years, conditions which human rights and environmental watchdog groups have called excessive.</p>
<p>He has claimed it is the "most vicious corporate counterattack in American history".</p>
<p>The New York courtroom was heated on Monday, with Judge Loretta Preska interrupting the counsel for Mr Donziger’s opening statement more than half a dozen times and sustaining every objection from the prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr Donziger, who was wearing a "Free Donziger" mask, faces six months in prison if convicted. A decision could be reached as early as this week.</p>
<p>The Ecuador legal fight has become one of the longest in history, even longer than the one that followed the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.</p>
<p>Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron’s estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff’s time. </p>
<p>Mr Donziger has amassed a number of high-profile supporters, including actor Alec Baldwin, Sarandon, Waters and dozens of Nobel laureates.</p>
<p>Outside the court on Monday, Mr Waters addressed a crowd. “The winners of this case are you, the people who want to see a future for our children, our grandchildren,” the British musician said.</p>
<p>After graduating from Harvard Law in 1991, Mr Donziger became a public defender in Washington DC. </p>
<p>During the first Gulf War, Mr Donziger helped document civilian casualties and co-authored a report adopted by the United Nations. Since 1993, the Ecuador pollution case has consumed his legal career.</p>
<p>He visited Ecuador in 1993, where he says he saw "what honestly looked like an apocalyptic disaster," including children walking barefoot down oil-covered roads and jungle lakes filled with oil.</p>
<h1>Ecuador's Amazonians sue Chevron over poison waterways </h1>
<p>Tens of thousands of Ecuadoreans living in the Amazon rainforest are suing Chevron, the US oil company, for poisoning their waterways in what is billed as one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in history.</p>
<div> <div> <span> By Aislinn Laing </span> <time> 15 November 2009 • 1:38pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The claimants say the company illegally dumped toxic waste from its oil production which filtered into the waterways and lakes used by thousands of people for washing, drinking and cooking. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The result, they say, was an environmental disaster worse than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, which in turn has provoked a public health crisis, with soaring levels of cancer, birth defects and miscarriages. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Some 30,000 Amazonians are behind a lawsuit to be heard by an Ecuadorian judge. Experts say the company might have to pay up to $27bn (£16bn) in damages. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The company insists there is no proof that any illnesses were caused by its operations, and says the responsibility for cleaning the area lies with the Ecuadorian government and Petroecuador, the state oil firm. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Chevron says the court case is the result of the exploitation of the indigenous population by US trial lawyers in connivance with a corrupt government. </p> </div> </div>
<p>The issue is also the subject of Crude, a recent and critically-acclaimed documentary by Joe Berlinger. The rags-to-riches tale of the chief Ecuadorian lawyer fighting the case has also earned it a place on the front cover of Vanity Fair. </p>
<div> <div> <p>Texaco, which is owned by Chevron, first started operating in Sucumbíos, in northeastern Ecuador in 1964 and in 26 years made $490m (£294m) and produced 1.7 billion barrels of oil. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>As the operator of a consortium with Petroecuador, it drilled hundreds of wells in an area of 1,500 square miles and for each one, a series of pits in which to put the water produced as a byproduct of the oil. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Those fighting Chevron claim the 18 billion gallons of water put into the pits was toxic and was allowed to overflow into nearby rivers. They also claim Texaco spilled an additional 17 million gallons of crude oil. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The resulting contamination has increased cancer rates in the area threefold, they claim, and led directly to the deaths of 1,400 people. </p> </div> </div>
<p>One of the families allegedly affected is that of five-year-old Yahaira Sanchez. Yahaira's grandmother died of cancer and her parents are terrified the girl could fall ill too, but they are forced by lack of options into using the local water. </p>
<div> <div> <p>Yahaira's father William, who farms his own smallholding, said: "We want to move to protect Yahaira's health but we are too poor."</p> </div> </div>
<p>Another local man, known only as Roberto, told Penny Marshall, an ITN correspondent who investigated the issue, that his son had died of leukemia and his wife was suffering from cancer. Asked why, he said: "I think it's the contamination."</p>
<div> <div> <p>Asked whether the firm had fulfilled its moral obligations to the Ecuadorians, he said: "We are in the business of producing energy for the future, not the cleaning up after other companies or making trial lawyers rich."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Despite this, he said, the Ecuadorian judge hearing the case in Lago Agrio, the provincial capital, was likely to rule against Chevron later this year. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><i>* Penny Marshall's full investigation will be broadcast on ITV News at Ten on November 16 and 17. </i></p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1>Pakistan capture al-Qa'eda "most wanted"</h1> </header>
<div> <div> <time> 29 July 2004 • 8:31pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Pakistan has arrested a senior al-Qa'eda figure with a bounty of up to $25 million on his head, the country's Interior Minister has said.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat said the suspect had been captured during a raid in central Pakistan a few days ago. He did not identify the captive but said he was "a person who is most wanted internationally".</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Al Arabiya satellite news channel quoted Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as saying the suspect was arrested on Sunday.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"The Pakistani president said the arrested person is Tanzanian who is married to an Uzbek woman, and who is wanted by the United States," the station said. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Al Arabiya said the suspect may be Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian who is on the FBI's most wanted "terrorists" list for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings by al-Qa'eda of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Ghailani was among seven people about whom the United States was seeking information in May amid fears of a possible attack in the near future.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>An FBI Web site lists Ghailani as a suspect in the African embassy bombings and says it is offering a reward of up to $25 million for information leading to his capture.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A Pakistani official said on Tuesday that the country's security forces were holding three Africans, including a Tanzanian, suspected of being militants after a shootout last week.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Another said the suspects had been trying to flee Pakistan along with their families, using fake documents, after living in neighbouring Afghanistan.</p> </div> </div>
<h1>Guantánamo prisoner Ahmed Ghailani cleared of 276 charges</h1>
<p>The first Guantánamo Bay prisoner to face a civilian trial in the US has been found not guilty of hundreds of terrorism charges for the bombings of American embassies in Africa in 1998.</p>
<div> <div> <span> By Jon Swaine in New York </span> <time> 18 November 2010 • 1:41am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a blow to the Obama administration, Ahmed Ghailani, a 36-year-old Tanzanian, was on Wednesday night cleared by a jury in New York of 276 counts of murder and attempted murder and five counts of conspiracy. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He was convicted of just one charge of conspiring to damage or destroy American property with an explosive device, but still faces at least 20 years in prison. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Ghailani had been accused of plotting with an al-Qaeda cell to kill US citizens in the attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A spokesman said the Department of Justice was “pleased that Ahmed Ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings.” </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>However the verdict was viewed as a setback to the plan by Barack Obama, the US President, to try alleged terrorists, including the self-proclaimed ringleader of the 9/11 attacks, in civilian courts. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Ghailani was held by the CIA after being arrested in Pakistan in July 2004. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He was transferred to the prison at the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in late 2006. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The prosecution against him was dogged by problems after the judge, Lewis Kaplan, blocked it from using its star witness, who claimed he had sold Ghailani the explosives used in the Tanzania attack. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Judge Kaplan barred the use of the witness, Hussein Abebe, because his confession had been extracted during interrogations in a secret CIA prison, where his lawyers say he was tortured. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The prosecution claimed Ghailani had helped to buy a Nissan truck and gas tanks used in the Tanzania attack, and that his mobile phone had been used by plotters in the weeks leading up to the bombing. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>“Call him a fall guy. Call him a pawn,” his lawyer, Peter Quijano, said in his closing argument. “But don’t call him guilty.”</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Jurors deliberated for five days after a month-long trial. Earlier this week, one passed a note to the judge asking to be excused because they felt threatened by fellow jurors. The request was turned down. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Four other men were convicted 10 years ago of carrying out the attacks and were sentenced to life in prison. Ghailani is due to be sentenced on January 25. </p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1> Prince Andrew served with legal papers over sexual assault lawsuit </h1> <p> The Duke of York has until September 17 to respond after documents were handed over at his home in Windsor, US affidavit states </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 10 September 2021 • 7:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York has officially been served with the civil lawsuit alleging sexual assault, according to a document lodged with a New York court on Friday.</p>
<p>He was served on August 27 at his home in Windsor and has until September 17 to respond, the affidavit states.</p>
<p>“Service was accepted by Metropolitan Police Office/Head of Security at Royal Lodge,” according to the legal team of his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. </p>
<p>The suit was formally served by “corporate investigator” Cesar Augusto Sepulveda, who works for a London-based process server.</p>
<p>Mr Sepulveda arrived at Royal Lodge at 9.30am on August 26, left a business card and was asked to wait before speaking to two Metropolitan Police officers, the document reveals. </p>
<p>They were unable to raise the Duke’s private secretary but told him they had been told not to accept any court papers and gave him a number for his lawyer, Gary Bloxsome, for whom he left a message.</p>
<p>Staff had “already been primed not to allow anyone access on to the property to serve court process and instructed anyone not to accept the service”, according to the document.</p>
<p>Mr Sepulveda returned to Royal Lodge at 9.15am the following day and spoke to the head of security, who told him to leave the paperwork at the main gates and that it would be forwarded to the Duke’s legal team. </p>
<p>The complaint and summons, enclosed in a plastic sleeve and A4 envelope, addressed to the Duke, was therefore deemed officially served, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>However, despite the detailed claims made in the court document, Mr Bloxsome has rejected the method of service, which he described as “regrettable” and procedurally improper.</p>
<p>He accused Ms Giuffre’s legal team of failing to follow correct procedures, claiming the lawsuit should be served via a British court official, who would act as an intermediary.</p>
<p>If the judge overseeing the case made such a request, he said it was “likely” the Duke would “agree to a convenient method of alternative service”, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.</p>
<p>Mr Bloxsome also revealed in the letter, dated September 8, that he hoped to strike out the sexual assault claim, believing that a confidential settlement Ms Giuffre reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009 could make her claim for damages invalid.</p>
<p>He is trying to access the sealed document, suggesting that without it the case cannot proceed.</p>
<p>Mr Bloxsome said the 2009 agreement may have led to the dismissal, by consent, last month of Ms Giuffre’s high-profile civil claim against Alan Dershowitz.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre had accused Mr Dershowitz, a lawyer who previously represented Epstein, of sexual assault in 2019. </p>
<p>However, she reportedly dropped the claim last month because the settlement she reached with Epstein released him and others from certain claims.</p>
<p>Mr Dershowitz is now trying to get the 2009 agreement unsealed and has asked for a copy to be sent to the Duke’s lawyers, to help them get the case against him dropped. The judge in his case has not yet ruled on that request.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre, now 38, has accused the Duke of “rape in the first degree”, sexual battery and sexual abuse, when she was 17. </p>

<p>How was I to know that the owner of this admirable menagerie had eight kittens she was trying to get rid of? </p>
<p>“Isn’t he magnificent?” Natalya sighs happily as North pulls down the curtains. Or: “Oh look! Northy is stripping another wall with his sweet little claws.” </p>
<p>“What’s to become of us?” Freddie will say. And Beatrice will add: “He’s already eaten the rug.” </p>
<p>As yet, “Northy” is only a kitten. God knows what will happen when he grows up. Start to demand fresh kills, I expect. </p>

<p>“When I walked into the place – people gasped,” she tells me. “Someone asked, ‘How does it feel being naked?’ I said, ‘It feels great.’”</p>
<p>“I still get away with a lot and wear clothes I wore years ago,” she says. “[Although] you don’t have to be naked to look great.”</p>
<p>Cher is a fan, explaining that she first discovered the ultra-cosy designs years ago when filming Down Under. “And I just got the Oh Yeah slides for my mom, who is 95 and fabulous,” she adds. </p>
<p>As evidenced by her answer when I ask what her fashion priorities are.“It depends on what I’m getting dressed for. Even though I don’t want to be uncomfortable, sometimes you do have to sacrifice comfort for beauty.”</p>

<p>Associations with the seasons offer a simple four-way categorisation – bright warm colours are summer, soft warm colours are autumn, and spring and winter tick off the cooler, bluer side of the spectrum. </p>

<header> <h1> Inside the battle for the most desirable beach huts in Britain </h1> <p> Queuing for more than 24 hours to get their hands on a summer rental is now a tradition for some families </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Joe Shute, Senior Feature Writer <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Normally he gets down to the beach at around 7am, but this year he had an inkling that demand might be higher than usual. He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<a>And people are prepared to wait, and wait, in order to get hold of a coveted key</a>.
<p>“The first year I queued I was soaked,” Ken recalls. “The rain was lashing in so badly I had to go home and get changed a couple of times.”</p>
<p>While beach huts are becoming increasingly luxurious – there are whispers that some of the privately-owned ones on Avon Beach have fridges and gas cookers – for many the true joy of them lies in their privation.</p>
<p>For another in the New Year queue, 76-year-old retired police officer Roger Learney, the beach huts are a reminder of family holidays in the 1950s when his father would always rent them out for the summer on Avon Beach.</p>
<p>They also assiduously plan for the queue. His wife divvies up a shift rota between Roger, his sister and their daughter and her husband, with whom they share a nearby holiday home.</p>
<p>Aside from some “friendly banter” and “the odd complaint about snoring”, at that late stage, he says everyone in the queue was just trying to snatch a few hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Once the booking was secured, they celebrated with a family roast dinner – although not before they had all caught up on a bit of kip.</p>
<h2>The rise of the beach hutterati</h2>
<p>This is unusual and it is because the land is owned by the village’s common lands charity, so we pay the seller for the value of the structure and the charity an annual licence fee.</p>
<p>But for local beach hut owners, it’s simply a joy to have a place to entertain family and friends – and boy, do you acquire a lot of friends if you have a hut.</p>
<p>I find it surprising that so many are prepared to shell out a fortune on fittings, when most beach huts get regularly whacked and often flooded by high tides and some disappear altogether in overnight storms.</p>
<p>I discovered this, soon after I moved to the coast, when I overheard two women talking in a designer changing room in Southwold.</p>
<p>The first cooed, “Oh, I didn’t know you had a beach hut darling! Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Just north of the pier,” came the reply.</p>
<p>There was a pause and then, with the kind of sigh you might deliver to a friend whose dog had recently died, the first woman replied.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear. You must come to ours. We’re at Gun Hill.”</p>
<p>I soon learnt this is the posh end of the beach.</p>

<h2>The most in-demand beach hut locations in Britain</h2>
<h2>Porthkidney Sands Beach, Cornwall</h2>
<p>Scotland doesn’t have a private beach hut tradition, but a gaggle of 30 windowless huts, smaller than prison cells, went on sale on the Moray Firth for £25,000 in 2017. Despite objections by locals, six new ones were added last year.</p>

<header> <h1> Six simple tricks to improve your eating habits in 2022 and beyond </h1> <p> Research shows that looking at how and why we eat is just as important as what we eat when it comes to making a meaningful long term change </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Eleanor Steafel <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:20pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Rather than beating yourself up for a Christmas filled with treats, why not think of January as a month to reset your relationship with food?</p>
<p>“Food is always a part of emotional regulation but because we’ve been limited in so many different ways, food has gone up the ladder even further.</p>
<p>So, how to approach a January food reset?</p>
<h2>1. Don’t diet – make tweaks</h2>
<p>It’s the simplest way to avoid getting into a “cycle of denial and indulgence” that leaves you feeling guilty every time you reach for the chocolate or crisps, says Ogden.</p>
<h2>3. Get your first meal of the day right</h2>
<p>“If you can get off the day on the right track, it usually does have a knock on effect on the rest of the day, whereas if you don’t start off on the right foot it can quite quickly go downhill.”</p>
<h2>4. Cut out liquid calories</h2>
<p>“If you’re somebody who has two lattes a day and likes a smoothie from the chiller, you’d actually find making that simple change would have quite a big impact.</p>
<p>“If you do two or three of those things then you might find there’s not really much need to go onto that faddy diet.”</p>
<p>Noting down what you eat and why can be a helpful way to keep asking yourself those questions, says nutritionist Jane Clarke, founder of Nourish.</p>
<h2>6. How to kick your snacking habit</h2>
<p>For Clarke, a simple but effective area to address is snacking.</p>
<p>If you’re “needlessly nibbling” while watching TV, she says you’re probably “not concentrating on the food”.</p>
<p>She recommends making a nutrient-packed vegetable soup that you could have a mug of mid-afternoon rather than reaching for toast or biscuits.</p>

<header> <h1> How to (finally) get a good night's sleep </h1> <p> Whatever you have planned for 2022, without a robust sleep regime, you’re unlikely to achieve it. Here's where to start... </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Guy Meadows, Clinical Director of The Sleep School <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:41pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Whatever you have planned for 2022, without a robust sleep regime, you’re unlikely to achieve it. But that begs the question: how do you actually improve sleep? Where do you even start?</p>
<a>Alzheimer’s</a>. If doctors could prescribe sleep, we would call it a wonder drug.
<p>Alcohol and caffeine are known to worsen our sleep. I won’t go as far as recommending a total boycott – that’s unrealistic. But I would advise you to avoid caffeine after midday, and to limit alcohol to three nights each week.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, by accepting these negative thoughts and feelings, you remove the obstacles that are blocking sleep. You create an internal environment in which sleep can emerge.</p>
<p>But whatever your relationship with sleep, it’s important to try and prioritise it in 2022. Without sleep, nothing else will fall into place.</p>
<header> <h1> Six easy and healthy recipes to kick start your 2022 </h1> <p> The duo behind BOSH! offer fun, vegetarian meals that are just right for being kind to our bodies and our wallets this New Year </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:24pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>To call BOSH! a sensation is, if anything, an understatement. Since Sheffield-born friends Ian Theasby and Henry Firth founded the plant-based brand it has gained two billion views on social media and three million followers. </p>
<p>An ITV series followed, along with a supermarket range and <a>four bestselling cookbooks</a>, sold in eight languages in 60 countries.</p>
<a>plant-based eating</a> was ready to explode.
<a>BOSH! On a Budget</a>, seeks to prove that plant-based dining needn’t be the preserve of the well-off.
<p>Recipes from BOSH! on a Budget by Henry Firth and Ian Theasby (HarperCollins, £16.99). Order you copy from <a>The Telegraph Bookshop</a>. </p>
<h2><a>Mushroom stroganoff</a></h2>
<p>This recipe is super simple but ridiculously effective. Deliciously tender mushrooms in a rich, flavour-packed sauce with lovely mild spice. Serve with rice, mashed potatoes or pasta for a superb, warming, comforting meal!</p>
<h2><a>Black bean soup and chilli cornbread</a></h2>
<p>This delicious, hearty soup is packed with protein-rich black beans, sweet kernels of corn and rich in warming Tex-Mex flavours. Serve with a crumbly cornbread that’s laced with a hint of spice and perfect for dipping.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Carrot and coriander soup</a></h2> <p>This is a BOSH! take on an absolute classic soup flavour combo.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Baked ratatouille with basmati rice</a></h2>
<p>In the BOSH! kitchen, we find simple ratatouille to be a little boring, so we wanted to make something truly outstanding. This Mediterranean-flavoured dish tastes as good as it looks.</p>
<h2><a>Jackfruit larb with baby gem lettuce and soy dressing</a></h2>
<p>Is it a salad? Is it a wrap? No. It’s larb, and it’s here to make your lunchtime tastier. This is a brilliant healthy-but-tasty finger-food meal for when you have friends over and want to serve something fun and informal.</p>
<h2><a>Big-batch bolognese sauce</a></h2>

<header> <h1> How to feed your gut to lose weight and fight illness </h1> <p> Taking care of yourself with a varied, fibre-rich diet is a great way to boost health – and you don’t need to be vegetarian to do it </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Dr Megan Rossi <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:13pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Our microbiota typically alters with age, exposing us to dysbiosis and the ensuing inflammation that’s the root of many chronic diseases. But it’s not a life sentence. We can dictate much of our gut diversity by how we treat it. </p>
<p><a>What our microbes love most of all is an abundant and diverse range of fibre</a>. Where does that come from? Plants. Plant-based diversity is more than just a trend – it’s based on a groundbreaking scientific discovery.</p>
<h2>A diet that lets you eat more</h2>
<p>There is no calorie counting here, no weighing and measuring, and no cutting out. I recommend people aim for 30 – yes, 30 – different plants over the course of a week. It’s much easier than you think if you follow my easy hacks.</p>
<p>Why this target? The five-a-day rule can be a good place to start, but it totally ignores the trillions of microbes living in our gut. They all need different types of plants to flourish. </p>
<p>So when I say eat more, it’s not just about quantity, but also variety. </p>
<p>While an estimated 300,000 edible plant species are available to humans, more than half of our global energy needs are met by just four: rice, potatoes, wheat and maize. </p>
<p>Many of us just reorder the same supermarket delivery, week in, week out. But our gut microbiota need us to shake it up a bit. </p>
<h2>Tea, coffee and even dark chocolate count </h2>
<p>The recommended daily intake of fibre is 30 grams in most countries. The average intake? Well under 20 grams. Our ancestors, on the other hand, used to clock up about 100 grams a day! </p>
