<p>SIR – I was appalled at the advice from the AA quoted in your report on safe driving on the motorway <a>(“Don’t wait in your car after a smart motorway breakdown”</a>, December 3). </p>
<p>Rona WakefieldLuton, Bedfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – When you work part-time in medicine, what really happens is that you work the number of hours that those outside medicine would consider to be full-time.</p>
<p>In spite of 46 per cent of UK-registered doctors being women, and a pattern of women medical school entrants outnumbering men, being a doctor is seen as a male role.</p>
<p>As representatives of the BMA Network of Elected Women, we are aware that we have got a societal problem about the way women in medicine are perceived. This needs to change.</p>
<a>Letters, December 2</a>). When I thanked the doctor for seeing me he said: “That’s what I’m here for.” Alas, Covid etiquette forbade me from kissing him.

<h2>Painful recorder music</h2>
<p>SIR – Like Ken Atkinson's (<a>Letters, December 2</a>), my school was visited by the Carl Dolmetsch Recorder Ensemble. Far from being put off, I was inspired to learn and still play at the age of 75.</p>
<p>It’s a mistake to judge an instrument by how it sounds played by a child but, even when played by an expert, the ukulele doesn’t sound beautiful.</p>
<p>Tom RadcliffeRochdale, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – In the 1960s, when I was learning to play the recorder, my mum told me that the racing pigeons in the shed at the bottom of the garden would love to listen to me practise every day.</p>
<p>SIR – When my brother and I were at primary school there weren’t enough recorders for everyone, so he was given a ruler to play. He eventually got a recorder, but he preferred the ruler.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 5 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The reaction to the omicron variant has shown us what will happen when another mutation emerges, and another one after that. We have seen the panicked imposition of restrictions on our freedoms, without proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>All Covid developments should be taken seriously, but this does not justify the illiberal policies advocated by zero-Covid fanatics. The journey back to normality has stalled.</p>
<p>SIR – I have had enough of the way this Government panics whenever a new variant rears its head.</p>
<p>I’ve been triple-jabbed and flu-jabbed, yet still the powers that be are not satisfied. This nonsense must stop.</p>
<p>John BakerCrayford, Kent</p>

<p>Archie Graham-PalmerWrexham</p>
<p>SIR – No 10 has told us not to cancel our Christmas celebrations. I’m sure we can rely on it to do that for us.</p>
<p>David McManamonHighworth, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – Thank goodness the Government has made “face coverings” mandatory in crowded situations.</p>
<p>I hope that these rules are in place throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Robert Simpson-WhiteColeford, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – It seems I must wear a mask on London transport and in shops but not when I do a pilates class or play bridge at my club.</p>
<p>SIR – I tried to book a booster jab. All the options were miles away, so I left it.</p>
<p>Later, I tried again and secured a venue that I could walk to. When I arrived, I discovered that the clinic had been cancelled. Nobody had told me.</p>
<p>I then booked another venue but that involves standing in a long queue for some 45 minutes outside at 6.30pm in the freezing cold. What is going on with our once fantastic vaccination programme?</p>
<p>Stan GrabeckiSt Albans, Hertfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – During the Winter of Discontent, when there were long-term power outages throughout the country, my father bought a small portable generator, fuelled by petrol.</p>
<p>Alan BelkLeatherhead, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – There is no business case for HS2 (Letters, November 28).</p>
<p>Even on today’s trains it is possible to get from Leeds to London in less than four hours, and we can get from Preston to London in about two and a half hours. Birmingham to London is around two hours.</p>
<p>This would enable the faster express trains to go through at speed. There would also be enough money left to improve rail services in the North; this could be contracted to the firms working on HS2, so everyone wins.</p>
<p>Dr Robert MitchellPoulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – With regard to the drive to go cashless<a> (Letters, November 28)</a>, I would like to know: how would I use a supermarket trolley, give my paper boy a Christmas tip or slip a couple of pounds into a charity collecting box?</p>
<p>Joy StrawbridgeTorquay, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – We must continue to have the choice to use cash.</p>
<p>We need it not just to pay the window cleaner or the odd-job man, but also to teach our children and grandchildren the value of money.</p>
<p>These are essential life experiences and we cannot let them disappear.</p>
<p>SIR – The sport of shin-kicking <a>(Letters, November 28) </a>was also carried out by coal miners in Wigan. It was called “porring” in the local vernacular.</p>
<p>The miners would wear their work clothing – long trousers and leather clogs with metal toecaps. One can only surmise that any injury would be used as an excuse to have a break from the terrible conditions below ground.</p>
<p>Anthony BerryWigan, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – You<a> report </a>on the calls for private country house owners to be given a “level playing field” with the National Trust on tax “if heritage is to be secured”.</p>
<p>We need a system that reflects the reality of maintaining listed buildings today, irrespective of their size or ownership structure. VAT relief would indeed help but it should only be part of the changes to the listed property landscape.</p>
<p>“Heritage” sits within all of these 400,000 properties – not just the income-generating ones managed by the National Trust and English Heritage, for instance. A review of the tax treatment and legislation is long overdue.</p>
<p>Vanessa JonesEdenbridge, Kent</p>

<p>SIR – Once, when giving my name on the phone, I was asked how to spell hyphen.</p>
<p>Sarah Dalrymple-SmithStone, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – Despite telling people that my surname is spelt as it is pronounced, I have still received the following versions: Goodenuff, Godenov and Gudinoff.</p>
<p>Bernard GoodenoughWantage, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – Correspondents, receptionists and others have frequently made the grave mistake of inserting a y into my surname.</p>

<p>Upon arrival I was asked by the receptionist for my family name. “Horsfall,” I replied.</p>

<p>SIR – I am in despair. GP surgeries are now excused from some health screening duties in order to complete Covid booster vaccinations.</p>
<p>Why are fully trained vaccination practitioners not being utilised? I am a nurse (qualified for 41 years), trained and certified to vaccinate. I have been running flu clinics at my place of work.</p>
<p>With my two nursing colleagues I offered my services to the NHS free of charge. We have all been told there are enough vaccinators.</p>
<p>Sarah MorrisNaccolt, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – We agree that “throwing money at GPs” is no panacea to “increasing productivity” (Patrick O’Flynn, telegraph.co.uk). GPs and our teams already work at capacity in a workload and workforce crisis.</p>
<p>Dr Gary HowsamVice Chair, Royal College of GPsLondon NW1</p>
<p>SIR – I read with interest about the Government’s decision to allow GPs to suspend the <a>annual medical checks for the over-75s</a>.</p>
<p>I am 85 and have never been invited to attend for a medical examination and assessment. Am I the only one or are GPs generally not providing this service?</p>
<p>James FletcherBarmby Moor, East Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – The local pharmacist gave me the flu jab and booster jabs at the shop. She also gave my disabled wife her flu vaccination at home.</p>
<p>Why are doctors neglecting health checks for the over-75s to do this work when pharmacists and retired medical personnel are trained to administer vaccines?</p>

<p>Little Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was well able to express what was happening to him. My heart breaks for that little boy.</p>
<p>Elfrida FallowfieldChichester, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – The Prime Minister has promised a thorough investigation into those who failed to protect six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. I think we can guess what that means.</p>

<p>Tim WellsWeymouth, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – Sheffield Vulcan Rotary Club recognised the loss of habitat for swifts (<a>Letters, December 3</a>) two years ago, and decided to provide free nest boxes, made locally, to schools and other establishments, like the Sea Cadets.</p>
<p>Residents were encouraged to join the campaign and over 200 boxes have been put up throughout the city.</p>

<p>After that experience, a wood-burner and solar energy that could be stored for use in an emergency became a priority.</p>

<h2>How the recorder led to a criminal record</h2>
<p>SIR – In 1951 I was permanently banned from the recorder group of Two Mile Hill Infant School in Bristol.</p>
<p>I had whacked fellow infant musician John Boucher so hard over the head with a wooden recorder (<a>Letters, December 4</a>) that it split. The instrument, not the head.</p>
<p>This experience has dissuaded me ever since from trying to learn to play an instrument. John, however, went on to glory in the junior school recorder band.</p>
<p>Dr Jennifer LonghurstSurbiton, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – If Ken Atkinson (<a>Letters, December 2</a>) had heard the recorder played as it should be, in a modern performance by adult musicians well versed in its historical repertoire, his view of it might be more favourable.</p>
<p>Richard GammanBrighton, East Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – Living in Doha, in the Middle East, when entertainment depended on initiative not technology, a number of us (just one with a musical background) taught ourselves to play the recorder.</p>
<p>We acquired the five different sizes – the shrill sopranino, familiar soprano, the alto, tenor and bass – forming a recorder consort. Those going on leave brought sheet music back with them.</p>
<p>The sheer joy of being a part of Bach’s harmonies, I shall never forget.</p>
<p>Later, our family learnt to play as a mini-consort of sopranino, soprano, and alto – simple music, much enjoyed.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 7 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – You report that housebound folk are not being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Across the country, out-of-hours NHS GP services have brightly coloured, well-equipped cars that are unused during weekdays.</p>
<p>Is it beyond the wit of managers to use this resource to transport vaccinators to unvaccinated housebound patients?</p>
<p>Dr Andy AshworthBo’ness, West Lothian</p>
<p>SIR – Stan Grabecki<a> (Letters, December 5)</a> asks what has happened to our once fantastic vaccination programme.</p>
<p>The answer is that the NHS is now running it.</p>
<p>Anne AndrewsMalmesbury, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – I have to agree with James Fletcher<a> (Letters, December 6)</a>. At 79, I have not yet been invited to an annual over-75 health check either.</p>
<p>The decision to allow GPs not to perform this check so as to give them time to perform increased numbers of Covid-19 vaccinations would thus seem unhelpful. Even more so now that many GPs appear to have opted out of giving the booster dose.</p>
<p>Malcolm FreethRetired GPBournemouth, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – Yesterday, I received an email from the NHS encouraging me to book a Covid-19 booster jab. The message states that NHS records show that I have not yet had this vaccination.</p>
<p>The reality is that I had the booster on November 14, and fortunately this is recorded accurately on my NHS app. This evidence of NHS inaccuracy makes me question the Covid vaccination statistics presented daily by the Government.</p>
<p>SIR – There is a widespread assumption that all unvaccinated people are anti-vaxxers. This is totally wrong.</p>
<p>Reassurance only works for a small number of people. Oral vaccines are some time away.</p>
<p>This problem could easily be solved by offering us a mild sedative, as dentists do, followed by the Covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Philip FairlessScots Gap, Northumberland</p>
<p>SIR – The Government is consulting (briefly) on a Bill to outlaw conversion therapy for homosexuals. Good.</p>
<p>In other words, they demand that the child or teenager be launched on the path of transitioning, which involves puberty-blocking drugs, progressing to cross-hormone medication and probably surgery.</p>
<p>This outcome, the activists tell us, is preferable to taking the chance – at least 80 per cent – that the child or young person will come to accept their natal body with gentle counselling.</p>
<h2>When an aircraft stalls</h2>
<p>SIR – In my<a> letter </a>of November 8, I discussed the Hawk crash at RAF Valley in 2018, which a coroner has now ruled could have been avoided.</p>
<p>In 1992, I recommended that turnbacks should stop being practised. Had this been accepted, the crash would never have happened.</p>
<p>Wg Cdr Jeremy Parr RAF (retd)Suckley, Worcestershire</p>
<p>SIR – Amid storms and power cuts, which left us without power for three days, I have to offer a good story.</p>
<p>Western Power’s help-line is excellent. Yes, it is automated, but it tells you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>It is concise, with just two options: emergency or power cut. It repeats your location, so you know that it knows where you are.</p>
<p>Susan LakeAlstonefield, Staffordshire</p>
<p>SIR – Helen Abbott<a> (Letters, December 6) </a>had no power in Sussex for 10 days in 1987. How lucky she was. We had none for three weeks. What a joy it was when light and heat finally returned.</p>
<p>Mary DuncanBarcombe, West Sussex</p>

<p>Ian StearnChichester, West Sussex</p>
<p>My primary concern now is whether it is going to be possible to continue with much-needed medical projects in Gaza – or will we in future be regarded as “providing support to Hamas” and liable to jail sentences?</p>

<p>SIR – Tim Oldfield (Letters, December 7) discusses the inaccurate recording of Covid vaccinations.</p>
<p>My wife received a letter from the NHS in Bristol saying she had not yet had the booster. She had, in fact, received it 28 days earlier. How many other people’s records are wrong?</p>
<p>A further error was that my wife was invited to get her booster many days before me, even though, due to our age difference, I had my first two jabs a month before her.</p>
<p>Adrian BaileyHayling Island, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – There is a further problem for elderly housebound patients trying to get a booster (<a>report, December 6</a>) if they live across a Welsh county border.</p>
<p>An elderly housebound relative – who is a patient of a Powys border practice, which probably has a third of its patients in the Neath Port Talbot (NPT) area – is awaiting a booster. She lives half a mile over the border.</p>
<p>Apparently, senior nursing managers had a meeting last week but could not decide whether NPT or Powys district nurses, or even the practice nurses, could provide home boosters.</p>
<p>This problem should have been recognised and resolved months ago. Have the bureaucrats forgotten that the “s” in NHS stands for “service”?</p>
<p>Dr Ken Harvey FRCGPGlasbury-on-Wye, Brecknockshire</p>
<p>SIR – Sherelle Jacobs (<a>Comment, December 7</a>) argues that “punishing the unvaccinated would be both immoral and unjustified”.</p>
<p>It is the continued punishment of double and triple-vaccinated citizens that deserves censure. If people value their freedom so much, they should get vaccinated. Then we will all be able to live and travel without restrictions.</p>
<p>Dr Aidan GillUnterägeri, Zug, Switzerland</p>
<p>SIR – I was chilled to learn that the Government has allowed GPs to reduce routine checks for the over-75s. My father’s prostate cancer was caught early enough for it to be treated as a result of one of these checks.</p>
<p>Covid has taken enough precious time with our families away from us. Decisions like this risk taking away relatives for good.</p>

<p>Dr Richard HilesThirsk, North Yorkshire</p>
<p>The independent patient watchdog Healthwatch recently commented that “enormous problems exist for people trying to find NHS (dental) care across the south Gloucestershire area”.</p>

<p>Professor Alan SpeddingFrampton Cotterell, Gloucestershire</p>
<a>Money, December 5</a>). It seems astonishingly easy to take out a phone contract using a false name and address – but impossibly hard for a victim to protect against, and rectify, the resulting damage.
<p>In March, my daughter identified two such frauds using her name. Both phone companies confirmed that the accounts were rogue and gave assurances that the apparent history of missed payments would not affect her personal credit rating.</p>
<p>The fraudsters continue to get away with it, while the victim must endure the consequences. For my daughter, that may mean the heartbreak of losing the house.</p>
<p>Network providers must not allow such injustices to continue.</p>
<p>David PayneFetcham, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – There have been several articles concerning the safety of older drivers (<a>report, December 2</a>).</p>
<p>Four of my friends have written off their cars recently by smashing into their garages and walls, and have given up driving as a result. The fault? Depressing the wrong pedal on the automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>For this reason I sold my over-complex Lexus and bought a Dacia Duster with a manual gearbox. With this kind of car it is impossible to cause a crash by pressing the wrong pedal or by pressing any two pedals simultaneously.</p>
<p>I am 83 years old and have driven about two million miles in my life in countries including Britain, the United States and South Africa, and on the Continent, mostly with cars with an automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>I never had a major accident. I have good eyesight and reactions but nevertheless have taken the precaution of avoiding these gearboxes from now on.</p>

<h2>Starting on a low note</h2>
<p>SIR – In my junior school music lessons I was never fortunate enough to be issued with a recorder (<a>Letters, December 6</a>) or a drum.</p>
<p>My journey on a lifetime of low expectations commenced with always being given the triangle to play.</p>
<p>Peter MatthewsWinchester, Hampshire</p>
<p>Sir Anthony SeldonWindsor, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – The US is to be congratulated for announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics next year (<a>Sport, December 7</a>). Other civilised countries should follow suit.</p>
<p>At the same time, governments have no right to tell athletes whether to participate or not. That is a matter for individuals, who should search their consciences and consult their sporting associations before deciding.</p>
<p>Sandy PrattStorrington, West Sussex</p>

<h2>Importing energy when oil is on the doorstep</h2>
<p>SIR – After Nicola Sturgeon opposed development of the Cambo oil field, Shell pulled out of the project, as the economic case for involvement was no longer worth the uncertainty and political turmoil (<a>report, December 4</a>).</p>
<p>While many Holyrood nationalists celebrated the news, importing energy from abroad will be more expensive and do more harm to the planet than using energy on Scotland’s doorstep.</p>
<p>It was astonishing to see a Scottish government minister cheering on such serious job losses. This ridiculous virtue-signalling will actually undermine efforts to achieve net zero.</p>
<p>Dr John CameronSt Andrews, Fife</p>
<p>SIR – Matt Ridley (<a>Comment, December 6</a>) is wrong to say that the sustainable biomass used by Drax drives up the global timber price. The economics of a timber harvest prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>Biomass is vital to Britain’s energy network. Drax generates 12 per cent of the country’s renewable electricity, enough to light four million homes.</p>

<p>I wrote to HM Revenue Customs to claim a relatively small tax rebate and posted my letter with the required information on April 30. It was received on May 5.</p>
<p>There appears to be something terribly wrong with our civil service and it desperately needs addressing.</p>
<p>David Samuel-CampsEastleigh, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – My junior school just after the war didn’t do music lessons<a> (Letters, December 8)</a>, because there were no instruments to use. The instrument cupboard contained a triangle – but nothing with which to hit it.</p>

<h2>Screening for dyslexia</h2>
<p>SIR – I was heartened by Matt Hancock’s <a>piece</a> about his campaign for all children to be screened for dyslexia before they leave primary school.</p>
<p>We are very grateful that our own daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of eight, which gave us time to find a school she was more suited to.</p>
<p>Emily WatkinsonBridgwater, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Matt Hancock believes that screening for dyslexia in schools would help to tackle illiteracy, but I am afraid this would be a misdirection of resources and a counterproductive step for the dyslexia community.</p>
<p>Dr Marlynne GrantRegistered educational psychologistBristol</p>
<p>SIR – Susan Calvert <a>(Letters, December 7)</a> is puzzled as to why beer costs so much more than petrol.</p>

<h2>Greener streets are not a cure for society’s ills</h2>
<p>SIR – First, let’s agree that the<a> planting of trees</a> is beneficial.</p>
<p>How does tree-planting reduce poverty, improve education, increase opportunity and prospects, increase housing quality, reduce overcrowding or solve the postcode services lottery? I would say that those factors are far more important.</p>

<header> <h1> Letters: After two years of Government inaction, the NHS is closer to collapse </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 10 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – As Plan B is launched in response to omicron, the truth of the matter is probably not that omicron is a greater threat to us, but that after two years, the NHS is actually more at risk of collapse than ever.</p>
<p>This has less to do with Covid than with this Government’s failure to address the reasons why the NHS cannot cope in the winter and then to do something about it.</p>
<p>Helping these dedicated people to provide a service that can withstand seasonal variations and unforeseen events, such as Covid, should be this Government’s highest priority. Why isn’t it?</p>
<p>Thomas Le CocqBatcombe, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Boris Johnson describes the new Covid measures as “proportionate and responsible”.</p>
<p>A cursory examination of the facts reveals that hospitalisations are down, deaths are down and, by Wednesday, the were 568 reported cases of omicron in the United Kingdom. The World Health Organisation reports zero deaths from this new variant.</p>
<p>Alan NowersIrvine, California, United States</p>
<p>SIR – At an estimated £8 billion for the hospitality industry alone, this is the most expensive dead cat in history.</p>
<p>Maria McGeeCulmore, Co Londonderry</p>
<p>SIR – I find it chilling that the Government has, without much real debate, secured for itself the powers to expand or restrict our basic freedoms on a whim whenever it so chooses.</p>
<p>Yet the Government’s chosen route is to treat liberty as if it were an unimportant trinket to be taken away or granted at its will. Maybe it needed a distraction after this week’s headlines.</p>
<p>I will never vote for this Government again, although goodness knows where I will find any competent replacement.</p>
<p>Mark TreasureHorley, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – I could not believe my ears. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said twice yesterday morning that mandatory vaccination would be “unethical”.</p>
<p>Is it then more ethical to allow unvaccinated people to infect others, take up hospital beds, be treated at public expense and delay the end of this miserable epidemic which ruins so many businesses and lives?</p>
<p>Elizabeth FoxHayfield, Derbyshire</p>
<p>SIR – I was surprised to hear the PM say we might to have a conversation about mandatory vaccination. This country has an extremely high Covid vaccine takeup. I myself have had three jabs.</p>
<p>Talk of making people take the vaccine is un-British and wrong. This is still a free country, just.</p>
<p>The numbers show that most people will have a jab if there is a good reason, rather than being told to do so. We don’t want to go anywhere near the measures being considered by the EU, and Germany in particular.</p>
<p>Graham MitchellHaslemere, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – I have had Covid and am triple-jabbed. What was the point?</p>
<p>Ian RennardsonTunbridge Wells, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – It was hard to believe it possible to be any angrier with this Government. But I am now.</p>
<p>This Government is not trying to protect me, but is slowly trying to destroy me. Nudges, restrictions, impositions, hypocrisy, suppression of evidence – all lead us to a dark place.</p>
<p>It is about time that MPs stopped supporting these impositions on our lives and let us return to normality. I will not accept any further restrictions.</p>
<p>Alan BillingsleyWhitworth, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – Is anyone in the Civil Service not already working from home?</p>
<p>Bill ToddTwickenham, Middlesex</p>
<p>SIR – Should supermarket and pharmacy staff work from home?</p>
<p>Mervyn HodkinsonBournemouth, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – Did the Democratic National Committee have to have had its headquarters in a building, the name of which ended in -gate?</p>
<p>Alistair MackayDunoon, Argyll</p>
<p>SIR – Last year Boris Johnson announced that we could go out but we couldn’t go out out. This year he has just announced that we can go out out but we can’t go out to work.</p>
<p>I am already looking forward to next year’s announcement.</p>
<p>Charlotte MacKayShaftesbury, Dorset</p>
<h2>The party and the Party</h2>
<p>SIR – I said to myself: I must watch the BBC one o'clock news to catch up on the virtual meeting between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden. After all, the stakes are high as Mr Putin amasses almost 100,000 Russian troops on the Ukraine border.</p>
<p>Yet the BBC didn’t appear to agree, since there was no mention of the threat to peace or the summit. I learnt a lot, though, about a Christmas party which may or may not have happened.</p>
<p>Nicholas NelsonIwerne Minster, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – I have been a Tory voter all my adult life and am disappointed at the goings on in Downing Street.</p>
<p>My husband was in a care home last year. Our daughters were not allowed to visit their father and I was not allowed to see him at Christmas.</p>
<p>He died in February. I was not allowed to be with him. We had been married for 61 years.</p>
<p>How do you think I will vote in the next general election?</p>
<p>Norma HeatherYateley, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – If there was a Downing Street party last Christmas, I wonder how Boris Johnson will face the Queen at his next audience with her.</p>
<p>It was dreadful to see her sitting on her own at the funeral of her husband, but we would expect nothing else from her as she unfailingly does the right thing.</p>
<p>She has the right to expect that her Government should do the same.</p>
<p>Janet HartNewark, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – I have voted Conservative almost all my life. Watching Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday left me in dismay.</p>
<p>Maj Gen the Rev Morgan LlewellynCrickhowell, Brecknockshire</p>
<p>SIR – I have been a supporter of Boris Johnson but sadly feel he must now be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My personal choice of successor would be Michael Gove. We need somebody with a record of effectiveness in government.</p>
<p>Julan TopePortishead, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Our Prime Minister and his Government have hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>Deirdre LayCranleigh, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Presumably Boris Johnson will next be in trouble for allowing No 10 staff to go to work when they should have been having a party.</p>
<p>David BurkeChobham, Surrey</p>
<h2>Dyslexia is not the only obstacle to learning</h2>
<p>SIR – At school in the 1960s I struggled with maths and was not allowed to take my maths O-level.</p>
<p>I am now too old to be formally diagnosed. When I was at school I was just someone who was a bit “thick” at maths. Without an O-level, I was never able to go to university, which has affected my life chances.</p>
<p>The condition is called dyscalculia and there must be thousands of children who have it, but it is rarely mentioned.</p>
<p>It should be investigated in the same way as dyslexia.</p>
<p>SIR – I was interested to read Matt Hancock’s proposal that all children be screened for dyslexia. He also mentioned the associated condition of dyspraxia, but not dysgraphia or dyscalculia. </p>
<p>Our son was identified as severely dysgraphic while studying for his A-levels. It was spotted by a learning support teacher and an English teacher before his fourth attempt at an English language GCSE.</p>
<p>While our son is very dysgraphic and has dyspraxia, he is not dyslexic or dyscalculic. These conditions all need to be screened for individually.</p>
<p>SIR – Beer may cost more per litre than petrol (<a>Letters, December 7</a>), but my local bicycle shop sells fancy chain oil at five times the price of single-malt Scotch.</p>
<p>Rob ChurchillWorthing, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – My golden retriever can spend her pocket money on Woofs cubes at £45 a kilogram, while I buy fillet steak for £40 a kilogram.</p>
<p>For a festive change there are pigs in blankets for dogs at £40 a kilogram, while I pay £16 a kilogram for mine.</p>
<p>She won’t share her treats so I don’t share mine. She doesn’t think this is fair.</p>
<p>Iain GibsonReading, Berkshire</p>

<p>SIR – I’m reading the Letters page on my Telegraph app in New York as I do some Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>Every single restaurant, bar, hotel and other indoor venue is mandated to check your vaccine status and your ID to match.</p>
<p>Masks are almost universally worn indoors. Most street corners in the central area have Covid testing stations. It seems to work well.</p>
<p>Martin DugganWeybridge, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – I’m triple vaccinated, have had the flu jab but am now having my life gradually closed down once again. What more can I do to have my freedom? At this rate this will be our life every year.</p>
<p>Why don’t they admit Covid will never disappear and everyone will have to learn to live with it? Then the public will get some backbone.</p>
<p>There is also the question of why the Government didn’t increase the number of ICU beds during the summer and autumn if they feared a new variant was likely in the winter. Answer: they are inept.</p>
<p>Andrew ChamberlinPlungar, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – It is not astonishing, as your Leading Article suggests, that NHS capacity has shrunk, despite billions of pounds of extra spending since March.</p>
<p>What would have been astonishing would have been a reversal of the loss of beds which has occurred every year since the inception of the NHS in 1948, despite annual increases in expenditure in excess of inflation.</p>
<p>The NHS is the paradigm of a bureaucratic organisation and must obey the Law of Bureaucratic Displacement: “In a bureaucratic system, increase in expenditure will be matched by fall in production.”</p>
<p>Dr Max GammonLondon SE16</p>
<p>SIR – Is it possible even to begin to imagine when the NHS will not be in crisis?</p>
<p>Simon MorpussStratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – The proposal to allow <a>only three people to visit </a>any resident in a care home has led me to question whether the people in government are actually human.</p>
<p>Not only will this distress residents of care homes, but it will place the burden of visiting them on the three people who are permitted to enter.</p>
<p>Surely the Government must understand that residents in care homes need a range of visitors to keep them stimulated, boost their morale and ease the burden on the family as a whole.</p>
<p>If we cannot do that at Christmas, when can we do it?</p>
<p>Hannah HuntWoodhall Spa, Lincolnshire</p>
<p>SIR – Our family are going to a pantomime soon after Christmas. Under the new Covid restrictions, are we allowed to take off our masks to hiss and boo or do we have to hiss and boo through our masks?</p>
<p>B N BosworthBlakedown, Worcestershire</p>
<p>SIR – It’s obvious to the man in the street that the Left and most of the media are obsessed with getting rid of Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>Without him, Brexit would have been cancelled by a political class determined to overturn the referendum decision to leave the EU. The Left, the media and the Civil Service have never forgiven Boris for his victory. He’s loathed for it.</p>
<p>Without Mr Johnson, the Conservatives would probably have lost the last election. Just imagine what that would have meant. We could have had Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott in charge of the country.</p>
<p>“Partygate” is a storm in a teacup. It’s always easy for the media to round up a bunch of enraged victims ready to tell a sob story.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is being unfairly targeted by a media witch-hunt. I sincerely hope they fail in their aim.</p>
<p>Stephen PettyBloxwich, Staffordshire</p>
<p>SIR – I’m afraid Bruce Murray (<a>Letters, December 9</a>) is mistaken in thinking that “the average member of the public” doesn’t care about the Tories’ latest “indiscretions”.</p>
<p>In a civilised society the majority of the population care very much. Most of us think it is absolutely fundamental to our democracy that members of the government do not break the laws which they have made. If they do, they should be replaced.</p>

<p>Andrew W GarnettHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Is it really in the national interest for much of the media, opposition and dissident Tory MPs to destabilise the Government at this time of national emergency?</p>
<p>Is it in anyone’s interest to force the Prime Minister’s resignation and inflict weeks of uncertainty while the omicron variant sweeps across the country?</p>
<p>Nigel BastinStaughton, Bedfordshire</p>

<h2>Millions of tons of timber burnt at Drax</h2>

<p>SIR – Boris Johnson and his chaotic, immature court is now beyond comedy.</p>
<p>Nicholas DobsonDoncaster, South Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Boris Johnson is clearly out of his depth, with a coterie of advisers and hangers-on who have no idea how to even look like a party of government, let alone be one.</p>
<p>They have total disdain for the public and little respect for the positions they hold. I have been a loyal Conservative voter all my life but the current shambles makes me embarrassed to be so. No policies, no direction, no plan.</p>
<p>SIR – The video footage of No 10 staff openly joking about a party on December 18 last year is a ghost of Christmas past that will haunt the Prime Minister for a long time.</p>
<p>In the space of just two years he has turned from an election asset into a complete and utter liability.</p>

<p>SIR – Those of your readers demanding that HS2 should be scrapped have presumably not seen what I, as a private pilot, have seen from the air above Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Frankly it is too late.</p>
<p>Anyone who imagines that the trackway through these lovely English counties is confined to two locomotive widths is mistaken. Whole swathes of good agricultural land have been ripped up. I have the photographs to prove it.</p>

<p>Jacqueline McCrindlePrestwick, Ayrshire</p>
<p>SIR – My machine has an even more annoying habit: it turns polo shirts inside out.</p>

<p>On the same programme I heard the Labour Party claiming that people’s trust in politics is being destroyed by Boris Johnson’s government. Mine isn’t, as I already had no trust in politicians. My work colleagues agree.</p>
