<h1> Rothko's children on growing up orphaned but in possession of an astonishing artistic legacy </h1>
<p> Mark Rothko was at the height of his fame when he took his own life leaving his two children possessors of an astonishing artistic legacy </p>
<div> <div> By Lucy Davies <time> 4 September 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Come with me to New York in February 1970, where six-year-old Christopher Rothko is pedalling his tricycle through his parents' Upper East Side townhouse.</p>
<p>He favours a circuit - a figure of eight - that leads from their bedroom to the living room, where the rumble of his plastic wheels on worn Persian rugs mingles with a wisecracking Popeye and his raspy ug-ug-ug on the black and white TV.</p>
<p>What can he see? Or, crucially, what will he remember? Because by autumn he'll be cut adrift from this life, the only one he has ever known, and an orphan, trying to find his footing 600 miles away in Ohio.</p>
<p>Here's the answer: books in teetering piles; a record player that he has been taught how to use, stylus and all; and, above the couch, two vast paintings by his father, the abstract expressionist Mark Rothko (1903-1970).</p>
<p>Christopher is 58 now, with flint-grey hair and the events of 1970 a full half-century behind him, though I doubt many days have passed since when their ghosts have not drifted into his thinking. How could it not?</p>
<p>He learnt fast, he tells me, that adapting would grant him the relief of anonymity. "I look back and yes, it was hard, but being away from the art world and having a quieter place to grow up was not a bad thing. Ultimately it stood me well."</p>
<p>"It was rich and round and sort of enveloping," adds Christopher, "It's just embedded in my head. I have strong memories of him walking with me in Central Park, talking to me, and mostly about music."</p>
<p>Music is as much a passion for Christopher as it was for Rothko. "We listened to a lot of records together: Schubert, Haydn, scatterings of Brahms and Mendelssohn, but always Mozart. He was, I would say, obsessed with Mozart."</p>

<header> <h1> Sonia Boyce to be first black woman to represent Britain at Venice Biennale </h1> <p> The 58-year-old artist is known for her photography, drawing and paintings, and a high-profile controversy at Manchester Art Gallery in 2018 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 13 February 2020 • 10:40am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The artist Sonia Boyce has been chosen to represent Britain at the 2021 Venice Biennale.</p>
<p>Boyce, who works across a range of media including painting, drawing and photography, will be the first black woman to fly the British flag at the world’s most prestigious art event.</p>
<p>“It was like a bolt out of the blue,” Boyce said in a statement, describing herself as “extremely honored, excited and nervous” to be selected by a British Council committee.</p>
<p>At home, Boyce is well-known for a controversy that began in 2018 at Manchester Art Gallery, in the weeks before her exhibition there, when she removed an 1896 painting by John Waterhouse, Hylas and the Nymphs, from the walls.</p>
<p>The work depicted topless nymphs surrounding the male hero. Boyce, who said she had heard members of gallery staff complaining that Waterhouse’s painting made them “uncomfortable”, removed the work.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Boyce became the first black British woman to have work acquired by the Tate. She went on to become the first black female Royal Academician.</p>
<p>In a statement, Emma Dexter, the visual arts director of the British Council and the commissioner of the British pavilion, pointed to the relations between Boyce’s work and Brexit. </p>
<p>“Boyce’s work,” she said, “raises important questions about the nature of creativity, questioning who makes art, how ideas are formed, and the nature of authorship.</p>
<p>“At such a pivotal moment in the UK’s history, the Committee has chosen an artist whose work embodies inclusiveness, generosity, experimentation and the importance of working together.”</p>
<p>“There are serious questions about how people can come together, particularly when there might be tensions around differences,” Boyce herself told The Times yesterday. “But through art it is possible.”</p>
<p>Britain was <a>represented in Venice last year</a> by Cathy Wilkes. In recent years, other British artists have included Tracey Emin, Phyllida Barlow and<a> Steve McQueen</a>.</p>

<header> <h1> Confused by NFTs? They are more straightforward than you realise </h1> <p> A new digital gold rush is shaking up the art world, selling for as much as $69.3 million at the most formidable auction houses </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Mick Brown <time> 11 October 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Of course, Sundaresan and Venkateswaran didn't expect to pay quite that much.</p>
<p>At a critical moment, the internet connection faltered - 'I thought I would have a heart attack,' Venkateswaran says - before flickering back into life.</p>
<p>'There was no time to rationalise what we were doing,' he goes on. 'We had just decided to go for it, no matter what, and we'll figure out what to do with it, where to put it, even why it was so important to us, later on.'</p>
<p>Before we get to that, consider this. Virtually unheard of 12 months ago, NFTs have become akin to the new gold rush in the art world - and increasingly in the commercial world too.</p>
<p>But are NFTs, as some maintain, the brave new frontier of art, or are they the emperor's new clothes?</p>
<p>The Pixel is the ultimate in minimalist digital art - literally an image of a single pixel, the smallest element of a picture represented on the screen, at acual size it is invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>'I liked the idea that the aesthetic was not Pak's but he was trying to send out this message around value and scarcity,' Young says.</p>
<p>There is a growing market in screens that can display NFTs - the equivalent of hanging one on your wall or putting it on the mantelpiece. But perhaps the most appropriate display medium for a digital artwork is a virtual one.</p>
<p>The artist Philip Colbert has his own installation in Decentraland, called Lobsteropolis - a development of the central theme of his work, a cartoon lobster, which he describes as 'my creative persona'.</p>
<p>Colbert talks of a future where the more the metaverse evolves, the more 'real' it will become. 'For kids, in two or three years' time the easiest way of being a pop star will be to be a meta pop star. You could have a global audience of billions.'</p>
<p>Venkateswaran brushes aside questions about NFTs as an investment.</p>
<p>'I don't see that falling away,' Fahey concludes. 'I see it as just the beginning.'</p>

<header> <h1> Everything you need to know about the test that can tell you when you will get cancer </h1> <p> Scientists have made a huge leap, with an innovative study published by scientists in Los Angeles, this week </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Luke Mintz <time> 29 December 2021 • 9:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Over the course of six months, they watched as the organoids from the BRCA1 patients began to show “enhanced structural abnormalities”, indicating cancer, according to the study published in the journal *Cell Reports*.</p>
<h2>How do BRCA genes work?</h2>
<p>Everybody has a BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene. They are known as ‘tumour suppressors’, because they protect us from cancer by correcting DNA damage inflicted when cells divide. But about one in 450 people have mutations in these genes.</p>
<p>“If you've got a faulty copy of one of those genes, it's not able to do its job, it's not able to stop the cells dividing, and that can lead to cancer,” explains Karis Betts, health information manager at Cancer Research UK.</p>
<h2>The Angelina Jolie effect</h2>
<p>BRCA genes burst into the public consciousness in May 2013, when Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed that she had undergone a double mastectomy (an operation removing both of her breasts) in order to prevent breast cancer.</p>
<h2>What is the potential for this new study?</h2>
<p>“By replaying variant cancer over and over again, we can keep replaying the [process], find out what caused it, and then develop drugs that stop it from happening,” Dr Svendsen says.</p>
<p>There are limitations, of course. It’s a new technology, with many questions yet to be answered. Dr Svendsen stresses that more research is needed to confirm the predictive power of this model. </p>

<p>I met a friend for a walk and we drank sloe gin in our own cups. A passer-by spotted us together and shouted angrily, “Social distancing!” “Do star jumps,” my friend said.</p>
<p>We did star jumps. They were wild and beautiful. The old man laughed when I told him about that.</p>
<p>I would not have found these people without this past year, and they have touched and enriched my life in ways they do not know. No matter what next year brings, I will keep my heart and mind open.</p>

<header> <h1> Drop your midlife weight gain with this one simple exercise </h1> <p> I took up weight lifting at the age of 62 - and I loved it </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Maggie Alderson <time> 2 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Please don’t stop reading after the next sentence – though I probably would have until a few weeks ago. Here goes: working out with weights at the gym regularly has changed my life.</p>
<p>Then, of particular interest to people further into middle age, there is increased bone strength and protection against memory loss. On top of all that, in the Iowa study self-esteem was boosted and depression relieved.</p>
<p>So, the broad health benefit evidence is compelling, with additional vanity inspiration from the singer Adele’s recent body transformation, which has lifting weights at the base of her rigorous daily exercise regime.</p>
<p>As well as the more conventional weight machines, dumbbells and kettle weights, which she does every morning, she also advanced to the more specialist deadlifting, when you lift a bar with weights on it, Olympic weightlifter-style.</p>
<p>In that speciality, Adele progressed from a gentle 4.5kg start to a cool 72.5kg. Or to put it another way, 11st 6lb, which is a little over what the average British woman weighs.</p>
<p>I was impressed enough to do a little research (from a reclined position) which revealed that deadlifting is a super efficient form of exercise – working the legs, core, back, shoulder and neck muscles in one grunty go.</p>
<p>I didn’t find out until last year that I have congenital hip dysplasia (which all babies are checked for now, but not in 1959), which means the femur is only loosely held in the pelvic socket.</p>
<p>There were also people on the older side – one regular is 84 – all just getting on with their own thing. Most importantly, none of them was looking at me, making the invisibility of the older woman a superpower in this context.</p>
<p>Waking up on the subsequent two days with no debilitating muscle pain, I was happy to go back for the next session and by the third one, I had advanced to a 3kg dumbbell for the squats – half the weight I need to lose.</p>
<p>I found it quite astonishing to think I’m carrying around on my poor old bones twice as much weight as I found taxing to lift. No wonder my hip was agony and I felt so tired and ancient.</p>
<p>If you don’t have every bit of you in the right position, deadlifting can lead to bad injuries, so my journey started with lifting and bending with nothing more than a wooden pole like a broom handle. Much harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>Only once Gilberto is sure I have perfected the straight-backed, hip-hinged, chest-lifted forward bend with the wooden pole will he let me have a go doing it with the first level of metal bar.</p>
<p>Putting weights on to one of those is still a way off – but definitely worth working towards, he says, for the sheer efficiency of the exercise, though I may never be proficient enough to do it without him guiding me.</p>
<p>“It’s exactly the same weight as last time,” he replied, as I finished with warm-knife-through-butter ease. “You’re getting stronger.”</p>
<p>I’ve always pictured myself as one of those bendy old ladies still doing yoga at 95. Now I think I’m more likely to be a wiry bird at the gym. Who knows? I might even be deadlifting as much as Adele by then.</p>
<h2>Other exercises for improved fitness</h2>
<p>Standing at a piece of kit with multiple set-up options to pull on weighted wires, you grab hold of the ends of two ropes and, keeping your elbows tight into your waist, pull them down and out, to mid-thigh level. </p>
<p>Standing side on to the same multitasking machine, using your outside arm, you pull a handle across your body, elbow first, at chest height. You think about tightly waisted trench coats and body con dresses.</p>
<p>Sitting down (the good bit) and starting with bent arms at shoulder level, you pull two levers down to the front until your arms are straight. I was surprised how much I hated this and how fast I improved at it.</p>
<h2>The Nicer Pull-Down One</h2>
<p>Sitting astride in the Christine Keeler manner, you grab hold of a wide metal bar, with your hands at 10 and two, and pull it down to chest level. Strangely much less offensive than the other pull-down thing.</p>
<p>Holding on to a handle behind your head at the top of this sloping bench, you lift your knees up to your chest and down again, keeping your legs bent at the same angle. In between sets you get to just lie down on it, which is nice.</p>
<p>I’ve always wondered what people do with these. I had to lift it over my head with straight arms and then SLAM it on to the ground as hard as I could. It was fantastic. Take that!</p>
<h2>How to beat gym phobia</h2>
<li>Find a gym with a mixed-age, mixed-ability clientele – probably easier at the more down-to-earth end of the market.</li>
<li>Go at off-peak times, if you can – such as 11am and 2pm, when these groups tend to be there.</li>
<li>Wear clothes you feel comfortable in. Tight Lycra leggings and bare upper arms are not mandatory.</li>
<li>Start off doing a course with a trainer, so you are not alone in the gym, fumbling with the equipment like Mr Bean.</li>
<li>Choose a trainer you feel really comfortable with, ideally nearer your own age.</li>
<li>Go three times a week, so it quickly becomes a normal place to be.</li>
<li>Have a bath with Epsom salts before bed on days you train, to lessen morning aches and pains.</li>
<li>Don’t weigh and measure yourself constantly at home – leave it for the trainer to monitor and interpret.</li>

<header> <h1> The best cordless vacuums for spotless carpets, rugs and hard floors </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 11 August 2021 • 5:54pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>I also took value for money and any extra features they offer into account. Here’s what I found on my hunt for the best cordless vacuum cleaners, starting with my favourite… </p>
<h3>1. Dyson V15 Detect Complete cordless vacuum cleaner</h3>
<p>Why we like it: Quite simply the most impressive cordless vacuum cleaner on the market</p>
<p>To address the elephant in the room, the Dyson V15 Detect Complete is a significant outlay – just a penny shy of £600, to be exact. But – and I say this without any doubt – it really is worth it.</p>
<p>At just 2.74kg, it’s extremely lightweight without compromising on suction power (which is an impressive 230 AW in Boost mode). </p>
<a>£249, Dyson</a>) for several years and highly rate its cleaning power, decent battery life and reliable performance. 
<h2> 2. Shark Anti Hair Wrap Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p><a>Was £529.99, now £349.99, Shark</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: The best for dealing with pet hair</p>
<h3>3. Vax ONEPWR Blade 4 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<p><a>£219, Currys</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: It's like a more affordable Dyson </p>
<p><a>£139, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: A budget-friendly model that still performs well</p>
<p>It’s suitable for all types of floor and can be converted to a handheld Hoover for spot cleaning or use in a car. You can also switch between 90 and 180-degree cleaning angles to get around furniture and into tight corners. </p>
<p>It’s also very light, at just 2.5kg, and can be clicked into a vertical position for temporary storage (while it’s not in use for longer periods of time, Hoover recommends you store it on the supplied wall mount). </p>
<p><a>£249.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: Excellent performance on rugs and carpets</p>
<h3>6. Miele Triflex HX1 Pro</h3>
<p><a>£579, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: The power of a conventional vacuum cleaner in a cordless design</p>
<p>The only reason it doesn’t rank higher on this list is cost – it’s the most expensive of all the models I tested and, although it’s suitably powerful, it’s not quite as impressive as the marginally cheaper Dyson V15.</p>
<h4>Frequently asked questions about cordless vacuums</h4>
<h3>Why should I get a cordless vacuum?</h3>
<p>However, the biggest draw is convenience – a cordless vacuum cleaner allows you to clean little and often rather than doing one weekly deep clean, and to easily spot-clean dust or spillages without the faff of dust bags and cables. </p>
<h3>How versatile are they?</h3>
<p>The best I tested were equally comfortable on thick carpet, wood, sofas and skirting; and the very best were just as efficient as corded varieties. </p>
<h3>What's the battery life like?</h3>
<h3>Do they have good dust capacity?</h3>
