<h2><a>Double chocolate and ginger brownies</a></h2>
<p>Brownies are a useful present, as they can be eaten at teatime or warmed with ice cream for pudding, plus they keep well. This recipe gets cakier the longer you bake it, so take it out when still slightly underdone for a fudgy centre.</p>
<header> <h1> Why the secret to enjoying wine starts with a £6.95 corkscrew </h1> <p> Forget the gadgetry – this Christmas, just get your hands on a Waiter’s Friend </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Victoria Moore, Wine correspondent <time> 16 December 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Victoria Wood once joked that she didn’t get caravanning. “I don’t understand people who can only have a relaxed holiday if they’re accompanied at all times by their own washing-up brush.” </p>
<a>Winerackd</a>. Agreed. The best corkscrews are the very compact ones, sometimes called waiters’ corkscrews, that sommeliers and bartenders carry in their apron pockets and which are made by companies like
<a>Waiter’s Friend</a> and
<a>BBR, £5.50</a>) but there are lots of good ones out there. Just remember, “double-lever” is an essential property.
<h2>Finest* in partnership with Bodegas Portia Ebeia Ribera del Duero 2019 </h2>
<p>Spain (14.5%, <a>Tesco</a>, £12)</p>
<p>A highly, highly recommended red from Tesco’s own-label range. This sturdy, barrel-aged Ribera del Duero is purply and dark-fruited with a touch of spice: think plums, blueberries and cedar with a tinge of mace and black liquorice.</p>
<h2>Cune Imperial Rioja Reserva 2016 </h2>
<p>Spain (14%, <a>Co-op</a>, 120 shops only, £19.95)</p>
<h2>Vertiges 2020 Vallée du Paradis </h2>
<p>France (14%, <a>Laithwaites</a>, £9.99/£10.99 mixed case/single bottle price)</p>

<p>Here are more of my recommendations for sparkling wines for Christmas.</p>
<h2>Which is your go-to champagne or sparkling wine? Tell us in the comments section below</h2>
<header> <div> <div> <h1> A perfect menu for New Year's Eve: simple, special, and worth staying in for </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>If you don’t expect to be ecstatic – just content – then you won’t be disappointed, and perhaps you’ll go to bed thinking how good the simple things are.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t bother with a starter, but since pulses are thought to bring good luck at this time of year, you could do braised puy lentils as an extra side.</p>
<p>The pie and pudding can be made in advance and heated in the oven, leaving you to feel ordinary contentment in the company of loved ones. Have a happy one.</p>
<h3>Champagne and sloe-gin cocktail with rosemary</h3>
<ul> <li>50g granulated sugar</li> <li>1 sprig of rosemary, plus extra to garnish</li> <li>175ml sloe gin</li> <li>6 tbsp lemon juice</li> <li>600ml champagne, chilled</li> </ul>
<li>Divide the gin between 6 glasses (2 tbsp per glass). Add 1 tbsp of syrup and 1 tbsp of lemon juice to each. Top up with champagne, and garnish.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <h3>Fish pie with saffron mash</h3> </div> </div> </div>
<li>1 small onion, thickly sliced</li>
<li>handful of parsley stalks</li>
<li>800g fillets of haddock and salmon (or you can use white fish alone), skin removed</li>
<li>12 scallops, cleaned (you can keep the orange roe on or not)</li>
<ul> <li>1kg mashing potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li> <li>50ml whole milk</li> <li>good pinch of saffron</li> <li>50g butter</li> </ul>
<li>Heat 15g of butter and the oil in a frying pan and, once it’s hot, cook the scallops for a minute on each side. They should be pale gold. Set aside.</li>
<li>Trim the leeks and remove the outer leaves if they are coarse (discard these, or keep them for a soup). Slice the leeks into 1.5cm-thick rounds. Wash well.</li>
<li>Put the fish and scallops into a 2.2-litre (4-pint) pie dish. If any liquid has gathered under the fish, add it to the sauce – it’s important not just to put it in the dish as it will make watery patches in the pie.</li>
<li>Spoon the leeks on top. Pour the sauce over and carefully mix it through to combine. Taste for seasoning. Leave this to cool then refrigerate. (A firm base makes it easier to spread the mash on top.)</li>
<li>Heat the milk in a small pan with the saffron until boiling, then leave to infuse for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/170C fan/gas mark 6.</li>
<li>Mash the potatoes until smooth, adding the butter, the warm saffron milk and some seasoning. Spread over the chilled base and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden.</li>
<li>You can make this the day before, cover and keep it in the fridge, then brush the top with melted butter and bake it for 45 minutes.</li>
<h3>Roast purple sprouting broccoli with rocket and Parmesan</h3>
<ul> <li>500g purple sprouting broccoli</li> <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li> <li>75g rocket</li> <li>juice of ½ small lemon</li> <li>25g Parmesan, shaved</li> </ul>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200C/190C fan/gas mark 6.</li>
<li>If any of the broccoli pieces have wider stalks than the others, split them along their length. You need them all about the same thickness. Trim the bases.</li>
<li>Lie the broccoli in a single layer in a roasting tin. Add the olive oil, toss the broccoli in it, and season.</li>
<li>Roast for 12-15 minutes, turning the broccoli pieces over halfway through. They should be tender and slightly charred.</li>
<li>Transfer to a serving dish and toss with the rocket (which will wilt a little), the lemon and a little more oil. Scatter the Parmesan on top and serve with the pie.</li>
<h3>Roast apples, pears and blackberries with orange blossom and almond crumbs</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <h4>SERVES</h4> <p>6</p> </div> </div> </div>
<li>3 pears, slightly under-ripe</li>
<li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>3 tbsp soft light-brown sugar</li>
<li>finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>1 tbsp orange-blossom water</li>
<li>60g marzipan, broken into little chunks</li>
<li>150g fresh or frozen blackberries</li>
<ul> <li>50g plain flour</li> <li>30g ground almonds</li> <li>65g cold butter, cut into cubes</li> <li>2 tbsp soft light-brown sugar</li> <li>5g flaked almonds</li> <li>icing sugar, for dusting (optional)</li> </ul>
<li>Halve and core each apple and pear – you can peel them as well if you want to. Lay the fruit facing cut-side up in a gratin dish.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with the granulated sugar, half the brown sugar, the zest and juice, the flower water and the butter. Turn it all over with your hands.</li>
<li>Take 30g of the marzipan nuggets and put them in among the fruit. Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>To make the crumbs, put the flour, ground almonds and butter into a bowl and rub them together with your fingertips. Add the sugar and rub it in too. You want to end up with a mixture that looks like small pebbles and gravel.</li>
<li>Take the fruit out of the oven and toss the blackberries on top. Sprinkle on the remaining brown sugar.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the almond crumbs over the top, then put the rest of the marzipan on top too, leaving patches of the fruit uncovered. Scatter on the flaked almonds and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Leave to cool a bit (I like it at room temperature, but you might prefer it warm) and dust a little icing sugar over the top if you like.</li>
<li>Serve with whipped cream or crème fraîche.</li>

<header> <h1> Three easy recipes that will make you fall in love with Christmas leftovers </h1> <p> From spiced turkey pie and sweet and sour toasties to a smoked salmon hash, cook up a feast on Boxing Day </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Diana Henry, The Telegraph's award-winning cookery writer <time> 24 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>There’s a lot of complaining done about Christmas leftovers. ‘God, not turkey again,’ is uttered in many a house. Me? I simply love them. </p>
<p>Any kind of hash – with crushed potatoes, greens, turkey or ham – becomes lunch, though I find it hard to turn the ham into anything, it’s so good on its own. Let’s just cut another slice, one with plenty of sugary glaze.</p>
<p>I usually find, after such a traditional British meal, that I’m craving spices, so use them in a quickly made relish; the mango version here still tastes fresh and slightly tart and is much more vibrant than a slow-cooked chutney.</p>
<a>Christmas</a> when I don’t make lentil soup the day after Boxing Day.
<p>Americans have turkey tetrazzini, a dish that’s easy to sneer at, but who doesn’t fancy the deep comfort of baked pasta with cheesy sauce, nuggets of turkey and crunchy breadcrumbs?</p>
<p>And there’s the Moroccan-spiced pie here, for which you heat the turkey in a little stock enriched with ground almonds. This is leftover cooking to be proud of. You’ve taken that bird and made it into a completely different dish.</p>
<p>If you’re left with Christmas pudding, heat it in a frying pan with some Marsala until it’s warm right through and eat it with cream, or crumble it before heating and you have another ice-cream companion.</p>
<p>Before you know it, the leftovers earmarked for next day’s lunch are no longer available. You have been warned.</p>
<h2><a>Moroccan-spiced turkey pie</a></h2>
<h2><a>Smoked salmon, leek and potato hash</a></h2>
<a>Boxing Day</a> (you can easily scale it up) or a good supper for two once you’ve got rid of all the relatives.

<h1> Mark Hix is back in business with a cool village pub with rooms in Dorset </h1>
<div> <div> By Benjamin Parker, Content Editor <time> 25 September 2021 • 10:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>With its thatched roof and mottled cream-beige exterior, strung with flowers and vines, the Fox Inn, is the epitome of a remote village pub. </p>
<p>It’s been rather a fall and rise for Hix, who came to prominence as chef-director of Caprice Holdings (Le Caprice; Scott’s), spending 17 years with the group. Next came his own restaurant empire.</p>
<p>For now, there’s just one place to stay, but more accommodation is on the way. Bill’s Annexe, named after Hix’s grandfather, jumbles countryside charm with modern quirkiness.</p>
<p>Hix built his reputation with fish and seafood, and though both feature – you can throw back Brownsea Island oysters for £2.75 a pop – the menu stays rooted in its pub surrounds: solid and unfussy done with a deft touch.</p>

<header> <h1> British bars lead the way in 2021's World's 50 Best Bars list </h1> <p> London takes the top two spots in the highly anticipated list leaving New York and Paris shaken and stirred </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 7 December 2021 • 10:45pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The number two position on the list is another win for Britain with Tayēr + Elementary. Located in the City Of London, it could scarcely be more different from The Connaught, highlighting the diversity of London’s bar scene. </p>
<p>Still, in spite of Britain taking several of the top spots, this year’s list does make clear just how challenged the country’s hospitality sector has been over the past year - in 2020, British bars took nine places in the top 50. </p>
<p>Previous names such as London’s Lyanness and Swift dropped down onto the longlist of 100 bars, while other winners such as Panda Sons in Edinburgh and the Savoy’s American Bar have disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>It’s not just London which has been singled out for success either though. A ‘speakeasy’ in Cardiff, Lab 22, wins the awards’ inaugural Siete Misterios Best Cocktail Menu title. </p>
<p>The menu features drinks based on artificial intelligence, the internet, and even time-travel (perhaps inspired by Cardiff’s association with a certain TARDIS-dweller.)</p>

<h2>At home happy hour cocktails </h2>
<p>“Many households are having regular happy hours after work,” according to research by Waitrose. “The evening glass of wine is being replaced by something spirit-based with two or three ingredients.” </p>
<p>The habit was born of lockdown but it has stuck and looks set to continue – if anything, becoming more elaborate – through 2022. So what’s on the At Home Happy Hour cocktail list?</p>
<p>Italian-influenced aperitivi are popular: at Waitrose, sales of Aperol are up 148 per cent, while vermouths are also selling extremely well, with chunky increases in sales of Martini Extra Dry, <a>Martini Rosso</a> and <a>Noilly Prat Dry</a>.</p>
<h2>English sparkling wine</h2>
<p>Homegrown sparkling wine continues to stride forward, with wine merchants reporting that many customers chose it for their Christmas and New Year celebrations in place of the usual champagne. There are so many good ones to try.</p>
<p>A surprise hit of the first 2020 lockdown, the light reds made from the gamay grape in this classic French region have continued to trend and no one is quite sure why. </p>
<a>Laithwaites</a>, where sales of beaujolais have risen 114 per cent since the pandemic began. “Either way, we’re very pleased.”
<p>South African wine is hitting a few sweet spots at the moment. At the £20-plus level, producers in the Cape are making wines that are both interesting and impressive. </p>
<a>Lay Wheeler</a>, £21.88) is an amazing, textured white made from a field blend of 10 varieties (meaning the vines of 10 different varieties are interplanted and the grapes are picked and vinified together). 
<p>Lourens Family Wines Howard John 2020 Swartland, South Africa (<a>Swig Wines</a>, £27.50) is a superb and aromatic red that is a blend of grenache, cinsault and syrah – think dried herbs and floral peppercorns with swags of fruit.</p>
<p>A good crisp white to go for is Vergelegen Sauvignon Blanc 2020 South Africa (<a>Tesco</a>, £10).</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether this trend is a “drink less, drink better” or just a “drink better” thing – either way, it’s happening both at home and when we go out.</p>
<a>Château d’Arsac 2015 Margaux</a>, Bordeaux looked great at £19.99 but it has already disappeared. If you are willing to spend £20 on a bottle, please also consider checking out your local wine merchant.
<a>Majestic</a>, out of stock online but available in some stores, £16.99/19.99 single bottle/mix six price). Also check out the Domaine Maby pinks made in the Rhône and sold by
<h2>Cocchi Vermouth di Torino </h2>
<p>(16%, <a>The Whisky Exchange</a>, £16)</p>
<p>Cocchi is one of the best Italian vermouths. This is a red vermouth that tastes of sour cherries and bitter wood, and it’s great in cocktails such as a Negroni or a Boulevardier (which is like a Negroni, but features whisky instead of gin).</p>
<h2>Chiroubles Beaujolais Cru 2019 </h2>
<p>France (13.5%, <a>Co-op</a>, £10)</p>
<p>Chiroubles is one of the 10 beaujolais cru and has the highest vineyards in the region. This one is brightly juicy, with a tantalising smell of fresh berries. Drink it lightly chilled with a plateful of coq au vin.</p>
<h2>Newton Johnson Chardonnay 2020 </h2>
<p>Upper Hemel-en-Aarde Valley, South Africa (13.5%, <a>Laithwaites</a>, £15.99/14.39 single bottle/mixed case price)</p>
<p>Newton Johnson make chardonnay with enough finesse to appeal to any burgundy drinker. This one is highly recommended and would be good with prawn, tomato and basil mayonnaise with brown bread or a roast butternut squash.</p>
