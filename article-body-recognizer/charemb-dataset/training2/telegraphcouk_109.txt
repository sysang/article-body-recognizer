<p>How are you feeling today? And don’t give me a stock British response. I want to know how you’re really feeling. What the reading on your colour-coded emotional thermometer was from the moment you woke up.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a whole world of feelings out there just waiting to be brought out into the open. And am I alone in finding the prospect of a future generation of hyper emotionally literate humans terrifying?</p>
<a>Because your emotional brain is at once the loudest, most definitive and stupidest part of the brain. So you can’t be led by emotions entirely</a>.”
<h1> The Beatles: Get Back, review: Peter Jackson's epic edit is truly fab, but too long and winding </h1>

<a>partner Yoko Ono</a>) seem to drift in a state of lethargy. Determined to defuse tensions, McCartney presciently observes that “in 50 years time its going to seem comical that [we] broke up because Yoko sat on an amp.”
<a>Harrison briefly quits and Lennon doesn’t show up for rehearsals</a>, Jackson lingers in slow motion on McCartney’s tearful expression. “And then there were two,” he tells Starr.

<h1> 2020 Ford Puma Titanium review: this most affordable version is also the best </h1>
<p> The lowest specification of this acclaimed small crossover is the one that most buyers will choose – but does this mean a major sacrifice? </p>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, contributing editor <time> 9 November 2020 • 6:06am </time> </div> </div>
<a>Peugeot 208</a> – but this is still our favourite of the current glut of small, town-friendly SUVs. 
<a>login</a> to find out our decisive verdict. 
<p>Pros: brilliant ride and handling balance; practical boot; perky, efficient engine.</p>
<p>Cons: interior feels low-rent in places; resale values aren’t the best; no sliding rear seats.</p>
<a>Fiesta ST</a>. We’ll have a comprehensive review of that just as soon as we can lay our hands on one. 
<p>If it’s an automatic you’re after, meanwhile, you’re restricted to a non-hybrid version of the 123bhp engine – which, as you might imagine, has a detrimental effect on fuel economy. </p>
<p>The Puma is roughly on a par with rivals like the Nissan Juke and Volkswagen T-Cross in size terms – a touch bigger than a Seat Arona, but smaller than the Skoda Kamiq and Peugeot 3008. </p>
<p>But it’s in the boot where the Puma pulls out its biggest trump card. Granted, it lacks the sliding rear seats of the Renault Captur, but what it offers instead is actually far more useful in day-to-day life. </p>
<p>In price terms, the Puma is pitched half-way between an equivalent Fiesta and a Focus, which seems about right, and against its rivals it looks like decent value, if not outstanding. </p>
<p>This Titanium model is pretty well equipped, too; cruise control, climate control, rear parking sensors, 17-inch alloy wheels and a heated windscreen all come as standard. </p>
<p>You can upgrade to ST-Line, which gets you a sportier bodykit but, slightly sneakily, loses the climate control in favour of manual air conditioning, or ST-Line X, which reinstates it and adds a beefy sound system and 18-inch wheels. </p>
<p>Want more? ST-Line Vignale gets leather upholstery, heated massage seats in the front, LED headlights and front parking sensors. As you might expect, though, it doesn’t come cheap. </p>
<p>The ST, meanwhile, is even pricier, but to all intents and purposes it’s a full-blown hot hatch with that punchy engine and a smattering of extra performance goodies including better brakes and specially tuned suspension. </p>
<p>You might think this matters little in an urban runaround, but in fact the opposite is true; the Puma’s agility makes nipping and dodging through town, whirling around roundabouts and sweeping around corners, immense fun. </p>
<p>In the flesh, though, this car is less divisive than in pictures, and the tidy profile and pert tail look neat and well-resolved, even if the whole isn’t quite as chic as the Peugeot 2008 or as ruggedly charming as the Jeep Renegade.</p>
<p>As we’ve already mentioned, we really rather like the Puma. However, what we hadn’t yet discovered was the best news of all: the best version is also the most affordable.</p>
<p>Telegraph rating: Five out of five</p>
<p>On test: Ford Puma 1.0 EcoBoost Hybrid 125 Titanium</p>
<p>How much? £21,640 on the road</p>

<p>If ever there was a Marmite car, the first-generation Nissan Juke is it. You either love it, or you hate it. And with its googly eyes, chubby cheeks, oddly sloping roofline and bulging haunches, plenty of people fall into that latter camp.</p>
<p>The old Juke clattered terribly off even the smallest bumps, so we peered at the big, 19-inch wheels and paper-thin tyres of our test car with trepidation. Happily, we needn’t have worried. </p>
<p>Better to stick to the six-speed manual, which is a little long of throw but sweet enough to shift, and with which the engine feels far happier.</p>
<p>It’s even pretty frugal; fuel consumption figures are in line with the Juke’s best rivals, and CO2 emissions are suitably low too. As a result, benefit-in-kind payments are competitive if you’re a company car driver.</p>

<header> <h1> The top 10 British breweries, named among the best in the world by RateBeer </h1> <p> Craft beer aficionados, rejoice – these ten UK breweries feature in a global top 100 ranking </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 2 March 2020 • 5:03pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The craft beer movement has seen increasingly discerning British drinkers turn away from generic, mass-produced beers and lagers – and their quest for better quality brews has revived Britain’s historic beer market of late.</p>
<a>Northern Monk </a>in Leeds to
<a>Wylam Brewery</a> in Newcastle. 
<p>In America, a craft brewer is formally defined as a small, independent brewer with an annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less (approximately 3 percent of U.S. annual sales). </p>
<p>With that in mind, allow us to present Britain’s top ten breweries according to RateBeer (in descending order), as featured in the Top 100 Best Brewers in the World 2019 list, published this month…</p>
<h4>10. BrewDog, Aberdeenshire</h4>
<h4>9. Siren Craft Brew, Berkshire</h4>
<h4>8. Northern Monk Brew Co, Leeds</h4>
<h4>7. Magic Rock Brewing, Huddersfield</h4>
<p>Another Yorkshire brewery, in 45th place according to RateBeer. Established back in 2011, Magic Rock founder Richard Burhouse and head brewer Stuart Ross are inspired by local brewing traditions and the vibrant US craft beer scene.</p>
<h4>6. Wylam Brewery, Newcastle</h4>
<h4>5. Fuller’s Brewery, Chiswick</h4>
<h4> 4. Buxton Brewery, Derbyshire</h4>
<h4>3. Verdant Brewing Co, Cornwall</h4>
<p>Based in Falmouth, Verdant specialise in hoppy beers which are unfiltered, unfined and vegan friendly. </p>
<h4>2. The Kernel Brewery, London</h4>
<h4> 1. Cloudwater Brew Co, Manchester</h4>
<p>You can visit the tap room and brewery shop on the Piccadilly Trading Estate throughout the week, and tours and tastings run regularly, but do book tickets for those in advance – they sell out fast. </p>
<p>They also have a London tap room on Bermondsey’s Enid Street. As well as the likes of their bold, punchy DDH (double dry hopped) 5.0% ABV pale ale, Cloudwater’s low and no soft drinks include pineapple and yuzu soda. </p>
<header> <h1> Six of the best Continental-style beers brewed in Britain </h1> <p> With Belgian and German beers stuck on the continent, now's the time to pour a helles from Hartlepool or a saison from Sussex </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Cole <time> 23 February 2021 • 4:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>They are also facing the added issue that export to the continent has ground to a halt for many of them, as courier and haulage firms figure out how to navigate the export issues caused by the eleventh hour deal.</p>
<p>So, if drinkers are really missing their fix of European beer styles, there really is no need to despair, or resort to sub-par substitutions, because there is plenty of this style of beer to drink from these shores.</p>
<p>Utopian Unfiltered British Lager </p>
<p>This unfiltered style will change your perceptions of lager all being bland and fizzy for life. Its rich bready notes, from a light body, and a refreshing herbal, grassy tang, leave a deep desire to dive back for more.</p>
<p>Classic German-style lager with a bit of modern hopping, so light-handed it’s like a baby’s breath of a floral hint, making it a genuine joy to drink in the spring sunshine.</p>
<p>From a brewery run by scientist and Belgian-born brewer turned London native Roman Hochuli, Halmos has hints of the classic Belgian blonde ales, but with some added interest from its flavours of preserved lemon and apricot jam.</p>
<p>With its high proportion of wheat, this is an ideal replacement drink for Belgian wit beer lovers; with its lightly tart hint of gooseberry and meadowsweet, it ticks all the same boxes.</p>
<p>Manchester Union Black Lager</p>
<p>Burning Sky Rustic Saison</p>

<h1> La Palma volcano: Spain invites tourists to enjoy ‘wonderful show’ as eruption triggers evacuation </h1>
<p> Lava flows destroy buildings and residents are forced to flee, but tourism minister insists Canary Island hotspot remains open to visitors </p>
<div> <div> By James Badcock Madrid <time> 20 September 2021 • 2:33pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A Spanish minister on Monday called on tourists to visit La Palma, in the Canary Islands, where a volcanic eruption has forced 5,000 people from their homes, to enjoy "a wonderful show” as lava swallowed buildings on its way to the ocean.</p>
<p>The volcano began erupting on Sunday, with lava shooting 50 feet into the air. The eruption destroyed around 100 houses.</p>
<p>Some 500 tourists at a resort on the west of the island were given the option of staying put or being evacuated by boat to nearby Tenerife. The majority chose to leave.</p>
<p>However, Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, insisted the island was still open to visitors.</p>
<p>"There are no restrictions on going to the island ... on the contrary, we're passing on the information so tourists know they can travel to the island and enjoy something unusual, see it for themselves," she told Spanish radio. </p>
<p> Flights to the area were briefly cancelled, before resuming on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish Prime Minister, postponed a trip to <a>the UN General Assembly in New York</a> and travelled to La Palma, the most northwestern island in the Canaries archipelago.</p>
<p>Mr Sánchez assured locals who fear they may have lost their properties that any material damage would be compensated “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>The Spanish army deployed its emergency unit to help with the evacuations.</p>
<p>The eruption could last for weeks, according to volcanologists.</p>
<p>Footage posted online shows the slow-moving lava eating into properties, which will end up buried under rock as the lava cools.</p>
<p>"The lava is moving towards the coast and the damage will be material. According to experts there are about 17-20 million cubic meters of lava," said Angel Victor Torres, the Canary Islands regional president.</p>
<p>The lava was moving at roughly half a mile per hour, and was predicted to reach the sea by Monday evening.</p>
<p>The molten mass obliterated homes, banana plantations and a school as it rolled through the municipality of El Paso.</p>
<p>La Palma had been on high alert after more than 22,000 tremors were reported in the space of a week in Cumbre Vieja, a chain of volcanoes that last saw a major eruption in 1971.</p>
<p>The Canary Islands’ Involcan volcanology institute said that between 6,000 and 9,000 metric tons of sulphur dioxide (SO2) had already been spewed into the air. </p>
