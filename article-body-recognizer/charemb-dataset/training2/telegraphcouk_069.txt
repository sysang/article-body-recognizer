<p>In which case you might be forgiven for thinking that, for various reasons, electric cars (EVs) won’t catch on, but that the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel means they have to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of misinformation concerning electric cars, much of it spewed by organisations which should really know better. Or at least do some proper research before sounding off.</p>
<p>But, as I always suggest to EV cynics: try it, you just might like it.</p>
<p>Not so long ago electric cars were seen as oddities but they are inexorably becoming the norm, driven by legislation. By 2030, no new purely petrol or diesel cars will be sold in the UK, meaning that the market will be almost entirely electric.</p>
<p>Should you make the switch yet? The choice expands by the week but there remains a lot of confusion about electric cars, so we’ve demystified the market to help you make an informed choice.</p>
<h3>Everything you need to know about buying an electric car</h3>
<h4>Electric or electrified? Main types explained</h4>
<p>⇢ also known as: Electric cars, EVs, battery electric cars, BEVs</p>
<p>These have a large battery pack combined with one, two or even three electric motors. They are powered solely by electricity, so you have to charge them.</p>
<p>Best used for: Short- to medium-length journeys and regular commutes, although long-range EVs (around 250 miles’ range or more) with rapid charging can work well.</p>
<p>⇢ also known as: PHEVs</p>
<p>Best used for: A mix of frequent short commutes and semi-regular, medium- to longer-range journeys.</p>
<p>⇢ also known as: Self-charging hybrids, full hybrids, HEVs</p>
<p>Best used for: Regular long-distance trips or homes where charging is impossible.</p>
<h4>The benefits of electric propulsion</h4>
<p>Electric cars are cost-effective to run, too, because electricity is far cheaper than fuel per mile, and servicing is simpler (and therefore less expensive).</p>
<h4>What about the downsides?</h4>
<p>At the moment, electric cars don’t go as far between charges as you might expect a petrol or diesel car to travel on a full tank of fuel.</p>
<p>Electric cars still tend to be more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel alternatives, too.</p>
<h4>Expensive? I thought there was a Government grant for electric cars</h4>
<p>What’s more, you might find the money you save on running costs makes up for the higher price of the car.</p>
<h4>Tell me more about those low running costs</h4>
<p>More often than not, running an electric car will be cheaper than a petrol or diesel one, simply because electricity is considerably less expensive per mile, especially if you mainly charge at home. Maintenance costs are usually lower, too.</p>
<p>It depends heavily on whether you have a charger at home. Public chargers can be expensive – sometimes so much so that it can make running an electric car costlier than a petrol or diesel one.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be charging away from home a lot, then, your electric car’s efficiency will matter.</p>
<h4>Efficiency? I thought range was the big concern</h4>
<h4>How do I find out an electric car’s efficiency?</h4>
<p>Most manufacturers now list efficiency figures in their brochures; if you can’t find the figure, ask the dealer instead.</p>
<h4>What is a kilowatt-hour?</h4>
<p>A kilowatt-hour, or kWh, is a unit of energy: 1kWh is enough energy to run an electrical appliance (in this case a car) with a power rating of 1,000 watts, or 1 kilowatt (kW), for one hour.</p>
<p>It might help to think of a kilowatt-hour as being a bit like a litre of fuel. Your battery (or fuel tank) can only hold so many of them; once they’re depleted, the car will stop.</p>
<p>If you have a bigger battery (ie one with a higher kWh rating), it will hold more charge – or fuel – and your car will travel further.</p>
<p>But equally, if your EV is more efficient, it will travel further on fewer kilowatt-hours, so it will cost you less, and you won’t need as big a battery.</p>
<h4>Is charging an EV as complicated as it sounds?</h4>
<h4>How easy is it to get a charger installed at home?</h4>
<h4>You said it takes a long time to charge an electric car, but how long?</h4>
<h4>Sounds great – can any electric car use these faster chargers?</h4>
<p>No. An electric car is only capable of receiving charge at a certain rate and that’s limited by its on-board charging equipment. Today, the fastest public chargers in the UK are capable of charging at 150kW.</p>
<p>Charging speeds are measured in kilowatts (kW) – think of these as the number of kilowatt-hours you can add to your car’s battery in an hour. So in that time, a 50kW rapid charger will add 50kWh to the battery.</p>
<h4>How long will the car’s batteries last?</h4>
<h4>How much does it cost to replace a battery?</h4>
<p>At the moment, it will set you back anywhere from £4,000 upwards, depending on the size of the battery and the type of car it’s going into.</p>
<h4>The big question: how environmentally friendly are electric cars, really?</h4>
<p>The production of EVs causes a great deal more emissions than the production of conventional cars. However, they usually make up for this by producing relatively few emissions in use.</p>
<p>As <a>electric cars</a> become more commonplace, sourcing these materials may yet become a sticking point.</p>
<h5>‘It does 200 miles between recharges – about six times more than I need’</h5>
<p>After four years of rare refills with a hybrid car, Sarah Rodrigues and her family tried an all-electric model to discover if it suits their needs. </p>
<p>So, with government grants for electric cars on the table, it makes perfect sense to investigate the possibility of upgrading to a fully electric vehicle, in this case an all-electric Citroën e-C4 family hatchback.</p>
<p>As cars go, this family Citroën doesn’t look very cool – certainly not as cool as my previous BMW X5. But, who am I kidding? </p>
<h3>Buying new: the top five affordable family electric cars</h3>
<p>Here are our top five affordable family EVs. The prices quoted do not include the Government PiCG discount of £2,500.</p>
<p>Volkswagen’s new electric Golf by another name, and just like a Golf it handles tidily, rides well, and feels fresh and modern inside. Fiddly touch-sensitive controls and central screen are the only flaws.</p>
<p>Getting on a bit now, but still one of our favourite electric cars. Tonnes of space, a long warranty and the option of a long-range variant, while it’s comfortable and quiet too.</p>
<p>Beautiful interior and classy ride and handling. Range not the best for the price, but the E-2008 is well equipped, and looks and feels just like a normal car.</p>
<p>Big, friendly SUV with a classy interior and an easy-going driving experience, though avoid the top-spec Sportline; it isn’t quite as comfortable as the rest.</p>
<h5>Our pick of the used Evs</h5>
<p>Can’t afford new? No problem. Here’s our five favourite second-hand plug-ins. </p>
<p>Been around for years yet still feels fresh, thanks to frequent updates. Careful of battery-leased examples, which incur a monthly fee.</p>
<p>A concept car made flesh. Looks like nothing else on the road and feels great to drive, too. Lack of a fifth seat and a tiny boot limit practicality, though.</p>
<h4>Hyundai Ioniq Electric</h4>
<p>Not much here to stir the soul – the Ioniq is a bit bland. But the long warranty and high equipment levels mean it’s great value, and it’s roomy and comfortable inside.</p>
<p>Original Tesla is infamous for reliability issues, but if you can live with the glitches there’s plenty else to like here: incredible technology, huge range, fabled performance and the company’s cracking Supercharger network.</p>
<p>Cheap, cheerful electric SUV can’t match the best on range. But if all you need is a local runaround, it’s comfortable, decent to drive and a long warranty provides added peace of mind.</p>

<p>But the latest wave of electric cars <a>are capable of some very respectable ranges</a> – the sort that mean you can do a week’s commute on one charge, and still have enough power left for a day out at the weekend. </p>

<h1> Volkswagen Tiguan eHybrid review: the plug-in hybrid that’s the very definition of average </h1>
<p> There’s not much to hate about Volkswagen’s new plug-in SUV – but there’s not much to love, either </p>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, Contributing Editor <time> 23 December 2021 • 4:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Despite this, people rarely get excited about A4 paper. And the same can be said of the Volkswagen Tiguan. It is the A4 paper of SUVs; solid, sensible and useful, but somewhat lacking in excitement.</p>
<a>plug-in hybrid</a> powertrain, which we’ve already seen in the Golf and Passat GTEs, as well as a smattering of Skoda, Seat and Audi models. So has either of these revisions brought a bit of colour to the Tiguan’s blank sheet?
<p>High company car tax rates (for a PHEV)</p>
<a>Citroen C5 Aircross</a>, for example, can go 40 miles on electric power (with the same sized battery to boot). 
<p>Unlike Volkswagen’s GTE models, the Tiguan eHybrid is positioned not as a distinct model in its own right, but as an engine option available on three versions of the Tiguan: Life, Elegance and R-Line. </p>
<p>Go for the Life, and you get front rear parking sensors, LED headlights, three-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control and 18-inch alloy wheels, which seems like plenty for an entry-level model.</p>
<p>The infotainment system, meanwhile, is Volkswagen’s latest, which is renowned for its glitchiness, although the system in our test car didn’t give us any issues and felt relatively intuitive. </p>
<h2>Papering over the cracks</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the chassis telegraphs its intentions pretty well and if the nose does lose grip it does so very progressively, which means that while this isn’t exactly a fun car to drive, it is at least safe and predictable. </p>
<p>Telegraph rating: Three stars out of five</p>
<p>On test: Volkswagen Tiguan 1.4 eHybrid 245 Elegance</p>
<p>Body style: Five-door SUV</p>
<p>How much? £38,585 on the road (PHEV range from £36,185)</p>
<p>How fast? 127mph, 0-62mph in 7.5sec</p>
<p>How economical? 153.2mpg (WLTP Combined)</p>
<p>Engine gearbox: 1,395cc four-cylinder petrol engine, six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, front-wheel drive</p>
<p>Electric powertrain: AC electric motor with 13kWh battery, 3.6kW on-board charger, Type 2 charging socket</p>

<h2> Audi A8 review: brimming with luxury and tech but still the bridesmaid in this class </h2>
<p> The German limousine gains a plethora of technology but faces tough competition from luxury SUVs as well as the indulgent Mercedes S-Class </p>
<h2> <a> Lexus NX 450h review: this posh plug-in hybrid makes a lot of sense – but only for company car drivers </a> </h2>
<p> Unfortunately, private owners won’t benefit from the tax breaks that come with plugging in what is effectively a car with two engines </p>
<h2> <a> Ford S-Max Hybrid review: A bit rough around the edges, but it’s still a comfortable, quiet and practical family hauler </a> </h2>
<p> Seven-seat MPVs have all but been eclipsed by SUVs but this long-running Ford proves there’s plenty of life in the people carrier format </p>
<h2> <a> Audi SQ5 Sportback review: You may see a big, dumb SUV - but it's far from the automotive antichrist </a> </h2>
<p> It prioritises pace and comfort over outright driving thrills – but has Audi missed a trick in making it a diesel and so very sensible? </p>
<h2> Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo review: don’t buy an electric SUV until you’ve read this </h2>
<p> This more practical Taycan melds the best bits of EVs, SUVs, estates and four-door coupés into one sublime package </p>
<h2> <a> Honda HR-V review: comfort and joy – with impressive economy too </a> </h2>
<p> The Japanese compact SUV/crossover has an illustrious pedigree but how does the new version measure up in an ultra-competitive market? </p>
<h2> <a> Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT review: the 186mph monster SUV that environmentalists will love to hate </a> </h2>
<p> Big, thirsty and ballistically quick, this 631bhp Cayenne takes hyper-luxury high performance to a whole new level </p>
<h2> <a> Renault Megane E-Tech review: France produces an electric car I’d be glad to own </a> </h2>
<p> This is the first of a new generation of battery electric family cars, but has Renault learned from its mistakes to make it a success? </p>
<h2> Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 review: A blend of talents that risks being a jack of all trades and a master of none </h2>
<p> Can a seven-seat SUV based on a hot hatchback really work? </p>
<h2> <a> MG ZS review: this budget SUV is great value and great fun – but with one major flaw </a> </h2>
<p> The ZS small SUV is hard to beat in terms of bang for buck. But should its crash test performance put you off? </p>
<h2> <a> Tesla Model Y review: a good electric car – but pending rivals may force you to reconsider </a> </h2>
<p> This SUV/crossover version of the Model 3 that has taken Europe by storm is fast and spacious but it’s by no means a default choice </p>
<h2> <a> DS4 review: French sophistication isn’t enough to rescue an insubstantial driving experience </a> </h2>
<p> The boutique brand takes a tilt at Europe’s biggest car market and some astonishingly accomplished rivals </p>
<h2> Mini Electric review: this electric hot hatch is an easy car to love, but a hard one to justify </h2>
<p> The swap from petrol to electric hasn’t diminished the latest Mini’s sense of fun </p>
<h2> <a> Mercedes-Benz S350d review: this new S-Class is still in the running for best car in the world </a> </h2>
<p> High technology and a glamorous interior mean the S-Class feels the part – but is it just a bit too clever for its own good? </p>
<h2> <a> Peugeot 308 Hybrid 225 review: Expensive, but also efficient and stylish family transport </a> </h2>
<p> Peugeot’s family hatch moves up market and gets plug-in power, but no GTI version </p>
<h2> <a> Ford Mustang Mach 1 review: it’s no Porsche-beater but you just won’t care </a> </h2>
<p> This honed, track-oriented version of the Mustang is certainly sharper, but it hasn’t lost the character that makes this car so special </p>
<h2> Dacia Duster 4x4 review: back-to-basics SUV is a great, utilitarian workhorse </h2>
<p> Fresh from a mid-life facelift, this version of the Duster is a worthy successor to rugged small 4x4s of old </p>
<h2> <a> Chevrolet Corvette C8 review: still a legend, and now a bigger threat than ever to European rivals </a> </h2>
<p> In its eighth generation, the all-American supercar gets a mid-mounted engine and right hand drive </p>
<h2> <a> BMW i4 review: the German establishment leads the fightback against Tesla </a> </h2>
<p> Tesla’s Model 3 is selling strongly throughout Europe but BMW’s riposte is aimed at re-establishing German hegemony </p>
<h2> <a> Mercedes-Benz EQV review: an electric seven-seater with a decent range – but an eye-watering price </a> </h2>
<p> With plenty of seats and a potential range of 213 miles, this might seem perfect for a large family who wish to live the electric dream </p>

<a>Audi</a> – produce some of the least reliable cars. And joining them among the bottom 10 manufacturers for reliability are fellow German firms
<a>Honda</a> is streets ahead of the competition. But, following on, brands that aren’t as renowned for reliability stand out. Numbers two to five are
<a>Skoda</a>. Perhaps more predictably,
<a>Hyundai</a> all feature in the lower reaches of the top 10.
<h2>German and premium car makers struggle</h2>
<p>Gremlins in the electrical system were the bugbear of Mercedes, Porsche and BMW. For Audi, suspension trouble is what’s most likely to cause problems. </p>
<p>Rival premium makers don’t have much to smirk about either: Land Rover, Mini and Volvo are also in the bottom 10. And they’re joined by Nissan, Seat and Kia.</p>
<h2>Have the French found their mojo?</h2>
<h2>Mercedes models seem breakdown prone </h2>
<div> <p>The minimum sample size for a model was 50 so that the data was less likely to be influenced by a small number of problems. Even so, the results don’t make happy reading for Mercedes, which has four cars in the bottom 10. </p> </div>
<a>BMW i8</a>. This suffers mainly from electrical problems with engine and suspension trouble in equal measure. The
<a>Volvo S80</a>, which appears beset with engine glitches, joins these two at the bottom.
<h2>Honda makes very reliable motors</h2>
<a>Vauxhall Zafira Tourer</a> is the car that troubles MotorEasy customers least, with a top score of 46.5 for reliability. This popular family seven-seater goes some way to making amends for the previous version that became renowned for catching fire.
<p>Two Citroens in the top 10 for reliability is a surprise, with the <a>C5</a> in ninth spot and the <a>C1</a> city car hot on the heels of the Zafira with 44.5 points.</p>
<h2>Smaller manufacturers and anomalies</h2>
<a>Kia</a> too suffers from the apparently fragile braking system of the
<a>Sorento</a>. Its more popular
<a>Ceed</a> model is actually on the fringe of the 10 most reliable. 
<a>Alhambra MPV</a>. Volvo is in a similar boat. Its more popular S40 and V50 models actually record decent results; it’s the old S80 (not made since 2016) that lets the Swedes down.
<p>The manufacturers that sneak under the radar by making averagely reliable cars include Ford, Jaguar and Mazda. Alfa Romeo also occupies that centre ground.</p>
<h2>How we ranked the car makers</h2>
<a>MotorEasy</a> data for 168 models from 31 manufacturers. To gauge reliability we’ve taken warranty claims and car repairs over the last two years on cars aged between three and 15 years. 
<p>Each car is given a reliability score ranging from minus 100 for the highly unreliable motor from hell, to 100 for a dream car that never goes wrong. </p>
<h2>What the manufacturers say</h2>
<p>We gave every manufacturer featuring in the bottom 10 their chance to respond. Only three did.</p>
<p>Porsche said: “Owning a Porsche is the fulfilment of a dream for many people, and we strive to deliver a complete ownership experience that lives up to that expectation.</p>

<h1> The ten best cars of 2021 – including the best hot hatch on sale today </h1>
<p> This year has been the perfect storm of production delays, but the industry has still produced a few gems – our critics share their picks </p>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent and Alex Robbins, Contributing Editor <time> 30 December 2021 • 10:54am </time> </div> </div>
<a>McLaren</a> Artura hybrid supercar, to name but three. Now that Covid is raising its horned head once again, it’s hard to believe what damage it’s done to the motor industry, though some of the collateral damage is self-inflicted.
<a>the silicon chip shortage</a> hit and resulted in almost sales-ready cars parked awaiting window-lift controllers and suchlike.
<a>Tesla</a>, which bounded in with shiploads of Chinese-produced Model 3s as car makers struggled out of lockdown. At one point this year, the
<a>Model 3</a> was Europe’s second bestselling car of all types behind
<a>Toyota</a>, then, which (unlike Peugeot and Citroën, with which it made the Aygo/108/C1 city car), is going to replace its petrol-engined tiddler next year.
<a>Ford Fiesta</a> (normally Britain’s favourite car) has fallen out of the top-ten best sellers entirely. The UK top seller in November was the
<a>Vauxhall Corsa</a> and Tesla’s Model 3. The year-to-date bestselling maker was Volkswagen, with Ford struggling into second place, closely followed by Audi, BMW and then Toyota and Mercedes-Benz. What strange times we live in…
<a>Aston Martin Vantage F1 Edition</a>, which is the car the Vantage should have been in the first place; the
<a>Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, which is a super-strong contender for the 2022 Car of the Year title; and
<a>BMW’s R1250 RT</a> motorcycle tourer, an all-round machine, which almost convinced me to swap four wheels for two. 
<p>But these are the ten cars that really fired me up…</p>
<p>It rides well, is fast enough to merit the BMW badge on the bonnet and the new BMW braking system is spectacularly good in balancing current regeneration and retardation. AE</p>
<h2>Renault Mégane E-Tech</h2>
<p>So your £74,200 buys you a gorgeous-looking, low-slung coupé or convertible with a 475bhp, 6.2-litre V8 engine delivering a top speed of 184mph and 0-62mph in 3.5sec. With great handling and looks like this, as they say, why pay more? AE</p>
<p>Seat’s sub-brand has bettered the Volkswagen Golf GTI on which its Leon hatchback is based while undercutting it on price. The Leon’s chassis is aggressively grippy, while its engine is addictively muscular and flexible.</p>
<h2>Bentley Flying Spur V8</h2>
<p>Even through the gauze of opulence, some Bentleys don’t quite hold up when you drive them. Some, however, make good on their promise, and the Flying Spur is one of those.</p>
<p>It is the consummate hyper-luxury saloon, teaming a beautifully finished interior with a glorious ride comfort, yet it’s also surprisingly deft to drive for such a vast car.</p>
<p>The best part is that the V8 is the best model in the range, despite also being the cheapest. Well, relatively speaking, of course. AR</p>
<p>The Mirai is different: an electric car powered by electricity generated from hydrogen, rather than a heavy battery. But for how much longer will it be the exception?</p>
<p>Certainly, this second-generation Mirai proves hydrogen is a compelling alternative – and that it can fuel a handsome executive saloon of beguiling refinement and comfort.</p>
<p>But above all, what the Mirai proves is that with the right infrastructure, hydrogen provides hope for drivers for whom battery cars just won’t work without major compromises. AR</p>
<p>For all the future-gazing going on in the industry, one car that came out this year has its roots firmly in the past – both in its name and provenance, as well as in its way of doing things.</p>
<p>That makes the Mustang Mach 1 feel like a bit of a relic; mostly, though, it does so for the better. Its thunderous V8 engine, for example, so refreshing in these days of synthetically ameliorated soundtracks.</p>
<p>Then there’s the way it drives; rough around the edges but surprisingly capable, with feel and character aplenty.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Mach 1 feels special at any speed and every journey is an event; there are vanishingly few new cars about which you can say that – and fewer still for the £55,000 the range-topping Mustang will set you back. AR</p>
<h2>Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo</h2>
<p>This isn’t a cheap way into pure electric propulsion but it’s certainly one of the best, combining the <a>Taycan saloon</a>’s blistering pace, razor-sharp handling and excellent balance with a more spacious, practical body.</p>
<p>The happy by-product is a more comfortable ride, which is what makes the Cross Turismo such an excellent long-distance cruiser. It also provides the sort of communication and feedback to the driver that most electric cars can only dream of.</p>
<p>It is, in short, everything an electric Porsche should be – and more besides. AR</p>

<header> <h1> How to buy a used car instead of a new one </h1> <p> Many are buying used to avoid long waiting lists for new cars. But what should you expect if you haven’t bought used for a while – or ever? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, Contributing Editor <time> 6 September 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Many have turned to used cars instead. But if the last few cars you bought were new, or you’ve never bought a used car before, the idea of doing so can be rather daunting.</p>
<p>And at the fot of this article we’ve included links to more no-nonsense car-buying advice.</p>
<h3>Can I finance a used car like I can a new one?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. But you don’t get quite the same wide range of options at every dealer. </p>
<p>In short, you should have no problem getting a finance deal on a used car – but you might have to shop around to get the best deal, and you’ll want to double check the small print to ensure you aren’t paying over the odds.</p>
<h3>Can I lease a used car?</h3>
<p>Yes. It’s still a fairly niche part of the market, but some companies offer lease or long-term rental deals on used cars, so if you don’t want to own your used car outright that option is open to you.</p>
<p>What’s more, you won’t get a say in how well looked after the car has been – and that could result in it being less reliable. It’s certainly a less surefire way of running a car than leasing brand new.</p>
<h3>What about the warranty?</h3>
<p>Buying new offers one big benefit: a long, manufacturer-backed warranty. Every new car these days comes with at least a three-year, 60,000-mile warranty. But there are ways of ending up with just as much cover on a used car.</p>
<h3>Can I buy an aftermarket warranty instead?</h3>
<p>You can also top up your car’s warranty by using an aftermarket company. There are several offering various levels of cover. </p>
<h3>Can I buy online and have the car delivered?</h3>
<p>Most of these dealers offer a seven-day, no-quibble money-back guarantee, however, while their obligation to arrange to collect the car if you decide you don’t want it is enshrined in the Consumer Rights Act 2015. </p>
<p>So while it’s now very easy to buy a used car and have it delivered to your home just like you can with a new one, it’s an option that’s to be treated with care. </p>
<h3>Should I still buy from a franchised dealer?</h3>
<p>The downside is that you usually get fewer extras thrown in with the sale, and most independent dealers only offer a three-month warranty as standard – you’ll have to pay extra for more. </p>
<h3>What are the key things to look out for when buying used?</h3>
<p>Your first port of call should be the car’s service history. Some modern cars don’t use a stamped book for this – instead, it’s stored within the car’s on-board computer, or on a manufacturer database. </p>
<p>But you can usually ask for a print-out of the history from a dealer. If the car has been serviced away from the main dealer network, a fastidious owner should have kept records of the car’s servicing in the form of invoices. </p>
<p>There are other tell-tale signs as to the car’s provenance. Dealers can easily clean interiors to get them looking spick and span, but it’s harder to remove signs of wear from the seat bolsters, gear lever and steering wheel. </p>
<p>When you test-drive the car, do so with the radio turned off, and listen for any untoward clunks, creaks or rattles from the suspension, or strange noises from the engine. </p>
<p>And finally, of course, make sure the car comes with everything it should – including a spare key, the spare wheel (or puncture repair kit if fitted instead), locking wheel nut key, owners’ manuals and parcel shelf or load cover. </p>

<header> <h1> How long does an electric car battery last? </h1> <p> It’s a key question for buyers of new EVs and an even more pressing issue when buying used: will the battery need replacing before the car? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 19 October 2021 • 10:50am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The cumulative effect of having to renew battery-electric cars every 10 years compared with, say, every 15 years makes an enormous difference to their environmental impact.</p>
<a>Luca de Meo, chief executive of Renault, said that it might take the introduction of less energy-dense but cheaper</a> lithium-ion phosphate battery chemistry in a few years to get the price down to that level.
<p>On the subject of the service life of the current generation of lithium-ion batteries, he was deliberately vague, although he did reveal that Renault is planning a refurbishment facility at its Flins plant in northern France.</p>
<h3>Avoiding the question?</h3>
<p>Or take Tomas Ingenlath, chief executive of Polestar, who looked pretty awkward when asked the same question at the 2020 launch of the Polestar 2, a battery-electric super-saloon.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure that everyone is “a bit more relaxed about the battery question”, especially as it directly affects the cost of running your battery car even if you only own it for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Yet battery cars are fairly simple, with few moving parts and they can be pretty easy on their drivetrains and brakes, so their mechanical structure might last even longer than the average 13.9-year life of a conventional car in the UK. </p>
<h3>How long will your battery last – part one</h3>
<a>battery life predictor for fleets based on that research</a>.
<p>A lithium-ion battery’s ability to hold its as-new state of charge (SOH) is affected by: time; high or low temperatures; maintaining a continual high (or SOC); repeated high-current charging; and lots of energy cycling of the battery.</p>
<p>“We are interested in what is happening in real-life,” said Gordon. “How are EV batteries performing within fleets, and at what rate are the batteries degrading?”</p>
<p>“Therefore, I would stick with what we actually know, on average 2.3% a year degradation, although it varies between make, model and year.”</p>
<h3>Ways to kill a battery</h3>
<h3>How long will your battery last – part two</h3>
<p>Geotab’s data is all very well, but it’s a snapshot and mostly doesn’t go beyond five years. So, what happens inside the battery over that time and for longer periods?</p>
<p>So how long does an automotive battery last, Mr Hall?</p>
<p>He explains that there are several pathways of battery deterioration, mechanical and chemical, and that measuring it is difficult.</p>
<p>He says that his main work is to do with the problem of the growth of electrical resistance in the cell – “or how quickly the lithium ions are getting slower…</p>
<p>“Like a lot of things that come with degradation,” he says, “the difficult thing is to predict the rate.”</p>
<h3>How a lithium-ion battery works (and how it starts to degrade)</h3>
<a>lithium-ion batteries comprise five main components: cathode; anode; separator; current collectors; and electrolyte</a>. The anode and cathode store the lithium and the electrolyte is the medium through which the positively-charged lithium ions travel.
<p>The role of cobalt is crucial here as most car makers are pushing to reduce the cobalt content because of shortages and human rights issues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is where most of it is mined.</p>
<p>As Hall says: “When you change the relative amounts of cobalt and nickel, it affects the production rate of oxygen.”</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be confused with the ‘million-mile durability’ trailed by Elon Musk in the run-up to Tesla’s investors’ Battery Day in 2020.</p>
<p>“Lithium-cobalt oxide cells in medical devices are still going strong after 10 years,” says Hall. “The big thing to extend battery life is temperature control and that’s much easier with grid storage [than in cars].”</p>
<h3>Longevity is full of dilemmas</h3>
<p>“Well, it’s partly temperature,” corrects Hall, before pausing, “but also the designs that tolerate fast charging and a high range aren’t the same, but we all want a battery that does both.</p>
<p>“It comes down to whether you are going to improve the engineering of the cell, or improve the stability of the components in the cell you have; they are related but independent.”</p>
<p>In fact, unlike a lot of battery pundits, Hall thinks the lithium-ion cell will be with us for a lot longer than we thought, as it gradually gets improved.</p>
<p>Presumably they’ll last even longer than the current generation, but we still don’t know how long that may be.</p>
<h3>How long will your battery last – part three</h3>
<p>Over to Maurizio Salvia, Fiat’s chief engineer for A-segment battery-electric propulsion. He’s the man responsible for the battery drivetrain in <a>Fiat’s new 500</a> EV.</p>
<p>But then comes the crunch. Charge it with high current too many times in a fixed period and the system will step in and restrict the current flow to protect the battery… It’s going to be hard to be the worst-case customer with this car.</p>
<p>The EQA has no fast-charging protective software, but he asserts that “you would have to try very hard to destroy the battery through fast charging”. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the advice is charge slowly, buy a bigger battery than you think you need and use no more than 80 per cent of its capacity most of the time.</p>

<h1> The 10 best electric cars to buy, from the Audi e-tron GT to the Volkswagen ID.3 </h1>
<p> Ahead of a ban on fossil-fuelled cars by 2030, here’s the pick of the EVs you can buy now in terms of range, efficiency and desirability </p>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, Contributing Editor <time> 6 December 2021 • 9:48am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Government has announced that, by 2030, no purely petrol or diesel cars will be allowed to be sold brand new in the UK and that, by 2035, hybrids will be banned too.</p>
<a>electric models on sale</a> and available to us to replace the vast array of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars currently on offer.
<p>But if you can make the switch, <a>electric cars offer plenty of benefits</a>, even now. Not only are modern electric cars fast and quiet, but <a>they’re also cheap to run</a> and maintain and mechanically very simple. </p>
<a>work out whether range anxiety really will affect you</a>. Fancy it? If so, we reckon these are the best EVs on sale today. 
<p>NB: All prices quoted are ‘On The Road’ and do not take into account any Government incentives. Where quoted, range and energy consumption figures were obtained using the official WLTP Combined test cycle. </p>
