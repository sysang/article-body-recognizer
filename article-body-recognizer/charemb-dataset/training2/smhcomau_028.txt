<p>Families have been left confused by shifts in pandemic-related policies and unsure about what is required from them amid surging case numbers.</p>
<p>Empty supermarket shelves caused by predictable supply chain disruptions have stoked a perception that our political leaders – who say Australia must now live with the virus – underestimated the turmoil that mass illness would cause.</p>
<p>Only a third of respondents now think the Morrison government will be returned at the next election compared with almost half in June 2021.</p>
<p>The growing sense of pessimism, evident across every state and territory according to the survey, is not surprising considering the summer’s upheavals and uncertainties.</p>
<p>It’s a bad sign for an incumbent federal government on the cusp of an election campaign.</p>

<div>Support for Johnson plunges amid scandals, Christmas quiz allegation</div>
<div><div><h5>By Michael Holden</h5><div>Updated <span><time>December 13, 2021 — 12.25am</time></span><span>first published <time>December 12, 2021 — 2.21pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>London: Boris Johnson, engulfed by a string of scandals that have outraged the public, could face more ire over a report he personally breached COVID lockdown rules last year when he hosted a Christmas quiz.</p>
<p>Support for the British Prime Minister and his ruling Conservative Party has plummeted after a series of scandals, with a majority of voters thinking he should now resign, according to a poll published on Saturday.</p>
<p>The poll was taken before the Mirror reported that Johnson had hosted a Christmas quiz from his Downing Street residence on December 15 when London was under a “no mixing” order.</p>
<p>The most damaging has been reports that a party – or a series of parties – was held at Downing Street during a 2020 Christmas lockdown when such festivities were banned, with a video showing staff laughing and joking about one gathering.</p>
<p>“The findings of our latest poll are certainly dramatic, with a devastating fall in both support for the Conservatives and approval for the prime minister,” said Adam Drummond, Head of Political Polling at Opinium.</p>
<p>He cautioned that Johnson was the “king of comebacks” who had recovered from difficult polling situations before.</p>
<p>“However, unless the Conservatives can turn these numbers around quickly, backbenchers might start asking if the party is over for the prime minister,” he said.</p>
<p>Two polls on Wednesday showed more than half of respondents think Johnson should resign, while a third by YouGov on Friday gave Keir Starmer’s Labour Party a four-point lead – the Tories’ worst poll rating in 11 months.</p>

<h3><a>Boris Johnson claims Downing Street lockdown party he attended was a ‘work event’</a></h3>
<p>The first signs of a Tory rebellion appear to be emerging, with Boris Johnson under increasing fire after admitting he attended a Downing Street party during the lockdown.</p>
<div>Boris Johnson suffers shock defeat in Tory heartland as scandals bite</div>
<p>London: The British Conservative Party has suffered a massive shock defeat in one of its stronghold seats in a result that will increase internal party scrutiny of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s leadership.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats won the seat of North Shropshire with a 34 per cent swing in a by-election.</p>
<p>The seat, in its various constituencies, has been held by the Tories for nearly two centuries – it was first formed in 1832 – until Helen Morgan’s victory for the Liberal Democrats on Friday by a margin of 5925 votes.</p>
<p>She said the result was a clear message to Downing Street that “enough is enough” and that Johnson was “unfit to lead”.</p>
<p>“They have said loudly and clearly: Boris Johnson the party is over,” she said.</p>
<p>“Mr Johnson you are no leader ... too often it is all about you and never about us.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the vote was a “very disappointing result”.</p>
<p>“I’m responsible for everything the government does, so of course I take personal responsibility,” he said.</p>
<p>He rejected as “unfair” suggestions that his comments were effectively blaming the media coverage of recent scandals rocking his government for the result.</p>
<p>“I think my job is to get over what we’re doing more effectively and to show people as a result of the fastest vaccine rollout and the fastest booster rollout in Europe we’ve got more jobs,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to put my hand up and say have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks, has it been obscured by all this other stuff? Yes, I’m afraid it has.”</p>
<p>Morgan said the government had misled the country about a Christmas party held in Downing Street at the height of last year’s coronavirus lockdown and that the Tories could and would be defeated at the next general election.</p>
<p>The Conservatives’ candidate Neil Shastri-Hurst secured just 12,032 votes to Morgan’s 17,957.</p>
<p>Britain has a first-past-the-post electoral system and voting is not compulsory – turnout was 46.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Morgan praised Labour for tactically voting and supporting the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>“Together, we have shown that we can defeat the Conservatives, not with deals behind closed doors, but with common sense at the ballot box.”</p>
<p>Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrats leader, who has struggled to cut through said the result in North Shropshire would be replicated right across the country.</p>
<p>“Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them,” he said.</p>
<p>The seat was vacated by Owen Paterson in one of a series of scandals that have rocked Downing Street and led to a government collapse in the polling. Paterson resigned after breaching parliamentary lobbying rules.</p>
<div>Boris Johnson scolded but spared over ‘cash for curtains’ scandal</div>
<p>Efforts to reclaim the public’s confidence in cabinet ministers, Geidt said, had “been placed at risk by the evident failure to meet the very highest standards of disclosure expected in this present case.”</p>
<p>Opposition leaders seized on the letter as proof that Johnson had not been truthful and as evidence of a pattern of corrupt behaviour.</p>
<p>Geidt’s investigation grew out of news reports about Johnson’s lavish makeover of his quarters in Downing Street — a project overseen by his wife, Carrie Johnson, who recruited a high-end interior decorator, Lulu Lytle.</p>
<p>“As soon as Lulu calls,” Brownlow promised, “we can crack on.”</p>
<p>The disclosure of the text messages, which came in a separate investigation by Britain’s Electoral Commission, initially prompted speculation that an aggrieved Geidt might resign his post as Johnson’s in-house ethics adviser.</p>

<div>Boris Johnson’s staff invited to ‘BYO booze’ party during lockdown: report</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Johnson, who won a landslide victory in a 2019 election, has faced a barrage of criticism over alleged parties in government offices, including his own, in breach of COVID-19 rules.</p>
<p>Around 40 staff gathered in the garden for the drinks party, including Johnson and his wife Carrie, ITV said, even though at the time social mixing between households was limited to two people outdoors.</p>
<p>The allegations of officials holding events in breach of the government’s own lockdown rules, including a Christmas party, have dismayed voters who were told by the government to carefully stick to social distancing rules.</p>
<p>Johnson’s office declined to comment.</p>
<p>At the time, schools were shut to most pupils, and pubs and restaurants were closed, with strict controls on social mixing. Two people from different households were allowed to meet outdoors but only if they maintained a distance of 2 metres.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party accused Johnson of having “no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us”.</p>
<p>A senior government official, Sue Gray, is currently investigating allegations that at least five parties were held in government departments last year during COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p>Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings claimed last week that a drinks party had been held in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 despite warnings by him that it was against the rules.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister was asked earlier on Monday if he and Carrie Johnson had attended the event, he declined to answer, saying: “All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s Conservatives have lost their poll lead over the Labour Party and last month suffered an election defeat in a historic stronghold, stepping up pressure from his own MPs to reform his team of advisers.</p>
<p>Britain’s official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic rose above 150,000 on Saturday, the second highest in absolute terms in Europe, behind only Russia’s.</p>
<div>Boris Johnson claims Downing Street lockdown party he attended was a ‘work event’</div>
<div><div><h5>By Latika Bourke</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 13, 2022 — 5.01am</time></span><span>first published at <time>12.42am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Johnson had until Wednesday avoided answering whether he and his wife, Carrie, attended a party that was organised by Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary on May 20, 2020.</p>
<p>Reynolds had sent around 100 prime ministerial staff an email invite to the BYO booze party in the Prime Minister’s garden, saying it was an opportunity to make the most of the rare warm weather.</p>
<p>At the time, the rules forbade all social gatherings and only allowed two people to meet outdoors socially distanced.</p>
<p>Johnson told Prime Ministers Questions that he attended the gathering for 25 minutes to thank staff, but thought it was a “work event.”</p>
<p>“Number 10 is a big department with the garden as an extension of the office, which has been in constant use because of the role of fresh air in stopping the virus.</p>
<p>“And when I went into that garden just after six [o’clock] on the 20th of May, 2020 to thank groups of staff before going into my office 25 minutes later to continue working, l believed implicitly that this was a work event.</p>
<p>“With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside ... and I should have recognised that even if it could be said technically to fall within the guidance, there would be millions of people who would simply not see it that way.”</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Keir Starmer said the Prime Minister’s excuse was “so ridiculous” that it was “actually offensive” and called Johnson a man “with no shame.”</p>
<p>“Well that apology was pretty worthless, wasn’t it?” Starmer said. “Can’t the Prime Minister see that the British public thinks he’s lying through his teeth?</p>
<p>“The party’s over, Prime Minister; the only question is will the British public kick him out, will his party kick him out or will he do the decent thing and resign?”</p>
<p>It is the first time Starmer has called on the Prime Minister to resign and Johnson did not rule out the prospect.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Opposition would have the opportunity to question him again after the internal inquiry, headed by civil servant Sue Gray, was complete “very soon.”</p>
<p>He said he would “respond as appropriate” to that inquiry, prompting some MPs to privately speculate that Johnson could quit if the report found he was at fault.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he can continue as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister, asking people to follow the rules and guidance of his government, when I don’t believe he did,” said Ross.</p>
<p>Backbencher William Wragg agreed. “Frankly [we’re] worn out of defending what is invariably indefensible and that for their sakes at least the Prime Minister should see that and do the right thing,” he told the BBC.</p>
<p>“I think it is for the Conservative Party, if not the Prime Minister, in fact, to make that decision.”</p>
<p>Nursing an 80-seat majority, Conservative MPs have always believed that Johnson would take them to the next election, but this is now no longer a given.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak did not attend Prime Minister’s Questions, nor did any government ministers appear for morning media rounds as is custom.</p>
<div>The only way Boris Johnson can save himself may be beyond him</div>
<p>London: And so it begins. Three Conservative MPs have asked for Boris Johnson to quit.</p>
<p>Two years ago this would have been unthinkable. The British Prime Minister had just clinched an 80-seat majority. Coronavirus was still something occurring in China, and there was Brexit to get done.</p>
<p>In a way, the exact qualities that have made Johnson such a political dynamo now threaten to turn his star into a black hole.</p>
<p>His ability to play the fool, laugh, joke, evade, morph his political positions like an octopus changes colour have seen him enjoy a magical rise from London mayor to Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Boris doesn’t even need a surname. He’s on a first-name basis with the public who have either enjoyed or tolerated his stunts because he spoke to them and their patriotism with positivity.</p>
<p>On policy and guiding principles he has always been light. Like Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, this can be beneficial as it allows him to hold all manner of contradictory positions with ease and success.</p>
<p>And Boris has always gotten away with it – until now.</p>
<p>On COVID, he has been forced to give up reimposing restrictions by his mutinous backbenchers who threatened a rebellion of more than 100 MPs if he tried any new post-Christmas rules.</p>
<p>“He has no courage,” complains one.</p>
<p>Which means Johnson was already vulnerable when leaks about multiple Downing Street parties began surfacing in December.</p>
<p>The revelations have put Johnson under the most serious pressure of his premiership.</p>
<p>Laughably, Johnson tried to excuse his presence as “technically within the rules” because he thought it was a “work event”.</p>
<p>It’s classic Johnson. And it’s likely to be his undoing. So used to getting away with everything, he’s trying it on a public that would prefer to leave its lockdown and pandemic trauma behind it.</p>
<p>This could be politically fatal.</p>
<p>Successes like being one of the countries to provide the world with a lifesaving vaccine – the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot – which it then rolled out with incredible speed, have helped restore national pride.</p>
<p>And the Prime Minister’s responses have made it worse. He initially tried to avoid answering whether he attended, has repeatedly insisted the parties were never parties but work meetings, and given qualified apologies.</p>
<p>It’s the faux humility, sorry-not-sorry tactic. It’s clear he doesn’t think he has done anything wrong.</p>
<p>As Starmer puts it, the excuse is so laughable it’s “actually offensive”.</p>
<p>In coming weeks, civil servant Sue Gray will complete her inquiry into the Downing Street parties. If she blames the Prime Minister, he could resign.</p>
<p>But even if he doesn’t, it’s hard to see another path for Johnson. He would have a narrow window to get his act together, thanks to a charmless Opposition Leader in Starmer and weak internal rivals in the cabinet.</p>
<p>But he would need to clear out his team, which would require sacking staff, something he despises, imposing discipline in No.10 and making some tough decisions on domestic policy, to woo back his unhappy backbench.</p>
<p>Three publicly disgruntled backbenchers don’t equal an imminent leadership challenge. Fifty-four MPs would need to write a letter seeking a no-confidence vote and with no clear rival Johnson could still see that off.</p>
<p>But he is on notice and his MPs are fed up and no-one says with certainty any more, like they used to, that Boris Johnson will lead them to the next election.</p>

<div>MI5 outs Chinese spy whose son worked in Labour MP’s office</div>
<p>London: MI5 has used a bombshell memo to MPs to out a Chinese spy accused of using concealed political donations and the cultivation members of Parliament to conduct covert interference.</p>
<p>The warning was issued by the British spy agency in a Security Service Interference Alert that was distributed to MPs via the speakers of the Commons and the Lords on Thursday (London time).</p>
<p>The MI5 alert said that it had identified London lawyer Christine Lee as knowingly engaging in political interference activities on behalf of the United Work Front Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>The United Work Front Department specialises in trying to corrupt or coerce MPs and other influential, high-profile individuals into making comments supportive of the CCP or silencing any criticisms they might have of the communist regime.</p>
<p>The speakers of the Commons and Lords said the situation was considered serious.</p>
<p>“I should highlight the fact that Lee has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring Parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China,” they told MPs and Lords.</p>
<p>“This facilitation was done covertly to mask the origins of the payments. This is clearly unacceptable behaviour and steps are being taken to ensure it ceases.”</p>
<p>Lee founded an NGO called the British Chinese Project which claimed to be promoting “engagement, understanding and cooperation between the Chinese community and UK society.</p>
<p>The organisation conducted a first-of-its-kind Chinese Community and Policing Report studying the relationship between the British-Chinese community and the police.</p>
<p>Then Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019 honoured Lee with a Points of Light Award, which recognises community volunteers.</p>
<p>“I also wish you well with your work to further the inclusion and participation of British-Chinese people in the UK political system.”</p>
<p>The organisation’s website says it has closed down due to the “COVID situation.”</p>
<p>Gardiner said he had been “liaising” with British security services for years about Lee.</p>
<p>“I have been assured by the security services that whilst they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office,” Gardiner said.</p>
<p>He also said Lee’s son worked in his office as a diary manager, but resigned on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The security services have advised me that they have no intelligence that shows he was aware of, or complicit in, his mother’s illegal activity,” Gardiner said.</p>
<p>Alan Mendoza, from the hawkish think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said the revelation showed Britain had been too slow to recognise the threat Chinese interference posed.</p>
<p>“This revelation proves what many have been warning for years: that China is actively attempting to subvert British democracy,” he said.</p>
<p>“For too long Britain has been blind to the threat of Chinese interference and failed to act with the same haste as our friends in Australia.</p>
<p>“Now that China’s anti-democratic malevolence is known, there can be no return to business as usual with this regime. The time has come to view the CCP as they view us, a threat.”</p>
<p>British Home Secretary Priti Patel said she knew the news that Lee has targeted parliamentarians on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party would be “deeply concerning to many.”</p>
<p>But she noted that “where necessary, proportionate action is always taken to mitigate these threats.”</p>
<div>Two parties held in Downing Street as Queen and country mourned Prince Philip</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>On the evening of Friday, April 16, Britain was in a period of public mourning.</p>
<p>Union flags on government buildings across Westminster hung at half-mast to mark the passing of Prince Philip the previous week.</p>
<p>In a private chapel in Windsor Castle the Duke’s coffin lay overnight.</p>
<p>The next day the Queen, her face covered by a black mask, would say farewell to her husband of 73 years. With social distancing rules in force, she sat alone.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Downing Street that Friday evening, however, was quite different. Advisers and civil servants gathered after work for two events to mark the departure of two colleagues.</p>
<p>One was James Slack, Johnson’s director of communications. He had served two Tory prime ministers, a rare carry-over from the Theresa May days, but was leaving after four years to become deputy editor at The Sun.</p>
<p>The other was one of Johnson’s photographers.</p>
<p>The revelation of the boozy gatherings at the heart of the government the night before the Duke’s funeral is problematic, not just because of the context of public grief, but because of the COVID restrictions then in place.</p>
<p>The government’s own guidance read: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.”</p>
<p>Any defence is likely to centre on the idea that the gatherings were for work, not socialising – a claim being scrutinised by Sue Gray, the civil servant investigating claims about gatherings that allegedly broke lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, was not in Downing Street that day, a No.10 spokesman said. He had departed for Chequers, the Prime Minister’s country house, on Thursday evening and stayed there until Saturday.</p>
<p>According to those in Downing Street that evening, the gatherings were initially held in different parts of the complex and joined up later. A total of about 30 people attended them, according to one attendee.</p>
<p>Slack finished work for the last time in Downing Street and thanked those present in a farewell speech. Some had worked with him for years through a tumultuous period – not least on trying to deliver Brexit.</p>
<p>Some colleagues joined the celebration via video links, alcohol was consumed and eventually the group drifted into the Downing Street garden, according to sources.</p>
<p>Someone was sent to the Co-op in the Strand, a busy street nearby, with a suitcase that was filled with bottles of wine and brought back to Downing Street, according to someone present.</p>
<p>In the basement a laptop had been placed on a photocopier and music was blaring out.</p>
<p>As the evening wore on, the alcohol still flowing, those celebrating the photographer’s departure headed to the Downing Street garden at around midnight. One present said they feared too much wine was spilling on the carpet as they danced.</p>
<p>In the garden, the two groups marking the departure of Slack and the photographer are said to have merged.</p>
<p>In 2021 the country faced some form of restrictions for seven months, starting with a full lockdown in January and ending with a lifting of almost all COVID rules in July.</p>
<p>In a sign that some in Downing Street understood the importance of sticking to the rules, a senior figure present told The Telegraph they had cautioned against holding a leaving do for Slack. Their advice was not taken.</p>
<p>Hours after the drinking ended in No.10, the Queen and members of the Royal Family gathered in St George’s Chapel for the Duke’s funeral.</p>
<p>Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of COVID restrictions. The Prime Minister decided not to attend so that more family members could do so.</p>
<p>A photograph of Johnson dressed in black outside Chequers, arms by his side during a minute’s silence, was posted on his official Twitter account.</p>
<p>As the Duke’s coffin lowered into the vault at St George’s chapel, those present bowed their heads.</p>
<p>They were spread out across the pews, two metres apart.</p>
<div>Downing Street apologises to Buckingham Palace for parties held during mourning for Prince Philip</div>
<p>London: The office of Britain’s prime minister has apologised to the Queen for two parties held at Downing Street the night before she buried her husband Prince Philip and when the country was in mourning.</p>
<p>“It’s deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning,” Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>“We acknowledge the significant public anger.”</p>
<p>The parties, revealed by London’s Telegraph, continued into the early hours of the morning of the funeral and were so rowdy a swing belonging to the prime minister’s son Wilfred was broken.</p>
<p>A staff member was reportedly sent to the co-op supermarket on Strand with a suitcase to buy booze while another staffer DJed the tunes.</p>
<p>At the time, indoor mixing with people from other households was still banned, a point underlined by the arresting image of the Queen sitting alone at the funeral at Windsor Castle that day in accordance with coronavirus restrictions.</p>
<p>One of the parties was held for James Slack, a former lobby journalist who was working as Boris Johnson’s spokesman but departing for his new role as deputy editor at the Murdoch-owned tabloid The Sun. </p>
<p>Slack issued an apology through News UK.</p>
<p>“I wish to apologise unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused,” Slack said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.”</p>
<p>Boris Johnson did not attend the parties and left for his country residence Chequers the night before.</p>
<p>But the damaging relevations about the further parties held at a time of mourning will only add to the pressure on him amid more calls from MPs for him to vacate the leadership.</p>
<p>MPs are furious with the prime minister who originally denied there were parties held at Downing Street during lockdowns only to confirm this week that he attended one in his official garden but thought it was a “work event.”</p>
<p>A fifth MP, Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen, has called on Johnson to resign, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss considered the two big rivals positioning themselves for a takeover of the top job.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Keir Starmer said the prime minister had “degraded” the office.</p>
<p>“An apology isn’t the only thing the Prime Minister should be offering the palace today,” he said.</p>
<p>“Boris Johnson should resign.”</p>
<p>Johnson is awaiting the result of an internal inquiry by civil servant Sue Gray who is investigating the parties and whether they breached lockdown rules.</p>
<div>Boris Johnson’s former adviser says PM knew about lockdown party</div>

<p>An internal inquiry is being carried out to establish the facts.</p>
<p>Johnson last week apologised to Parliament for attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, but said he had thought it was a work event.</p>
<p>“Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened,” he said on his blog.</p>
<p>Last week ITV News published an email invitation from Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to a May 20, 2020 event, asking attendees to “bring your own booze”.</p>
<p>Cummings said that after Reynolds was told to cancel the invite by at least two people Reynolds checked with Johnson if it should go ahead.</p>
<p>“The PM agreed it should,” Cummings said in his blog.</p>
<p>Johnson’s spokesman denied on Monday that the Prime Minister had been made aware of the May 20 event.</p>
<p>“It’s untrue to say that the Prime Minister was told or warned ahead of that,” the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The internal inquiry into the allegations Johnson’s staff attended lockdown-flouting parties on government property is being led by Sue Gray, a senior but previously obscure civil servant.</p>
<p>Gray is due to report by the end of the month on claims government staff held late-night soirees, “bring your own booze” parties and “wine time Fridays” while Britain was under coronavirus restrictions in 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>The allegations have spawned public anger, incredulity and mockery, and prompted some in the governing Conservative Party to call for Johnson’s resignation.</p>
<p>Alex Thomas, a program director at the Institute for Government, said those expecting the report to “either clear the prime minister or damn him” would likely be disappointed.</p>
<p>“This is a huge political and wider public issue,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Gray report is an important part of finding out what happened. But in the end this is a judgment for Conservative cabinet ministers and MPs about whether they want Boris Johnson to lead their party and therefore lead the country.”</p>
<p>Gray is investigating close to a dozen alleged gatherings held between May 2020 and April 2021, most in the Prime Minister’s Downing Street office-cum-residence.</p>
<p>One party took place when people in Britain were banned from socialising or visiting sick relatives in hospitals. Another came on the eve of Prince Philip’s socially distanced funeral, at which the Queen was forced to sit alone in church.</p>
<p>Gray’s assignment is to uncover the facts about the gatherings and whether they broke any rules.</p>
<p>She has access to “all relevant records” and power to interview officials, including Johnson.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s office hasn’t confirmed whether Johnson has been quizzed by Gray, though Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Johnson had “submitted himself” to Gray’s investigation.</p>
<p>Gray can establish “whether individual disciplinary action is warranted” against officials, and London’s Metropolitan Police force says it could open an investigation if she finds evidence of law-breaking.</p>
<p>Crucially, though, Gray has limited room to censure Johnson himself.</p>
<p>Usually, civil service inquiries make recommendations to the Prime Minister. In this case it’s the Prime Minister who is being investigated, making Johnson the arbiter of his own punishment.</p>
<p>The inquiry is an unusually high-profile assignment for a woman used to exerting power behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Gray has served both Labour and Conservative governments over several decades, according to a brief biography on the government website, with a gap in the 1980s when she ran a pub in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Thomas, who knows Gray, said she wouldn’t be enjoying the spotlight.</p>
<p>“You don’t generally join the civil service to become a household name,” he said. “That said, she is a resilient person.”</p>

<div>Race-by-race preview and tips for Wednesday meeting at Newcastle</div>
<p>Selections based on a good to soft track.</p>
<h3>Race 1 - 2:20PM: CHARLESTOWN SQUARE PROV CTRY 23YO MAIDEN (900 METRES)</h3>
<p>5. November Rhythm was well in the market on debut at Canberra and hit the lead after a wide run before being reeled in late and missing a place. Fitter for that, drawn ideally and showed ability on soft ground in trials. Sure to go close.</p>
<p>Blinkers on, wide draw some concern but worth including in the chances. 3. Meerut could be a big improver on his only start at Muswellbrook. He drew wide and stayed wide before weakening. Better gate this time and may lift.</p>
<p>How to play it: November Rhythm WIN; Trifecta 5/1,3,4/1,3,4.</p>
<h3>Race 2 - 2:55PM: OAS TECHNOLOGY 4YO UP MAIDEN PLATE (1250 METRES)</h3>
<p>Dangers: 9. Smart Sophia is a late starter but she hit the line well on debut at Port Macquarie and might appreciate the extra ground. Was a bit wayward in the straight so open to some improvement. 5. Rapid Reload is another coming off a long break.</p>
<p>How to play it: Adulting WIN; Trifecta 7/3,5,9/3,5,9;</p>
<h3>Race 3 - 3:30PM: REWARD HOSPITALITY FM MAIDEN HANDICAP (1400 METRES)</h3>
<p>5. Jawaani is a nicely bred filly whose two recent trials suggest she’s ready to run a big race on debut. She’s been given plenty of time but like that she’s kicking off at 1400m from a soft gate, so she will get every chance.</p>
<p>Dangers: 1. Blue Jager is likely a big improver on what she showed first-up at Gosford where she drew wide and had no luck but was only beaten a couple of lengths. Plenty of ticks here with the extra trip, a better gate and added fitness.</p>
<p>How to play it: Jawaani WIN; Trifecta 5/1,2,12/1,2,12</p>
<h3>Race 4 - 4:05PM: NHN GROUP CGE MAIDEN HANDICAP (1400 METRES)</h3>
<p>9. The Replicant did enough on debut at Warwick Farm to say he has some ability and is looking for a bit more ground. Specked at big odds, he found the line late to be beaten four lengths at 1200m. Less depth here, he can run well.</p>
<p>1. Celtic Harp comes through the same race as The Replicant, finishing one place ahead of him. Has been largely disappointing so far but chance to improve up in distance.</p>
<p>How to play it: The Replicant E/W</p>
<h3>Race 5 - 4:40PM: NEWMARKET DAY 4 MAR CONDITIONAL BM68 HANDICAP (1300 METRES)</h3>
<p>How to play it: Capri Lane E/W</p>
<h3>Race 6 - 5:15PM: NZB 2022 KARAKA ONLINE CATALOGUE BM64 HANDICAP (1500 METRES)</h3>
<p>6. Just Tozza is threatening to win a race and might have a good chance to here. Nice run fresh at Randwick then again made good ground at Warwick Farm two weeks ago. A bit of speed on would help his cause but sure to be competitive.</p>
<p>How to play it: Just Tozza E/W</p>
<h3>Race 7 - 5:50PM: TAB LONG MAY WE PLAY BENCHMARK 64 HANDICAP (1500 METRES)</h3>
<p>1. Carlisle Bay was far from disgraced in a much stronger race at Kensington third-up off an easy all the way Scone win. Handles all ground, should push forward onto the speed and that would make him hard to run down.</p>
<p>How to play it: Carlisle Bay WIN; Trifecta 1/ 3,7,8/3,7,8</p>

<p>A talented three-year-old filly who burst onto the scene more than a year ago in Victoria can re-boot her career at Tuesday’s feature Wyong meeting.</p>
<p>On competitive Trainers’ Recognition day, Godolphin-based Telluride is primed to strike third-up in only her second prep in a strong Benchmark 64 Hcp for the girls over 1100m.</p>
<p>A power-finishing daughter of prolific US sire Medaglia d’Oro, Telluride hit the headlines instantly this time last year rushing home to just miss on debut at Flemington before a flashing second start win at The Valley.</p>
<p>But she only had one more run that initial prep - failing in a Group 2 Blue Diamond Prelude - before being sent to the paddock.</p>
<p>Telluride was brought back to NSW and given plenty of time to mature and overcome a few physical setbacks before tackling two steady trials in November.</p>
<p>She then resumed with a tidy finishing effort in a deeper metropolitan race before charging home at Gosford to beat all bar the winner three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Again drawn to sit well off the speed and away from the fence over 100m further, Telluride will again be asked to show her finishing quality.</p>
<p>Improving mare Stormborn who also closed strongly in the same Gosford race, unbeaten filly Riva Del Sol and progressive first-up winner Mabel can all command market support.</p>
<p>Riva Del Sol is stepping into provincial company for the first time.</p>
<p>Earlier in the seven-race card, promising three-year-old colt Rejoiced is out to climb another rung on his brief career ladder.</p>
<p>The progressive son of late great Redoute’s Choice is shooting for a third win from only four starts in a Benchmark 64 Hcp for the boys over 1350m, although has also accepted to run at the Newcastle meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>After two narrow but impressive wins at the provincials to kick off his career, Rejoiced hit the skids last start in a similar mile race Gosford three weeks back when he folded up after leading on a Soft 7.</p>
<p>It was reported he lost an off-fore plate in running, but the apprentice who rode felt Rejoiced didn’t run out the trip.</p>
<p>Trainer Annabel Neasham has responded bringing him back abruptly in distance, and top metropolitan hoop Tommy Berry takes over in the saddle, having ridden the colt in his opening two trials last year.</p>

<div>‘I want them to feel the wrath of the viewers’: SBS out of touch, says axed commentator McEwen</div>
<p>SBS is facing a fierce backlash over its decision to dump former Australian cycling champion and broadcaster Robbie McEwen from its coverage.</p>
<p>McEwen won 12 stages of the Tour de France during his racing career and since his retirement in 2012 has become a popular caller and studio analyst.</p>
<p>The three-time green jersey champion on Sunday announced just hours after commentating from the Australian national road championships that he’d been cut from the network.</p>
<p>McEwen said he was not provided with a valid reason for being dropped.</p>
<p>Criterium du Dauphine champion Richie Porte, who in 2020 became only the second Australian to stand on the podium at the Tour de France, finishing third, led a groundswell of international support for McEwen.</p>
<p>“Yes he’s a mate but @robbiemcewen is one of the best in the commentary game and one of the all time cycling greats. #themindboggles,” Porte wrote.</p>
<p>McEwen responded to Porte saying: “At least I got to commentate on what I reckon has been your finest moment #TdFpodium.”</p>
<p>SBS viewers were equally dismayed, with some declaring they’d switch to watching cycling streaming service GCN.</p>
<p>“Robbie’s was the only insight I was interested in hearing, especially when there was a sprint finish. Sorry @sbs_australia time to pay for @globalcyclingnetwork,” one said.</p>
<p>SBS said in a statement issued after McEwen’s announcement: “Robbie has been a valued member of our cycling commentary line-up for a number of events over the last six years, but we’re exploring a different approach in 2022.</p>
<p>“While his contract has come to an end, we thank Robbie for all that he’s brought to the role during his time with us.”</p>
<p>One source with knowledge of the situation believed budget was the issue but McEwen, speaking to The Age on Tuesday, said that didn’t add up.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect SBS to tell the real story behind the change, and they’ll just weather the storm on social media and wait for it to blow over.”</p>
<p>It is not the first time SBS has made a contentious change to its cycling broadcast team, which has become a revolving door of both pundits and reporters in recent years, with its Tour de France line-up regularly altering.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be reinstated to work with those who made this decision, but I want them to feel the wrath of the people they are letting down – the viewers, who are also the taxpayers who fund SBS.”</p>
<p>McEwen said the reaction to his shock departure showed the executive management at SBS Sport was out of touch.</p>
<p>“The viewers, who SBS claim are the most important people when it comes to the broadcast, are unanimous. The executive is/are out of touch with the audience and have read the room completely wrong,” McEwen told The Age.</p>
<p>A source said former cyclist turned pundit Bridie O’Donnell was expected to increase her role in McEwen’s absence.</p>
<p>O’Donnell, since joining McEwen and Matthew Keenan in the commentary box, has called major international and domestic events including this year’s national road championships.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old on Monday referred to public backlash she has apparently copped since the news of McEwen’s axing went viral.</p>
<p>McEwen on social media separated his former broadcast colleagues from SBS sports management.</p>
<p>McEwen will form part of the Seven Network’s commentary team at the upcoming Santos Festival of Cycling in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Sophie Smith has previously worked as part of the SBS cycling broadcast team, including at the Tour de France.</p>

<div>Crowds flock to see Barty at practice session</div>
<p>The whisper got around Melbourne Park just after 2pm on Tuesday that something special was in the offing for Australian fans on the outside courts.</p>
<p>Sam Stosur had kept her career alive just minutes before. Maddison Inglis was in the midst of the finest moment of hers. Both Australian women delighted the crowd with great wins.</p>
<p>But the icing on the cake of those fine performances was that world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty was training on a back court. It proved a prized hour for ticket holders with a ground pass.</p>
<p>The Queenslander booked a midday training slot mindful that she would be facing Italian qualifier Lucia Bronzetti in an afternoon match on Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is shaping as a special day at Melbourne Park, and not just for the tennis to be played, with the Australian Open also celebrating its First Nations Day.</p>
<p>Barty touched on the importance of her Indigenous culture after a dazzling 6-0 6-1 triumph over Lesia Tsurenko on Monday and will be aiming to crown the party with another win.</p>
<p>“I’m a proud Ngarigo woman, a very, very proud Indigenous woman,” she said.</p>
<p>“I love my heritage. I love to celebrate my heritage. It’s what connects me to all of you here today. It is what connects me to the land.”</p>
<p>Just as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal always draw large attendances to their training sessions, the crowd surged towards Court 10 to watch Barty’s work on her game.</p>
<p>Almost all were masked, though the sheer number of fans meant social distancing was impossible as they craned their necks to get a glimpse of the Wimbledon champion.</p>
<p>Those behind the stands had their phones held high in a bid to capture footage of the 25-year-old as she went through a regulation training regime.</p>
<p>About 10 fans were watching a match between Liudmila Samsanova and Emina Bektas on an adjoining court. The crowd gathered to watch Barty was about 20 times as large.</p>
<p>At one stage, Barty started swiping through the phone of her coach Craig Tyzzer while taking a quick breather, but it is doubtful she was checking her social media accounts.</p>
<p>The use of technology for coaching is commonplace and became even more regular during the pandemic.</p>
<p>During pre-seasons, the Roland Garros champion will assess footage on an iPad to check the progress of a slight technical adjustment.</p>
<p>Inglis, who upset US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez to claim her first win at a grand slam, said fans and players alike were lucky to have examples like Barty and Stosur to aspire to.</p>
<p>“Sam and Ash are both amazing people and amazing role models. We’re pretty lucky to have those girls as people to look up, as Aussie tennis players,” she said.</p>
<p>“Those girls, they always have time for a chat. Ash in the locker-room, she’s always, ‘Good luck, Madds.’ She’s so supportive, which is so lovely, I think. They’re really great girls.”</p>

<div>Showman Kyrgios provides style, substance</div>
<p>Nick Kyrgios broke serve in his first game. He pointed to the court and pointed to his ear and pointed to the stands. He turned his palms up to the crowd and pointed to his ear again. What more do you want? Again to his ear. I can’t hear you.</p>
<p>Kyrgios matches are sport as immersive theatre.</p>
<p>From the opening burst onto court, he was determined to showcase everything in his game. A straight-sets win 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 over Liam Broady only hints at the performance.</p>
<p>“I served f---ing well today,” Kyrgios said, working a little blue for the blushing live and TV audience. Though it was after 9pm.</p>
<p>“I think from the get-go, I know I’ve got the crowd in the palm of my hand and any time I can use that to, you know, spark a moment or spark some energy.”</p>
<p>That was just the opening two games. The full box-office package condensed into just two games.</p>
<p>To get out there at all was remarkable, which made his performance so much the better.</p>
<p>In the second set Kyrgios began where he left off. In one point alone he began with a behind-the-back serve, returned with a ‘tweener’ (between his legs) then a curling, down-the-line winner. Tennis as performative art.</p>
<p>Broady teased on serve at some innovation of his own, laughing as a call came from the crowd for his own underarm and he cut Kyrgios a glance to be ready for it in good-humoured mocking.</p>
<p>Kyrgios indulged the crowd with a little Ronaldo celebration of his own on court after the win.</p>
<p>On this night, the Australian did what he needed to do to win, and did what he needed to do to entertain.</p>

<div>Sledged and made to look silly. Playing Kyrgios is ‘awful’</div>
<p>Playing Kyrgios on his favourite court in front of his fans is unlike any other tennis experience, according to Liam Broady.</p>
<p>Kyrgios’ vanquished first round opponent had one word to describe playing him on John Cain arena. Awful.</p>
<p>While fans were definitely crying out the Ronaldo chant of “siu” and not boo for much of the match, Broady also said he was booed when he stepped on court and was sledged during a raucous match.</p>
<p>Full of praise for Kyrgios and his game, Broady said nothing had truly prepared him for Kyrgios’ serve or the crowd experience.</p>
<p>“I mean (it was a) good experience and I think that’s the good thing about playing the great players is that you can always learn very quickly about what you need to work on.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere was incredible, but it was, it’s the first time I’ve ever walked onto a tennis court and been booed, which for me was a crazy experience.</p>
<p>“I think that’s very rare, especially in the sport of tennis. Now people don’t really interact with the crowd like he does and that’s one of his biggest strengths.</p>
<p>“But like I said, I’m glad to have played the match and to have got the experience, and for a Brit to go and play on John Cain against Kyrgios is probably one of the tougher atmospheres in tennis to play. ”</p>
<p>Little of the sledging from the stands was suitable to be repeated, Broady laughed.</p>
