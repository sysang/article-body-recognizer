<h1> How an Oscar-winning documentary-maker helped create the Elizabeth Holmes myth </h1>
<p> Errol Morris’s work rejects the idea that a documentary can tell the objective truth. But how did he wind up advertising Holmes’s lies? </p>
<div> <div> By Susannah Goldsbrough <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:39pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes looks straight at the camera. She’s sitting in front of a plain white wall, loose blonde hair swept over a signature Jobs-style black turtleneck, wide-eyed and smiley. </p>
<p>“Can you tell us a secret?” asks a friendly voice off-screen. For a moment, she seems stumped, gaze drifting downwards, nodding her head over and over again. </p>
<p>“I don’t have many secrets” comes the eventual reply. </p>
<a>The Inventor</a>, which chronicles the rise and plummet of disgraced Silicon Valley wunderkind Holmes. The 37-year-old disgraced has now been
<a>convicted of defrauding investors out of $900m,</a> after the revolutionary blood-testing technology she developed failed to live up to her lofty claims.
<p>Except when it comes to his adverts.</p>
<p>“This same little thing can do exactly what the other vials did?” one awed participant asks.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Morris replies.</p>
<p>So how did the father of modern documentary-making, known for his uncanny ability to capture the slippery nature of truth, end up peddling Holmes’s lies? </p>
<p>Speaking to the New Yorker in 2019, Morris explained that he did not “vet” Theranos before accepting the work:</p>

<header> <h1> Why the Queen needs her confidantes more than ever </h1> <p> The death of Lady Farnham is the latest blow in another difficult year for Her Majesty, but her ladies-in-waiting can help weather the storm </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Camilla Tominey, Associate Editor <time> 3 January 2022 • 11:36pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Yet there is a distinct disadvantage to longevity; as the Queen, like her husband before her, has found, living well into your nineties means saying goodbye to many loyal and long-standing friends.</p>
<a>Prince Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</a> made 2021 another year the Queen will hardly look back on with “undiluted pleasure”.
<p>The death of Lady Farnham on December 29, at the age of 90, came mere weeks after the passing of another close confidante, the Duchess of Grafton. </p>
<a>until her death, on December 3, at the age of 101</a>. Having first become Lady of the Bedchamber in 1953, shortly after the Coronation, she had been a palace presence throughout the Queen’s nearly 70-year reign.
<p>As one royal insider put it: “We are all so sad for the Queen. It has not been a good year for HM at all, losing her husband and then two of her ladies-in-waiting in less than a month.</p>
<p>“It feels like the end of an era now they are both gone. But, as the Duke used to say, the trouble with growing old is that you outlive a lot of the people you care about.”</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, because of their close proximity to their ‘employer’ some of them became friends, especially those who had served for decades.”</p>
<p>The Duchess of Grafton’s role as Mistress of the Robes remains vacant following her death – and it seems unlikely that Lady Farnham will be replaced with the Queen turning 96 in April.</p>
<p>Yet with the Platinum Jubilee approaching in June – not to mention the ongoing fallout from the Epstein saga and Prince Harry’s autobiography due in the autumn – the Queen is going to need all the support she can get.</p>
<p>But Her Majesty will also increasingly rely on her remaining ladies-in-waiting – as well as the loyal and longstanding servants that formed part of “HMS Bubble” during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another lady-in-waiting who will play a key role over the coming year is Dame Mary Morrison, 85, who has been Woman of the Bedchamber since 1960, the year of Prince Andrew’s birth.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Queen also appointed Lady Elizabeth Leeming, her first cousin once removed, to become a trusted companion. </p>
<p>Other ladies-in-waiting include Richenda Elton, The Lady Elton, 84, and The Hon Mrs Whitehead, Annabel Whitehead, 78, previously a lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.</p>
<p>Similarly, one of the Queen Mother’s former ladies-in-waiting, Jennifer Gordon Lennox and Philippa de Pass, are also on the “rota” to support the Queen in her official duties.</p>
<p>As she comes to mark her 70th year on the throne, having bade farewell to a number of her nearest and dearest, it seems the Queen’s remaining “court” has never played a more crucial role.</p>

<header> <h1> Leaving London? The best commuter villages to buy a home in for less than £500k </h1> <p> Escapees from the capital with bigger budgets can make the most of the stamp duty holiday before the end of June </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 5 April 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The <a>rise of working from home</a> means buyers are less tied to proximity to train stations, and are looking farther out of London, away from the traditional commuter hubs.</p>
<p>Savills estate agents has analysed property prices in village parishes within 10km of all stations within<a> less than a 45-minute train journey </a>of the capital. </p>
<a>looked at where you can move with £300,000</a>. Now, here's where you can buy with a larger budget of £500,000 – the price bracket where you will benefit from the highest
<a>stamp duty savings</a> in proportion to your house price, if you complete by June 30.
<p>With this budget, many villages open up, so we have only included villages with top primary schools.</p>
<p>Now Cranleigh is having a commuter renaissance. Ian Camplin, of Savills, said: “More people are moving further out and planning to do a longer commute but only for two or three days a week. The change is seismic.”</p>
<p>A little north, closer to Crawley, commuters can purchase in Turners Hill for £496,789 and catch the 30-minute train from Gatwick Airport to Victoria.</p>
<p>The share of Surrey movers has jumped from 5pc to 20pc of local buyers, said Mr Whittome. Prices for the most sought-after homes are up 10pc in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Further east, in Kent, buyers can purchase in Ryarsh for £463,943 and commute via Snodland station’s 43-minute train link.</p>
<p>To the north of the capital, Bishops Stortford station provides commuters in Manuden, across the county border in Essex, with a 38-minute link to London Liverpool Street. Homes here cost £460,788.</p>
<p>Paddy Pritchard-Gordon, of Knight Frank estate agents, said that values in the surrounding countryside are up 3pc year-on-year as London's commuters move further away, seeking more space and gardens.</p>
<p>The property market here is centred around the village of Wooburn Green – which historically was based around a working mill. Here, schools are key to driving house prices.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Buckinghamshire, the parish of Thornborough has a 41-minute commute from Milton Keynes station while the village of Haddenham also had a 41-minute link from its own station. Respective house prices are £454,965 and £463,872.</p>
<header> <h1> One landlord's ultimate buy-to-let savings plan for an early retirement </h1> <p> Interest-only mortgages on rental properties are the key to financial freedom, according to super saver David Scothern </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 5 January 2022 • 3:45pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The privilege of choosing whether to work or not is a luxury usually reserved for the ultra rich but some British super savers are determined to join the club. </p>
<p>Mortgage adviser David Scothern, 38, from Sheffield, has devised a thorough four-year savings plan that will allow him to retire at the end of 2023 and free himself from his “repetitive” work. </p>
<p>Mr Scothern has calculated that he can live comfortably on £18,000 a year and plans to generate this through a portfolio of buy-to-let properties and investments in the stock market.</p>
<p>He estimated he would have just over £1m in assets by the time he retires at 40. “It will depend on the stock market and property values but it’s achievable,” he said. </p>
<p>His<a> savings journey</a> has been carefully tracked in weekly blog posts, called Mortgage Advisor on Fire, that started in November 2019 when he first set out his goals of financial freedom. </p>
<p>These all generate a yearly income of £3,475 but he hopes to double that next year when he purchases two more buy-to-lets and his shares in British banks pay out dividends. </p>
<p>In a typical month Mr Scothern sets aside £1,000, about half of his net salary. “We live very comfortably, we don’t have to consciously scrimp on our shopping.”</p>
<p>The 38-year-old has secured a cheap mortgage rate with virtually no interest, he said, thanks to his job as an adviser. </p>
<p>All properties purchased will be with interest-only mortgages, which means none of the value of the house is paid off, he added. </p>
<p>"It was a chance discussion with a friend and coworker that turned my groping around in the dark into a laser-like focus. He recommended the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and it changed my life.”</p>
<header> <h1> Does the billing address actually matter for online shopping? </h1> <p> Retailers can decide how rigorous to make their authentication </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 2 December 2021 • 2:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Multiple lockdowns saw many shoppers turn to online retail while high streets were closed last year. If you're new to shopping online, you may have some queries about your financial security.</p>
<p>To keep you confident while browsing online this Black Friday or <a>Christmas shopping</a> season, we've answered readers' top questions about keeping your details safe.</p>
<h2>Does the billing address actually matter for online payments?</h2>
<p>Q: I regularly buy items online, and have just realised that for the past few months I have been putting in the wrong billing address for my debit card. Despite this, not one of my payments has been challenged. </p>
<p>I thought the billing address was part of verifying my identity, but does it actually matter what address I put in? </p>
<p>Shopping online is easy, but in the age of convenience many individuals are increasingly concerned about their financial security.</p>
<p>You might presume that, if you lost your debit or credit card, without your billing address it would be useless for online shopping.</p>
<p>However, this does not appear to be the case, and in reality it is left up to retailers to decide on the level of verification to enforce.</p>
<p>The risk of fraud is not a retailer’s only concern. They balance the risk of losses from fraud with the cost of lost sales if their verification services put people off making a purchase.</p>
<p>Some will place a higher level of priority on identity verification than others. This may vary depending on the cost of the item in question, device being used to make the purchase, and the customer’s history on the website.</p>
<p>There are also differing levels of address checking <a>verification retailers can use</a>, depending on how much they want to spend.</p>
<p>Who the liability lies with if something goes wrong can also affect how rigorously details are checked.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no hard and fast rule: it depends on the retailer, the payment method, the transaction size and more.</p>

<h2> <a> New guidelines for chronic fatigue treatment are a fudge </a> </h2>
<p> ME activists are delighted that ‘graded exercise therapy’ has been rejected, but I fear patients will be forced to live with their symptoms </p>
<h2> <a> Stalling on vaccinating children was a misstep </a> </h2>
<p> The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has taken a cautious line, to the detriment of our young </p>

<p> People want to move forward their second dose in order to go away on holiday. After the year we've had, who can blame them? </p>

<p> Anti-vaxx arguments are exasperating, but the Government’s proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for care workers equally miss the point </p>

<header> <h1> Best strimmers for a neat and tidy garden </h1> <p> If you want to keep the edges of your lawn in good shape then a strimmer is just the thing. So, which one to buy? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 22 February 2021 • 9:57am </time> </div> </div>
<a>lawnmower</a> can handle, the strimmer can take down that long grass and then you can go over it with the mower afterwards,” explains James Broadhouse, a professional landscaper and influencer known by his moniker,
<p>If you’ve got something a bit tougher than grass, like a big bramble patch, a strimmer might also be helpful for doing a job the lawn mower can’t manage. </p>
<h4>Best cordless strimmers</h4>
<h3><b>1. Stihl Cordless Line Trimmer FSA 45 </b></h3>
<p><b>What we like about it: </b>A solid all-rounder that should suit most standard gardens</p>
<p>A really solid all-rounder, well suited to most normal sized gardens, the FSA 45 balances price with functionality. </p>
<p>However, arguably the key point to make about the FSA 45 is that it’s incredibly light for a trimmer of this size. At just 2.3kg it should suit most most gardeners, even when using for extended periods.</p>
<h3><b>2. Greenworks 24V Cordless Line Trimmer</b></h3>
<p><b>What we like about it: </b>It offers a huge amount of functionality for the price</p>
<p><a>£79.99, Dobbies</a></p>
<a>hedge trimmer</a> or mower which uses the same battery saving you having to recharge three different batteries. 
<h3><b>3. Webb 250w Classic Electric Grass Trimmer </b></h3>
<p><b>What we like about it: </b>The price</p>
<p><a>£26.99, YouGarden</a></p>
<p>Still, for smaller gardens which require less specialised equipment it’ll do the job and given that it costs less than half of the next most expensive one, it’s a bargain in anyone’s book. </p>
<h3><b>4. Bosch UniversalGrassCut</b></h3>
<p><a>£124.99, Currys</a></p>
<p>“Bosch is really reliable as home-owner stuff goes,” says Broadhouse. “They kind of copy what the really high-end stuff does just with a smaller 18V battery.” </p>
<h3><b>5. Webb 43cc Cow Horn Handle Brushcutter</b></h3>
<p><a>£189.99, Dobbies</a></p>
<p>So far on this list we’ve really only covered the trimmers designed for your garden lawn and doing the edges. But what about if you have a long driveway, or you need to tackle a really rather large and rather overgrown field? </p>
<p>The trade-off, though, is that you get a lot more power so weeds like thick brambles don’t stand a chance. They’ll also cover more ground so you won’t have to keep recharging if you have a big garden. </p>
<p>It won’t be for everyone, but for those who need a bit more power, this is a great place to start.</p>
<h3><b>Frequently asked questions about garden strimmers</b></h3>
<h3><b>Are strimmers with plastic blades any good?</b></h3>
<h3><b>What should I look for when buying grass trimmers?</b></h3>
<h3><b>How do you stop a strimmer line from breaking?</b></h3>
<h3><b>Is a straight or curved shaft trimmer better?</b></h3>
<p>In short, it depends what you’re going to do with it, says Broadhouse. “Curved shafts will be more light-weight and compact which makes them good for intricate work around flower beds etc.</p>
