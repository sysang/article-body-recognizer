<div><div><h1>Timeline of events surrounding Texas’ ban on most abortions</h1></div><div>By PAUL J. WEBERDecember 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Since early September, Texas has banned most abortions under a new law that has created the biggest curb to abortion in the U.S. in nearly 50 years.</p>
<p>Texas clinics have spent months asking courts to halt the the law, known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected. That is usually around six weeks, which is before some women even know they are pregnant. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a>on Friday again allowed the law to remain in a place</a> in a ruling that allows abortion clinics to continue their legal fight. In the meantime, most abortions in Texas are still banned. </p>
<p>Here is a timeline of key events so far:</p>
<a>signs the law</a> in a ceremony at the Texas Capitol that is closed to the press and public. The law is solely enforced by private citizens, who are entitled to $10,000 in damages if they successfully sue abortion providers.
<p>JULY 13: Texas abortion clinics sue in federal court in Austin.</p>
<p>AUG. 25: U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, an appointee of President Barack Obama, denies Texas’ efforts to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>
<p>AUG. 27: The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals orders a halt on the lawsuit in Austin, eventually leading abortion clinics to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene.</p>
<p>SEPT. 1: The law takes effect. Late that night, Supreme Court <a>issues a 5-4 decision</a> allowing the law to remain in place, without ruling on its constitutionality. Texas abortion clinics say they will abide by the restrictions. </p>
<a>to “eliminate all rapists from the streets,”</a> drawing swift criticism. He also
<a>falsely asserts</a> that women have “at least six weeks” under the law to get an abortion.
<p>SEPT. 9: The Justice Department <a>sues Texas</a>, saying the law was enacted in “open defiance of the Constitution.” </p>
<a>“exactly what we feared.”</a> Out-of-state clinics say appointments are quickly filling as the majority of their patients now come from Texas.
<p>OCT. 6: Pitman <a>issues an order suspending the law</a>. Some Texas clinics quickly resume abortions for patients beyond six weeks, but many physicians still won’t, fearing lawsuits.</p>
<p>OCT. 8: The 5th Circuit <a>reinstates the law.</a> Texas clinics <a>cancel appointments</a> booked over the previous 48 hours. </p>
<p>OCT. 15: The Justice Department says it will take case to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>NOV. 1: The Supreme Court <a>hears oral arguments</a> for the first time. </p>
<p>DEC. 9: A Texas judge rules that the enforcement scheme that critics call a “bounty” <a> is unconstitutional</a>. The narrow ruling still leaves the law in place.</p>
<p>DEC. 10: The Supreme Court again allows the law to stand for now, but lets clinics continue efforts trying to overturn it. The court dismisses the Justice Department’s separate challenge. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday left in place Texas’ ban on most abortions, offering only a glimmer of daylight for clinics in the state to challenge the nation’s most restrictive abortion law.</p>
<p>The decision, little more than a week after the court signaled it would roll back abortion rights and possibly overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, was greeted with dismay by abortion rights supporters but praise by opponents.</p>
<p>Five conservative justices, including three appointed by former President Donald Trump, formed a majority to limit who can be sued by the clinics, a result that both sides said probably will prevent federal courts from effectively blocking the law.</p>
<p>The court acted more than a month after hearing arguments over the law, which makes no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>
<p>The law has been in place for about three months, since Sept. 1. The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide has stood since 1973.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden voiced concern over the high court decision to keep the Texas law in effect and restated his support for legislation that has cleared the House of Representatives and would codify in federal law the abortion right now at risk.</p>
<p>“We have more work to do, but I will always stand with women to protect and defend their long-recognized, constitutional right under Roe v. Wade,” Biden said in a statement.</p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has consistently voted against abortion rights, did not mention Roe in his main opinion for the court Friday. Gorsuch is one of the Trump appointees, along with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>In any case, it all could return to the justices, and so far there have not been five votes on the nine-member court to put the law on hold while the legal fight plays out.</p>
<p>“The Court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before S. B. 8 first went into effect. It failed to do so then, and it fails again today,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a separate opinion Friday. </p>
<p>The court’s conservative majority also seems likely to roll back abortion rights in a Mississippi case that was argued last week, although that decision is not expected until spring.</p>
<p>If Roe is overruled, the fight over the Texas law would be largely beside the point because Texas is one of 12 states with a trigger law that would ban abortion in a post-Roe world.</p>
<p>Friday’s high court ruling came a day after a state court judge in Texas r <a>uled that the law’s enforcement, which rewards lawsuits against violators by awarding judgments of $10,000, is unconstitutional</a> yet left the law in place.</p>
<p>Critics of the decision also said it would encourage other states to adopt copycat laws on abortion and allow for attacks on other constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberal justices dissented from that part of the decision in an opinion that said the purpose of the Texas law was “to nullify this court’s rulings” on abortion.</p>
<p>The same four justices were in dissent in September when the court declined to block the law once before.</p>
<p>“The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter; it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake,” Roberts wrote. </p>
<p>Roberts called on U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, whose earlier order blocking the law was overturned by the appeals court, to “enter appropriate relief without delay.”</p>
<p>Since it took effect in September, the law has imposed t <a>he most restrictive abortion curbs in the nation since the Supreme Court first declared a woman’s right to an abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision</a>.</p>
<p>Some residents who left the state seeking abortions have had to travel well beyond neighboring states, where clinics cannot keep up with the increase in patients from Texas, according to a separate study by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<p>Following the court’s September vote, the Justice Department filed its own lawsuit over the Texas law. The justices on Friday dismissed that suit, which raised a separate set of thorny legal issues.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court refused Monday to halt a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers in New York that does not offer an exemption for religious reasons.</p>
<p>The court acted on emergency appeals filed by doctors, nurses and other medical workers who say they are being forced to choose between their jobs and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>As is typical in such appeals, the court did not explain its order, although it has similarly refused to get in the way of vaccine mandates elsewhere. </p>
<p>New York is one of just three states, along with Maine and Rhode Island, that do not accommodate health care workers who object to the vaccine on religious grounds.</p>
<p>The court had previously turned away health care workers in Maine, who filed a similar challenge, with the same three justices in dissent.</p>
<p>In his dissent, Gorsuch drew a link between the health care workers and the World War II-era Jehovah’s Witnesses schoolchildren who refused on religious grounds to stand and salute the American flag for the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>

<p>The state parole board granted parole to 42-year-old Bobby Bostic on Monday and he will be released from prison late next year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and the Missouri Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Bostic for a while found hope in a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that outlawed life sentences for people under 18 for non-homicide crimes. The Supreme Court, however, declined to hear his case in 2019.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Arizona asked the Supreme Court Tuesday to allow enforcement of a ban on abortions performed solely because of Down syndrome and other genetic abnormalities.</p>
<p>Several Republican-led states have enacted laws prohibiting abortion based on a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome or other genetic issues, among hundreds of new abortion restrictions put in place in recent years. </p>

<a>and other states</a>. Kaul is up for reelection along with
<a>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. </a> Both are supporters of abortion rights and face Republican opponents who want to make abortion illegal again.
<a>21 states with laws</a> or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
<p>Wisconsin is one of nine states with an abortion ban law that predates Roe v. Wade, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Even if Kaul would take that approach, most prosecutions for violating any abortion ban would most likely be brought by district attorneys at the county level. </p>
<p>Kaul said the Justice Department is focused on investigating crimes of statewide importance like homicide, sexual assault and arson.</p>
<p>“Diverting resources from those important cases to the kinds of cases that could be brought under abortion ban, which I also believe to be unconstitutional, is not something that I would do as attorney general,” he said.</p>
<p>Kaul said enforcing an abortion ban would undermine public safety.</p>
<p>“And it would result in serious negative health consequences, including potentially the death of women who wanted to seek to exercise what for nearly 50 years been understood to be a constitutionally protected right,” he said.</p>
<p>Two Republicans have launched campaigns to challenge Kaul: Fond do Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney and former state Rep. Adam Jarchow, of Balsam Lake. </p>
<p>Toney said Kaul was a politician, not a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>“I am proudly pro-life and I will defend the police and defend our Wisconsin laws, including our abortion ban, if allowed,” Toney said.</p>
<p>Jarchow blasted Kaul as “a wholly owned subsidiary of the Washington DC swamp.”</p>
<p>“He is the very definition of partisanship and a failed leader,” Jarchow said. “So, while it’s disappointing that he says he will not follow the law, it’s not surprising.” </p>

<div><div><h1>Court allows Biden employer vaccine mandate to take effect</h1></div><div>By GEOFF MULVIHILL and ANDREW DeMILLODecember 18, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>A federal appeals court panel on Friday allowed President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for larger private employers to move ahead, reversing a previous decision on a requirement that could affect some 84 million U.S workers.</p>
<p>The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati overrules a decision by a federal judge in a separate court that had paused the mandate nationwide.</p>
<p>Republican state attorneys general and conservative groups said they would appeal Friday’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The panel’s majority disagreed.</p>
<p>“Vaccination and medical examinations are both tools that OSHA historically employed to contain illness in the workplace,” she wrote.</p>
<p>She was joined in the majority decision by Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch, an appointee of former President Barrack Obama, a Democrat.</p>
<p>The case was consolidated in the 6th circuit, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. Earlier this week, the circuit’s active judges rejected a move to have the entire panel consider the case, on an 8-8 vote.</p>
<p>Larsen also argued that vaccinated workers “do not face ‘grave danger’ from working with those who are not vaccinated.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said she would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block the order. At least two conservative advocacy groups said they had already appealed to the nation’s highest court.</p>
<p>“The Sixth Circuit’s decision is extremely disappointing for Arkansans because it will force them to get the shot or lose their jobs,” Rutledge said.</p>
<p>South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who also is chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association, said in a Twitter message Friday that he was confident the mandate could be stopped.</p>

<p>Following is a rundown of some of Biden’s most sweeping vaccine requirements and the status of the legal fights over them.</p>
<a>a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the mandate</a>, reversing a decision by a panel of

<a>consolidated </a> into the Cincinnati-based 6th circuit, which was selected at random.
<a>OSHA announced </a> that it would not issue citations before Jan. 10 for its vaccination mandate or before Feb. 9 for its testing requirement to give employers time to adjust.
<a>but a ruling Dec. 15</a> gives it the possibility of moving ahead in about half the states.
<p>FEDERAL CONTRACTOR MANDATE</p>
<a>issued a ruling Dec. 7</a> prohibiting enforcement of the requirement for contractors nationally. The ruling came a week after a judge in Kentucky barred enforcement of the requirement in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.

<p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho is among 27 states asking the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency stay to prevent President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for larger private employers from taking effect.</p>
<p>The request filed Monday follows a decision Friday by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruling a decision by a federal judge in a separate court that had paused the mandate nationwide. </p>
<p>The mandate from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was to take effect Jan. 4. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is scheduled to rule on the emergency application by Dec. 30.</p>
<p>The emergency stay request comes from 27 Republican-led states, conservative groups, business associations and some individual businesses.</p>
<p>The vaccine requirement would apply to companies with 100 or more employees and would cover about 84 million workers in the U.S. Employees who are not fully vaccinated would have to wear face masks and be subject to weekly COVID-19 tests. </p>
<div><div><h1>After SCOTUS hearing, a new look at baby ‘safe haven’ laws</h1></div><div>By ASTRID GALVAN December 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHOENIX (AP) — For years, Nicole Olson had longed for a baby and gone through a rigorous and emotional adoption process. Then Olson and her husband got a call asking if they’d like to adopt a newborn. That day. As soon as possible. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Governor to pardon Plessy, of ‘separate but equal’ ruling</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>High court confirms justices have received COVID-19 booster</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chief justice: Judges must better avoid financial conflicts</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>NC voter ID trial delayed as US Supreme Court examines case</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Julie Rikelman, the attorney arguing against the Mississippi law, rebutted that argument, saying abortion rights are not just about forced motherhood but about forced pregnancy. </p>
<p>In a traditional adoption, a family knows who the mother is. They have her medical history and often keep a relationship with her. </p>
<p>That’s what Olson, a Phoenix-area high school teacher, was expecting when she and her husband worked with a private agency after years of trying other routes. Their son, Paul, who was 7 years old at the time, was also eager for a sibling. </p>
<p>But when they met their newborn, the couple didn’t know his exact date of birth, his race, or any pertinent medical information.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find critics of safe haven laws, and advocates say if they save even one baby from being killed, they are worthwhile. </p>
<p>But some question their efficacy. </p>
<p>Adam Pertman, president and CEO of The National Center on Adoption and Permanency, said the laws’ effectiveness, including in preventing death, aren’t studied enough. </p>
<p>Pertman said safe haven laws don’t address the needs a woman might have if she were in such a crisis that she’d hurt her child, nor do they provide resources for someone in need. </p>
<a>or overturning Roe v. Wade</a> altogether, could result in more children being left at safe havens and not adopted the traditional way — with medical background and thorough health information.
<p>Slightly over 4,000 babies have been surrendered since the first law took effect in 1999, according to both the organization and the CDC, which put out a report in 2020. </p>
<p>The study found that the overall infant homicide rate was 13% lower in the years since safe haven laws were adopted nationwide. The study compared data from 1989 to 1998 to data from 2008 to 2017. Every state had adopted safe haven laws by 2008. </p>
<p>The CDC recommends that states “evaluate the effectiveness of their Safe Haven Laws and other prevention strategies to ensure they are achieving the intended benefits of preventing infant homicides.”</p>
<p>A vast majority of child welfare advocates praise safe haven laws, saying they keep babies alive and safe when a birth parent isn’t able to care for them. The babies are adopted quickly, rarely going through foster care.</p>
<p>Olson helps with an organization that advocates for safe haven laws and hopes more people learn about them. </p>
<p>“The biggest message I’ve been trying to send out is when you have a desperate situation, somebody will be there to help,” Olson said.</p>

<p>LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — A Louisiana appeals court has upheld a man’s attempted murder conviction for stabbing a stranger who threw a beer can at him during an argument outside a truck stop casino. </p>
<p>The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal rejected DeWayne A. Sylvester Sr.’s argument that his 10-2 conviction is unconstitutional under a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, The American Press <a>reported. </a></p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision <a>affected</a> only future cases and those in which the defendant’s appeals had not been exhausted.</p>
<p>Sylvester, of Lake Charles, is serving 15 years after being convicted in 2017 of attacking Gerald Carter outside the EZ Aces Casino in Lake Charles, where Sylvester and a child had stopped to use the restroom after driving from Lafayette. </p>
<p>Sylvester testified that the fight in February 2016 started after Carter accused him of following Carter. </p>

<div><div><h1>In abortion rights debate, Biden doesn’t often use the word</h1></div><div>By COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLERDecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden insists that he strongly believes in the rights spelled out in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that are now under the most dire threat in decades. </p>
<p>To women who rallied to Biden’s presidential campaign in no small part to protect the landmark 1973 court ruling, that’s not nearly enough. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>There have been studies, commissions, and a range of executive actions, but Biden has been focused on the issues he views as most pressing for the country, most passable in Congress, and posing the greatest return with voters. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris has of late been more vocal on the topic, a possible indication that she will be the one who is more likely to speak out in the future. </p>
<p>“The most important objective of the Biden administration is to make sure that Donald Trump does not re-enter the Oval Office in January 2025,” he said. “Everything else pales in consideration to that.”</p>
<p>But there are at least some things the president could do, liberals say, beyond urging Congress to pass legislation affirming abortion rights guaranteed in the court’s historic rulings. Such a bill would probably never get through the Senate.</p>
<p>For some, adding more seats to the court would help solve the problem. For others, the recent decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ease up on restrictions <a>for the abortion pill is a great start. </a></p>
<p>And some have suggested it doesn’t have to be Biden himself at the bullhorn — he could direct Harris and others in his administration to take up the topic more extensively. </p>
<p>There is support for protecting Roe. In 2020, AP VoteCast found 69% of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court should leave the Roe v. Wade decision as is; <a>just 29% said the court should overturn the decision.</a></p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s historic 1973 decision legalized abortion throughout the United States and its 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed Roe.</p>
<p>At the very least, the court could undermine the Roe and Casey rulings, which allow states to regulate but not ban abortion up until the point of fetal viability, at roughly 24 weeks. The outcome probably won’t be known until June. </p>
<div><div><h1>Sarah Weddington, lawyer who argued Roe v. Wade, dies at 76 </h1></div><div>By JAKE BLEIBERGDecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>DALLAS (AP) — Sarah Weddington, a Texas lawyer who as a 26-year-old successfully argued the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade before the U.S. Supreme Court, died Sunday. She was 76.</p>
<p>The case of “Jane Roe,” whose real name was Norma McCorvey, was brought against Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade and eventually advanced to the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Weddington argued the case before the high court twice, in December 1971 and again in October 1972, resulting the next year in the 7-2 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.</p>
<p>Weddington’s death comes as the Supreme Court is considering a case over <a> Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks</a> of pregnancy that’s widely considered to be most serious challenge in years to the Roe decision. </p>

<div><div><h1>State legislatures in US poised to act on abortion rights</h1></div><div>By WILSON RINGDecember 28, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Early in the new year, the Vermont House of Representatives is due to begin debate on an amendment that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution and send the question to voters in the fall.</p>
<p>Supporters of the proposed Vermont amendment had the possible loss of Roe in mind when they began the process in 2019 to enshrine “reproductive autonomy,” including abortion, in the constitution.</p>
<p>The amendment would say that the state constitution provides no right to abortion and that the Legislature can regulate it however lawmakers see fit — which means if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Kansas lawmakers could ban abortion completely.</p>
<p>In Mississippi, Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel said earlier this year he would “absolutely” consider filing legislation to match the Texas law after a sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court let that law stand, at least for now.</p>
<p>“I think most conservative states in the South will look at this inaction by the court and will see that as perhaps a chance to move on that issue,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet even in California, which already has adopted several measures to protect abortion access, a pro-choice group laid out 45 steps that could be taken to further protect those rights.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of work to be done in order to shore up abortion rights and access,” Nash said.</p>
<p>Nash said a handful of states have interpreted their state constitutions as protecting abortion rights, but Democrats in Vermont want to be certain.</p>

<div><div><h1>White House, Jan. 6 committee agree to shield some documents</h1></div><div>By ZEKE MILLERDecember 28, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has agreed to defer its attempt to get hundreds of pages of records from the Trump administration, holding off at the request of the Biden White House.</p>
<p>The deferral is in response to concerns by the Biden White House that releasing all the Trump administration documents sought by the committee could compromise national security and executive privilege.</p>
<p>Trump is appealing to the Supreme Court to try to block the National Archives and Records Administration, which maintains custody of the documents from his time in office, from giving them to the committee. </p>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Still other documents are highly classified and the White House asked Congress to work with the federal agencies that created them to discuss their release.</p>
<p>Su wrote that for the committee, withholding the documents “should not compromise its ability to complete its critical investigation expeditiously.”</p>
<p>Biden has repeatedly rejected Trump’s claims of executive privilege over those documents, including in a letter sent Dec. 23 regarding about 20 pages of documents. </p>
<p>“The President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified,” White House counsel Dana Remus reiterated in the latest letter. </p>
<p>Trump has taken to the courts to block the document releases. A federal appeals court ruled this month against Trump, and he has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, though the high court has yet to decide whether to take up the case.</p>

<div><div><h1>Late Senate leader Harry Reid remembered as `man of action’</h1></div><div>By KEVIN FREKING, LAURIE KELLMAN and KEN RITTERDecember 30, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Reid, 82, died Tuesday at home in Henderson, Nevada, of complications from pancreatic cancer, according to Landra Reid, his wife of 62 years.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>High court confirms justices have received COVID-19 booster</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chief justice: Judges must better avoid financial conflicts</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>NC voter ID trial delayed as US Supreme Court examines case</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Roe lawyer Sarah Weddington helped redefine abortion rights</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Biden called Reid one of the great Senate majority leaders in the country’s history.</p>
<p>“He was a man of action, and a man of his word — guided by faith, loyalty, and unshakeable resolve,” Biden said in the proclamation.</p>
<p>Reid retired in 2016 after an accident left him blind in one eye. He announced in May 2018 that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was being treated. </p>
<p>In many respects, his legacy is tied to Obama’s. In a letter to Reid before Reid’s death, Obama said he wouldn’t have been president without Reid’s support. </p>
<p>“As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other — a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy,” Obama said.</p>
<p>Republicans cited Reid’s toughness and tenacity, while also noting they disagreed with him on many issues.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he and Reid “disagreed on many things, sometimes famously. But we were always honest with each other. In the years after we left public service, that honesty became a bond.” </p>
<p>The future senator put himself through George Washington University law school in the District of Columbia by working nights as a U.S. Capitol police officer.</p>
<p>At 28, Reid was elected to the Nevada Assembly. At 30, he became the youngest lieutenant governor in Nevada history.</p>
<p>Elected to the U.S. House in 1982, Reid served in Congress longer than anyone in Nevada history. </p>
<p>After his election as Senate majority leader in 2007, he was credited with putting Nevada on the political map by pushing to move the state’s caucuses to February, at the start of presidential nominating season. </p>
<p>Reid steered hundreds of millions of dollars to Nevada and was credited with almost single-handedly blocking construction of a nuclear waste storage facility at Yucca Mountain outside Las Vegas. </p>
<p>But voters, angered by the recession and inspired by the small-government tea party, soon swept Democrats from their House majority.</p>
<p>Reid also took action in 2013 to change the Senate’s filibuster rules and lower the threshold for advancement to 51 votes for most executive and judicial nominees, but not Supreme Court picks.</p>
<p>McConnell went further when Republicans were in the majority, lowering it to 51 votes for Supreme Court nominees too, and enabling Republicans to install three of President Donald Trump’s high court choices over Democratic objections.</p>
<p>In his final months, Reid spoke in favor of eliminating the filibuster altogether, calling the Senate a “legislative graveyard” and no longer a deliberative body.</p>
<p>“The filibuster has become an anti-democratic weapon wielded by the minority to silence the will of the people,” he wrote in the Las Vegas Sun.</p>
<div><div><h1>Comments renew debate over adoption as abortion alternative</h1></div><div>By DAVID CRARY and JOHN HANNADecember 30, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Year after year, several thousand women in the U.S. carry an unintended pregnancy to term and then offer the baby for adoption. It’s a choice commended by many foes of abortion.</p>
<p>Yet despite a huge demand for babies from Americans yearning to adopt, perhaps 40 times more women opt for an abortion, and a large majority of those who proceed to give birth make the choice to keep the child.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Comments renew debate over adoption as abortion alternative</h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>Noem's check on abortion meds stuck in legislative committee</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Bartholet described the justice’s comments as “breathtakingly thoughtless” by failing to acknowledge the deep emotional bonds that many women have with their babies even when they result from an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
<p>Those bonds can grow more powerful immediately after birth, said Grace Howard, who has worked as a doula assisting women in childbirth and women seeking abortions.</p>
<p>“Your body’s like, ’Bond! Bond, damn it!’” said Howard, an assistant professor in justice studies at San Jose State University.</p>
<p>The adoption council is working on a new estimate of infant adoptions for 2019 and 2020. Its acting CEO, Ryan Hanlon, predicted the number would be similar to the 2014 estimate.</p>
<p>Hanlon says there’s a huge gap between the number of U.S. infants available for adoption and the hundreds of thousands of Americans – single adults and couples – who want to adopt.</p>
<p>“There are dozens waiting with each agency for every child they place,” Hanlon said.</p>
<p>Kelsey Wright chose adoption — twice. She became pregnant in high school and, at 18, gave birth to a son in 2011. Feeling unprepared for parenting, she placed the baby for adoption with a family she knew.</p>
<p>Six years later, as a subsequent relationship was breaking up, she again became pregnant. And again, she chose to continue with the pregnancy and place her second son with the same family that adopted his brother.</p>
<p>Now 29, Wright lives in the Houston suburbs and got married last year. She and her husband have a 4-month-old daughter. She stays in touch with her sons, visiting occasionally even though their family moved to New Mexico.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any regrets,” Wright said. “It took time to heal, but I wouldn’t change it for anything. I’m so grateful adoption was an option.”</p>
<p>Lee said adoption “is an alternative to parenting, not to pregnancy.”</p>
<p>Many abortion-rights advocates are wary of some aspects of private adoption, viewing it as part of the agenda of anti-abortion activists.</p>
<p>Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Pro-Choice Missouri, said the anti-abortion pregnancy centers that proliferate in many states are part of that system.</p>
<p>It’s often a challenge for staff members to even discuss adoption, Maxon said.</p>
<p>“Some pregnant women were afraid to come to the church for help – they thought they were going to be judged,” said Kat Talalas, assistant director for pro-life communications for the bishops’ conference.</p>
<p>“Our goal is walk with them as sisters,” she said of a recent initiative, Walking with Moms in Need. “We’re showing them a positive vision of motherhood.”</p>

<p>In a filing with the court Thursday, lawyers for the committee argued that it is within its jurisdiction to seek the information. </p>
<p>“Although the facts are unprecedented, this case is not a difficult one,” the lawyers said in the filing, adding, “This Court’s review is unwarranted, and the petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.”</p>

<p>Last week Trump’s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to hear arguments on his claim that executive privilege prevents the release of the documents, describing the committee as engaged in “meandering fishing expeditions.” </p>
<p>The Supreme Court could decline to hear the appeal. Such action would mean the ruling Dec. 9 by the federal appeals court is the final word on the matter. </p>
<p>They also said the records could have an effect on efforts to enact or enhance laws to “prevent Executive Branch officials from enlisting the Department of Justice, or other federal resources, to support false claims about an election.”</p>

<p>Voting rights advocates warn that Republican-led states are passing restrictive <a>legislation and trying to install election officials</a> loyal to former President, Donald Trump in ways that could subvert future elections.</p>
<a>“fight like hell”</a> for his presidency, and a mob stormed the Capitol trying to stop Congress from certifying the state election tallies for Biden. It was the worst domestic attack on a seat of government in U.S. history.
<p>How the Senate <a>filibuster </a> rules would be changed remains under discussion.</p>
<p>It seems certain that a full-scale end of the filibuster is out of reach for Democrats. Changing the rules would need all 50 votes, and Manchin and Sinema have made it clear they are unwilling to go that far. </p>
<p>Schumer said he has had several discussions with Manchin, and that Manchin was “entertaining” various proposals.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to give people the illusion that he said he would be for any of them at this point. It’s a long, hard struggle,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>Republicans are so worried Democrats will end the filibuster that McConnell has taken other actions to try to keep Manchin and Sinema close so they don’t join the rest of their party in making any drastic changes.</p>
<p>One Republican, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, argued on Monday that ending the filibuster would turn the Senate into a “Lord of the Flies”-style institution where majority rules, no matter what.</p>
<p>“It is absurd and dangerous to the institution itself,” Lee said in a statement. He said Schumer and his “disastrous plan” must be stopped.</p>

<p>Will it? Don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>“And I don’t think it will change many investors’ attitudes,” he added. “People are still going to want to reach for the moon.”</p>
<p>Holmes got slapped down hard for going overboard with her relentless sales pitch while running Theranos, a blood-testing startup she founded as a 19-year-olld college dropout in 2002.</p>

<p>Few expect the Holmes conviction to lower the wattage on the brash promises and bold exaggerations that have become a routine part of the tech industry’s innovation hustle.</p>
<p>The bold dream Holmes pursued when she founded Theranos had become a nightmare by the time she was indicted on felony charges in 2018.</p>
<p>“Some people like to throw money at things and have too much unfounded optimism, and Elizabeth Holmes took full advantage of that,” Greenfield said.</p>
<p>Evidence presented at the trial also showed that Holmes lied about purported deals that Theranos had reached with big drug companies such as Pfizer and the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The deception backfired in 2015 after a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal and a regulatory audit of Theranos uncovered potentially dangerous flaws in the company’s technology, leading to its eventual collapse.</p>
<p>“Let’s face it: Silicon Valley is based on dreams,” Greenfield said. “And you need people to keep stoking the fire to help keep those dreams alive.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Family stranded in Virginia: ‘It’s not getting any better’</h1></div><div>By BEN FINLEY January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>By 1 p.m. Tuesday, morale was plummeting for Jennifer Travis, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter. </p>
<p>“Haven’t had breakfast,” Travis said Tuesday afternoon. “Haven’t had lunch. Haven’t had snacks. I’ve got a growing 12-year-old girl. I’m sure she’s getting hangry.” </p>
<p>It was a smooth drive for about 11 hours. But in Virginia, traffic began to back up on I-95 near Stafford. They decided to get on U.S. Route 1, which runs parallel.</p>
<p>Then, for some reason, Travis said Google Maps rerouted them back on to I-95, which appeared clear. </p>
<p>“Within 10 to 15 minutes, we were in bumper-to-bumper traffic,” Travis said. “It was just stacked-up cars.” </p>
<p>“Nobody’s helping us,” Travis said. “We are stuck and how are you going to get people to us?”</p>
<p>The family was at a standstill on I-95 from about 1:30 a.m. to about 9 a.m. </p>
<p>After fleeing I-95, the family was soon stuck again, this time on Route 17. </p>
<p>“They basically shuffled all of these cars off the highway and now have congested all the side roads,” Travis said. “The side roads haven’t been plowed. There are trees down, powerlines down. Cars are skidding.”</p>
<p>One of their dogs, a Rhodesian ridgeback named Finn, has separation anxiety. </p>
<p>“And I know that when he sees me, we’re going to be attached at the hip for a week,” Travis said.</p>
<p>Eventually, the cars on Route 17 began to move. And the family charted a way north, “taking calculated risks with backroads.” </p>
<p>“I said about 1,000 Hail Marys because there were so many trees that were dangling from power lines,” Travis said. </p>
<p>They stopped at a firehouse to use the restroom for the first time and got some better driving directions. By 3:30 p.m., they were a little more than an hour from home.</p>
<p>They still hadn’t eaten. </p>
<p>“I’ve seen cows. I’ve seen horses. No grocery stores yet,” Travis said. “We’re just trying to drive as fast and as safely as we can to get home and just eat something.” </p>
<div><div><h1>Police struggle to deter rising catalytic converter thefts</h1></div><div>By DENISE LAVOIEJanuary 2, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — In the tiny town of Lawrenceville, Virginia, a van owned by Poplar Mount Baptist Church was knocked out of commission for weeks after thieves cut the catalytic converter out of its exhaust system. </p>
<p>Several months later, across town, a catalytic converter was ripped from a van owned by First Baptist Church. </p>
<p>Similar crimes followed, targeting a total of 15 church vans and 13 other vehicles in town, part of a nationwide surge in thefts of catalytic converters.</p>
<p>For victims, the costs of replacing a stolen catalytic converter can easily top $1,000 and make their vehicle undrivable for days or weeks as the part is ordered and installed. It can also leave owners feeling vulnerable.</p>

<p>“Just to feel that the church property was invaded by thieves was disheartening,” said John Robinson, a member of Poplar Mount Baptist Church.</p>
<p>In Henrico County, where about 540 catalytic converters have been reported stolen this year, police have produced public service announcements to raise awareness. </p>
<p>“These people have got to be held accountable in some way, not given a slap on their wrist,” Overby said.</p>
<p>“People cut through our fence constantly to try to steal the catalytic converters,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely something we have to get a hold of because it’s causing a lot of families and a lot of people some heartburn,” English said. “It’s not something people deserve to have happen to them.”</p>

<p>Flames swept over drought-stricken grassy fields and neighborhoods northwest of Denver on Thursday with alarming speed, propelled by guests up to 105 mph (169 kph). Tens of thousands were ordered to flee with little notice.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>Crews box in Colorado wildfire as investigators seek cause</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Two people were missing as of Sunday and at least seven were injured. Officials estimated nearly 1,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed.</p>
<p>The blaze burned at least 9.4 square miles (24 square kilometers). The cause is still under investigation, but experts say its clear what allowed it to spread so fast.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Colorado between June and December were the warmest on record, Balch said. The grasses grew thick because they had a wet spring, but saw no moisture until snow flurries arrived Friday night. </p>
<p>Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Sunday called the blaze a “a horrific convergence” of destructive wind gusts that hit the area following the unseasonably dry and warm winter.</p>
<p>“We know that with the climate we face higher risks,” Polis said. “Right here in city and suburbs.”</p>
<p>Balch said Colorado is a dry landscape filled with flammable material for much of the year - “and those chunks of time are getting longer with climate change.”</p>
<p>The lesson learned throughout this event is that the “wildland-urban interface is way bigger than we thought it was,” Balch said. That means a wider area is under threat of wildfire.</p>
<p>“We need to completely rethink how we’re building homes.”</p>
<p>The other important change is understanding how these fires start in the first place, she said.</p>
<p>“There’s no natural source of ignition at this time of year. There’s no lightning,” she said. “It’s either going to be infrastructure-related or it’s going to be human caused.”</p>
<p>“The way we live in the landscape and our daily activities make us vulnerable,” she said.</p>
<p>“I like to say, we need Smokey Bear in the suburbs,” she said. “We need to be thinking about how our daily activities can contribute ignitions or sparks that start wildfires.”</p>
<p>Unless people stop climate change by cutting back on fossil fuels, wildfires will threaten communities, Overpeck said.</p>
<p>“There’s little doubt in my mind that the conditions conducive to really bad wildfire, whether it’s grass or forest, are only going to get worse,” he said. </p>
<p>As more people move to areas where wildfires occur, the threat goes up.</p>
<p>“We’re building towns and cities and infrastructure and so it’s just a matter of time before we have whole towns burning down like we had in California and events like this in Colorado.”</p>

<div><div><h1>2 missing; survivors count blessings after Colorado fire</h1></div><div>By THOMAS PEIPERT, BRITTANY PETERSON and EUGENE GARCIAJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Rex and Barba Hickman sifted through the ashes of their Louisville home with their son and his wife. </p>
<p>Their son Austin cut a safe open with a grinding tool to reveal gold and silver coins, melted credit cards, keys and the charred remains of the couple’s passports.</p>
<p>They evacuated with their dog, their iPads and the clothes on their back. Rex Hickman said he was heartbroken to see there was nothing left of their home of 23 years.</p>
<p>“There’s a numbness that hits you first. You know, kind of like you go into crisis mode. You think about what you can do, what you can’t do,” he said. “The real pain is going to sink in over time.”</p>
<p>The couple have to find a rental property and clothes in the short-term, and their insurance company told them Sunday it would take at least two years to rebuild their home.</p>
<p>“We know how fortunate we are,” Rex Hickman said. “We have each other. We have great friends, wonderful family. So many people have got to be suffering much more than we are, and we feel for them.”</p>
<p>While homes that burned to the foundations were still smoldering in some places, the blaze was no longer considered an immediate threat — especially with Saturday’s snow and frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>Crews were still looking for a woman at a home in Superior and a man living near Marshall. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said their homes were “deep in hot debris and covered with snow. It is a difficult task.”</p>
<p>Other investigators were seeing if the missing people might have made it out, but not contacted their families or friends, Pelle said.</p>
<p>Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and federal emergency officials visited some of the damaged neighborhoods Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Utility officials found no downed power lines around where the fire broke out. </p>
<p>Pelle said Saturday authorities were pursuing a number of tips and had executed a search warrant at “one particular location.” The sheriff refused to give details again Sunday, including whether he thought the fire was set.</p>
<p>The two towns are about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Denver with a combined population of 34,000. </p>
<p>The flames stopped about 100 yards (90 meters) from Susan Hill’s property in Louisville. She slept Saturday night in her home using a space heater and hot water bottles to stay warm since her natural gas service had not been turned back on.</p>
<p>She choked up as she remembered seeing the sky change color and recalled nervously sprinting out of town with her college-age son and the dog, cat and a fire box with birth certificates and other documents.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know how to describe it,” she said. “It’s so sad. It’s so awful. It’s just devastating.”</p>
<p>Utility crews expected to restore electricity to the homes still standing Sunday, but warned gas service might take longer to get back. </p>
<p>People lined up to get donated space heaters, bottled water and blankets at Red Cross shelters. Xcel Energy urged other residents to use fireplaces and wood stoves to stay warm and keep their pipes at home from freezing.</p>
<p>Superior resident Jeff Markley arrived in his truck to pick up a heater. He said he felt lucky to be “just displaced” since his home is intact. </p>
<p>“We’re making do, staying with friends, and upbeat for the new year. Gotta be better than this last one,” Markley said.</p>
