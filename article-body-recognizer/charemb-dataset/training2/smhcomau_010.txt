<p>Boris Johnson, engulfed by a string of scandals that have outraged the public, faces fresh allegations he broke lockdown rules by hosting a Christmas quiz.</p>
<div>Ex-adviser to be questioned over claims Boris Johnson lied about party: report</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>London: A former senior adviser to Boris Johnson who claims the British Prime Minister lied about a party held at his residence during a COVID-19 lockdown will be questioned by an investigation into allegations of rule-breaking, the Mirror reported.</p>
<p>Cummings said on Monday the Prime Minister knew in advance about a drinks party at his residence during the first coronavirus lockdown despite later claiming he had not realised it was a social gathering.</p>
<p>Johnson last week apologised to Parliament for attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, but said he had thought it was a work event.</p>
<p>Cummings claims Johnson misled Parliament because he had agreed the drinks party should go ahead.</p>
<p>“The PM agreed it should,” Cummings said in his blog. “The events of 20 May alone, never mind the string of other events, mean the PM lied to Parliament about parties.”</p>
<p>“I’m absolutely categorical, nobody said to me, ‘This is an event that is against the rules,’” Johnson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab agreed that deliberately lying to Parliament was “normally ... a resigning matter.” But he dismissed Cummings’ claim that Johnson was warned about the party as “nonsense”.</p>
<p>Cummings, an architect of the victorious 2016 referendum campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, left Downing Street in late 2020 and has become a vociferous critic of the prime minister he helped put in office.</p>
<p>Johnson’s spokesman, Max Blain, said the Prime Minister supported the rules in the Ministerial Code “when it comes to knowingly misleading the House”.</p>
<p>Johnson’s political fate may rest on the word “knowingly.”</p>
<p>In his carefully worded apologies over the allegations, Johnson has acknowledged “misjudgments” but not admitted personal rule-breaking.</p>

<h3><a>Tonga appears to have escaped devastation after volcano blast</a></h3>
<p>Despite sitting almost on top of the volcano that erupted so violently on Saturday, Tonga appears to have avoided the widespread devastation that many initially feared.</p>
<div><h5>Updated</h5><h5>Tsunami</h5></div>
<h3><a>Extensive damage to Tongan islands as first images of eruption aftermath emerge</a></h3>
<p>The Tongan government released a statement saying three people had died so far from the eruption and tsunami.</p>
<h3>Tongan blast was violent and vast, but may not disrupt global warming</h3>
<p>While Tonga’s neighbours struggled to access information about what was happening on the ground, scientists, equipped with modern monitoring technology, saw the blast in real time.</p>
<div><div><h5>Opinion</h5><h5>Coronavirus pandemic</h5></div><h3>COVID a wild card in efforts to help Tonga</h3><p>The country has so far been free of the disease.</p><ul><li><time>January 17, 2022</time></li><li>by Dr Tess Newton Cain</li></ul></div>

<h3><a>Tongan tsunami damage remains unknown as volcanic ash hinders response</a></h3>
<p>The extent of damage in Tonga following a volcanic eruption remains unknown, with authorities yet to make contact with some coastal areas and smaller islands.</p>
<h3><a>Villagers flee in Indonesia as tallest volcano on Java erupts</a></h3>
<p>People have been filmed dashing away from spiralling volcanic cloud in Indonesia’s East Java province as ash was sprayed 12 kilometres into the sky, turning day into night.</p>

<p>“It’s been mind-blowing, literally, to see this dynamism in action,” the geologist said. “We are learning so much about how volcanoes work.”</p>
<h3>‘We are at the mercy of the volcano’: No end in sight for La Palma eruption</h3>
<p>The volcano has so far destroyed more than 1800 buildings – mostly homes – and lava now covers more than 750 hectares of the island.</p>
<h3><a>Residents flee as lava from volcanic eruption spreads on Spain’s La Palma</a></h3>

<h3><a>Lava from La Palma volcanic eruption finally reaches the ocean</a></h3>
<p>A bright red river of lava from the volcano on Spain’s La Palma island finally tumbled over a cliff and into the Atlantic Ocean, setting off huge plumes of steam and possibly toxic gases.</p>
<div>Tonga appears to have escaped devastation after volcano blast</div>
<p>Wellington: The blast from the volcano could be heard in Alaska and the waves crossed the ocean to cause an oil spill and two drownings in Peru. The startling satellite images resembled a massive nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>And yet, despite sitting almost on top of the volcano that erupted so violently on Saturday, the Pacific nation of Tonga appears to have avoided the widespread devastation that many initially feared.</p>
<p>On Tongatapu, at least, life is slowly returning to normal. The tsunami that swept over coastal areas after the eruption was frightening for many but rose only about 80 centimetres, allowing most to escape.</p>
<p>“We did hold grave fears, given the magnitude of what we saw in that unprecedented blast,” said Katie Greenwood, the head of delegation in the Pacific for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, in those major population centres, we are not seeing the catastrophic effect we thought might happen, and that’s very good news.”</p>
<p>UN humanitarian officials and Tonga’s government has reported “significant infrastructural damage” around Tongatapu.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s High Commission in Tonga also reported significant damage along the western coast of Tongatapu, including to resorts and the waterfront area.</p>
<p>Like other island nations in the Pacific, Tonga is regularly exposed to the extremes of nature, whether it be cyclones or earthquakes, making people more resilient to the challenges they bring.</p>
<p>Another worry, said Greenwood, is that the volcano could erupt again. She said there is currently no working equipment around it that could help predict such an event.</p>
<p>Two people drowned in Peru, which also reported the oil spill after waves moved a ship that was transferring oil at a refinery.</p>
<p>In Tonga, British woman Angela Glover, 50, was one of those who died after being swept away by a wave, her family said.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s military said it hoped the airfield in Tonga would be opened either Wednesday or Thursday. The military said it had considered an airdrop, but that was “not the preference of the Tongan authorities.”</p>
<p>New Zealand also sent a navy ship to Tonga on Tuesday, with another planned to leave later in the day, and pledged an initial $NZ1 million ($943,000) towards recovery efforts.</p>
<p>Australia sent a navy ship from Sydney to Brisbane to prepare for a support mission if needed.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Tuesday said China is preparing to send drinking water, food, personal protective equipment and other supplies to Tonga as soon as flights resume.</p>
<p>The UN World Food Program is exploring how to bring in relief supplies and more staff and has received a request to restore communication lines in Tonga, which is home to about 105,000 people, Dujarric said.</p>
<p>Communications with the island nation are limited because the single underwater fibre-optic cable that connects Tonga to the rest of the world was likely severed in the eruption. The company that owns the cable said the repairs could take weeks.</p>

<div>Russia moves more troops westward as Ukraine tensions soar</div>
<p>Amid the soaring tensions, the White House warned that Russia could attack its neighbour at “any point,” while the UK delivered a batch of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia’s Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said the joint drills with Belarus would involve practising a joint response to external threats.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine from various directions, including from its ally Belarus.</p>
<p>The US again stressed its concern Tuesday, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing the Russian forces’ move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.”</p>
<p>“We’re now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” she said.</p>
<p>A series of talks last week between Russia, the US and NATO failed to quell the tensions over Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday in another attempt to defuse the crisis.</p>
<p>Russia has already started moving troops for the war games in Belarus. Fomin said it would take until February 9 to fully deploy weapons and personnel for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills, which are expected to take place February 10-20.</p>
<p>Russia has denied an intention to attack its neighbour but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other ex-Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there.</p>
<p>Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-US negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week.</p>
<p>Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve an unspecified number of troops from Russia’s Eastern Military District, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country’s entire military potential in the west.</p>
<p>Belarus’ authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint manoeuvres would be conducted on Belarus’ western border and also in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States and its allies have urged Russia to de-escalate the situation by calling back the troops amassed near Ukraine.</p>
<p>Germany may consider halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia attacks Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz signalled on Tuesday, as pressure grew on his government to take a more hawkish stance on the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Scholz met NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Berlin to discuss the next steps.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on Nord Stream 2, Scholz told reporters it was “clear that there will be a high price to pay and that everything will have to be discussed should there be a military intervention in Ukraine”.</p>
<p>Lavrov restated Moscow’s argument that it’s free to deploy its forces wherever it considers it necessary on its territory.</p>
<p>“We can’t accept demands about our armed forces on our own territory,” Lavrov said, adding that “troops’ training is something that every country does”.</p>
<p>“We aren’t threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us,” he added. “We will decide how to react depending on what specific steps our partners will take.”</p>
<p>Speaking on a visit Tuesday to Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly denounced the Russian troop buildup as unacceptable.</p>
<p>She noted Canada’s efforts to help train Ukraine’s military.</p>
<p>Canada, with a sizeable and politically influential population of Ukrainian descent, has taken a strong line with Russia since its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>“We are united in our support to Ukraine. Of course, any incursion into Ukraine will result in serious consequences, including very severe, co-ordinated sanctions on the part of allies.”</p>
<p>Germany signalled on Wednesday that it could halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia if Moscow invaded Ukraine, and Western nations rallied behind Kyiv over a Russian troop buildup that has stoked fears of war.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that Moscow would suffer if it did attack its neighbour, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz signalled that Berlin’s response might include stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing gas to Germany.</p>

<div>BHP homecoming to lift market’s mining exposure</div>
<p>However, the move may also make some investors in popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) a little nervous.</p>
<p>ETFs that track the performances of the SP/ASX 200 index and other indices that track Australian shares would become more vulnerable to a downturn in the mining sector, as the weighting of BHP in those indices would likely more than double.</p>
<p>BHP’s unification proposal will be voted upon on by shareholders on Thursday and, if successful, holders of PLC shares will exchange them for Ltd shares on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<p>That would see BHP PLC shares in Britain delisted, with their capitalisation effectively added to that of BHP Ltd, thereby increasing the company’s capitalisation weighting in Australian sharemarket indices.</p>
<p>Unification has been mooted by BHP for years. The company says it can now be done cost-effectively and would make acquisitions and equity raisings simpler and streamline dividend funding arrangements.</p>
<p>If shareholders vote “yes” to the proposal, the change is expected to take effect from January 31.</p>
<p>On completion, BHP’s weighting in the SP/ASX 200 index would rise from about 6 per cent to at least 10 per cent, cementing the miner as Australia’s largest listed company.</p>
<p>Australia’s three largest listed iron ore miners are BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals. Iron ore prices have been favourable to the miners in the past few years.</p>
<p>However, an economic slowdown in China could see the price of the commodity fall, impacting the benchmark index’s performance, Hodge says.</p>
<p>Elio D’Amato, founder of Spotee Connect, an investor advice service, says we have a highly sophisticated and large sharemarket but are perceived globally as being “higher risk.”</p>
<p>“Part of that is our traditionally high concentration with a smaller number of larger stocks and then a long tail of smaller stocks,” he says.</p>
<p>“The other reason is its our mining focus, which is a cyclical sector that is susceptible to booms and busts.”</p>
<p>D’Amato says BHP’s unification could have implications for those who are getting exposure to the Australian equity market through ETFs.</p>
<p>ETFs are proving popular with investors, mainly because they are easy to buy, as their units are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange and they provide a low-cost way for investors to add diversification to their investment portfolios.</p>
<p>However, D’Amato says BHP’s increased weighting in the SP/ASX 200 index could see it become more dependent on the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, the growth rate of Australian ETFs has averaged almost 40 per cent a year. One of the most popular types of ETFs are those that track the Australian sharemarket, particularly those that track the SP/ASX 200 and SP/ASX 300.</p>
<p>Chris Brycki, founder of Stockspot, an online investment adviser and fund manager, says investors should not be too concerned about the increase in ETF concentration risk to the mining sector.</p>

<div>Bitcoin investors dig in for long haul in ‘staggering’ shift</div>
<p>A growing cohort of long-term bitcoin investors are doubling down on their stashes of the cryptocurrency, hoping a December dip was merely a festive blip.</p>
<p>Some industry watchers point to the underlying stability of such long-term investments as potentially promising indicators for the capricious cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Since last July, for example, the amount of bitcoin held in digital wallets with no outflows for more than five months has been steadily increasing, according to digital currency brokerage Genesis Trading.</p>
<p>In addition, the amount of the bitcoin held in “illiquid” wallets - which spend less than quarter of their inflows - is also rising, meaning fewer coin are being actively traded, it added, citing wallet data across several exchanges.</p>
<p>“The number of bitcoins that haven’t moved in over a year has been climbing since July,” said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Trading. “That’s pretty staggering.”</p>
<p>While bitcoin and ether both posted gains last week - up 2.9 per cent to $US43,107 and up 6.3 per cent to $US3,350, respectively - they are still some way off their 2021 highs of $US69,000 and $US4,868.</p>
<h3>‘Strong hands’</h3>
<p>Yet advocates of bitcoin and other coins say the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream financial and investing in recent years has shored up the sector.</p>
<p>“Previous market bottoms in July 2021 and March 2020 correlated with Fear and Greed scores of 19 and 10 respectively,” he added.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, 0 indicates “extreme fear” and 100 is “extreme greed”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The number of bitcoins that haven’t moved in over a year has been climbing since July. That’s pretty staggering.”</p><cite>Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Trading.</cite></blockquote>
<p>There were, meanwhile, more headlines for cryptocurrencies last week.</p>
<p>Meme-based dogecoin stole the spotlight after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company would accept it as payment for select merchandise.</p>
<p>The tweet sent dogecoin up nearly 12 per cent.</p>
<p>“If more people are looking to buy Tesla merchandise with dogecoin then there’s more demand,” Acheson said, adding that this move could improve fundamental factors for dogecoin.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency Solana was another altcoin in focus, with Bank of America analysts saying the Solana blockchain could pull market share away from ethereum and “could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem”.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, bitcoin miners bounced back from mining crackdowns in China and the recent unrest in Kazakhstan, one of the world’s primary centres for bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s mean “hash rate” a measure of the power of the bitcoin computing network, touched an all time high of over 215 million terahashes per second on Thursday, according to blockchain data provider Glassnode.</p>

<div>BHP lifts iron ore but braces for ‘short-term’ pain as COVID rises</div>
<p>Top Australian miner BHP delivered stronger-than-expected output of the steel-making material iron ore in the final three months of 2021 despite the challenges of COVID-19 border restrictions limiting availability of skilled workers.</p>
<p>From its mines in Western Australia, BHP lifted its quarterly production of the commodity by 5 per cent to 73.9 million tonnes, beating some analysts’ expectations and putting the miner on track to achieve its full-year target.</p>
<p>Rio Tinto, the nation’s second-largest miner, earlier this week reported a drop in shipments of iron ore in the December quarter amid protracted supply chain disruptions and the labour shortage.</p>
<p>Iron ore, which steel-makers heat with coal at high temperatures to churn out liquid metal, is Australia’s biggest export, accounting for a record $150 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>However, the iron ore price fell sharply in the second half of the year as Beijing deepened cuts across its steel mills to reduce emissions from one of its worst-polluting industries and global supply began to pick up.</p>
<p>“Subject to shareholder approval and UK Court sanction, unification is expected to complete by January 31,” the company said.</p>
<p>BHP said it would retain its standard listing on the London Stock Exchange, where it is currently the second-largest company, and its shares would continue to be traded in Johannesburg and New York.</p>
