<h1> The Bothy Bistro, Burghead, restaurant review: 'It's fresh and exciting because it's not posh' </h1>
<p> Enraptured with a menu of fresh seafood, our critic is keen to shout the praises of this bistro in the Highlands </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 8 October 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>If Scotland is a nation of deep-fried Mars bars, of square sausage and macaroni pie, then I have seen the start of a revolution, witnessed and been at the epicentre of the fightback, observed the dawn of a new mindset. </p>
<p>The Bothy Bistro is utterly charming and beautifully simple, and in fact so fabulous that it almost makes me want to forgive the Scots for inventing reeling. Almost.</p>
<p>It’s there on Grant Street, the main street of Burghead, a very long street, so long you can’t see one end from the other and, heading north, might assume that you’ll fall off the edge of Scotland and into the chilly Moray Firth.</p>
<p>The restaurant itself is clad in timber and painted pale blue, so looks a bit like a shipping container with windows. Inside, there’s a pretty bar with shelves bearing spirits and a counter that brandishes cake. </p>
<p>Seating winds round to the back, but we sat in the front part; light and airy and decorated with old ships’ wheels hung on the walls and gold-framed blackboards that heralded specials, cocktails or chirpy greetings.</p>
<p>I started with their seafood chowder, a dish that I reckon can separate the menu from the boys. Will it be milky and rich, or a flimsy fish soup? It promised local crab and freshly baked focaccia alongside.</p>
<p>Of my two pals, one had a very fine, soft, orange-coloured quenelle of crab, served with Bothy ciabatta and Roseisle leaves, the other fresh and decent fried chanterelles, accompanied by ‘new-season tatties’.</p>
<p>It was nothing short of gorgeous innovation, a dish to shout about from the rooftops, to march up and down Grant Street singing of.</p>
<p>Two of us loved our lobster, while the third sang equal praise for his scallops in their shells with samphire and bacon. Sides included chips with a crabby mayo and greens cooked with chilli and garlic.</p>
<p>With its sister, seasonal shack and double-decker bus (<a>Bootleggers</a>) by the sea, and this place’s year-round position, The Bothy Bistro is a glorious, sensational discovery.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews Fiend, London: 'Every plate was immaculate, original and interesting' </h1>
<p> There's a subtle culinary genius at work at this restaurant on London's iconic Portobello Road </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 15 October 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>But the body held, it didn’t fray and, once in the mouth, it melted, doing so with a beautifully natural sweetness. A dollop of white was an oyster emulsion, tempered with sprigs of baby watercress. Such a fine and clever dish.</p>
<p>Similarly a cod, cockle and smoked eel bordelaise came as a bundle of the sea, like a pile of oceanic debris rolled ashore and sitting in a puddle of gravy. It was magnificent. </p>
<p>Before pud came a froth of cucumber and dill to settle the mind and stomach and prepare one for a clever concoction of beer, chocolate and spelt.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews Holbeck Ghyll, Windermere: 'I hadn't come this far for afternoon tea – even with staff shortages' </h1>
<p> After a shocking update from the restaurant, I was almost unable to dine at this restaurant in the Lake District – but the tables turned </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 29 October 2021 • 11:45am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The landscape of the Lake District was assuaging my journey time. After four hours of driving from the Scottish Borders, the hills and mountains, stone walls, twisting roads and black-and-white cattle were filling my heart with joy.</p>
<p>That joy turned to wonder when the lakes themselves appeared; the spectacular scenery, if you’re on your own, gives you an urgent need to call somebody and tell them about it. </p>
<p>‘I’m sorry, sir, but we are only serving afternoon tea today,’ continued the voice.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’ I replied. ‘I’m booked in for lunch and I’ll be there in 10 minutes.’</p>
<p>‘I apologise, sir, but due to staff shortages we can only serve afternoon tea, which you are welcome to have.’</p>
<p>Crestfallen, shocked, confused, bewildered, I looked around me, at all this wretched scenery, these pesky hills, these stupid-looking black-and-white cows.</p>
<p>Very peculiar, I thought. But Cyrus was at my feet, and they had provided my Labrador companion with a bowl of water and biscuits. He was happy. It was time that I was.</p>
<p>The chips were a labour of layered and crisp joy. I dealt with it gladly, noting the tasting menu usually on offer; a 10-course prospect of indigestible (for me) hell. Thank God I was refused it.</p>
<p>I finished with an obvious choice but I felt I deserved it: a sticky toffee pudding with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews Sessions Arts Club, London: 'Dish after dish of pretty innovation' </h1>
<p> Our critic enjoys criminally good food at a former courthouse in bustling Clerkenwell </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 5 November 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Florence made her name at the <a>Polpo chain restaurants</a> of Russell Norman. Now she’s back doing her own thing, and it’s clever, gorgeous and largely free of carbs.</p>
<p>Dish after dish of pretty innovation included raw, fresh and sublime slices of sea bream in oil and sorrel, with edible fig leaf. We had tasty clams in a sauce of riesling and lovage. </p>
<p>I’ll take an early 21st-century life sentence at the old courthouse.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews The Whittling House, Northumberland: 'I had a huge roast pork Sunday dinner – it was lovely' </h1>
<p> Our critic tackles huge portions in Northumberland </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 12 November 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The bright white light pierced my eyes. I looked ahead at the person opposite me, but all I could make out was the tracings of a face, the spotlight from above blinding me.</p>
<p>‘Are you OK?’ the figure opposite me asked – not the voice nor the sentiment of an interrogator.</p>
<p>I looked up at her. ‘I’d love to see the wine list please. And could you see if you could dim the lights?’</p>
<p>‘I’m afraid we can’t dim the lights,’ the kind waitress said on returning. And we couldn’t move as the place was full.</p>
<a>Yorkshire pud</a>, al dente broccoli, creamed cabbage, great roast potatoes, epic gravy. On and on I ploughed successfully to the finishing line.
<p>Then I went mad ordering an ice-cream sundae. There were (more) sugared nuts, little brownies and drizzles of caramel sauce. This may have been a once-in-a-decade pud moment. I’m glad I did it, but I’m also glad it’s over.</p>
<p>We left for a quick gulp of sea air by the beach. They’ll fill you well and for very good value at The Whittling House, but bring sunglasses or a spotlight gel and some sticky tape.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews The Alice, Oxford: ‘Not the sort of place you'd want to linger in’ </h1>
<p> Our critic is left unimpressed by this restaurant inspired by the famous Lewis Carroll novel </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 26 November 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The set lunch menu is modest: three starters, three main courses and a misleading section labelled ‘Pudding’.</p>
<p>I sensed the artichoke in there with fried things, no hint of truffle, but a sprightly salad on top. But it was a gold-starred dish compared to Rev Andrew’s ‘Mushroom custard, girolle, tarragon’.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a sort of dashi broth poured over congealed custard. ‘It tastes of bad water,’ uttered the man of God. Slices of raw mushroom on top added a rubbery note to the silty liquid.</p>
<p>And those puddings? Two unseasonal sorbets and some cheese. We shared the buttermilk and strawberry one (a panna cotta); oversweet and with bits of a spiky bush that literally hurt one’s mouth.</p>
<p>My intellectual indifference has met my least favourite place to eat.</p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews Trattoria Brutto, London: 'A food faddist’s living hell – and better for it' </h1>
<p> Our critic delights in a buzzing Tuscan-style trattoria with great cooking and excellent service </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 3 December 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>He approaches his vocation like a sort of intellectual salesman. Such is his style and erudition that he could persuade you that a glass of London tap water was from the table of Zeus.</p>
<p>He founded and ran a chain of Italian restaurants called Polpo, which came financially unstuck last year, and now he’s back with his version of a Tuscan trattoria.</p>
<p>Brutto is the food faddist’s living hell. Every dish is brown or beige; if there’s no meat in a recipe, there’s vodka, and carbs come at you like a heavy bombardment to which you can only surrender.</p>
<p>These we troughed while sipping the most amazing negronis made, apparently, from Russell’s own base mixture of wormwood, orange, artichoke and water from the Adriatic.</p>
<p>We had a sort of balcony table, which afforded a great view of the restaurant as it heaved with nimble waiters and with every table full.</p>
<p>We sipped wine from Chianti and relished the glory of an establishment that provides a wonderful answer to that eternal, almost mystical question of what makes a great restaurant. </p>
<h1> William Sitwell reviews Langan's Brasserie, London: 'They need to get their s­—t together' </h1>
<p> Our critic is left as cold as his fish pie at this old-school Brasserie in Mayfair </p>
<div> <div> By William Sitwell <time> 10 December 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Of his many bugbears, being asked if he had a reservation on entering a restaurant was high on the list. ‘That is not a greeting,’ he would snort.</p>
<p>I spied a fellow critic in the joint and we immediately compared notes about this travesty of unwelcomeness. ‘I’ve been raging about it for 20 minutes,’ he said.</p>
<p>So if you now arrive at this expensively refurbished gaff, as it works feverishly to reclaim past glories, and are greeted with a ‘Good evening’ from the chap at the door, you know who to thank.</p>
<p>The prices are sobering – which is reflected on the well-composed wine list. There’s not much choice here south of £55, so be prepared.</p>
<p>Up next was the Langan’s fish pie (£65 for two to share). It looked pretty in its oval dish, with golden, rippled potato and flecked with chives.</p>
<p>I plunged a spoon in and… what’s this? No steam? A big fish pie should be hot, so it cools gently as you eat and go back for more. This one was just warm, so it was cold within minutes. </p>
<p>The kitchen cannot claim credit for the great oysters and the fabulous rich but dry Vermentino. They need to get their s­—t together.</p>

<header> <div> <div> <h1> A blueprint recipe for the best home-made granola </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<p>This honey and orange blossom granola is a fabulous way to start the new year, and baking a big batch will see you through the month and help to make these January mornings a bit brighter.</p>
<p>The same goes for the orange blossom extract; it complements the honey beautifully, However if you prefer to not use it, stick with straight-up orange juice.</p>
<h2>Honey and orange blossom granola recipe</h2>
<p>Cooking time: 30 minutes</p>
<li>30g pistachios, shelled</li>
<li>30g walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
<li>20g blanched hazelnuts</li>
<li>Zest and juice of 1 orange</li>
<li>1 tsp orange blossom extract (you can go up to 2 tsp if you like)</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170C/150C fan/Gas 3.</li>
<li>Add the dry ingredients to a large bowl and stir together to combine.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a saucepan, and once fully melted remove from the heat and add the honey, orange zest and juice. Mix well, before finally adding in the orange blossom extract. Stir this through the dry ingredients well until fully coated.</li>
<li>Tip out onto a large baking tray with a lip, making sure the granola mix covers the base of the tray in one layer, as it will cook more evenly. Cook for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool before using. This will keep for up to one month in an airtight container.</li>

<p>'Areas that used to have ancient forests and beautiful, diverse wild plants are now just depressing squares of grazing pastures, and I simply couldn’t continue to turn a blind eye.’ </p>
<a>Lifesum</a>, which is increasing the climatarian advice offered to its users. 
<p>If you’re eating to save the planet, local, seasonal, unprocessed and plant-based foods are in; meat, dairy and water-intensive crops like avocados are likely out.</p>
<p>The climate-friendliness of a food can be determined by analysing a huge range of factors, such as how much power is used in making or storing it, and how much water is used growing a crop or, in the case of meat, cleaning a factory or farm. </p>
<p>It considers the potential pollutant impact from pesticides and the loss of biodiversity when wild land is converted to a single crop or grazing pasture. </p>
<a>Just Salad</a> already mark climatarian options on their menus. 
<a>Wahaca</a> has created an avo-free alternative to guacamole (according to
<a>Carbon Footprint Ltd</a>, a pack of two avocados has almost twice the emissions footprint of a kilo of bananas).
<a>Oatly</a> packaging shows a measure called ‘C02e’, which converts all the greenhouse gases emitted while making a product into the equivalent amount of CO2.
<a>Foodsteps</a> to analyse our recipes and actually provide a carbon score on the menu,’ says Holly Congdon from luxury events company
<p>What used to be a lifestyle on the eco-fringes of society is becoming more and more established – so how can you get in on it?</p>
<p>If you can’t bear to give up meat altogether, try the ‘Veggie 5:2’ – where you cut out meat for five days a week. Waitrose predicts this will be one of the biggest food trends of 2022.</p>
<p>For good ideas on how to make your fridge go further, have a look at the new book <a>The Zero-Waste Kitchen by Charmaine Yabsley</a> (out 13 January).</p>
<p>If your motivation slips, consider this: going climatarian might even see you drop a few pounds. ‘Much of planet-friendly eating also reflects healthy eating behaviour,’ says Professor Lang. </p>
<h2>Six climate-friendly food swaps to make now </h2>
<div> <div> <p>One cup of coffee a day contributes 155kg of greenhouse gases to your annual emissions. Tea contributes just 15kg.</p> <h2>Beer for wine</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Three to five pints a week contribute 139kg, while the same number of medium glasses of wine contribute 65kg.</p> <h2>Cow’s milk for almond milk</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A daily 200ml serving of dairy milk on your cereal adds 229kg. The same amount of almond milk adds 51kg.</p> <h2>Beef for lamb</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Eating 75g of beef one or two times a week contributes 604kg – even just switching that to lamb sees a fall to 339kg.</p> <h2>Rice for pasta</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Three tablespoons of rice (uncooked volume) eaten one to two times a week contributes 26kg; for one or two servings of pasta, the number is just 9kg.</p> <h2>Lamb for beans</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>If you then swapped that 75g of lamb for 150g beans (7kg of greenhouse gases), you’d save 332kg.</p> <h2>Have you made any climate-friendly food swaps recently? Let us know in the comments section </h2> </div> </div>
