<p>SIR – I understand the frustration of Telegraph readers concerning their eligibility to serve as vaccinators. I joined the mass vaccination programme this time last year.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to understand that the NHS is a hierarchical organisation and at the vaccination centre there are typically four grades of staff at the front line.</p>
<p>The Band 3 healthcare assistant (HCA) provides administrative support, and the vaccination itself is given by a Band 4 HCA immuniser. Both work for the NHS on short-term or zero-hours contracts.</p>
<p>Jonathan SwanChelmsford, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – Every campaign to encourage the uptake of the vaccine requires more of volunteers’ time and commitment. I have been involved since the beginning of the programme and have thoroughly enjoyed playing a part in it.</p>
<p>We are likely to remain involved for some time yet. Without the goodwill and support we provide, the programme would crash.</p>
<p>It is fine offering doctors £15 per vaccination. Little, if any, of that trickles down to volunteers.</p>
<p>Paul CaruanaTruro, Cornwall</p>
<p>SIR – Could we please have fewer complaints about our postal service? Our local postie has appeared every day come rain or shine and always with a “Good morning” and a smile.</p>
<p>Brian DukeEast Hoathly, East Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – We in Whitstable have had a similar experience to that of Brian Halling (<a>Letters, December 27</a>), with no post since more than a week before Christmas.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a Telegraph reader in the Canterbury sorting office who can help. It has been impossible to reach it by phone.</p>
<p>Michael PerkinsWhitstable, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – It has been more than a week since the street I live in has had a postal delivery. This is disappointing and massively inconvenient for those relying on business communications.</p>
<p>We have grown used to a weekly or twice-weekly delivery because of the pandemic, but this prolonged no-show illustrates just how far the reliability of Royal Mail has sunk.</p>
<p>The number of on-farm slaughtered pigs will only increase. This crisis is emotionally and financially crippling for pig farmers, and is made worse by the ineffectual government response.</p>
<p>Richard ListerFormer Chairman, National Pig AssociationTopcliffe, North Yorkshire</p>
<h2>Citizen don’t-knows</h2>
<p>SIR – After a family feast on Christmas day, we had games and quizzes. Some one brought out a paper in which applicants for British Citizenship have to attain a 75 per cent pass rate.</p>
<p>The general knowledge questions were tricky. One was : “Is smoking in a public place a criminal or civil offence?” Another: “Who invented radar? Logie Baird or Watson-Watt?”</p>
<p>Out of 12 playing, including six university students, 33 per cent failed.</p>
<p>David RobothamStratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – I have managed to get through the festivities so far despite severe forecasts of gloom in recent months.</p>
<p>I was able to buy all the food I needed, in spite of forecasts of empty supermarket shelves. Turkeys were advertised extensively, in spite of the expectations that there would not be enough to satisfy demand.</p>
<p>All my online shopping arrived on time, in spite of the chronic shortage of drivers.</p>
<p>I hope all the prophets of gloom were as well looked after as I was. Where are they now?</p>
<p>Ken HallamMaidstone, Kent</p>
<h2>An MP for the Falklands</h2>
<p>SIR – John Penrose wishes <a>MPs for British Overseas Territories</a> to sit in the Commons. The idea has a long pedigree.</p>
<p>However, the objection that consulting far-flung dependencies would delay the result of general elections was answered by plans for fixed-term voting, an idea that was copied into the US constitution in 1787.</p>
<p>Gibraltar was one of 19 overseas seats that the radical Joseph Hume tried to add to the Reform Bill in 1831, ranging from the Isle of Man to Australia (allocated one MP, a proposal that greatly amused the House of Commons).</p>
<p>As Canada moved towards self-government in the 1840s, allowing Canadians to elect MPs in Westminster seemed to leading politicians such as Lord John Russell and Benjamin Disraeli a way of preserving the link.</p>
<p>In 1955, a round-table conference proposed to give Malta three seats at Westminster as an alternative to independence. Churchill privately said the innovation would “inflict lasting damage upon the character of the House of Commons”.</p>
<p>Centuries of debate prove only that this pleasant idea would simply create fresh anomalies: for instance, that the Isle of Wight returns a single member, but has 50 times the Falklands’ population.</p>
<p>Professor Ged MartinYoughal, Co Cork, Ireland</p>
<p>SIR – I was given a foot massage machine for Christmas, inevitably made in China. The instructions are a treat.</p>
<p>I must not use it if I have “some Psychopath” or if I have some “skin consciousness obstacle” or if the machine “becomes mojibake”. Any advice on how to spot mojibake?</p>

<h2>Unfair school report that still rankles 80 years on</h2>
<p>SIR – I came top of the class in History with 86 per cent. In my report (<a>Letters, December 27</a>), the teacher’s comment was: “Beryl is lazy and self-satisfied.” At 89, it still seems unfair.</p>
<p>SIR – My youngest daughter’s form tutor once wrote on her report: “I had high hopes of Polly … but now realise that underneath the tinsel and glitter there is merely more tinsel and glitter.”</p>
<p>Evelyn HubbardHarwich, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – The comment under History in my report for the Lent term, 1950, was: “Good progress has been made. I shall miss him when he goes to Australia.”</p>
<p>I never went to Australia, and I wasn’t doing History. I often wonder what happened to D’Arcy Clarke, for whom the report was meant.</p>
<p>George BuxtonLeeds, West Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – The general comment on one of my wife’s primary school reports said: “Jane resents criticism”. Bullseye!</p>
<p>She always reads your letters as we eat breakfast. For the next few days, I will be eating mine with some trepidation.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 30 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The approach of the New Year is a good time to reflect on our current economic position.</p>
<p>While we continue to close all our own coal pits, there remains a need to import coal for our steel industry. This means that someone else has to dig it up and that we pay for the mining and to transport it across the world.</p>
<p>I did not vote for these “green” ideas – and nor did more than a tiny minority – but their acolytes now wield far more power than their numbers justify.</p>
<p>Major Colin RobinsBowdon, Cheshire</p>
<p>Until the Government has a proper integrated energy policy, this country will continue to lose out to foreign manufacturers – and the importation of Indian bricks will continue.</p>
<p>Tony CrossSevenoaks, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – I have received an email quote from Octopus, my energy supplier, informing me that my current annual cost of £1,600 will rise to £3,600 when my contract renews in February.</p>
<p>As a pensioner living in a relatively small house, I am distressed as to what will happen – apart from my freezing to death.</p>
<p>Paul ArcherBognor Regis, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, is hardly in a position to criticise the Government over the price of energy.</p>
<p>As secretary of state for energy under the coalition government, it was he who made sure that fracking for gas was discouraged, and he who championed a policy of shutting down coal-fired power stations.</p>
<p>Chris LewisWidnes, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – I sympathise with the actor John Nettles (Nature Notes, December 24), who worries that proposals for a solar farm risk destroying the natural splendours of Devon.</p>
<p>It would surely be more sensible to locate solar farms where the land is already covered in concrete – the large car parks of shopping malls, railway stations and similar areas.</p>
<p>A sympathetic design would raise these higher off the ground and utilise the electrical infrastructure already in place.</p>
<p>David ChadwickMinehead, Somerset</p>
<h2>Barriers to rail travel</h2>
<p>SIR – I was disappointed that the new chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, <a>Christian Schreyer</a>, failed to mention the desperate need for improved access to Britain’s rail network.</p>
<p>The last time I travelled to King’s Cross, I had to shout for help when assistance failed to show. On other occasions, I have been physically lifted on to trains because the ramp has been too steep.</p>
<p>The current situation creates significant – often insurmountable – barriers to work and social events, preventing disabled people from being fully included in society.</p>

<a>Around the World in 80 Days</a>. A real female reporter, Nellie Bly, replicated the adventure in 1889 – not long after Jules Verne’s book had been published – for the paper New York World. She even met Verne in France.
<p>She completed the journey, alone, with one case that she could carry herself, in 72 days – although the newspaper chartered a train to help on her final leg across America.</p>
<p>Marcia MacLeodLondon NW6</p>
<p>SIR – Dr Guy Meadows makes several recommendations for those <a>struggling to get to sleep</a>.</p>
<p>I would never have made a good MP.</p>
<p>The sector currently has many unfilled vacancies, with additional shortages due to the need for staff to self-isolate, should they test positive for Covid-19. This all takes its toll on the wellbeing of those working in this unsung profession.</p>
<h2>Flame-thrower conservation</h2>
<p>SIR – Tony Juniper’s argument that “<a>nature needs some human disturbance</a>” is a welcome riposte to the rewilding movement, which holds that wildlife conservation means hands-off management.</p>
<p>Richard MayMacclesfield, Cheshire</p>
<p>Constructing large projects is not all bad for wildlife – though it is sometimes not easy on the eye of humans.</p>
<p>Michael SarlingBraintree, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – I regularly use subtitles to aid my hearing when watching television (<a>Letters, December 29</a>). However, I am unsure what I can use to help my vision, as all dramas seem to be filmed at night.</p>

<a>Bloody Mary</a> – but, as tomato juice appeared to be out of stock across the length and breadth of Scotland before Christmas, this favourite of mine was not available.
<h2>Cricket crowded out of the curriculum</h2>
<p>SIR – The shortsightedness of the England and Wales Cricket Board does not fully explain England’s failure in Australia (<a>Letters, December 29</a>).</p>
<p>As things stand, the raw talent simply is not there – irrespective of the ECB’s drive to popularise the sport with limited-overs matches.</p>
<p>Nicholas NelsonIwerne Minster, Dorset</p>

<p>SIR – Although people are being encouraged to take a Covid test before meeting others, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has now admitted that there is a shortage of tests.</p>
<p>If it looks like a lockdown and feels like a lockdown it will effectively be a lockdown, with or without a vote in Parliament.</p>
<p>Roger GentryWeavering, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – I received an email from my daughter intimating that her 50th birthday party lunch would go ahead on January 1.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that at the fifth chemist I was able to obtain a box: the second last.</p>
<p>My next outing in search of a testing kit will be by car. Needless to say, the NHS website tells me that home deliveries are not available.</p>
<p>Malcolm FreethBournemouth, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – The cavalier manner in which education has been treated during the pandemic is a national disgrace.</p>
<p>That a return to closed schools and remote learning is even <a>under consideration</a>, because healthy staff cannot do a twice-weekly Covid test, is beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>The Government must take immediate action to ensure that not a single school closes its doors to our children.</p>
<p>Thomas Le CocqBatcombe, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – How many have had Covid and didn’t take a test? The answer is unknown, but must be very high.</p>
<p>How many required to take a home test before going to work have simply binned the kit and reported negative? The answer is unknown, but could be very high. Unless everyone tests, the whole system is rendered pointless.</p>
<p>Having already spent billions of pounds on this scheme, the Government must end it now before even more money is squandered.</p>
<p>Nick HazeltonWimborne, Dorset</p>
<p>This does not bode well for next year, especially for the poor and pensioners like me.</p>
<p>Peter WillimanChatteris, Cambridgeshire</p>
<p>SIR – Green extremists have shut down our coal power stations and stopped fracking, and would like to ban new projects in the North Sea.</p>
<p>We are to pay astronomical bills when we still have plenty of indigenous fuel.</p>
<p>We know that electric vehicles are coming, but surely in the interim it makes more sense to use our own fuel, rather than paying exorbitant prices for imported products.</p>
<p>If only those in power would stop virtue signalling and show some sense we could at least keep our energy bills at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Alan RipleyPolstead, Suffolk</p>
<p>SIR – As a former chief superintendent, I am pleased that police forces are <a>reintroducing </a>bobbies on the beat after decades of cuts.</p>
<p>As any seasoned officer will tell you, the serious offenders of tomorrow start off by getting away with minor crimes today. The only way to address this is through the relentless, intensive disruption of antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p>In the 1980s I found that doing this, while also targeting the leaders, both significantly reduced crime and won the respect of the hard-pressed communities living in fear of crime.</p>
<p>Mel PelhamCheadle Hulme, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – Why is it that when I watch television drama I get the full mumble<a> (Letters, December 30)</a>, but when the ads arrive – on the same set and the same channel – I can hear every syllable being enunciated?</p>
<p>Ralph BerryStratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – Having trained at the BBC, I was a drama director all my working life.</p>
<p>Mixing the sound – atmosphere, effects, music and speech – in the dubbing theatre was a long and technical process. But it was so enjoyable that it was possible to forget what was really important.</p>
<p>Sadly, subtitles are no substitute: they may enable you to follow an otherwise baffling story, but you are reading rather than watching the actor, and if you are a quick reader you get there ahead of those subtle signals that come with performance.</p>
<p>Sarah HellingsNorth Berwick, East Lothian</p>
<p>SIR – Am I alone in missing the RP of former years?</p>
<p>My hearing is not as good as it used to be, but I was taken aback by the announcement on Sunday night that “Deaf in Paradise” was coming up next.</p>
<p>Catherine LewisWare, Hertfordshire</p>
<a>article </a>on the pettiness and stupidity of the devolved governments – and particularly the Welsh one – raises profound anxiety that Michael Gove is about to make this bad situation even worse.
<p>Rumour has it that he will define “levelling up” with the introduction of a Bill to establish elected mayoralties and “governorships” throughout England. This, I fear, would mean levelling down.</p>
<p>I hope the rumour is wrong. Otherwise, God help the Tories.</p>
<p>Professor Alan SkedLondon School of Economics</p>
<p>SIR – Adrian Crisp<a> (Letters, December 30) </a>suggests that Oxford and Cambridge no longer value “achievements in sport when selecting undergraduates”, and that this has hastened the decline of cricket.</p>
<p>It is attitudes such as this that have contributed to the recent debacle in Australia. I remember the Cambridge professor being boring – as, I imagine, were the candidates he selected.</p>
<p>Richard LongfieldWeston Patrick, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – I disagree that England lacks raw cricketing talent due to a failure of the academic system.</p>
<p>Second, universities such as Oxford and Cambridge are concentrating on academics because the outdoor activities have been transferred to sports universities such as Loughborough.</p>
<p>Dave AlsopChurchdown, Gloucestershire</p>
<h2>A happier ending for the Princes in the Tower</h2>
<p>SIR – It is plausible that one of the Princes in the Tower, Edward V, was not killed by his uncle Richard III, but <a>allowed to live under a false name in the Devon village of Coldridge</a>.</p>
<p>Richard Plantagenet, son of Richard III, was discovered by a local landowner working as a bricklayer in the Kentish village of Eastwell. (The fact that he could read Latin perhaps gave him away.)</p>
<p>A 19th-century stone in the churchyard claims to mark his grave, and there is an entry in the parish register stating that he was buried on December 22 1550.</p>
<p>Professor Tim ConnellEsher, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – The claim that Richard III did not kill his nephew is a good example of the teleological approach to history, whereby researchers inevitably find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>I suspect the findings reveal the lingering hope of the Marquis of Dorset for a Yorkist restoration. Any pretender would do. He has, of course, persuaded the Ricardians.</p>

<h2>The unexpected advantages of an ancient car</h2>
<p>SIR – Jan Etherington <a>writes</a> about her old cars.</p>
<p>In the 1980s we had a Triumph Herald (Harold), which we passed down to our daughter in London.</p>
<p>She got to know many of the local breakdown teams, as well as the police, since Harold was stolen several times – though the car never made it beyond a few streets away before refusing to move any farther.</p>

<p>Ken BatesChesterfield, Derbyshire</p>
<p>SIR – By Thursday, I thought I’d had Covid symptoms for a couple of days. I tried 15 times to arrange a drive-through, walk-in or home-testing kit for myself and my wife, who also developed symptoms.</p>
<p>Alan HollowoodBlandford Forum, Dorset</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my symptoms have been no worse than those of a cold. Ordinarily I would have gone about my life as normal while taking sensible precautions to get better and not pass my cold to anyone who was vulnerable.</p>
<p>I will wait at least seven days and for two negative tests before rejoining the world, but please can someone convince me that all this was necessary?</p>
<p>SIR – The shortage of Covid tests exposes, yet again, the lack of scientific and technical knowledge in the Civil Service and Government.</p>
<p>Anyone with even the most basic grasp of manufacturing can tell you that, while most processes can be switched off quickly, they take weeks – or months or years depending on the industry – to come back to full speed.</p>

<h2>The princes’ killer</h2>
<p>SIR – In her novel, The Daughter of Time, published in 1951, Josephine Tey challenged the long-held assumption of Richard III’s complicity in the deaths of the Princes in the Tower (<a>Letters, December 31</a>).</p>
<p>Through her main character, Inspector Grant of Scotland Yard, she conducted a forensic examination of the sources and concluded that Richard was completely innocent.</p>
<p>In view of his tenuous right to the throne and the ability of the victor to write the history, suspicion fell heavily on Henry VII. It convinced me.</p>
<p>Richard SutcliffeCharing Heath, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Professor Tim Connell (<a>Letters, December 31</a>) is wrong to say that no mercy was shown to Lambert Simnel, a pretender to the throne of England.</p>

<p>SIR – The Covid testing regime currently in place causes more trouble to the economy than it’s worth.</p>
<p>By far the larger proportion of those testing positive are isolating without symptoms. Meanwhile, the omicron variant continues its relentless progress through the population on its trajectory to becoming another version of the common cold.</p>
<p>Here’s a novel idea: scrap testing. Stay at home if you feel ill but go about your business as usual if you are well.</p>
<p>William TarverWokingham, Berkshire</p>
<p>I would suggest that a virus that kills fewer than 1 per cent of those who catch it (and, of that group, many have comorbidities or are obese) should not be described in such lurid terms.</p>

<p>SIR – Simon Bathurst-Brown<a> (Letters, December 26) </a>says there’s been a “furore” in the North East over the cancellation of HS2 to Leeds.</p>
<p>I can leave here at 6.45 in the morning and be in King’s Cross at 9.30am. What’s the problem? It takes me nearly as long to get to Manchester, 40 miles away, because there is no link across Bradford. Now that is a problem.</p>
<p>David PearsonHaworth, West Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Christopher Wood <a>(Letters, December 26)</a> in Plymouth wants a direct train to Southampton.</p>
<p>I suspect his problem is that too few others do; it is hardly obvious that a mere coast should have such a service just for being a coast. At least he doesn’t have to go via London, the worst horror of all.</p>

<p>SIR – I once read an article in an American journal about a couple who decided to teach their children the value of money <a>(Letters, December 26)</a>.</p>

<p>My son followed a similar path, and now works for a highly regarded letting agent in London. Many of his friends went to university but did not benefit from their degrees.</p>
<p>If we want to improve the prospects of our young people, we need more apprenticeships and technical training.</p>
<p>Jack MarriottChurt, Surrey</p>
<h2>It’s not cyclists who make roads less safe</h2>
<p>SIR – I feel I must respond to the two <a>letters </a>last Sunday that criticised cyclists on public roads.</p>
<p>One listed cyclists’ bad practices, but failed to mention the far more dangerous behaviour of vehicle drivers towards cyclists on a daily basis, which can result in riders being seriously injured or even killed.</p>
<p>For instance, I would very much appreciate drivers not overtaking me on blind, narrow country bends, when they know that if another vehicle approaches they will have to swing back on to their side of the road and risk taking me out.</p>
<p>I would also be grateful if drivers stopped overtaking me at speed, grazing my right elbow – or cutting across my front wheel, jamming on their brakes and immediately turning left.</p>
<p>Perhaps, too, they could desist from racing by me at the top of a steep descent, pulling in front of me and then descending with their brakes on at half my speed.</p>
<p>Finally, I would cordially request that they stop parking their vehicles across cycle lanes and dual-use pavements for cyclists and pedestrians, forcing me out into fast-flowing city traffic.</p>
<p>Christopher DevineSalisbury, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – I am both a driver and a cyclist, and have observed terrible behaviour by both groups.</p>
<p>However, it is important to avoid making generalisations, for on the roads we find a cross-section of humanity, with many good, some less good and indeed some selfishly reckless individuals.</p>
<p>There is no simple solution to the problem of poor conduct by drivers or cyclists, but more rigorous enforcement of the rules by the authorities would be a good start – as would a renewed effort to achieve mutual tolerance.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – Ministers have suggested that stricter Covid controls are unlikely to be introduced in the coming days, due to a fall in infections and the mild symptoms of omicron, especially among children.</p>
<p>Yet Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, has defended the re-imposition of masks in schools, despite little evidence that they protect pupils.</p>
<p>Michael StaplesSeaford, East Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – What is the point of face-to-face teaching if you then cover up the faces of the pupils?</p>
<p>Should I perhaps take my classes to the pub and teach them over a pint or two instead? Remote teaching is far from ideal, but we shouldn’t imagine that muzzling our increasingly vaccinated young people is somehow an acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>Either it is too risky for schools to return at the moment, so we should focus on high-quality remote education, or we should be allowed to return to teaching and learning in a free and civilised way.</p>
<p>Mark WaldronRyde, Isle of Wight</p>
<p>SIR – There appears to be an expectation that certain areas of the public sector are going to have a shortfall of 25 per cent in their workforces due to Covid infection.</p>
<p>Are we going to see a similar shortfall in the private sector?</p>
<p>Stewart GraingerSaltburn, North Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – We are now being told that if we have a cold, it may well be Covid.</p>

<p>SIR – In the next election I will vote for whichever party commits itself to digging coal and fracking for gas. Will anyone join me?</p>
<p>John SmallwoodWest Auckland, Co Durham</p>
<p>SIR – There have been several letters supporting shale gas extraction, often citing its use in the United States.</p>
<p>This is a rural area with no transport infrastructure to support the movement of more than 100 heavy goods vehicles per day, and the fracking process has been shown to be massively polluting to the local environment in numerous ways.</p>

<h2>Rotten dental services</h2>
<p>SIR – The letter (January 3) about the dire straits of Britain’s dental services echoed one you published a year ago.</p>
<p>That letter referred to a parliamentary debate on January 14 2021, the outcome of which was clearly unhelpful in real terms.</p>
<p>I took up this issue with my MP and received the usual platitudinous response – that everything was under control, and that although he was too busy to attend the debate, he shared my concerns.</p>
<p>That nothing appears to have changed shows how little interest the Government has in addressing this serious everyday matter.</p>
<p>Adrian PatrickCheltenham, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – Under the national health scheme introduced towards the end of the Second World War, schoolchildren received free dental treatment.</p>
<p>I remember the twice-yearly visit to my school by the travelling dentist in his well-equipped caravan.</p>
<p>I can’t say, however, that its appearance filled us with joy, as we called it “the agony wagon”.</p>
<p>Sheila WilliamsAscot, Berkshire</p>

<p>It is scientifically proven that a bacon sandwich is the antidote for a thumping head.</p>

<p>J P BriggsPetersfield, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – Nick Timothy <a>describes</a> only part of the mess that Tony Blair made of Britain.</p>
<p>Why his appreciation of the disastrous consequences of Sir Tony’s 10 years in power leads Mr Timothy to support his knighthood is a mystery.</p>

<p>SIR – The Order of the Garter is for chivalry. Perhaps Tony Blair could display some by politely declining this honour.</p>

<p>SIR – For those considering the rights and wrongs of awarding Tony Blair the Garter, I would remind them of Lord Melbourne’s remark: “I like the Garter; there’s no damn merit in it.”</p>
<p>I am astounded he has not claimed his earldom as well.</p>
<h2>What’s the buzz?</h2>
<p>SIR – If I witness our multitude of beehives in full flight before early spring, I always shiver. On New Year’s Eve I did just that.</p>
<p>Their stocks of honey, collected through the summer months, are there to supply them with food for survival during their semi-dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>High anxiety took over until I checked our apiaries and, sure enough, all hives were on the wing. The fear for their survival took a better turn when I saw most hedgerows dotted with yellow hazel catkins, forsythia and peeping yellow gorse.</p>

<h2>The magic leaf that keeps hungry moths at bay</h2>
<p>SIR – Conservators of tapestries and other fabric artefacts in properties plagued by moths (Leading Article, December 31) should try using bay leaves.</p>
<p>These are an ancient remedy – and an environmentally friendly one. I have found they are very effective at preserving carpets, as well as woollens and cashmere clothing. Pots of lavender will also help to keep a property moth-free.</p>

<p>Mary HarrisSheffield, South Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – In 1972 I bought my first car, a green second-hand Ford Anglia.</p>
<p>Once, after returning to where I had left it in a multi-storey car park in Birmingham, I drove out – only to notice about a mile down the road that the car’s mileage was different. I then realised that it wasn’t my car.</p>
<p>In a panic I returned to the car park to find, next to the space I’d just left, my own car. The vehicles looked identical – and the door and ignition keys must have been the same, too.</p>
<p>Stephen GledhillEvesham, Worcestershire</p>
<p>SIR – I agree with Anthony Whitehead <a>(Letters, January 1) </a>about the constant warning beeps in modern cars.</p>
<p>I have a large car trailer, which from time to time I have to reverse into the tight space where it lives.</p>
<p>I have the tailgate open for better visibility, along with the door, to judge how far I need to go. My seat belt is unfastened for ease of movement.</p>
<p>This means there are about five different beeps all happening at the same time. It’s very distracting. I know when my door is open, usually because I have just opened it.</p>
<p>I want a button, or at least a software switch in my “settings” menu, which turns all noises off.</p>
<p>Ian Brent-SmithStratton Audley, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – On a coach in China I asked the driver what the frequent, loud announcements on his radio were.</p>

<h1> Confederate statue handover: a monumental shift in race relations in post-BLM Virginia? </h1>
<p> Richmond locals hope moving statues to a black history museum will bring a new era of understanding after the Black Lives Matter protests </p>
<div> <div> By David Millward, US Correspondent <time> 30 December 2021 • 8:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Statues of Robert E Lee and other Confederate leaders in Richmond, Virginia which were removed during and after the Black Lives Matter protests last year have been handed over to the city’s Black History Museum.</p>
<p>It will decide the statues’ fate in collaboration with The Valentine, the city’s long-established local history museum.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 700 Confederate memorials, dotted around cities in the southern US states which fought to preserve the institution of slavery in the American Civil War.</p>
<p>Once regarded as historical artefacts, they came under attack as Black Lives Matter demonstrations swept across the US following a wave of police shootings of African-Americans.</p>
<p>Several were pulled down by protesters; others were taken out by cities.</p>
<p><a>Their removal</a> was condemned by Donald Trump, the president at the time, who said their disappearance was a sign of the <a>“history and culture of our great country being ripped apart”</a>.</p>
<p>The Robert E Lee statue, which is owned by the state, was removed in September following a case at the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>
<p>Ralph Northam, the state’s Democratic governor, ordered its removal from Monument Avenue, a majestic thoroughfare that sweeps through the centre of the city.</p>
<p>The statue was seen as a relic of the racist past of the Confederacy and its graffiti-daubed 40ft pedestal became regarded as a symbol of street protests for justice.</p>
<p>Now the pedestal is regarded as a reflection of the political climate of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and is also being considered as an art installation.</p>
<p>Also being transferred are statues of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, J E B Stuart, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Fitzhugh Lee.</p>
<p>The museums will also take over a statue of Joseph Bryan, the newspaper publisher who fought for the Confederacy and used his presses to rail against Reconstruction which followed the Civil War.</p>
<p>Other artefacts being handed over include several canons and a generic statue of a Confederate soldier.</p>
<p>All the statues are being stored at a secret secure location, where they are under guard.</p>
<p>They are also intact, although the Robert E Lee statue was taken down in three pieces.</p>
<p>The fate of monuments has become an emotive issue. Charlottesville, where the removal of the Robert E Lee statue triggered <a>the violent “Unite the Right” protest</a>, outraged preservationists by melting the monument down.</p>
<p>Albemarle County in Virginia came under fire for sending its Confederate soldier statue to the Shenandoah Valley where it remains on display.</p>
<p>Given the strong feelings surrounding the fate of the monuments, Richmond, which was the second capital of the Confederacy, has chosen to take its time over what to do with the artefacts.</p>
<p>“The statues are an important part of our history which should be reflected, including what happened on our streets,” Bill Martin, the director of The Valentine museum, told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>“What do the last few years mean? What do the monuments mean and what did they mean when they were built?</p>
<p>“We can now talk about what the absence of monuments means. We have places where we have removed history. These are stories that have been lost and we have to decide what stories we need to tell.</p>
<p>Mr Northam said the statues had celebrated the country’s tragic division and the fight to maintain slavery for too long.</p>
<p>“Now it will be up to our thoughtful museums, informed by the people of Virginia, to determine the future of these artefacts.”</p>
<p>Mr Filatov has proposed to bring them to St Petersburg where they will be recognised for their contribution to Russian history.</p>
<h1> University cuts lines from ancient poem over fears domestic violence reference could be ‘triggering’ </h1>
<p> Reading University defends edited handout but campaign group History Reclaimed criticises the 'illiberal emphasis on emotional wellbeing' </p>
<div> <div> By Ewan Somerville <time> 2 January 2022 • 8:16pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A university has cut lines from an Ancient Greek poem in seminars over fears that a reference to domestic violence could <a>“trigger” students</a>.</p>
<p>The “unnecessarily unpleasant” section has been removed from Types Of Women, by Semonides of Amorgos, in a short handout sheet for freshers taking Reading University’s <a>classics course</a>.</p>
<p>But this alert was dropped when the academic in charge of the course decided to axe the “vitriolic” brief reference altogether from a poem extract used in class.</p>
<p>Despite no student making a complaint, it was felt that the ancient poem in its original form could give a distorted view to freshers new to studying classics, campus officials said.</p>
<p>But leading scholars raised concerns about “historical revisionism and censoring of core readings” that <a>could narrow free thought</a>.</p>
<p>Types Of Women, also known simply as Women, dates back to the seventh century BC.</p>
<h2>‘A brief reference’</h2>
<p>One translation of the work includes the line: “She’s used to getting smacked, and won’t give in until you threaten her and really force her.”</p>
<p>At Reading University, documents released under freedom of information laws, seen by the Mail on Sunday, state: “The portion of the poem now omitted involved a brief reference to domestic violence.</p>
<p>“That portion has subsequently been removed because, while the text as a whole is vitriolic, that part seemed unnecessarily unpleasant and (potentially) triggering.”</p>
<p>Prof Doug Stokes, from the anti-woke scholarly campaign group History Reclaimed, told The Telegraph: “The principal purpose of universities is to help foster critical thinking, intellectual resilience and personal maturity.</p>
<h2>‘This is not censorship’</h2>
<p>Another “content warning” at the university covers artworks depicting the Egyptian battle scenes of Ramesses II and Tutankhamun in Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: “This is not censorship, nor is it mollycoddling oversensitive students. Nothing has been cancelled.”</p>
<p>The spokesman added: “Students have access to all texts relevant to their course, and are encouraged to read and discuss a wide range of material.”</p>

<p>The Government must without delay take the initiative with radical measures to address the crisis and not just stand back while disaster looms.</p>
<p>Bob HartNewark, Nottinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – I suspect that the crisis in the cost of energy to every household and business in the country could prove to be this Government’s poll-tax saga.</p>
<p>Its fixation with green energy policy and its abject failure to secure long-term sensibly priced home-grown resources may well be its downfall.</p>
<p>David CrawshawAlmondsbury, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – Representations to ministers about shale gas (<a>Letters, January 2</a>) have fallen on deaf ears, as the only voices that are heard are those of well-funded environmentalists.</p>
<p>John BeswickRothley, Leicestershire</p>
<p>My feeling is that energy companies are trying to recoup their losses by collecting extra cash from customers on the monthly direct debits and hoping that most will just accept it.</p>

<h2>Tony Blair’s honour</h2>
<p>SIR – Tony Blair knighted (<a>report, January 1</a>)? Can there be a more blatant case of rewarding failure?</p>
<p>Richard FreerRibaute-les-Tavernes, Gard, France</p>
<p>SIR – The honours system is, yet again, shown to be a disgrace.</p>
<p>Mark MacauleyWarminster, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – Tony Blair is the least deserving prime minister to be knighted.</p>
<p>All this even before considering his military intervention in the Middle East, which has left thousands dead or homeless and led to mass migration.</p>
<p>Clifford BaxterWareham, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – Chris Whitty and Jonathan Van-Tam have saved lives, but this cannot be said of Tony Blair. I applaud knighthoods for the first two, and utterly deplore it for the latter.</p>
<p>Dorian WoodCastle Cary, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Will the long delay in bestowing the honour of a knighthood on Tony Blair give hope to John Bercow?</p>
<p>Jonathan MannGunnislake, Cornwall</p>
<p>SIR – Like Barrie Bain (<a>Letters, January 1</a>) I owned a Triumph Herald many decades ago. She was my first love. On cold winter nights I would keep her warm with an old mackintosh thrown over her engine under the bonnet.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this that protected her from a thief one night. She was driven off our drive on to the road but steadfastly refused to go any further.</p>
<p>Robert T BrownCrosby, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – While I agree with Barrie Bain that access to the engine of a Triumph Herald was made easy by the hinged front, there was one shortcoming.</p>
<p>They would gather round the car to examine it thoroughly. Without doubt, the British Herald was a far cry from the ubiquitous local Moskvitch.</p>
<p>Nigel TaylorThakeham, West Sussex</p>
<h2>Children’s stories full of justice for evil-doers</h2>
<p>SIR – Chris Harvey’s article on scary children’s television programmes (<a>Arts, December 23</a>) reminded me of the books I read as a child.</p>
<p>One of these was Grimm’s Fairy Tales – the original version, where the evil-doers got their just rewards, being flung into a pit of snakes, for instance, or into the sea in a barrel. Very satisfying.</p>
<p>Ann RunacresUllenhall, Warwickshire</p>
<h2>Panic prevails despite the data on omicron</h2>
<p>SIR – Studies from across the world are showing that the omicron variant infects more people more quickly but is less potent and dangerous than previous variants, and is making far fewer people seriously ill.</p>
<p>How often have we been told by sensible experts to “live with Covid”, and why are we not doing just that?</p>
<p>Simon CrowleyKemsing, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Three of our six adult children tested positive for Covid in the past 12 days, ruining our family holiday. They have been either asymptomatic or experienced simple colds.</p>
<p>I suggest we dump the “Covid-19” tag and now use “Cold-22” instead. That would be closer to the truth and may help dispel unwarranted fears.</p>
<p>Hervé HattLondon W1</p>
<p>SIR – The shortage of Covid-19 lateral flow tests is widely reported, but what about the lack of wheelchairs in the NHS? </p>
<p>Geoffrey CrosthwaiteCromhall, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>Life has been complicated and frustrating in the past two years, but we should look to Betty White as an example of how to live life to the full.</p>
<p>Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourne, Australia</p>
<a>report, January 1</a>) was the concoction that Jeeves gave to Wooster, but I do not think the great man ever revealed the recipe. In its absence, sitting alone in a dimly lit room listening to Chopin’s piano nocturnes does it for me.

<p>Is it any wonder that increasing numbers of patients and professionals feel they have to go private for dental services, when NHS dentistry planning is so inadequate and punitive?</p>

<p>SIR – Tim Wigmore (Sport, December 26) is right: the current Ashes debacle is not caused the players but by the men in suits.</p>
<p>The ECB has also been accused of failing to curb racism. How can this be a surprise when it demonstrates such incompetence in running our national game? If they were not paid, one would describe its members as a group of talentless amateurs.</p>
<p>John HansonCanterbury, Kent</p>
<p>Robert FarnesLimpsfield, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Following the debacle in Australia these past two weeks, what more will it take for the ECB to realise it has made a dreadful mistake in the way it has run English cricket?</p>
<p>Many cricket lovers despair at the direction Test cricket has been heading in, and will do so until there is some major reconstruction work.</p>
<p>Matthew BiddlecombeSampford Courtenay, Devon</p>

<p>SIR – I cannot help thinking that half-a-dozen “batsmen” would have done better than our “batters”.</p>
<p>Charlie FlindtHinton, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – Is the recent display from our cricketers a representation of the problems Britain faces generally?</p>
<p>Richard OwenLightwater, Surrey</p>
<p>I suspect that there is a conservative majority in this country. Most people believe in balancing rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Sir Julian BrazierCanterbury, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – I recently attempted to fill in an online application form.</p>
<p>I entered my first name as requested.</p>
<p>Next, I entered my surname.</p>

<p>Do they really feel the need to touch me that much?</p>
<p>Richard DalgleishKingsclere, Hampshire</p>
<p>Western leaders demonstrate little understanding of the history, diplomacy or psychology that led to the decline in our relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>We need diplomats who can develop an approach that protects the countries in between, but also allows Russia to regain its pride and become a democracy with an economy that does not just depend on natural resources.</p>
<p>With both Russia and China on the move, and an increasingly inward- looking and poorly led America, Europe is vulnerable on many fronts.</p>
<p>SIR – What are the chances that if Russia did move in Ukraine, China would act in the South China Sea or Taiwan at the same time?</p>
<p>Andy MunroAll Stretton, Shropshire</p>
<p>SIR – While I was interested to read about the discovery of a deadly viper in a pile of bricks imported from India (<a>report, December 23</a>), why is Britain not making its own bricks?</p>

<h2>Subtitles are not the solution to ‘mumbledom’</h2>

<p>My sympathies are also with the sound recordists, who feel compelled to remain mum.</p>
<p>Stephen GreifRichmond, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Your editorial seems cravenly to capitulate to the programme directors who insist on actors mumbling in the pursuit of reality.</p>
<p>The solution is not to turn on the subtitles, it is for actors to enunciate with clarity, despite directors’ wishes.</p>
<p>JPG BoltonBishops Lydeard, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – The solution to inaudible dialogue is twofold: curb directors’ attempts at “realism” and teach actors to speak clearly. Modern televisions are not to blame, as anyone who watches repeats of old programmes well knows.</p>
<p>What we need are actors who can project their voice and not depend on technology to do it for them, and directors who understand that they are there to satisfy viewers’ needs, not their own artistic whims.</p>

<p>SIR – My energy tariff with Scottish Power ended on December 31.</p>
<p>As food processing and distribution require energy, food prices are also bound to increase. Inflation reached more than 5 per cent in December and I would predict that it will be closer to 10 per cent by the spring.</p>
<p>Mike LewisReading, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – The primary energy use in Britain is for industrial power – not only for manufacturing but also for numerous public buildings such as hospitals and schools.</p>
<p>The alternative is to replace natural gas with hydrogen for industrial boilers. Producing enough hydrogen would be daunting but possible; however, Britain’s domestic heating needs will account for an additional large demand.</p>
<p>The proposal to use electricity as a transport fuel further skews the economics, even if hydrogen might be used as a cheaper alternative to electric batteries in cars.</p>
<p>While substituting hydrogen for natural gas and electricity appears an economic option, the 20-year planning required for such a transition challenges short-term political cycles and demands cross-party cooperation.</p>
<p>Is it possible that climate-change imperatives might effect such radical change in our political establishment?</p>

<p>SIR – I set up my solar-powered fairy lights in a tree in my garden two weeks before Christmas. They lit for the first time on Christmas Day after a couple of hours of sun.</p>
