<p>A rival with hot prospects is Flutter Entertainment, owner of Betfair. Analysts expect the shares, which trade at £117.15 now, to reach £170 within the next 12 months. </p>
<p>Michael Mitchell of Davy Research said Flutter’s investment case had never been stronger, because its expansion into America was bearing fruit.</p>
<p>“Performance in the US has been outstanding and Flutter has increased customer numbers by 350pc in the past 12 months, meaning revenue there is 50pc larger than its closest rival’s,” he said.</p>

<header> <h1> Lloyds Bank reveals unique way to avoid contactless card fraud </h1> <p> The new contactless limit of £100 has been attacked as a thief's dream </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Howard Mustoe <time> 24 September 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Bank customers fearing the new £100 contactless card limit will leave them vulnerable to fraud will be given the option to set their own, lower limits from next month. </p>
<p>The new £100 cap was announced in August and will come into force on October 15. However, Lloyds Banking Group will allow its customers to set their own limits on contactless spending, after some customers demanded a lower ceiling.</p>
<p>Debit card holders can choose their own limit from £30 to £100 in £5 steps if they have an account with Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland. It is thought to be the first of the four largest banks to make this step.</p>
<p>Contactless technology was introduced as a simple way to make quick, small purchases like a sandwich or a round of drinks. But the initial £10 spending cap has been repeatedly increased since these cards were launched.</p>
<p>The limit was increased to £20 in 2012, to £30 in 2015 and then to £45 in 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But Lloyds said its customers wanted to be able to set their own limits. Debit card holders will have first access to the sliding scale of limits, followed by credit card customers.</p>
<h3>Reporting contactless fraud</h3>
<p>Critics have wondered who would demand this higher limit, since Pin entry only takes slightly longer. But banks point to the fraud guarantees that are available and the fact that cash, when stolen, is even less secure.</p>
<p>Cards ought to force a Pin check every five transactions or £300, whichever is triggered first, as another security measure.</p>
<h3>Avoiding contactless scams</h3>
<p>There are ways to protect yourself and avoid having to test your bank’s largesse. Contactless cards contain an antenna to allow the payments system to identify the card and carry out the transaction.</p>
<a>reading your card and cloning it</a>, line your wallet or purse with tin foil. This blocks the radio signal needed for the card to communicate. If you are going on holiday or worried about pickpockets try to not carry too many contactless cards at once.
<p>Do not allow your card out of your sight for payment. Many terminals are now wireless and your card never needs to leave your hand unless the Pin is needed.</p>
<p>Politely remind anyone taking a payment that if a terminal is faulty then they can go and swap it without also taking your card. It is also socially acceptable to insist on seeing the amount being billed and to request a receipt.</p>
<a>check for unusual payments</a>. If you do not recognise a payee, search the name online as some vendors use their company name rather than a brand name. If anything looks suspicious, ring your bank or card provider.

<header> <h1> How to invest wisely and make the most from your savings </h1> <p> Many people miss out on the best returns through lack of investing knowledge </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jonathan Jones and Lauren Almeida <time> 6 December 2021 • 2:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Investing is one of the best ways to make your money grow. Over time, the stock market has been the only place capital has consistently grown ahead of inflation.</p>
<p>Yet, many of us still do not know the best way to go about this. In our 20s and 30s we do not invest due to a lack of funds or a lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>In retirement, we become more cautious and avoid the best-returning investments. Many end up missing out on the best returns throughout their lives.</p>
<p>With the right plans, investing can be easy and can be done with only a small amount of savings. Telegraph Money gives 10 top tips for investors of all ages.</p>
<p>However, for higher-rate taxpayers (earning more than £50,270 per year) investing via a self-invested personal pension –also known as a Sipp – is often the best option thanks to the tax relief.</p>
<p>For those saving for young children, <a>or grandchildren, </a>a junior Isa is a logical option. Deciding which investment tools are right for your circumstances is crucial to long-term planning, as it will reduce the tax you pay in the future.</p>
<h2>If you are young, take more risk</h2>
<p>Those starting out should invest in the stock market and have broad exposure companies around the world</p>
<p>Investing in higher risk parts of the world, including emerging markets and private equity, could provide higher rewards.</p>
<h2>Explore all options and understand the language</h2>
<p>Whether you decide to invest in a tracker fund that follows the market, or want to back an active manager that you hope will beat the market, <a>investors should look at all the options available to them </a>before making a decision.</p>
<p>People can invest in specific themes, like renewable energy or water sanitation, or ethical funds, which direct your money towards "good" companies.</p>
<h2>Use the Telegraph 25 as a starting point</h2>
<a>Telegraph 25</a>, as well as the Telegraph 10 lists for
<a>defensive funds</a>, are a good source of funds and investment trusts for those unsure of where to start.
<h2>Be aware of behavioural tendencies</h2>
<p>Do your homework on what you are investing in. Planning your finances so you know how much you can invest, and how regularly, are good practices to get into.</p>
<p>Avoid anything that seems too good to be true and being patient with your investments is also important.</p>
<h2>Take less risk if you need the money soon</h2>
<p>The length of the period you are investing for is important as it directly translates into how much risk you can afford.</p>
<p>Investing for a short period in risky assets is dangerous as there is a higher probability of losing all the money. If you need the money soon, keep it in cash or find low risk investments such as Premium Bonds.</p>
<h2>Know your financial goals</h2>
<p><a>New parents should be naturally more cautious with their money</a>, as there could be unexpected expenditures associated with a growing family.</p>
<p>Taking less risk to make sure the money is secure, at least for the first few years, might be advisable, particularly if you are already unable to save much extra from your earnings.</p>
<h2>Always have one eye on retirement</h2>
<p>Although the advice is to start saving into a pension from a young age, most of the time we <a>do not start saving until our 40s</a>. But the power of compounding returns means the more you can save early, the bigger the reward later in life.</p>
<h2>Do not become too cautious at retirement</h2>
<p><a>Someone in their 50s or 60s may live another 30 or 40 years</a>, yet many around this time decide to take less risk as their pot grows larger and they get closer to retirement</p>
<h2>Enjoy yourself in your retirement</h2>
<p>While investing might be something you are looking at, remember to enjoy the money you have worked hard to earn.</p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, found on average that people draw down just 31pc of their <a>wealth between age 70 and 90</a>, a rate of about 1pc a year.</p>
<header> <h1> How to cut your energy bill by making these small changes </h1> <p> A few small changes to your home could cut your energy bill </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 14 December 2021 • 3:39pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>British households face a surge in energy bills as a supply crunch has sent power prices soaring, but there are steps they can take to cut the costs of the looming bleak winter.</p>
<p>Here are some of the steps you can take, how much you could save, and the pitfalls to avoid. </p>
<h2>Consider a smart meter</h2>
<p>However, <a>the devices have proved controversial</a>. Some people are uncomfortable having their energy use tracked and have questioned how much money the meters really save, given bills have increased to pay for the smart meter rollout.</p>
<p>The devices themselves have also been prone to issues. First-generation meters can lose their functionality when a customer switches supplier, effectively rendering the devices useless. </p>
<h2>Improve your insulation</h2>
<p>Changes to your home to improve its heat retention could shave hundreds of pounds from your energy bill this winter.</p>
<p>According to My Utility Genius, a comparison site, around 35pc of heat in an average semi-detached house is lost through its walls. Properly installed cavity wall insulation can save up to 15pc on heating costs. </p>
<p>In an uninsulated home, almost a quarter of heat is lost through the roof. Loft or roof insulation could save up to £175 on the average bill, the comparison site said. </p>
<p>Insulating floors, by filling in gaps below skirting boards can reduce heat loss by up to 10pc, cutting £60 from the typical energy bill.</p>
<h2>Should you switch to a heat pump?</h2>
<p>However, savings vary depending on the age and style of households' existing boiler. While heat pumps are four times as efficient as traditional boilers, they are usually powered by electricity, which is much more expensive than gas or oil.</p>
<a>a Government grant designed to promote the use of renewable heating</a>. The scheme provides quarterly payments for seven years based on the amount of renewable heat produced and is open for applications until March 2022.
<p>Some energy firms offer schemes that help meet the upfront costs of fitting a heat pump in exchange for the quarterly subsidies. </p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of heat pumps has been questioned. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the pumps were "still in their infancy", while traditional boilers had been "refined over many years".</p>
<p>Chris Stark of the Climate Change Committee, a trade body, has called for policy changes to make heat pumps a more realistic proposition for households.</p>
<h2>How much would solar panels save you?</h2>
<p>Customers with solar-panelled homes can shop around for the best price for the energy they generate, as the rates paid vary between energy providers.</p>
<p>Savings on annual energy bills for the average British home installing solar panels vary between £95 and £234 depending on energy use, according to the Energy Saving Trust, but there are regional variations.</p>
<p>Savings are lowest in Stirling, from £90 where a household uses energy only from 6pm, to £220 where energy is used all day. In London the range of savings rises to between £100 and £240 per year.</p>
<h2>Be mindful of your appliances </h2>
<p>On average, British homes have 10 unused items plugged in and switched on at any one time, according to energy firm Utilita.</p>
<p>A TV left on standby all year adds £16 a year to a household's electricity bill, while a printer or scanner adds £6.50. The amount per appliance is relatively small, but quickly adds up when multiple appliances are left on.</p>
<h2>Should you get a fixed-term or variable tariff?</h2>
<p>The energy crisis has turned the market on its head. Once cheaper fixed-term deals are now far more expensive than suppliers' default tariffs.</p>
<p>If your supplier collapses and you are moved to a new supplier, you may want to shop around for a better deal. Be very careful though, as suppliers may not advertise their cheapest.</p>
<p>Customers automatically move on to standard variable tariffs, also known as default tariffs, when their fixed-term deals come to an end.</p>
<p>While they are usually the most expensive deals, they are protected by Ofgem's "energy price cap", which limits how much suppliers can charge. This has been set at £1,277 since October 1 2021. </p>
<p>Many <a>suppliers have stopped advertising these deals on their websites</a> and hiked the price on fixed-term tariffs.This means energy customers could unwittingly lock themselves into contracts, spending hundreds of pounds more than they need to.</p>
<p>Instead, simply letting a fixed-term deal end and moving on to a default tariff could be the cheaper option.</p>
<header> <h1> How to supercharge your pension when you hit 50 </h1> <p> There are two investment trust favourites for 50-year-old investors, experts say </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:11pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Life begins at 50, or so they say, but whether you plan to keep working for decades or hang up your tie at 55, it’s a good time to take stock of your retirement savings. </p>
<p>With just five years to go until your personal pension is unlocked, it is important to make sure it is invested wisely. The way you invest will be largely determined by when and how you plan to draw on those savings. </p>
<a>take their tax-free cash at 55</a> but leave the rest untouched for 10 years should continue to look for investments with long-term growth potential but recognise that their risk appetite was probably diminishing. 
<p>However, Dan Lane of Freetrade, a stockbroker and personal pension (Sipp) provider, warned against taking too risk-averse an approach, as many investors do when they start to near retirement. </p>
<a>last-minute stock market dip</a> would punish their pot. But you do still need enough of a growth engine there to power you through the line and provide capital growth even in retirement,” he said. 
<p>“You will still need growth but protection becomes incredibly important as soon as you have no other income sources,” he said. </p>
<p>Investment trusts (funds listed on the stock market) that tick these boxes include Personal Assets and RIT Capital Partners, according to both Mr Lane and Mr Khalaf. </p>
<p>“That diversification and focus on capital preservation meant a much lower fall for its investors, relative to the plummeting British stock market index, the FTSE All-Share,” he added.</p>
<p>There may be less of a chance to shoot the lights out but that protection against losses becomes <a>increasingly valuable</a> as investors near retirement, he said.</p>
<p>“The real draw here is in the full extent of the portfolio. We never can tell where the next shock will come from so having such wide diversification all in one place can be a prudent way to prepare for the unexpected,” he added.</p>
<p>“Later on in your 50s you might also start to gradually build up some cash in the pension ready for the point at which you withdraw your 25pc tax-free lump sum.”</p>

<header> <h1> Want to retire at 55? Here’s how big your pension needs to be </h1> <p> Retiring early is a pipe dream for those who don’t plan ahead and save diligently </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:13am </time> </div> </div>
<p>A comfortable retirement is the goal for most who actively monitor their pensions and save regularly. The trouble is, it can be hard to know how much you will need.</p>
<p>The state pension starts to pay out at 66, which means anyone finishing work at 55 would have more than a decade to wait. They would need to substitute the £9,350 a year with money from their own personal and workplace pensions. </p>
<p>Based on this, a pension pot of £800,000 would provide an income of £33,600 each year until the age of 91.</p>
<p>Even with a final goal in mind, it can be tricky to know if you are on track to reaching that target by 55. </p>
<p>By age 45, their pension would have grown to £500,000 and they would have £25,000 in their Isa, not including investment returns.</p>
<p>The closer to retirement, the more workers tend to put away into their nest eggs. </p>
<p>A 50-year-old earning £40,000 would need to pay 20pc of their income into their pension, and have amassed a pension worth £650,000, with £25,000 in an Isa. This would allow them to reach £790,000 within five years.</p>
<p>However, a <a>50-year-old on higher earnings</a> of £75,000 a year, also contributing 20pc, would only need £475,000 in their pension and £100,000 in their Isa.</p>
<p>Carla Morris, of Brewin Dolphin, said anyone planning to retire early would need to ensure they had made informed financial decisions, which include maximising their pension contributions and saving prudently.</p>
<p>Those who fall short of the large pension required should consider working longer. By working five years extra until age 60, a pension pot can last almost 20 years more, she said. </p>
<h2>What about a moderate lifestyle?</h2>
<p>The “comfortable” standard of living is the highest echelon, according to the PLSA, but a "moderate" lifestyle would still be enough for a holiday in Europe for two weeks a year and eating out a few times a month.</p>
<p>This would require an income of £20,800 a year for a single person – or an additional £11,000 in personal pension money once the state pension age is reached.</p>
<p>According to Brewin Dolphin, a saver would need £410,429 in their pension by age 55 to be able to afford this standard of living without running out of money before 91. </p>
<p>A 50-year-old earning £40,000 would need to have already saved £300,000 and start contributing 20pc into their pension each year. They would also need a £25,000 Isa.</p>
<p>A phased retirement could offer a good compromise, she added, and working part time can reduce some of the pressure on pensions, which would only need to top up a lower income level rather than immediately replace all earnings.</p>

<p>Our tax system is far too complicated, but I’m afraid we are stuck with it until politicians genuinely grasp the nettle of simplification, and they seem to have other matters on hand at the moment.</p>
<p>So what is coming before then?</p>
<h2>1) Greater scrutiny of the self-employed</h2>
<p>In advance of Making Tax Digital the Government wants to ensure those <a>entering self-employment</a> or becoming new landlords are identified early. Currently their obligation is to notify HM Revenue Customs when they have a tax liability.</p>
<h2>2) Earlier tax collection</h2>
<a>collecting tax earlier</a>. As the document says: ”timely payment refers to bringing the calculation and payment of tax closer to the point where the income or profit arises”. 
<p>Although this is just a consultation at this stage, for a Government short of money it <a>must be tempting to press ahead</a> and raise funds sooner.</p>
<h2>3) Penalties for Isa misuse</h2>

<header> <h1> How to beat inheritance tax by rewriting your will </h1> <p> Death tax to hit record high £6bn </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Harry Brennan <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:11pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Britons paid £5.4bn in death duties last year and the state haul from the divisive 40pc duty is forecast to hit a record £6bn this year, before rising further still to £6.6bn in 2026. </p>
<p>Booming house prices, frozen tax breaks and coronavirus deaths have caused a spike in the number of people who pay. In five years the number of families hit by the tax is expected to increase by around three fifths. </p>
<p>However, there is a way to beat the taxman from beyond the grave. </p>
<h2>What is a 'deed of variation'?</h2>
<p>A deed of variation - or DOV - is a legal document that allows the beneficiaries of an estate – children, for example – to make changes to a will, in the name of the deceased, after their death.</p>
<a>40pc IHT applies</a> on your death – you can alter the deceased’s will so that money you stand to inherit passes directly to other beneficiaries, reducing or eliminating the amount of tax you would otherwise have to pay later.
<p>For example, you may want to redirect some of the money you stand to inherit to charity, or to your grandchildren via discretionary trust for their benefit later on. </p>
<p>If 10pc of an overall estate is gifted to charity, the rate of IHT paid is reduced by 4 percentage points to 36pc and all donations are tax free. </p>
<p>You can gift up to £325,000 into a trust before any tax is due, as long as you survive the gift for seven years. This solution is sometimes used by grandparents who wish to contribute to private school fees. </p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that there is a two-year window. Any deed of variation must be drawn up within 24 months of the death of the deceased, and must be signed by all the executors and beneficiaries of the estate to be valid.</p>
<p>A DOV is separate from a grant of probate – the legal document that allows you to gather up and distribute the assets of the deceased – and can be obtained before or after probate is granted.</p>
<p>There are no formal documents to apply for, you can simply write a letter explaining the changes you wish to make. However, you must ensure the letter meets certain conditions – HM Revenues Customs provides a checklist.</p>
<p>Provided everyone else involved agrees, you can redirect your inheritance to anyone you wish, even if they are not named in the deceased’s will.</p>
<p>Although you may be the one deciding what changes to make, through a DOV the changes are made in the name of the deceased as if they were making the changes themselves.</p>
<p>If a variation affects anyone under the age of 18, you will need court approval before making any changes.</p>
<h2>What if there is no will?</h2>
<p>When someone dies without <a>leaving a will</a>, their estate is passed on to their next of kin, usually a spouse or other immediate family member, in line with the so-called rules of intestacy.</p>
<p>However, the rules state that certain family members cannot inherit. Unmarried partners, step children, and other relatives and friends, irrespective of the role they played in the life of the deceased, will not be gifted anything.</p>
<p>A DOV can still be used if there is no will, allowing you to redirect money to other beneficiaries that would otherwise have been left with nothing.</p>

<header> <h1> How you can shield £975,000 from inheritance tax with this little-known trick </h1> <p> A little trick to shield even more from the taxman. You can even do it retrospectively </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Harry Brennan <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:13pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Thousands of people could be needlessly paying large inheritance tax (IHT) bills each year as a once widely-used tax loophole has been all but forgotten. </p>
<p>However, there are ways individuals can get almost the same amount of protection too.</p>
<a>additional IHT </a>allowance of £325,000, shielding even more from the taxman.
<p>Faye Silver of Raymond James, the wealth manager, said this would benefit people who had lost their partner but who could still remarry. </p>
<h2>How the inheritance tax trick works </h2>
<p>Margaret is married to Peter. Peter dies and some years later she marries John. There are no children involved, so the family home allowance does not apply.</p>
<p>Peter’s death leaves Margaret with his full basic allowance, giving her £650,000 of IHT protection. She puts the £650,000 into a discretionary trust for John. On her death, John can add this to his own £325,000 allowance.</p>
<p>John also ringfences his own allowance through a trust, so Margaret can add his £325,000 to her allowance if he were to die first. Now the surviving spouse will pass on £975,000 tax-free. </p>
<p>What is more, beneficiaries can use this tactic retrospectively. By using a legal document known as a deed of variation up to two years after death, families can alter a will to be more tax efficient.</p>
<p>Rachael Griffin of Quilter, another wealth manager, said such “little-known quirks in the tax system” were increasingly important as booming house prices push the death tax take to record highs. </p>
<p>“Navigating the tax system shouldn’t be akin to finding a needle in a haystack. People are entitled to use allowances, even if few people have heard of them,” she said.</p>

<p>To me, Fortnum Mason is synonymous with this time of year. Who would not want to find one of its traditional wicker hampers under the Christmas tree? (If my husband is reading this: hint, hint.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your efforts to spend your £100 e-voucher at its flagship store were seriously hampered, in the wrong way.</p>
<p>I got in touch with Fortnum’s on your behalf, and I am pleased to say it finally got its act together to organise your refund – and the equivalent deduction from your e-gift card.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas to you – and to all this column’s readers.</p>

<p>My dear friends and family even produced a spoof video for my big birthday earlier this month where they performed, to hilarious effect, excerpts from many of these favourites. It is a video to treasure.</p>
<p>So it was quite fitting that I took on the role of the Telegraph's Consumer Champion in March this year. I could finally do my own bit of sleuthing, and solve, on behalf of readers, a huge range of cases (no body bags involved, thankfully).</p>
<p>My investigations involved reuniting well over 100 readers with money that was lost, trapped in limbo, charged unfairly, stolen or owed in compensation for poor advice or service from banks and other financial organisations and retailers.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce I have won back approximately £1.9m fighting readers’ corners over the past nine months. That’s nearly £50,000 a week.</p>
<p>Behind every win there is often a story of anguish or heartache – or, at the very least, deep frustration with poor service.</p>
<p>With many of us spending more time at home alone during the pandemic, we became easier targets for fraudsters. They often masqueraded as people we usually trust implicitly, such as the police or our banks, or simply used slick sales techniques.</p>
<a>£100,000 house deposit stolen</a> by thieves who had intercepted their solicitor’s email, instructing them to change the bank account details for the payment. On my intervention, Nationwide returned the whole sum.
<a>£1.99 for a Corgi toy ice cream van</a>. I persuaded the Corgi Club to call off the hounds.
<a>insurance claim for her injured horse</a> turned down because provider Animal Friends excluded all incidents involving fences.
<p>I fully expect troubles with insurance claims to feature in this column in 2022.</p>
<a>the excuse of the pandemic</a> for providing poor service and delaying refunds when they are due – another major theme of 2021. This blight has been with us nearly two years and their systems and customer services should have adapted by now.
<p>With that word of warning, it’s time for me to say Merry Christmas to you all and go in search of a festive detective treat. Looks like the Death in Paradise Boxing Day special might be in order.</p>
