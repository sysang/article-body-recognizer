<p>Getting your hands on rapid antigen tests isn’t easy at the moment. Once you’ve got one, it’s important to know when and how to register the result it delivers.</p>
<div>A walk after a big meal is great for your gut – but timing matters</div>
<p>A walk after a heavy meal is a good move, but it’s best to wait an hour or so before heading for the door.</p>
<p>The winner here is our levels of blood glucose which rise after a meal and reach a peak about an hour after eating, explains researcher Dr Evelyn Parr from the Australian Catholic University’s Exercise and Nutrition Research Program.</p>
<p>Walking after eating a big meal at night may be better still, Dr Parr adds.</p>
<p>“The closer we get to the evening, the less efficient our bodies are at using insulin to deal with blood glucose, making it harder to keep blood glucose levels healthy. Yet this is when we have our biggest meal of the day.”</p>
<p>Research into whether the optimal time for exercise is morning or evening have had mixed results, but her gut feeling is that evenings might be better in terms of managing blood glucose.</p>
<p>So why do healthy levels of blood sugar matter so much?</p>
<p>Walking after a big meal is kind to the gut too. It stimulates gut movement so that both food and gas get through the gut more quickly, says Professor Jane Andrews of the Gastroenterological Society of Australia.</p>

<div>Shed those pesky Christmas kilos? Forget about it</div>
<div><div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Shed those pesky Christmas kilos? Forget about it</h1></div><div><div><div><h5>Sarah Berry</h5>Lifestyle Health Editor</div><div> <span><time>December 29, 2021 — 11.00am</time></span></div></div></div></div>
<p>With the festive overindulgence box checked, it’s time to roll out the annual “new year, new you” story – a narrative that typically involves how to shed those pesky Christmas kilos.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you’ll be a smiling, leaping, hair-flicking image of weight-loss joy. And that is because weight loss makes us happy, right? At least, that’s what the advertisements keep telling me.</p>
<p>I get it. A third of Australians are obese and there is some good evidence that weighing yourself daily may help prevent holiday weight gain and can be a key strategy for maintaining weight loss.</p>
<p>But here is what irks me about these stories. Firstly, they fail to consider that such advice can be hugely problematic for some people.</p>
<p>Eating disorder participants in one study from 2020, expressed similar psychology. They had significantly more anxiety and weight preoccupation when the number on the scale was tracked via daily weigh-ins.</p>
<p>A study following almost 2000 overweight or obese participants over four years found those who lost at least 5 per cent of their body weight were significantly worse off psychologically than those whose weight remained the same.</p>
<p>Inadequate nutrition can activate the release of stress hormones like cortisol and impact both mood and cognitive function.</p>
<p>Herein lies the third problem which can help to explain the second: the focus is all wrong.</p>
<p>A 2020 study of participants who were overweight found those with better body image and subjective wellbeing were more likely to report being happy, regardless of their age, gender, or weight.</p>

<div>A mindset coach, dietitian and gym founder on their top habits for 2022</div>
<p>After a difficult 2021, many of us are entering 2022 with a sense of trepidation (hello, Omicron) but also hope — surely, surely this year will be a better one.</p>
<p>We are the stories we tell ourselves, so a simple mindset habit I wish for the world in 2022 is learning how to hold our ground and own our story.</p>
<p>The antidote to this is horizontal relationships, where everyone is equal. When we are “enough” we don’t compare or judge ourselves as better or worse, and can accept and even celebrate (rather than berate) ourselves.</p>
<p>A mojo mantra (also called a courage mantra) can help us do this. It helps to cement your sense of self and can be as simple as three words. To find yours, start by answering three questions:</p>
<li>When does this happen? Is it when I walk into a room and feel people judging me? Is it when I feel like I can’t do something? Or is it when I feel I’m losing control of a situation? For me it’s often when I feel judged.</li>
<li>What can I say to myself in real time to “own my story” and hold my ground against the distractions of the outside world? This is the fun bit where we get to create our mojo mantra.</li>
<p>A mantra could be as simple as “I’m imperfect but I’m worthy”. Or “I’m a warrior not a worrier”.</p>
<p>Mantras don’t have to be overly serious. The mantra I used most during 2021 lockdowns was “You can’t make this shit up”, which always made me smile.</p>
<p>My favourite mantra was Emily Seebohm’s, who I worked with in 2019, leading up to the Tokyo Olympics. She would write three words: “I am enough.” These three words can change your life.</p>
<p>Dietitian also known as @nude_nutritionist</p>
<p>Rather than starting a new diet or giving up sugar in 2022, what’d happen if we instead resolved to give up food guilt and body hate?</p>
<p>When I was a dieter, I was either eating sad salads or ice cream straight from the tub. I was all-or-nothing. Denying myself chocolate only led to binge-eating Nutella straight from the jar.</p>
<p>We often think we need to punish ourselves to be healthier (further adding to our already overwhelming to-do list), but what if practising self-compassion can actually help us be healthier?</p>
<p>2021 was a binfire of a year but my relationship with food and my body doesn’t have to be in 2022. Instead of counting almonds or macros, I’ll be counting happy memories.</p>
<p>Founder of Body Fit Training</p>
<p>The year 2021 was a strange one for all of us. Mine was made even stranger when I had to have appendix and hernia surgery, closely followed by epidural and cortisone injections into my spine. Looking after <i>me</i> is key for this year.</p>
<i>move</i> as opposed to needing what I perceived was a “valuable”, body-thrashing workout.
<p>It’s also easy to find reasons not to make a planned, gruelling 60-minute workout. But I can always find the time to walk or stretch at home for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So how do you achieve this? I am still working on this myself, but here’s what I’m doing:</p>
<li>Make the activities a priority. Put them in your diary like you would with any other appointment, so you’ve blocked out that time.</li>
<li>Make it fun. Exercise should be enjoyed or at least mindful. Give yourself that window to shut off the work thoughts and the daily buzz, and make some space for yourself. Focus on your breathing, how the movement feels and just letting things be.</li>

<div>A scientist’s ‘diversity diet’ may be the secret to great gut health</div>
<p>“I call it the Diversity Diet, it’s based on facts, not fads,” Dr Rossi explains. It couldn’t be timelier: 70 per cent of our immune system lives in the gut, and strengthening that is also crucial to fighting off COVID.</p>
<p>Dr Rossi started sharing her ideas via social media and was “blown away by the interest” - especially when she noticed her followers included Jamie Oliver and Davina McCall.</p>
<p>She wants us to all be eating 30 different types of plant a week, which she refers to as “plant points”, to ensure that different types of gut bacteria are nourished, multiply, and knock out unhealthy bacteria.</p>
<p>“This is not about a boring diet,” she says. “The more variety we introduce, the tastier the meal, and ultimately the better we feel.”</p>
<p>Dr Rossi isn’t pro-vegan either. “The science doesn’t support that being healthy, necessarily,” she says. “The processed mock meats and fake cheeses have the plants’ health benefits stamped out of them.”</p>
<p>Swapping more in is remarkably easy, she adds. “Have barley or oats rather than wheat, for example. Buy frozen or tinned legumes, vegetables and fruits to widen the variety.”</p>
<p>One of the benefits of plant-based eating, she says, is that you can easily reach your weight goals without dieting. But nuts and avocados are full of calories, so how does that square up?</p>
<p>Hers is not a fad diet, she reinforces. “It’s about tapping into the latest scientific discoveries about how our bodies, and gut bacteria, work best.”</p>
<p>Eat More, Live Well is published by Penguin Life.</p>
<div>Diets make you feel bad. Try training your brain instead</div>
<p>Here’s a New Year’s resolution you can keep: Stop dieting and start savouring your food instead.</p>
<h3>The case against restrictive diets</h3>
<h3>How eating habits are formed</h3>
<p>Brewer notes that eating behaviours, such as absent-mindedly snacking on potato chips or binging on dessert, are often the result of habit loops that get reinforced over time.</p>
<p>Here are two simple exercises from Brewer’s Eat Right Now program to get you started.</p>
<p>Begin with a premeal warm-up</p>
<li>Now think about what triggers this behaviour. Is it an emotion, such as anger or stress, or are you rewarding yourself with a treat? Or it could be a situation, such as watching television or grocery shopping when you’re hungry.</li>
<p>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p>
<div>Chocolate? Chips? Pizza? How to own your cravings</div>
<p>Food cravings are a normal part of the human experience; studies show that more than 90 per cent of people have them. (In fact, who are those unicorns who’ve never had cravings?)</p>
<p>But how we deal with cravings can vary widely. Some people eat what they want and don’t worry about it, whereas others feel controlled by cravings and end up binging on favourite foods.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution for people who struggle with cravings?</p>
<p>But increasingly, studies show that constant restriction and attempts at distraction can actually backfire for people who struggle with cravings and binge eating.</p>
<h3>How dieting can make cravings worse</h3>
<p>After 10 days, everyone was asked to send a photo of their chocolate box. The dieters had pilfered significantly more of the chocolates than those who weren’t counting calories.</p>
<h3>Acceptance vs. distraction</h3>
<p>“Surprisingly, there was a large benefit in people’s quality of life that was somewhat unexpected,” Forman said. “It benefited their well-being and emotional state, too.”</p>
<h3>How to cope with cravings</h3>
<p>Try these acceptance and mindfulness techniques to focus on food cravings.</p>
<p>Practice “urge surfing”</p>
<p>– Identify your craving. Use the phrase, “I’m having the urge to eat …” and fill in the blank.</p>
<p>– Observe it. Notice how you feel as you crave the food. Do you feel it in your stomach? Are you distracted? Anxious? Do you feel the need to move or keep visiting the kitchen?</p>
<p>– Be open. Don’t try to suppress or get rid of your craving. Accept the experience.</p>
<p>– Pay attention to what happens next. Notice the urge as it rises, crests, falls and subsides. Note the intensity of a craving. “I’m having the urge to eat potato chips. It started as a 5, but now it’s a 7.”</p>
<p>Ask: How little is enough?</p>
<p>Find a bigger, better offer</p>
<p>Another strategy to deal with a craving is to focus on how a food tastes and makes you feel and then replace a problem food with a higher-quality food that satisfies the same urges. Brewer calls this “finding a bigger, better offer.”</p>
<p>“Cutting ourselves off is not the way to go,” Brewer said. “We don’t want to live this austere life of not enjoying foods that taste good.”</p>

<div>What 10 days of clean eating actually does to your body</div>
<p>Four days in, however, and your body’s systems will have adjusted. You may find you have better concentration and energy.</p>
<p>The physical consequences of heavy alcohol use, such as liver damage and high blood pressure, are well known. But can there be any impact on those areas after just ten days of abstinence?</p>
<p>These are just short-term effects, which are outweighed by the long-term impact on overall health from cutting out or down on refined sugars; from weight loss to better gut health.</p>
<p>“Refined and added sugars, on the other hand, may lead to a higher risk of health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.”</p>
<p>Your taste buds will also change, as zinc, found in oysters, beef and crab, helps to boost tastebuds. Fortified cereals, yoghurt, cashews and oatmeal are some of the vegetarian-friendly foods that can help up your zinc intake.</p>
<p>You may notice some weight loss; studies show that people who stick with a vegetarian diet consume less fatty food, and are thinner than people who eat meat.</p>
<p>Ten days is too soon to know, but there’s evidence that the world’s longest-living people are found in plant-based diet communities.</p>
<p>There are no quick fixes and shortcuts to a fitter body, but after 10 days of taking up exercise, Dean Hodgkin, personal trainer and head of programming at leading community wellness and fitness app Truconnect by tv.fit says strength can improve.</p>
<p>“Although this is as a result of neurological adaptations rather than muscle gains. The individual motor units within your muscles quickly learn to work in synchronicity, resulting in the muscle fibres generating more force.”</p>
<p>Recent research suggests just a single bout of exercise can positively impact your mood status. After 10 days you will have reduced your stress levels, helping to lower the risk of slipping into depression.</p>
<p>“As soon as you begin working out, blood flow to your brain will increase, helping your brain cells to function more efficiently. It’s common to feel more alert during exercise and more focused afterwards.”</p>
<h3>HOW TO STICK TO YOUR HEALTH RESOLUTIONS</h3>
<p>There are three important elements to successfully sticking to any resolution:</p>
<p>YOUR ‘HOW’It’s all now about the action. Plan your gym classes, get that gym kit out or change into it before leaving work. How exactly are you going to make this happen? Get a friend with similar intentions and do it together.</p>

<p>As much as 40 per cent of the population suffers from a sleep disorder, and they affect both our health and life-span. But there are effective ways to prevent and treat them.</p>

<p>Advances in medical research offer new evidence that daylight saving time could be harmful – and governments overseas are taking note.</p>
<div>Eat your way to a better night’s sleep</div>
<p>As a sleep-deprived nation, where one in three of us suffers from poor sleep, we will do anything for some decent shuteye; the global sleep market is now worth $116 billion.</p>
<p>But what if instead of buying weighted blankets and sleep trackers, rethinking the supermarket shop could be the key to buying your way to a better kip?</p>
<p>New research shows that what we eat can have a significant effect on the quality of our sleep.</p>
<p>Rob Hobson, nutritionist and author of The Art of Sleeping, is unsurprised by the study’s findings: “People who eat more fruit and vegetables generally have a healthier life overall.</p>
<p>“They’re probably eating less sugar and drinking less alcohol. What’s more, many plant-based foods contain nutrients shown to help with sleep such as magnesium, tryptophan and B6.”</p>
<p>Here, he guides us through which foods harm and which help your sleep – and why.</p>
<h3>Foods that harm your sleep</h3>
<p>White sugar, fizzy drinks and desserts</p>
<p>One study showed that high sugar consumption led to less deep sleep and more wakefulness.</p>
<p>Sugar might also inhibit sleep as it causes the release of a hormone called norepinephrine that can stimulate the brain.</p>
<p>Everyone should watch their red meat intake. Going for poultry (chicken or turkey) would make your evening meal slightly healthier.</p>
<p>Cheese and yoghurt (high fats)</p>
<h3>Foods that help you sleep</h3>
<p>The health benefits have been widely researched, and a Mediterranean diet has been shown to help in all areas of health.</p>
<p>Essentially, it involves a high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals, a moderate intake of fish, a low to moderate intake of dairy foods and a low intake of beef and poultry.</p>
<p>It also means a high ratio of monounsaturated fats to saturated flats; they can be found in olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds.</p>
<p>A combination of tryptophan-rich foods teamed with carbohydrates may provide the perfect evening meal. Example dinners include turkey stir-fry with white rice, salmon with white pasta and pesto, and veggie chilli with rice or quinoa.</p>
<p>Ironically, white carbohydrates are better than wholegrain ones in supporting tryptophan transfer because they’re broken down more quickly, and the release of insulin is more rapid.</p>

<div>Does smiling really make you look younger?</div>
<p>Many believe that smiling takes years off your appearance by conveying a youthful joie de vivre.</p>
<p>However, a study has found that smiling actually makes people look older, unless they are over 60, in which case the wrinkles have set in and it makes little difference.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists showed participants hundreds of photographs of faces of people aged between 20 and 80, either smiling or with a neutral expression, and were asked to estimate their age.</p>
<p>Only when the participants were shown cropped photographs, depicting just the eyes of the older people, did they think they look older when smiling.</p>
<p>He added that faces contain “an amazing number” of social cues.</p>
<p>“Among the many critical dimensions that people readily extract from faces, age is often considered as primary,” Mr Goodale said.</p>
<p>“Accurate identification of a person’s age is crucial for understanding social roles and determining the nature of social interaction.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Accurate identification of a person’s age is crucial for understanding social roles and determining the nature of social interaction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This may also be explained by a difference in smile-related wrinkles.</p>
<p>Researchers also suggested that it could be down to the gender differences in lifestyle and skin care that could affect facial wrinkling.</p>
<p>Mr Goodale said: “Not only do middle-aged men have more wrinkles than middle-aged women - the prominence of those wrinkles around the eyes increases more when middle-aged men smile than it does when middle-aged women smile.”</p>
<p>The findings suggest wrinkles around the eyes are a key cue for the perception of age.</p>
<p>“These findings are particularly relevant in the time of COVID-19 when so many people are wearing masks, leaving only our eyes visible,” added Mr Goodale.</p>
<p>The study was conducted with Tzvi Ganel from Ben-Gurion University in Israel and published in Scientific Reports. It follows a similar study undertaken in 2018 which also debunked the theory that smiling can take years off your appearance.</p>
<p>The same scientists published a paper saying that the belief “well-rooted in media” was “a complete misconception”. They said the misplaced belief was causing social media users to post ageing photos of themselves online.</p>
<p>Prof Ganel said: “Our results make it clear that the same person can believe that smiling makes one appear younger, but at the same time judge smiling faces as older than neutral faces.</p>
<p>“Popular media promotes the idea that smiling makes you look younger: look at the smiling faces in skincare and dental ads. How many of us post smiling faces on social media?”</p>
<p>The results contradict a 2011 study, published in Psychology and Aging, in which the participants guessed the ages of people who were smiling as being two years younger than the same individuals photographed with other expressions.</p>

<h3><a>One-in-20 Queensland Health staff off work as Omicron wave bites</a></h3>

<h3><a>More than 7000 COVID-19 cases in aged care as hundreds of homes locked down</a></h3>

<p>The vast majority of the 500 aged care homes hit by active COVID-19 outbreaks have not received an infection control spot check from the regulator in the past six months.</p>
<h3><a>Aged care booster shots slowed as Omicron took off over Christmas</a></h3>
<p>The surge workforce employed by the Morrison government to deliver COVID-19 booster vaccines in aged care across Australia slowed its work dramatically just as Omicron gathered speed.</p>
<div><h5>Opinion</h5><h5><a>Coronavirus pandemic</a></h5></div>
<h3><a>Help needed to keep COVID-19 out of aged care</a></h3>
<p>The aged care sector has done an extraordinary job of protecting vulnerable older people during the pandemic, but government support is needed to keep COVID-19 out of residential care.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of aged care homes around country yet to get vaccine boosters</h3>
<p>Hundreds of nursing homes around Australia are yet to get booster COVID-19 vaccine shots, but Health Minister Greg Hunt says the program is “ahead of schedule”.</p>
<div><h5><a>Coronavirus pandemic</a></h5></div>
<h3><a>COVID outbreaks lock down nearly 500 aged care homes nationally</a></h3>

<p>There were 652 active COVID-19 cases in residents of NSW aged care facilities by Tuesday, an increase of nearly 100 in four days.</p>
<h3>Visitors to aged care facilities struggle with rapid test shortages</h3>

<div>Having to sell your home to pay for aged care is a myth</div>
<p>It is remarkable the number of people who believe that you have to sell your home when you move into aged care.</p>
<p>When questioned about who will force the sale, they generally say either the government or the aged-care home will make them sell.</p>
<p>However, having to sell your home is an aged-care myth. Whether you choose to sell to pay for your aged care is totally up to you.</p>
<p>While selling might be the right decision eventually, there are a few things you should consider first.</p>
<p>For the purposes of calculating how much you can contribute towards your aged-care costs, the value of your home is capped at $175,239 (unless a “protected person” lives there, in which case it is exempt).</p>
<p>The value of your home also receives special treatment in calculating your age pension.</p>
<p>For the pension assets test, the full value of your home is exempt from assessment for two years from the date you or your partner leave (whichever is later).</p>
<p>Beyond two years, the home is assessed at market value, but your pension assessment changes from a homeowner to a non-homeowner, giving you a higher threshold.</p>
<p>While the asset value of the home receives special treatment for pension and aged care means testing, it is important to know that if you receive rent from the home, it is assessable income for both the pension and aged-care means tests.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you can keep the main residence Capital Gains Tax exemption on your home for six years after moving into aged care – if the property is rented – and potentially beyond this, if it does not produce income.</p>
<p>Be careful though, as the tax implications for you and those who stand to inherit the home are complex and warrant seeking specialist financial advice.</p>
<p>So, with all these special concessions, why are many people so quick to sell their home before moving into aged care?</p>
<p>Typically, the answer is cash flow and a lack of liquid funds.</p>
<p>When this is added to the basic daily fee, means-tested care fee plus any additional services, you can easily be looking at an annual cost of $50,000 or more.</p>
<p>If you have a home and a small amount of money in the bank, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that you have to sell it.</p>
<p>However, for all the reasons listed above as well as the potential impact on your estate planning wishes, it is crucial to crunch all the numbers to assess your personal circumstances before deciding whether to sell your home.</p>
<p>The treatment of your home is unique from any other asset and, once it is sold, it’s too late to change your mind.</p>

<div>Why more Aussies are rethinking the ink</div>

<p>This shouldn’t surprise us, said Fields: “Neuroscientists have studied neurons for over a century, but they are playing catch-up with glia.”</p>

<div>A quest to uncover how to spend the final year of your 30s</div>
<p>I turned 39 and suddenly, a milestone was rolling towards me. I felt this creeping yet seductive urge to do something meaningful with it.</p>
<p>So, I asked my immediate elders – those aged 40 and older – two questions to help shape my final year of this decade.</p>
<p>What are they grateful they did while in their 30s? And is there anything they wish they’d done?</p>
<p>Travis de Jonk, features editor at magazine Sydney Sentinel, was so conscious of the milestone, he wrote a 40 by 40 bucket list: 40 activities to do before he reached the big four-oh.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old appreciated the deadline compelling him to act. “To me life is this amazing race against time to experience all the wonder within it,” he says.</p>
<p>That attitude comes from a near-death experience in Victoria when he was 13. “The family car slid off an 80-foot cliff at Mount Buller,” he says. “It’s miraculous we survived. It was a crystallising moment.”</p>
<p>The list includes experiences such as the Burning Man festival, publicly performing in drag and eloping with his now-husband.</p>
<p>He’s most grateful he made the trek to climb a New Zealand glacier. “Here was this ice, melting. It put me in the centre of something I didn’t previously understand on that level: climate change.”</p>
<p>Also, paragliding. “That was about facing a fear, and trust,” he says. “I had to accept the instructor’s direction: ‘Whatever you do, don’t stop running; just jump off the cliff!’”</p>
<p>It became a fitting metaphor. “It made me think: what else am I capable of?”</p>
<p>And what does he wish he’d done? “Go for a fit and toned body,” he says. “That gets harder after 40, although it’s never too late to try.”</p>
