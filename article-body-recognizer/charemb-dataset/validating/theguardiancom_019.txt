<p>Well, I think that was the best episode of the series yet – some fiddly challenges, a healthy helping of innuendo and some trauma to round it all off. </p>
<p>That is gutting. I have loved Amanda right from the start. Always eternally positive, even when things aren’t going her way. Exceptional pun work and always up for subtly embarrassing her fellow bakers in front of the camera. A true Bake Off icon.</p>

<p>Having watched every season of both, twice, I was searching for new shows to fill the very specific voids left by each. I didn’t expect to find one show that fills both voids simultaneously, but here we are.</p>
<p>You also apparently don’t need cash prizes or any prizes at all. People will do it for a commemorative trophy, the vague possibility of a cookbook deal and the sheer love of baking.</p>
<p>The thing is though, it is about him. And I suspect every project he stars in moving forward will be about him too. He’s transcendent. So while you’re waiting with half the world to see what he does next, snack on The Great Canadian Bake Off.</p>
<h2>And we say a fond farewell to …</h2>
<a>Monica Galetti</a>, a judge on MasterChef: The Professionals.
<p>“During lockdown … we were all stuck at home making things over and over again,” said Galetti, “and [when watching the show] people were saying: ‘Oh I could make that.’ It was things we could all relate to at the time, the cooking!”</p>
<p>Its executive producer, David Ambler, said: “People really want to show off their food. You could say ‘it’s only cooking’ but the amazing thing about food is that everyone’s food story is unique to them and that’s something the audience relate to.</p>
<p>He said lockdown reinforced the fact there “is something primordial … in each plate of food; there is a story and an internal drama from the humblest food situation, whether it be chopping an onion or burning toast.”</p>
<p>The format airs in about 200 global territories, and Spain recognised the increased resonance food had during lockdown by creating MasterChef Seniors, which has been picked up by other countries.</p>
<p>He came up with the format in order to “democratise fine food” after a ribbing about British cuisine by the actor Mel Brooks.</p>
<p>MasterChef began on the BBC in 1990 and was rebooted in 2005. Then the most-cooked dish was pancetta-wrapped monkfish or chicken. Now Banijay says that veganism, “clever things done with eggs” and crispy fish and chicken skins are popular.</p>
<p>Ambler added: “The food constantly reinvents itself. We’re filming the amateur series at the moment [and] five of the dishes John [Torode] and Gregg [Wallace] had never seen before.”</p>
<a>a greater focus on sustainability</a>, with 75% of productions donating leftover food to charity, contestants using sustainable fish and reducing waste, and the German version using a 100% recycled set.
<p>Despite offering no formal prize, 1,700 contestants have taken part in UK versions of MasterChef and the show has created stars such as the Wahaca founder, <a>Thomasina Miers</a>, as well as spawning celebrity, professional and junior spin-offs.</p>
<p>Ambler said another version was “possibly in the pipeline” in the UK but not yet confirmed, while Randall revealed there were “some really exciting ideas” about a potential global iteration of the show and “untapped potential” for a teenage version.</p>
<p>Roddam would like to see the UK show scale up and use previous contestants as mentors. He also thinks MasterChef is “a little undervalued because it’s been around a long time.”</p>
<p>Not unlike a bowl of ripe bananas during a pandemic.</p>

<h2>Star Baker is … Chigs!</h2>
<p>“Julia changed the way Americans thought about food, fully and completely,” co-director Julie Cohen adds. “From the idea that the goal shouldn’t just be about speed and convenience, but deliciousness and the joy of creation.”</p>

<p>Sorry, I’ve been meaning to say goodbye for a while but I got completely absorbed by comments BTL. I think all seven stages of grief are visible down there.</p>
<p>That said, congratulations are certainly due to our three worthy finalists. They seem rather evenly matched so it could go in any of their favours. I, for one, can’t wait to see who wins that lovely plate.</p>
<p>See you next week, pals. Stay well x</p>
<h2>And the person leaving the tent is …</h2>
<p>A poignant final segment there. I reckon Crystelle’s nabbed her second Star Baker, narrowly squeezing out Chigs. That means it’s a battle between Giuseppe and Jürgen to stay, though. Does the handshake outweigh the technical win? What do we think?</p>
<section> <div> <div> <h2> <a>Most popular</a> </h2> </div> </div> </section>
<p>“I ain’t got a clue what I’m doing here, how has that happened? I’m so shocked, I don’t know what to say,” said Chigs after he found out he had made it through to the final last week. “I’m now kacking it.”</p>
<p>“He’s a pretty good climber actually,” said Joseph Helmore, manager at the centre. “All the staff know who he is, he’s really good at talking to folk, and people recognise him a lot now, which is nice.”</p>
<p>“And he’s always smiling,” said her friend, Luke Bunn, 20.</p>
<p>He also said it was nice to see someone take something positive out of a tough year, particularly as Leicester was hit hard with Covid, enduring England’s longest lockdown.</p>
<p>“It’s something everyone has been through so we can all relate, and it’s good for Leicester as well as we were in lockdown longer than everywhere else,” said Wyeth.</p>
<p>“It’s always nice to see somebody from your home town doing well,” added Dye.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see somebody locally do so well and we’ve obviously got our fingers crossed for the final,” said Percy. “But regardless of what happens, it’s great to see somebody follow their dreams and show what you can achieve.”</p>
<p>She has always been a keen baker and was “chief taster” in her household when she was growing up, although only started baking seriously about three years ago.</p>

<p>It was a normal day like any other when female employees at Ford’s Dagenham plant, who felt increasingly frustrated by an unequal pay structure, walked out.</p>
<p>The strike, regarded as a watershed moment in the fight for equality, paved the way for the Equal Pay Act of 1970, and has been retold on stage and on screen including in the 2010 movie <a>Made in Dagenham</a>. </p>
<p>But the role of females working at Ford’s plant in Halewood on Merseyside, who downed tools in solidarity with their southern colleagues, has been largely overlooked. </p>
<p>Frances Kerwin is one of those forgotten heroines. She had only been working at Ford for two weeks when union conveners Bernard Passingham and Rose Boland paid Halewood a visit to discuss the strikes hundreds of miles away. </p>
<p>Asked if women had come a long way since then, she said “not really”, but pointed to the significance of tennis players winning the fight for equal pay.</p>
<p>“But young people are now saying: ‘They did that years ago, why can’t we do it?’”</p>
<p>In 1968, the female machinists at Ford were classified within the company pay structure as grade B. That meant they were officially unskilled, despite having to pass tests in order to gain their employment. </p>
<p>After years battling for recognition as skilled workers, they finally walked out, bringing car production to halt and becoming the focus of national news stories.</p>
<a>some of them even walked down the Baftas red carpet with British actor Gemma Arterton</a>, in support of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. These conversations, Kerwin said, are “definitely important”.
<p>She added: “Fifty years ago we were the minions. Women had to know their place.”</p>
<p>She said she was was infuriated when the Dagenham film came out and did not show the role of the women of the north. “The strike’s success would not have been possible without us. They would have been on their own,” she said.</p>
<a>local newspaper coverage</a>, he found them.
<p>“Without the stand taken by women working at Ford’s plants in Dagenham and Halewood in 1968, the Equal Pay Act would not have followed. The fight has not yet been won, but we owe them an awful lot,” he said.</p>
<p>Danielle Flynn, an apprentice from Jaguar Land Rover’s Halewood plant, thanked “these amazing women from the Halewood plant in its Ford era” for paving the way for women “to forge a successful career in a traditionally male-dominated industry”.</p>
<p>“Not only did the actions of the Ford sewing machinists initiate the 1970 Equal Pay Act but also a period of increased gender equality,” said Elaine Yerby, a senior lecturer at the Royal Docks School of Business and Law.</p>
<p>The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has apologised for comments she made to a <a>Channel 4</a> News producer about having a difficult childbirth.</p>
<p>The programme’s editor, Ben de Pear, later said he had complained to the MP and the <a>Labour</a> party. </p>
<p>Thomson tried to ask Siddiq about the case of Ahmad bin Quasem, a British-trained barrister in prison in Bangladesh, while she was at a rally in support of the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>Siddiq’s aunt is Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the prime minister of Bangladesh, and Channel 4 News said it had previously tried to contact the Labour MP about the case of Bin Quasem, who human rights organisations say was abducted by state security forces.</p>
<p>When questioned by Thomson, Siddiq repeatedly asked the reporter whether Bin Quasem was a citizen of Britain or a resident of Hampstead, of which he is neither.</p>
<p>“The fact that some members of my family are involved in politics in Bangladesh has long been a matter of public record which I have not hidden from. That said, I have no capability nor desire to influence politics in Bangladesh.”</p>

<p>Proxy voting will be introduced to the <a>House of Commons</a> on a one-year pilot, Andrea Leadsom has announced.</p>
<p>It follows an outcry over the lack of support for the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who delayed the birth of her son by two days to vote against Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement.</p>
<p>Despite initial indications that somebody would be allowed to vote in Siddiq’s place a week ago, the MP was subsequently told by the Conservatives she would have to go to Westminster in person if she wanted her voted to be recorded.</p>
<p>Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs that a motion approving the scheme would be on the order paper for approval by the house on Monday 28 January.</p>
<p>She said: “I am delighted to be able to confirm to the house today that a substantive motion on proxy leave in the case of maternity, paternity and adoption has been tabled today for the house’s agreement on Monday 28 January.</p>
<p>Siddiq, who was advised by doctors to have a caesarean section after complications in the birth of her first daughter, Azalea, voted in a wheelchair last week against May’s agreement.</p>
<p>A breakdown in trust over the pairing system for pregnant MPs and new mothers meant she wanted to attend the Commons in person or risk losing her vote on behalf of her constituents, 76% of whom voted remain.</p>
<p>Siddiq blamed the Conservatives, saying: “It is sad to learn that senior politicians are actively delaying proxy voting in order to gain a partisan advantage.”</p>
<p>She was pushed through the division lobbies in a wheelchair by Labour colleague Clive Lewis. The government lost by a record 230 votes.</p>
<p>Her son, Raphael Mujib St John Percy, was born on Thursday, two days after the vote.</p>
<p>Responding to the announcement, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn tweeted a photo of herself holding her son while watching Leadsom at the dispatch box.</p>
<a>#ProxyVoting</a> in the House of Commons. A really momentous (and overdue) change that I welcome,” she wrote.
<p>Leadsom made the announcement in a response to an urgent question tabled by Jo Swinson, who was excluded in a similar pairing row last summer. Swinson welcomed the announcement but said the situation Siddiq was put in last week was “shameful”. </p>
<p>The one-year pilot will be based on the <a>procedure committee report into proxy voting</a>.</p>
<p>The scheme will be available in cases of childbirth or care of an infant or newly-adopted child and will be administered by the Speaker, with the proxy vote cast by another member or a whip.</p>
<p>The change takes the form of a temporary standing order.</p>
<p>The pilot allows for the procedure committee to review the success of the scheme before the end of the pilot, after which it is hoped it can be rolled out on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>The full practical details of how the scheme will operate will be discussed by the house authorities and will be signed off by the Speaker as well as the leaders of the three largest political parties in the house.</p>
<p>MPs vote down EU withdrawal agreement in resounding defeat for prime minister</p>
<p>Theresa May has sustained the heaviest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister in the democratic era after MPs rejected her Brexit deal by a resounding majority of 230.</p>
<p>The prime minister immediately announced that she would welcome a vote of no confidence in her own government, and would make time for it on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, quickly confirmed he had tabled the motion, with the support of the leaders of all other opposition parties.</p>
<p>Brexit-supporting Conservatives joined with opposition parties and the DUP to trounce the government in the “meaningful vote”, which the prime minister delayed before Christmas in the vain hope of winning over waverers.</p>
<p>May began the eighth day of the Brexit debate by making a last-ditch plea to colleagues to support her, warning them not to break their promise to the British people to deliver Brexit.</p>
<p>“Together we can show the people we serve that their voices have been heard, that their trust was not misplaced.</p>
<a>to slam her painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement</a> in the House of Commons, it became clear that few had changed their mind – though whips urged MPs to abstain, rather than vote against the government.
<p>May herself embarked on a last-ditch charm offensive on Tuesday, holding meetings with MPs including the European Research Group’s Steve Baker, who said the pair had held a “constructive and substantial conversation about the future”.</p>
<p>Speaking just before the vote, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said “the prime minister has treated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative party, rather than the good of the whole country”.</p>
<p>He called the government’s efforts to steer Brexit through parliament “one of the most chaotic and extraordinary parliamentary processes” he had experienced in 35 years as an MP.</p>
<p>Both Labour and the Scottish National party withdrew amendments to the government’s motion at the last minute, to allow MPs a clean vote on the deal.</p>
<p>Just one amendment, tabled by the Brexiter John Baron and proposing a unilateral exit mechanism for the Irish backstop, was voted on and soundly defeated, by 600 votes to 24.</p>
<p>The publication on Monday of letters between May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, about the Irish backstop failed to win over Tory MPs who feared the UK could be trapped in a quasi-permanent customs union.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said: “We regret the outcome of the vote, and urge the UK government to clarify its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters descended on central <a>London</a> to demand a final say on the terms of the Brexit deal in one of the largest protests against leaving the European Union.</p>
<p>Organisers estimated a crowd of at least 670,000, a much larger turnout than the protests against Donald Trump and the 2011 anti-cuts march.</p>
<p>The People’s Vote march was due to set off at 12pm, but the crowd that gathered at Park Lane only began moving in earnest after 2pm because of the sheer number of people.</p>
<a>Brexit</a> actually have a say in what happens.”
<p>Axel Antoni, 44, a spokesperson for campaign group the3million, said: “It’s a very specific demand: we want a final say for all. The UK is our home. We are part of it. EU citizens didn’t even have a vote last time, we didn’t have a voice last time.”</p>
<p>Peter Andrews, who was among the 500 people to have travelled to London with the group Bath for Europe, said: “I believe leaving Europe is the stupidest idea I have ever come across. It will ruin my children’s future and it will ruin my future.”</p>
<p>Matthew Cooke, 28, who had come down from Scunthorpe with the Modern Union for a Changing World, described the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as “terrifying”.</p>
<p>The Labour MP <a>Chuka Umunna</a> criticised Brexiters who “have tried to smear us as some liberal metropolitan elite, when nothing could be further from the truth”.</p>
<p>The crowds began to disperse from 4pm. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said they were not aware of any disorder nor were there any significant arrests.</p>
<p>“And no penises,” Mountford chips in. As the pair dissolve into laughter, Horgan muses that, when it comes to the company name, “we should have a better story”.</p>
<p>Mountford agrees: “It felt like the right time to own things more creatively and more financially,” adding that, with a commission for a third series of Todd Margaret that became Merman’s first, “we hit the ground running”.</p>
<p>And as Mountford points out: “When branded content really nails it – be it through the idea, script or directing – that’s beautifully creative. It’s another way for writers and directors to make stuff and that can only be a good thing.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have an agenda, as such,” Mountford says. But, Horgan adds “It is significant in that we are working with a lot of female writers and female talent. But that’s probably because we’re drawn to them and they’re drawn to us.”</p>
<p>With ambition like that, little wonder that Merman is making a splash.</p>

<p>Becoming will be published globally in 24 languages on 13 November by Penguin Random House, which acquired world publishing rights to both Michelle and Barack Obama’s memoirs in a deal rumoured to be <a>worth $65m</a>.</p>
<p>Obama described writing her memoir as a “deeply personal experience”, and saidshe hoped her story would encourage others to become who they want to be. </p>
<p>The memoir will chronicle her life from a childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, as well as her time in the White House. </p>
<p>In a statement, she said: “Writing Becoming has been a deeply personal experience. It has allowed me, for the very first time, the space to honestly reflect on the unexpected trajectory of my life. </p>
<a>Penguin Random House</a> UK. In the US and Canada, it will be released by Crown Publishing Group.
<p>At the time of publication, Obama will embark on an international book tour, with details to be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>It is not, however, Obama’s first book. In 2012, <a>she released American Grown</a>, which focused on her White House kitchen garden and nutrition initiatives as first lady. </p>

<p>The German chancellor, once described by Forbes as the world’s most powerful woman, managed that for 13 years. She has been measured, cautious, methodical, pragmatic, sometimes maddeningly noncommittal and seemingly always in control.</p>

<p>For Jan-Werner Müller, professor of politics at Princeton university, many Germans saw Merkel as “an eminently reliable and highly analytical civil servant, not as a politician who has ever systematically staked out a vision for the country”.</p>

<p>These desperate measures aren’t just devised to avoid a pesky irritation. Some mosquitoes can transmit diseases, in Australia most commonly Ross River virus.</p>
<p>“We’ve had two years running when it’s been extremely wet and it’s situations like that when we have a greater risk of the really nasty mosquito-borne viruses, especially for south-eastern Australia.”</p>
<p>So, which of the myriad methods to avoid getting bitten actually work? And are there other safety concerns with those that do?</p>
<p>Deet is considered the most effective and long-lasting topical repellent, although many people are concerned about toxicity. While some studies have shown potential health impacts from using it, Deet is generally considered safe when used correctly.</p>
<p>Other studies report varying levels of protection using plant-based repellents, which contain phytochemicals that plants evolved as a defence mechanism. Generally, more research is needed into their efficacy.</p>
<p>An Australian study, from the University of Sydney and Westmead hospital, found that wristbands impregnated with botanicals could help deter some mosquito landings, but they were not as effective as Deet and would not protect your whole body.</p>
<p>If you don’t suffer from asthma, Williams says citronella or sandalwood coils or burners can help as a second line of defence outside. “I set them up as a kind of boundary, a barrier around the back deck.”</p>
<p>What about carnivorous plants? Sure, they might attack a few mosquitoes in the bedroom, “but if you’ve got 10,000 mosquitoes flying about, that’s not going to do much”, says Doggett.</p>
<p>For inside the home, some plug-ins claim to repel mozzies using sound, but Williams says there’s no evidence to support their effectiveness.</p>
<p>The humble household fan, on the other hand, is very helpful. “A fan will work because mosquitoes generally try to avoid the wind,” Williams says. “If you get above a certain wind speed they won’t be able to fly, so that will be an aid for sure.”</p>
<p>They also form a vital part of the food web, says Doggett. A world without mosquitoes would mean “there’s wholesale environmental damage”.</p>
<p>“If we didn’t have them, the world would be screwed.”</p>

<p>Lawyers are calling for stronger warnings on breast implants as government figures show at least 88 women in the UK have been diagnosed with cancer linked to the surgery.</p>
<p>A small number of women who have implants can develop a rare type of lymphoma known as Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).</p>
<a>breast implant register</a> was subsequently set up, but it is not mandatory and thousands of women are missing from it.
<p>She said patients who had had the implants faced a small risk and were not advised to have them removed. They should contact a doctor if they notice a sudden onset of swelling, a lump, and/or pain.</p>
<p>Medical device regulations do not currently require patients to be provided with written warnings of the possible adverse effects of breast implants, but clinicians have a legal obligation to discuss the potential risks with patients.</p>
<p>The number of women in temporary accommodation has increased by 88% over the last decade, according to research suggesting single mothers have been disproportionately affected by homelessness.</p>
<a>despite the extra help put in place during the pandemic</a>.
<p>Women have made up a disproportionate share of those in temporary accommodation as they are more often in lower-paid, less-secure work and likely to have caring responsibilities. </p>
<p>About 60% of the people in temporary accommodation in <a>England</a> are women. However, the sheer number of women requiring help is causing serious concern among homeless charities, with the increased cost of living pressures coming next year.</p>
<p>A series of in-depth interviews with 34 women and one non-binary person found a third of them had experienced domestic abuse, which often triggered their housing problems.</p>
<p>Some lone mothers said they did not seek help as they were worried about having their children removed. Others said that their housing benefit no longer covered their rent, as private rents have continued to increase.</p>
<p>Two-thirds said some professionals who dealt with their cases made them feel like a burden, with one woman describing feeling “fobbed off”. More than half the group said they did not know where to get help.</p>
<p>Toni, 38, from Birmingham, who was made homeless after a relationship breakdown, said she was having to live in unsuitable temporary accommodation full of mould and areas inaccessible to her disabled son.</p>
<a>“safe and appropriate” accommodation</a> to thousands of people sleeping rough - including those with restricted eligibility because of immigration status.
<a>Communities</a> said: “These figures reflect the increase in support for vulnerable groups which is preventing thousands of women from becoming homeless. However, we’re clear that temporary accommodation should only be a last resort.
<p>Sarah Weddington, an attorney who argued and won the <a>Roe v Wade</a> supreme court case which established the right to abortion in the US, has died. She was 76.</p>
<a>Roe v Wade</a>, fresh out of law school. She was my professor … the best writing instructor I ever had, and a great mentor.
<p>“At 27 she argued Roe to [the supreme court] (a fact that always made me feel like a gross underachiever). Ironically, she worked on the case because law firms would not hire women in the early 70s, leaving her with lots of time for good trouble.”</p>
<a>ruled on Roe v Wade</a> in 1973. Nearly 50 years later, under
<a>a supreme court</a> packed with hardline conservatives, the right Roe established is under threat in part thanks to
<a>a Texas law</a> that drastically restricts access and offers incentives for reporting women to authorities.
<a>speaking to the Guardian</a>, Weddington predicted such a turn of events. “If [Neil] Gorsuch’s nomination is approved, will abortion be illegal the next day? No. One new judge won’t necessarily make much difference. But two or three might.”
<p>After steering Gorsuch on to the court, Donald Trump installed Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett replaced the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights.</p>
<a>an evangelical Christian</a> and opponent of abortion. She
<a>died in 2017</a>. In a posthumous confession, she
<a>said</a> anti-abortion groups paid her to take such a stance.
<p>In her Guardian interview, Weddington said arguing the case in federal court “was like going down a street with no street lights. But there was no other way to go and I didn’t have any preconceived notions that I would not win.”</p>
<p>She did win, but the case continued.</p>
<a>Texas</a> legislature when the phone rang. It was a reporter from the New York Times. ‘Does Miss Weddington have a comment today about Roe v Wade?’ my assistant was asked. ‘Why?’ she said. ‘Should she?’
<p>“It was beginning to be very exciting. Then we got a telegram from the supreme court saying that <a>I had won 7-2</a> and that they were going to air-mail a copy of the ruling. Nowadays, of course, you’d just go online.</p>
<p>“I was ecstatic, and more than 44 years later we’re still talking about it.”</p>
<p>Weddington predicted: “Whatever else I do in my life, the headline on my obituary is always going to be ‘Roe v Wade attorney dies’.”</p>
<p>In fact she achieved much more, as Hays <a>detailed</a>. Weddington was “elected as the first woman from Travis county in the [Texas legislature] in 1972 (along with four other women: Kay Bailey, Chris Miller, Betty Andujar and Senfronia Thompson).</p>
<p>“She was general counsel of the United States Department of Agriculture under [Jimmy] Carter and enjoyed her stint in DC. Federal judicial nominations for Texas were run by her as a high-ranking Texan in the administration.</p>
<p>“Ever the proper preacher’s daughter, she would never tell me who the lawyer was. People don’t know that about Sarah. She was such a proper Methodist minister’s daughter. One of the few people I couldn’t cuss in front of.”</p>
<p>Hays also paid tribute to Weddington as a member of a “Great Austin Matriarchy” including the former Texas governor Ann Richards and the <a>columnist Molly Ivins</a>.</p>
<p>Among other tributes, the University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck said Weddington was “a remarkable woman [who had] a remarkable career and a remarkable life. May her memory be a blessing”.</p>
<p>Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said simply: “Rest in power.”</p>
<p>Weddington indicated she was at peace with being remembered for <a>Roe v Wade</a>.</p>
<p>“I think most women of my generation can recall our feelings about the fight,” she told the Guardian. “It’s like young love. You may not feel exactly the same, but you remember it.”</p>
<a>Nicola Walker’s Cassie Stuart </a>,
<a>Sofia Helin’s Saga Norén</a> and
<a>Sofie Gråbøl’s Sarah Lund</a> have held my attention like nothing else – even the second or third time around.
<p>As the light fades in our respective homes and we say goodbye, I think: “You’re right.”</p>

<div> <time> Published: 12 Sep 2021 </time> </div> Men are inventing new excuses for killing women and judges are falling for them
<p>“I think the bikini line is still a no-no,” says Robert-Smith, with regard to the move towards letting it all hang out – although she has a leotard piece coming up and isn’t planning to buy any Veet.</p>
<p>Turn on the TV, watch kids’ cartoons or most films, and you won’t have to look hard for the message that nice guys finish last, while tough guys get the girl, and, more importantly, gain the respect of other men.</p>
<p>Gender, including masculinity, is something that is worked upon and it is hard work. In fact, if it came so naturally, then men would not increasingly spend so much time, money and effort on fashion, grooming, dieting, training and exercise.</p>
<p>Masculine women, butch lesbians and transgender people on the masculine spectrum are targeted for double glances at best, and for worse when those scrutinising glances work out who is what, and who is not what was expected.</p>
<a>men are rightly identifying</a> the expectations of gender as contributing to poor mental and physical health, social isolation, addiction problems and violence.

<p>While the centre’s staff of 10 arrange group and individual discussions on the premises, perhaps the organisation’s most important function will be the outreach work it does.</p>
<p>Through exhibitions and events in museums, libraries and other cultural institutions it hopes to raise the debate about masculinity. It will also be active in the city’s numerous sporting associations.</p>
<p>Pérez sees sport as being one of the last areas where men cannot be open about their sexuality, a point borne out by the media attention given to Josh Cavallo, the young Australian footballer who came out as gay last month.</p>
<p>The centre will also attempt to fill the void of discussion about gender roles and identity in school by involving parents and teachers. Pérez says there is little sex education and almost no discussion of sexuality in the Catalan education system.</p>
<p>Some of the programmes pre-date the centre and one of the most successful and popular of them prepares fathers-to-be with discussions about fatherhood, childcare and sharing domestic chores.</p>
<p>A survey by the national statistics institute shows that Spanish men spend an average of 23 hours per week on childcare and 11 on household chores, compared with 38 and 20 hours respectively for women.</p>
<p>“Increasingly, we see young Spanish men and women understanding the need to break with gender stereotypes,” she says, but adds that some of the country’s institutions lag behind.</p>
<p>The sentence provoked a huge outcry with tens of thousands of women and men taking to the streets all over <a>Spain</a> in protests that forced the government to introduce new legislation on consent.</p>
<p>“Gender stereotypes affect us all,” says Waisman, who supports the Barcelona initiative. “If we only focus on women being feminists and fighting for equality and don’t do the same for men, we’re leaving out half the population.”</p>
<p>Pérez agrees. “Barcelona has been promoting feminist policies since 2015, and it’s important we consolidate the topic of masculinity within these,” she says. “If not, it’s just the sound of one hand clapping.”</p>
<p>For you, where does value come from? (Emine Saner)It makes my life meaningful. I love a project that gives my life a bit of motivation, and it uses up your time in a really good way.</p>
<p>Do you abandon work? (ES)Usually nearer the beginning than the end. I used to make things, then hate them and smash them. Now I can see the tragedy unfolding early on and nip it in the bud.</p>
<p>Eat the rich or sell them art? (Suzanne, Liverpool)Definitely sell them art. Though a few of them could be barbecued.</p>
<p>Isn’t it obscene to spend hundreds of millions on a piece of art? (ES)Probably. But it’s better than spending it on weapons.</p>
<p>Tom Ford answers my phone call in precisely the way I’d hoped he would: with a voice as smooth as butter and the grace of Cary Grant.</p>
<p>But first, the gentleman prefers small talk. “You’re in London? How wonderful. I miss it,” he says of the city he used to call home.</p>
<a>Ford’s movies </a>– A Single Man (2009) and Nocturnal Animals (2019) – were nominated for Academy Awards. Both are beautiful to watch.
<p>A photograph of Jack is among Ford’s favourite additions to the book. “It is the only shot I have ever released of him publicly. He was five when it was taken, so no one would recognise him from it,” he says.</p>
<p>The designer also highlights the potency of good taste in the Buckley Ford family’s genes. “One time when he was five, somebody at school asked what was the worst thing you could think of. Jack said: “Brown shoes with a black belt.”</p>
<p>Work on the book meant that Ford spent lockdown sifting through thousands of images. “It was an interesting thing to spend so much time looking back,” he tells me, “it is not something I do often.”</p>
<p>Ford seems to be fascinated and repulsed by the digitalisation of fashion.</p>
<p>“The future of fashion is increasingly cartoonish,” he says. “Instagram has broken down the rules. People dress up to take pictures of themselves to post online, everything is exaggerated – especially the eyebrows.”</p>
<p>He recently watched <a>Fake Famous</a>, the HBO documentary about influencers, and found the revelation that Instagram users were using toilet seats to give the illusion of being on a plane “completely hysterical”.</p>
<p>Can we expect to see an airport selfie of him soon? “Never!” he says. “I’m very private.”</p>
<p>You can count on Ford to keep it classy.</p>
<p>Well, stop dreaming. The actor, screenwriter and producer Paul Rudd has just been named as the sexiest man alive. We are saved.</p>

<p>Caroline Nokes, who chairs the women and equalities committee, said Johnson had smacked her hard on the bottom in 2003, while he was in the running to be MP for Teignbridge in Devon.</p>
<p>Ailbhe Rea, political correspondent for the New Statesman, said she was grateful to Nokes for speaking out and said Johnson had “groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019”.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson’s spokesman said he could not comment on individual cases, but that Downing Street would encourage anyone who had experienced harassment to report it.</p>
<p>Nokes, the MP for Romsey, was speaking on a panel discussion with other MPs on Sky News. She said: “I’ve had male MPs stick their hands on my backside in Strangers’ Bar [in parliament].</p>
<p>“I can remember a really prominent man – at the time the Conservative candidate for Teignbridge in Devon – smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going: ‘Oh, Romsey, you’ve got a lovely seat.’</p>
<p>Both Phillips and Allin-Khan described being harassed at work in their previous jobs by senior managers. Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence, said she was assaulted by a former boss at a party.</p>
<p>Jones, who was elected in 2019, described how she was flashed at by a man when she was 17 years old.</p>

<p>A new space mission to hunt for potentially habitable planets around Earth’s closest neighbouring star system is under way. </p>
<p>In a project with echoes of the 2009 film Avatar, an international collaboration of scientists in Australia and the US will search in the Alpha Centauri star system for earth-like planets that could sustain life.</p>
<p>Alpha Centauri – Earth’s closest neighbouring star system – consists of two sun-like stars, known as Alpha Centauri A and B, and a more distant red dwarf star.</p>
<p>The Toliman mission, named after the ancient Arabic-derived name for the star system, will search for potential planets orbiting Alpha Centauri A and B.</p>
<p>“We know that life has evolved at least once, around a sun-like star on an earth-like planet,” Tuthill said. “We try to look for other examples that are as close to that configuration as possible.”</p>
<p>Tuthill likened hunting for planets to solving a mystery: the signals planets give off are “very subtle” and “very faint” compared to the signals from stars, he said.</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly frequent discovery of <a>exoplanets</a> – planets outside our solar system – “around our very nearest sun-like stars we don’t have any idea whether there could be … any earth-like planets,” Tuthill said.</p>
<p>The Toliman mission will try to uncover planets by studying whether the stars Alpha Centauri A and B wobble from side to side, due to the presence of unseen planets tugging on them gravitationally.</p>
<p>Collaborators on the mission previously detected a “<a>planet candidate</a>” potentially orbiting around Alpha Centauri A, but its existence hasn’t been definitively confirmed.</p>
<p>“If that is a real planet that would be something like a Neptune-like planet … a gas giant,” Tuthill said. “Maybe it has a moon around it that life could exist on.”</p>
<p>At 4.37 light years away from the sun, Alpha Centauri would be an obvious destination for any future interstellar travel, Tuthill added.</p>
<p>“It’s not in my lifetime, but it’s still a visionary future where we might imagine developing technologies … able to span these interstellar voids.”</p>
<p>In collaboration with the University of Sydney, the Toliman mission involves scientists at Saber Astronautics in Australia, and Breakthrough Initiatives and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US.</p>

<p>Age: During the silent movie era “intertitles” or “title cards”, boxes of text between film sequences, were used in lieu of speech, so that viewers had some idea of what was going on. So about 115 years, let’s say.</p>
