<p>We’ve been warned: shop early or risk disappointment. Between supply chain chaos, local delivery woes and the ongoing pandemic, getting your end-of-year gifts in order is going to take a bit of extra planning in 2021.</p>
<p>So we’ve made a list – of gift ideas that are local, sustainable, socially minded or just plain delightful – and checked it twice, to create Guardian Australia’s largest gift guide to date.</p>
<p>We haven’t done it alone. We asked five guest editors, each with their own areas of expertise, to contribute ideas.</p>
<p>Dr Michelle Wong: A cosmetic chemist and science educator, Michelle busts beauty myths with her blog Lab Muffin. She explores the science behind makeup and skincare, and has selected grooming gifts in line with her evidence-based approach.</p>
<p>Alice Zaslavsky: Author of In Praise of Veg, recipe writer, culinary wizard and, all right, also MasterChef Australia alum, Alice has mined her kitchen to curate a selection of local cookware for everyone from obsessive home cooks to novices.</p>
<p>Max Brearley: 2021 was a bumper year for Australian cookbooks, and the food journalist has pored through them all to select the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>First and most importantly – you can filter based on price. Just use the slider at the top of the guide to set your budget before you browse.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a gift you can give at the last minute, use the last minute toggle.</p>
<p>Finally, if you know who you’re shopping for but not what they want, browse by who it’s for. From grumps to adventurers, we’ve also selected based on the mood of the recipient.</p>
<p>But if your giftee is a prolific user of beauty products then something beauty-related could well be the perfect gift. Here are some tips for choosing something they’ll love.</p>
<p>To sidestep the “pointed hint” faux pas, it’s probably a good idea to avoid any skincare products that target acne or wrinkles, unless you know your giftee specifically wants (or already uses) them.</p>
<p>If they’ve ever mentioned having sensitive skin, allergies or rosacea, it’s probably best not to gift skincare at all, since they probably have a long checklist of ingredients they avoid in products.</p>
<p>Body skin is thicker and less sensitive than face skin, so you can have a bit more fun with these products without risking a skin reaction – unless, of course, your person has sensitive skin.</p>

<p>At Le Beauté, the six newly trained staff earn £100 to £300 a month, depending upon their level of expertise and skill.</p>
<p>More beauticians are being trained near Mumbai. “We plan to open our next salon in Pune and ultimately go national once we get more funding,” says Pasha.</p>
<p>However, he is happy that La Beauté opened a door for him and trained him as a hairstylist – and has recently made him a part of the salon’s management team. “I feel loved and appreciated here,” he says.</p>
<p>“I no longer have to act or hide behind a different identity just to do my job. It’s so liberating. And that’s how society should be too – inclusive and diverse,” he says pointing proudly to the salon’s rainbow-hued walls.</p>

<p>Once seen as dowdy, the cardigan is enjoying a renaissance, with Taylor Swift even penning a song about the knitwear favourite last year.</p>
<p>There’s a huge array to consider. Block colours – particularly in autumnal shades, such as rust or mustard – are a good place to start. Designs with a V-neck might suit those over a D-cup.</p>
<p>Cardigans aren’t just classic, though. They can bring something playful to a weekday outfit. Old-fashioned knits found secondhand provide a cute and cosy feel. Quirky brands like Cinta are worth looking at on rental sites.</p>
<p>Treasures can be found in vintage stores and online. Think of channelling Nancy Mitford in a classic twinset, Marilyn Monroe on the beach in something more chunky, or Mad Men’s Betty Draper. Lauren Cochrane</p>

<p>A new survey has found that music fans believe you should know at least 10 songs by a band before wearing their T-shirt. But for fans of folk music, K-pop and jazz, you should know at least thirteen.</p>

<p>There’s a problem with how we talk about our roads. From news reports on “accidents” to who gets blamed for road danger in comment pieces, our media sources sometimes flip the sources of death and injury on their head.</p>
<p>Language and accuracy matter, and too often reporting contributes to making the roads less safe.</p>
<p>That’s why the Active Travel Academy has drafted media reporting guidelines which we hope broadcasters and publishers will adopt, just as they have adopted guidelines for reporting on suicide or domestic violence.</p>
<a>broadly negative</a>, focusing on road danger, criminality or bad behaviour, although studies
<a>have shown cyclists are generally far more law-abiding than motorists</a>.
<a>Research has demonstrated</a> that how journalists describe and discuss crashes affects how people see the causes of and solutions to road danger. Not only that, it influences how we treat others on the roads – with language that
<a> dehumanises other road users, often cyclists</a>, predicting aggression and violence between road users. Those who cycle regularly will tell you they
<a> wince when they see the latest article or TV programme</a> about so-called “lycra louts”.
<p>One only has to read the comments under online news articles about motorists and cyclists to see how prejudices can be reinforced by ill-informed “keyboard warriors”, most of whom will be eligible for jury service.</p>
<p>The four clauses each align with journalistic values that inform existing reporting guidelines – . These are:</p>
<p> Impartiality: publishers must not use the term “accident” when describing road collisions – “collision” or “crash” are more accurate, especially when the facts of the incident are not known.</p>
<p> Discrimination: publishers must avoid using negative generalisations of road users, and must not use dehumanising language or that which may incite violence or hatred against a road user.</p>
<p> Reporting on crime: publishers must avoid portraying dangerous or criminal behaviour on the roads, such as speeding, as acceptable, or those caught breaking the law as victims.</p>
<p>We want to hear from you – whether you are a member of the public, organisation or group. Tell us what you think of our draft guidelines, how they will affect you or your work, and anything you’d like to see improved.</p>
<p>The consultation closes on 8 November at midnight, and the guidelines will be launched on 26 November. You can also submit a response to the consultation by email at consultation@rc-rg.com.</p>
<p>And amid the daily froth of sometimes entirely false stories about LTNs <a>closing roads</a>, or <a>slowing emergency service</a> response times, one thing is often forgotten: these schemes tend to be very popular.</p>
<p>Arguably even more notable was another element of the poll, where people were given a list of seven possible changes to local transport, and asked to pick the two they found most important.</p>
<p>While the most popular choice was fewer potholes, picked as one of the options by 48% of people, 21% wanted more cycle routes, and 34% opted for reduced road traffic. Just 8% supported extra roads being built.</p>
<p>The latest group to blink in the face of opposition led by vocal and often largely internet-based campaigns was Lewisham council in south-east London, which last week <a>wound back several elements</a> of a local LTN scheme.</p>
<a>lined up at No 10 press conferences</a> to hail walking and cycling as the solutions to not just reduced public transport capacity, but more widely to help ameliorate the effects of future pandemics through better public health.
<a>reported a letter</a> from Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, to councils, reportedly warning them that too many cycle lanes were causing traffic buildup, adding: “No one should be in doubt about our support for motorists.”
<a>are good for business</a>, not bad.
<p>As <a>Reid also reported</a>, last month, as well as a 40% rise in the number of motor vehicles on UK roads over little more than a decade, in urban areas those vehicles are increasingly led by satnav apps down unsuitable sidestreets.</p>
<p>By default, it directed me along a labyrinthine zigzag of residential roads, the sort of route that, until a few years ago, only taxi drivers or locals could have followed. Now there were hundreds of us squeezing along the narrow streets.</p>
<p>It wasn’t ended. Satnav algorithms got updated, chaos subsided very quickly, rat-running traffic has largely evaporated, and now I’d wager many locals barely remember the old system.</p>
<p>In contrast, councillors in Lewisham panicked and changed course in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Again, to stress, I don’t underestimate how difficult it is for councillors to face abuse, hostility and even threats of violence after changing a long-assumed status quo. But for those who are wavering, I would urge them to bear two things in mind.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you eliminate an LTN, or another traffic-taming intervention, you’re not solving anything. But also, for all the noise from a minority, as the Greenpeace survey shows, they are a minority. These changes are popular.</p>
<p>You <a>know the one</a>. Abolished in 1937. Replaced by vehicle excise duty (VED), which is, as has been explained countless times, very much not a tax to pay for roads – the money goes into the central pot, as do almost all tax revenues.</p>
<p>VED is also based on exhaust emissions, meaning that even if cyclists were liable for it, bikes would be, as with dozens of electric and hybrid cars, charged precisely £0 a year.</p>
<p>The idea that cyclists are freeloaders because they don’t pay “road tax” has been so thoroughly debunked over so many years that, these days, it is mainly the preserve of anonymous Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>But Farage is nothing if not adaptable, and is currently reinventing himself as something of an all-purpose, hard-right, populist culture warrior, whether warning about an “invasion” of asylum seekers in the Channel or <a>battling lockdown</a>.</p>
<a>columnist in the Times</a> used
<p>On the same day, the Telegraph got in on the act, hosting a <a>ridiculous Twitter “debate”</a> that started with the argument: “Country walks can be ruined by arrogant cyclists expecting walkers to know they are coming up behind at 40mph.”</p>
<a>£250m in emergency spending</a> is welcome but, in road transport terms, that is less than a fifth of
<a>a very expensive roundabout</a>.
<a>signed a letter</a> calling, in effect, for all new work on cycle lanes and LTNs to halt.
<p>The coronavirus pandemic changed the UK in many ways, and one of the minor impacts was to spark an explosion of interest in e-bikes, as people sought out ways to return to work while avoiding public transport and traffic jams.</p>
<p>After months of back-and-forth emails with bike companies and PRs, I got hold of the four featured below. I wanted to test more models, and some cheaper ones, but it couldn’t happen.</p>
<p>Before I get into the details, there are three general points to make.</p>
<li><p>Finally, e-bikes can be transformative, especially for those uncertain that cycling or cycle commuting is for them, whether because of a lack of experience, or because of hills, or perhaps fitness.</p></li>
<p>Enough preamble; let’s get to the reviews.</p>
<p>In fact, pretty much everything is built into the frame, including the battery and motor, meaning fellow cyclists at red lights might not even realise what you’re riding until you shoot into the distance with a gentle whirring noise.</p>
<p>To ride, the S3 is genuinely fantastic. The motor power, which comes via the cranks rather than direct to a wheel, is smooth and gradual, without the sudden jolt that some older e-bikes used to give when you hit 15mph.</p>
<p>But others will, and do, disagree. The VanMoof was definitely the bike that prompted the most interest and envy from neighbours and fellow riders, and if the design suits you, it is a delight to ride.</p>
<p>In terms of commuting practicality, the S3 comes with full mudguards and a chair guard, and VanMoof makes its own front and rear racks, with branded pannier bags to go on them.</p>
<h2>Carrera Vengeance E electric mountain bike (£1,099)</h2>
<p>I had hoped to try the same-priced commuter model in Halfords’ own-brand range, or a slightly cheaper folding version. But if e-bikes are in short supply, then (relatively) cheap ones are like gold dust, so I tried out the mountain bike.</p>
<p>Though officially designed for hills and trails, it is still quite commuter-friendly, with eyelets for mudguards and a rear rack, while the wide tyres and suspension forks laugh in the face of bumpy surfaces.</p>
<p>On picking up the bike, I had worried whether its brakes – cable-operated disc models, as against the VanMoof’s hydraulic versions – might be a bit weedy against such bulk, but they were fine.</p>
<p>Guided by a phone app along a complex route of back streets and low-traffic neighbourhoods, I found it almost relaxing. Yes, I could have done the trip on my normal bike, but the chances are I wouldn’t have bothered.</p>
<h2>Brompton Electric M2L two-speed e-bike (£2,725)</h2>
<p>To continue the parallel, if the VanMoof has everything sleekly integrated, the e-Brompton is basically a standard model with a motor hub and battery pack added to the front.</p>
<p>As with all Bromptons, much depends on whether you need a folding bike. One extra advantage here is that e-bikes are very stealable, and with a Brompton you can safely keep it inside, at home or in an office.</p>
<h2>Raleigh Motus Crossbar (£1,800)</h2>
<p>If the other bikes I tried all had their quirks, or niches, perhaps the best thing you can say about the Motus is that it is gloriously ordinary – a very sensible and well-fitted commuter bike that just happens to have an electric motor.</p>
<p>Bike theft is a perennial problem – and a pandemic-induced cycling boom inevitably means more targets for thieves. </p>
<p>As restrictions lift, thefts are expected to rise, and police are trying to be ready when that happens, with a new national cycle crime partnership bringing together the UK’s major police forces.</p>
<p>“The government’s approach is to get more people cycling and walking, because obviously there’s benefits to the environment,” says Supt Mark Cleland, UK police national lead for cycle crime, who is leading the partnership.</p>
<p>“My view on it is: if we tackle cycle crime then we’re saving lives and protecting the world.”</p>
<p>Only about 5% of stolen bikes are returned to their owners, and almost a quarter of those who have a bike stolen stop cycling altogether, while 66% cycle less often.</p>
<p>While BikeRegister provides every UK police force with free kits, supplies are limited. What’s more, with 2m bikes sold in the UK each year, only a few thousand of which are then registered, there is a long way to go.</p>
<p>There are good news stories, though. “There was a person who didn’t even know their bike was stolen, we called them to say it had been found, and they said, ‘It’s downstairs’, only to go out and find it wasn’t there,” he said.</p>
<p>Brown says bikes have turned up in America, Europe, India and Africa. One customer got their bike back after a decade.</p>
<p>At present, police recommend victims of theft check online sites themselves – they know their bikes better than anyone – and then alert police.</p>
<h2>How to stop your bike being stolen</h2>
<p>Lock your bikes at home, too – don’t assume it’s safe because it’s in a garage or shed.</p>
<p>Leave your bike somewhere well lit, busy and ideally within sight of CCTV. If somewhere feels dodgy, lock it somewhere else.</p>
<p>Lock both wheels and the frame – don’t just lock the front wheel through the fork.</p>
<p>Think about insuring your bike </p>
<p>On the subject of e-bikes, you may want to consider a GPS tracker. Then you can use an app to check your bike is still where you left it, even when you can’t see it for yourself.</p>
<p>When meeting sellers, check the cycle registration mark, and check ownership on bikeregister.com or immobilise.com. Sellers who have had the bike from new should have a receipt.</p>
<h2>What to do if your bike is stolen</h2>
<p>If you’ve registered it on BikeRegister, then the first thing to do is to update that.</p>
<p>The London Cycling Campaign recommends the sites Bikeshd and Find That Bike, which provide pictures of all bikes listed for sale on auction and resale websites.</p>

<p>We have normalised a society in which men can move around as they please while the rest of us fear for our lives for the simple act of travelling home.</p>
<a>says</a>, “When I ‘became a cyclist’ in 2013, I felt liberated from street harassment. I was never still long enough for someone to try to harass me and even if I were, I could get away so much more quickly on two wheels.”
<a>Copenhagen</a> for example, 55% of journeys by bike are made by women. In
<a>Paris and Lisbon</a>, the number of female cyclists has increased with recent investment in protected bike lanes and other measures.
<a>research</a> has found that female cyclists in the UK are twice as likely as men to have faced “near misses” or harassment by drivers, while a
<a>US study</a> found that drivers are 3.8 times more likely to pass female cyclists too closely than male cyclists.

<p>If you were to read certain newspapers for long enough, the message would seem clear: the main cause of traffic congestion is measures to boost walking and cycling – that is, separated cycle lanes, and so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods, or LTNs.</p>
<p>There was, however, one interesting phenomenon: the proportion of the delays put down to “traffic calming measures” – the metric that covers LTNs – rose, particularly when newer LTNs had been built.</p>
<p>Finally, the sample size is small. An analysis by the Bike is Best campaign looked at the LFB data and found that “traffic calming measures” was a tiny proportion of the total number of recorded delays, ranging between 1.3% and 1.5% in recent years.</p>
<p>The LFB is pretty clear in its view, saying it backs measures to boost active travel, and works closely with councils over how they are implemented.</p>
<p>The LAS doesn’t keep similarly micro-level response data, and it is with ambulances, at least in London, where the LTN picture becomes a little more complex.</p>
<p>The LAS also publicly backs moves to boost cycling and walking – not least given the huge number of medical cases connected to inactive living – but is keen to work with councils, and Transport for London, to make sure its views are heard.</p>
<p>If you speak to ambulance staff, some will say that LTNs can be a polarising subject, and that they not uncommonly come up when the service holds engagement events with senior managers.</p>
<a>London</a> mayor’s major mandates is transport. Cycling and walking are a key part of that, not least while many people are avoiding public transport or working from home.
<a>according to one poll</a>. To a great extent it is divided along party lines; support is far higher among London Labour voters (71%) than Conservatives (36%),
<p>But which candidate should voters who want better conditions for cycling choose? Here’s a guide to the main candidates’ pledges.</p>
<h2>Shaun Bailey, Conservative</h2>
<a>“ensuring good access to bicycle training”</a>.
<p>While cycleways in every community would be welcome, many are sceptical that it would happen under Bailey. Without decent, protected infrastructure most won’t cycle – and he doesn’t seem to like decent infrastructure.</p>
<a>part of a recent video interview</a> from the back of a black cab, in which the driver compared low traffic streets to the Tour de France, with Bailey nodding along to claims that cycling drops “drastically” in winter (
<a>it’s actually around 15%</a>). He also
<a>says he’d cut Streetspace</a>, the programme of expanded pedestrian and cycling space introduced during Covid, a proposed £5.50 charge for driving into London and the city’s low emission zone.
<p>He does not make clear how he will establish which LTNs are unwanted, though, and in fact the mayor does not have the power the scrap them, as they are implemented by London boroughs, not City Hall.</p>
<a>the statutory guidance telling councils to introduce</a> such measures,
<a>along with the funding,</a> came
<p>Bailey wants to cut congestion and pollution, but scrapping the ultra-low emissions zone – which has “contributed to a 44% reduction in roadside nitrogen oxide” since 2019 <a>according to TfL</a> – leaves a lot of ground to reclaim. </p>
<p>Bailey did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<h2>Sian Berry, Green party</h2>
<p>The Greens pledge new walking and cycling crossings, like the scrapped Rotherhithe and Cremorne bridges, and funding councils and community groups to develop and fast-track LTNs, with quarterly bidding processes and improved consultation.</p>
<p>Tackling hostile junctions is also on the list, and ensuring no signalised junctions are without green pedestrian crossings by 2024.</p>
<p>For pedestrians, the Greens would create a central London walking network, with low-pollution routes, and better and wider pavements with more dropped kerbs and tactile paving.</p>
<a>who can bunny hop</a>. Shortly before the pandemic struck, Khan announced he had
<p>Khan <a>says he wants</a> London to be carbon neutral by 2030, with 80% of journeyson foot, by bike or public transport by 2041.</p>
<a>potential local impacts on health</a> from increased air pollution, and
<p>Khan pledges to “continue the rapid expansion of London’s cycle network … so it reaches a third of Londoners by 2025”, up from one in five at present. </p>
<p>A new “outer London town centres fund” would include improved cycle parking, wayfinding, street signage and digital mapping, modernising and expanding the Santander cycle hire scheme, which had its busiest year in 2021.</p>
<p>Khan has pledged more walking and cycling community grants, cycle training for adults and children, cargo bike support and freight consolidation and work to “tackle the scourge of [engine] idling”.</p>
<p>20mph limits would be rolled out on TfL roads, along with improvements to dangerous junctions.</p>
<p>Like Berry, Khan has also said he wants vehicle emissions duty to be hypothecated for London.</p>
<p>“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild our cities and our economies so that they are cleaner, greener and more sustainable, and I’m determined to work with boroughs and communities across London to get there.”</p>
<h2>Luisa Porritt, Liberal Democrats</h2>
<p>Some Lib Dems <a>seem to disagree internally on whether or not cycling infrastructure is a good idea</a>, but in the mayoral race at least they are pledging to double cycle infrastructure expenditure by 2024.</p>
<p>The Lib Dem manifesto is lighter on cycling details than in previous elections. A major manifesto pledge is scrapping the Silvertown tunnel, instead “committing to greener transport projects, like the Bakerloo line extension or more cycling routes”.</p>
<p>Are measures to make streets safe for walking and cycling unpopular? Are they vote-losers? Have we failed to take communities with us – and will we, as local politicians, pay the price?</p>
<p>The infrastructure was vandalised. I was accused of not consulting or listening to people’s views – though the schemes, as trials, were themselves consultations. The schemes were often labelled “unpopular” and “controversial” in the local press.</p>
<p>Labour, whose mayor and council implemented the schemes, comfortably won all five of the wards – including one, Ealing Common, that the Tories took last time. The Tory vote in that ward dropped by more than 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>But what does seem quite clear is that in a bad year for Labour, cycle schemes saved or won votes for us, not lost them. And that if there was any “controversy”, it worked largely in our favour.</p>
<p>Reimposing road danger, noise and pollution on people who voted for the opposite? That would be an Ealing tragedy, not an Ealing comedy.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Julian Bell is councillor for Greenford Broadway ward, and was leader of Ealing council for 11 years.</p></li> </ul>
<p>I’ve been something of a sceptic about technological bike gizmos over the years, add-ons that too often seem to represent a solution in search of a problem, an attempt to reinvent something – the bicycle – that was not far short of perfect anyway.</p>
<p>I’m no luddite. New developments make cycling even more enjoyable and useful, not least near-puncture proof tyres and tiny, retina-searing lights. Plus, of course, there’s the amazing world of electric-assist bikes, or e-bikes.</p>
<p>There’s not space to fully get into why e-bikes can be a cycling gamechanger, but they are increasingly common, even in the UK, whirring along with a passenger, or cargo of kids and shopping.</p>
<p>A standard order costs £999, but if you wait a bit, every two months the company offers “pre-order” windows, where you get a 50% discount.</p>
<p>I decided to electrify a very old, very tatty hybrid bike, someone else’s “spare” bike that had lain unused in a garage for some months. Why? Partly for the sheer fun of it. Partly to see if, indeed, “any” bike could be converted.</p>
<p>I also spent a while thinking I’d got the wiring wrong, as there were two spare ones dangling from the battery. Eventually I worked out these were to attach optional brake sensors, which cut the motor when you’re slowing down.</p>
<p>The battery pack is also simple to remove and portable. Once it’s off, the bike is still fairly obviously an e-bike, but could be less noticeable to thieves.</p>
<p>The entire setup weighs about 3kg, though the net bulk depends on the weight of the wheel being replaced. I could happily have lifted the tatty hybrid on which I installed it up some steps if needed, not always a given for an e-bike.</p>
<p>But the big appeal of Swytch is that you can attach it to a bike you already use and know you enjoy riding. And with the battery off, the bike still feels more or less the same as it did before, albeit a bit weightier at the front end.</p>

<p>The world of leisure cycling is nothing if not inventive when it comes to ways to sell bikes and associated bits of kit, and two of the most popular new – or theoretically new – concepts are bikepacking and gravel bikes.</p>
<p>The trail, put together by Cycling UK and taking in parts of the Ridgeway and South Downs Way, is highly recommended, but what I want to recount here is more the mechanics of how I and a friend did it – and to describe the ideas behind such trips.</p>
<h2>What is bikepacking? Is it just touring rebranded?</h2>
<h2>What bike do you use? And what is a gravel bike, anyway?</h2>
<h2>But what’s the point of gravel bikes?</h2>
<h2>What equipment do you need for bikepacking?</h2>
<h2>Can’t you just use panniers?</h2>
<h2>Can we have some specifics on what you used?</h2>

<p>Councils which rip out cycle lanes or low-traffic neighbourhoods before giving them a chance to work or without evidence they are failing could lose future central government funding, ministers have warned.</p>
<a>removed active travel schemes</a> in the face of sometimes noisy objections, transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris is formally writing to the leaders of all English local authorities with transport responsibilities.
<p>In separate comments, Boris Johnson warned councils that he was serious about boosting active travel, saying that “trying to squeeze more cars and delivery vans on the same roads and hoping for the best is not going to work”.</p>
<p>“I support councils, of all parties, which are trying to promote cycling and bus use,” the prime minister said. “And if you are going to oppose these schemes, you must tell us what your alternative is.”</p>
<p>“Premature removal of schemes carries implications for the management of the public money used in these schemes and for the government’s future funding relationship with the authorities responsible,” wrote Heaton-Harris.</p>
<p>Under the government’s emergency active travel fund, councils installed hundreds of cycle lanes, school streets and low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which seek to filter residential streets against through-traffic by motor vehicles.</p>
<p>However, amid <a>often noisy objections</a> from some residents, plus repeatedly negative media coverage of such interventions, a series of councils have removed schemes at short notice.</p>
<a>been told</a> it cannot apply for the next phase of active travel funding after it removed a cycle lane in Shoreham-by-Sea. Similar lanes have been taken out
<a>by Labour-led Liverpool council</a>, and by an alliance of Labour and Tory members
<p>It comes as newly released government-commissioned polling showed apparent strong public support for LTNs, and for wider traffic reduction measures.</p>
<p>The research, carried out in Birmingham, Ipswich, Bournemouth and Salford, showed 61% of people supported their local LTN, including 58% of business owners and 49% of those with mobility challenges.</p>
<p>More generally, 79% of people backed the reduction of traffic in their local area, with 71% support for respondents with mobility challenges.</p>
<p>The letter and Johnson’s statement emphasise the apparent policy difference divide over active travel between some councils and the more positive view within Downing Street and the Department for <a>Transport</a>.</p>
<p>Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for <a>Cycling</a> UK, said the organisation had been arguing for months that councils should give schemes enough time to work.</p>
<p>That perception is a big part of the answer. Bike manufacturers have had a free ride in terms of tracking their own environmental impacts largely because of the assumption that biking is inherently environmentally friendly.</p>
<a>Dutch study</a> and used by the
<a>European Cycling Federation</a>) for the manufacturing footprint of bicycles is 96kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
<sub>2</sub>e). According to Trek, the production of a basic model of its bestselling bike – an entry-level mountain bike – emits about 100kg of CO
<a>ECF estimates</a> a manufacturing carbon footprint of 134kg, Trek’s figures show that electrifying any bike adds about 65kg of CO
<sub>2</sub>e to production emissions. Making a basic commuter e-bike would therefore produce about 165kg of CO
<sub>2</sub>e/km (depending on food footprint, which can be
<a>highly variable</a>). With Trek’s updated figure and assuming an EU average electricity mix, e-bikes come in at 21-25g CO
<sub>2</sub>e/km (yes, e-bikes can be less carbon intensive than conventional bikes, assuming the rider is doing less work).
<a>typical car produces</a> about 220g CO
<sub>2</sub>e/km over 180,000 lifetime kilometres. Electric vehicles are better, averaging about 160g CO
<sub>2</sub>e/km (depending on a country’s electricity emissions). There is little data on the lifecycles of e-scooters, but an
<a>estimate</a> of a typical case in Germany is about the same as an electric car, at 165g CO
<p>While it markets its bikes as playing a critical role in decarbonising transportation systems, a lot of these models aren’t intended as alternatives to cars. In fact, some of them might be driven to the place where they are used.</p>
<p>Trek compared the aluminium and carbon-fibre versions of its bikes and consistently found that making the latter produces nearly three times the emissions. The same goes for wheels.</p>

<p>Every politician knows the word “bikelash”. From Milan to London, from Sydney to Vancouver, reallocating public space from motor vehicles for people to walk and cycle will inevitably send some residents into paroxysms of anger.</p>
<p>Next month, the mayors of two cities in North America – Mike Duggan in Detroit and Valérie Plante in Montreal – will test whether voters reward their pedestrian and bike-friendly policies.</p>
<a>creating or completing 160 miles (260km) of new bike routes</a>. Faced with an opponent who vocally opposed improvements for cycling and walking, the Labour mayor won 55% of the vote in the runoff.
<a>was reelected</a> by the city’s council after expanding citywide biking corridors and creating innovative “
<a>most of the city’s downtown parking spaces</a> to ease pollution.
<a>Clover Moore in Sydney</a> has already won three reelections despite strong blowback to her pro-cycling agenda; she is now running to win a fifth term in December. Tel Aviv’s electorate reelected
<a>San Francisco and other American cities</a> determined that pedestrian and cycling infrastructure increased retail sales by making streets and the stores along them better for shoppers on foot, bike and public transport.
<a>portrayed</a> Plante as out of touch with ordinary residents, but even her opponent is careful to promise that he would not reverse her signature protected bike lane on St Denis Street.
<p>Bikelash can be exhaustingly repetitive, to the point where even media writers are tired of the ritual of discussing bike lanes solely in terms of controversy.</p>
<p>Perhaps not quite yet, but the editorial took the view that bike lanes had “grown from political flashpoints – and ideological signifiers – to standard-issue civic infrastructure”.</p>
<p>It added: “The arguments over bike lanes are settled. They’re becoming what they should have long been: an ordinary way of getting around our cities.”</p>
<p>They are also an increasingly ordinary way for mayors to win elections.</p>
<p>“You used to be able to ride through here,” I said. “Yes,” replied my friend Mark, “but that was more than 20 years ago.”</p>
<p>A gravel bike, if you were wondering, is essentially a road bike that has relaxed frame angles (for a more comfortable riding position), can run wider, knobbly tyres for riding off-road and comes with mudguards and mounts for panniers.</p>
<p>My knobbly tyres sailed over the rough surface and soon we were in Soar-y-Mynydd, a whitewashed chapel built in 1822, and apparently the most remote chapel in Wales.</p>
<p>From here, we rode on rough tarmac for 10 miles or so across windy moorlands to Tregaron, and rooms for the night at <a>Y Talbot hotel</a> (doubles from £85 BB), which may have the UK’s most powerful showers – perfect after a day’s biking.</p>
<a>Ystwyth Trail</a>, which follows the route of the old Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railway beside
<a>Cors Caron</a>, a huge raised bog where otters thrive, along with the region’s soaring red kites.
<p>From here, a gradual climb saw us wend our way along an ancient moorland bridleway as southerly winds threw big, splashy raindrops in our faces – just as you’d expect in Wales.</p>

<p>So much so that in Lonely Planet’s list of 10 regions to visit in 2022, the Scenic Rim rubs shoulders with the likes of Burgundy, Vancouver and Puerto Rico. Older and younger Queensland siblings (and smug Aussie cousins) … eat your heart out.</p>
<p>Tabitha Bird, author of A Lifetime of Impossible Days and the Emporium of Imagination, lives on the western side of the region in a town called Boonah, which is also the setting for both of her books.</p>
<p>“My second book has even more of the town featured in it and the locals love it. I often do things like a ‘getting lost drive’, the whole point of the drive is to get lost and discover the region.</p>
<p>The Scenic Rim was named by the Binna Burra tourism pioneer Arthur Groom in the mid-1900s. But Jenny Jenner, of Kalbar Sunflowers, says her visitors are still surprised by the area, a century later.</p>
<p>“Visitors love being able to do an experience … picking flowers; riding camels or climbing a mountain.”</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given all the national parks, the Scenic Rim is home to hundreds of walking tracks.</p>
<p>For serious hikers, the 34.5km Scenic Rim Trail, which meanders through private property and Main Range national park, is a four-day hike with small, free campsites along the way. These should be booked before setting out, as spaces are limited.</p>
<p>For something more eccentric, Harrisville’s Summer Land Camels offers everything from rides to tastings – of fetta, halloumi, gelati and even a world-first vodka, all made from camel milk.</p>
<p>There’s also a Scenic Rim Farm Box, an innovative idea born out of Covid-19 lockdowns to bring the country flavours to the city. Visit Kent’s Lagoon shop, take some produce home, or even have it delivered.</p>
<p>Head here for ticketed events including sunrise yoga, sunset dinners among the flowers, and pick-and-pay for bunches to take home. There are still photo opportunities – but these ones actually contribute to the local economy.</p>

<p>The PM says we’re ‘not going back to lockdowns’ but Omicron could affect Australia’s Covid border restrictions. We look at the rules on booking changes, cancellations and refunds</p>
<p>Australians planning interstate travel over the Christmas period could face difficulty securing accommodation refunds and flight credits if state and territory borders tighten in response to the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>In anticipation of potential border changes, some airlines have in place flexible refund options for all fare types, but other airlines are less accommodating.</p>
<p>Jetstar has begun charging some passengers if they want the option to get a flight credit voucher if they decide to cancel their ticket on a flight that is still going ahead.</p>
<p>Ahead of the first Christmas since Covid when Australians will largely be free to move between states – with the exception of Western Australia – here is everything you need to know about the main airlines’ policies on disruptions.</p>
<h2>How likely are domestic border changes because of Omicron?</h2>
<p>While Scott Morrison<a> has declared </a>“we’re not going back to lockdowns”, it is unclear if Omicron transmissions could see a return to entry restrictions to some states for travellers from specific local government areas.</p>
<p>Introduced in response to earlier internal border closures throughout the pandemic, Jetstar offers passengers who have booked a fare the ability to change the date of their trip if a border closes or they can no longer travel.</p>
<p>However, if there are no border restriction changes, but a customer becomes a close contact and can no longer go to their destination or must isolate on their flight date, they will not be automatically eligible for a flight credit voucher.</p>
<p>Customers will need to purchase “FareCredit” during checkout, which allows passengers to cancel their flight for any reason up until airport check-in opens for the flight. The voucher is valid for three years.</p>
<p>The cost of Jetstar’s “FareCredit” protection varies, but on a one-way $64 flight from Sydney to Melbourne the cover costs $16.40 per passenger.</p>
<p>Jetstar does not require a border to have closed or proof of close contact status in order to access any of the above flight offers, except for insurance.</p>
<p>If changing the date of a flight, Qantas will waive the change fee but passengers will still need to pay any cost difference if their new fare is more expensive.</p>
<p>If requesting a flight credit, the cost of the fare can be used on any route with Qantas within 12 months.</p>
<p>There is no limit to how many times the date of a booking can be changed.</p>
<p>Qantas does not require a border to have closed or proof of close contact status in order to access any of the above flight offers, except for insurance.</p>
<p>Similarly to Qantas, Virgin is waiving fees for passengers who can no longer travel and the ability to change their flight dates or cancel their booking for a travel credit.</p>
<p>Passengers who want to change a flight will have to make the change before their day of departure. Customers changing their date of travel will still have to pay fare differences if their new flight is more expensive than their original booking.</p>
<p>If cancelling their fare for a flight credit, the voucher can be used on any route Virgin Australia offers, both domestic and international.</p>
<p>Virgin’s cancellation and changes options will cover all travel up until May 2022.</p>
<p>If a passenger wants to cancel their flight and get a refund, it will depend on the flexibility of the fare they initially booked, similar to the Qantas policy.</p>
<p>Rex’s policy appears more generous than other airlines, in that they offer full refunds to passengers and their entire travelling group on each leg, if one person is affected by Covid disruptions.</p>
<p>Covid disruptions include border closures, lockdowns, and isolation requirements for close contacts.</p>
<p>Unlike Jetstar, Qantas and Virgin’s rules, passengers will actually have to be affected by a Covid disruption to access the refunds.</p>
<h2>What about accommodation?</h2>
<p>In most cases, refund and travel credit rules are set by individual hotels and accommodation providers.</p>
<p>Generally, Airbnb flexibility will depend on the settings the accommodation host sets when booking.</p>
<p>After the initial pandemic closures in 2020, Airbnb changed its extenuating circumstances policy to mean that Covid disruptions to travel were not covered.</p>
<p>However, if a guest or host contracts Covid and their check-in date is within 14 days, they could be covered by the extenuating circumstances policy, but they must provide proof.</p>
<p>The brakes have been put on summer road trips with Australians who decide to holiday at home facing rental car prices up to double pre-pandemic rates.</p>
<p>The <a>worldwide car shortage </a>that has hit new and used car retailers has also jacked up rental prices by hundreds of dollars a week. </p>
<p>A <a>shortage of electronic chips</a> means some new cars will take months to be delivered. That shortage has pushed up the prices of used cars, which are <a>36% higher</a> in Australia than before the pandemic began.</p>
<p>But those without wheels, and those wanting to fly and hire some, can expect to pay more than $1,000 a week.</p>
<p>Rentals are most expensive in Tasmania, where prices have reached $169 a day – that’s $1,183 a week, assuming no discounts. No state has an average price of less than $100 a day.</p>
<p>The number of people searching for rental cars more than doubled in most states compared to last year, and as demand increased so did prices. In the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania, prices have more than doubled since 2019.</p>
<a>shipping logjam</a> that has affected other products including building materials, or the pallet shortage that is slowing the distribution of groceries.
<p>Chip manufacturers <a>slowed down production</a> as lockdowns began, and were unprepared when demand for chips soared as people bought electronic goods to keep them entertained or to work from home.</p>
<p>A <a>storm and a fire</a> in separate manufacturing facilities compounded the problem.</p>
<p>It takes time and money to establish new factories, Wylie said, so there will be car shortages until next year.</p>
<p>“The rental market in many respects is a snapshot of the car market. You have luxury models, hatchbacks and family cars,” he said.</p>
<p>“The shortage varies across brands and models greatly.”</p>
<p>“[When buying a new car] there are some cars you can purchase off the lot today, some you’ll purchase and they’ll be delivered in a week, some can take months.”</p>
<p>“Consumers in general need to be doing their research on what models are available here and now. They need to be prepared for possible wait times on some models, especially if they’re looking for particular specs, colours, and trims,” Wylie said.</p>
<p>The Kayak data shows the last week in January is the cheapest in the holiday period to rent a car (the average price is $92 a day), while the week from 27 December to 2 January is the most expensive, with an average price of $157.</p>

<p>Turner was once a high-flying international project manager. “But the Covid pandemic resulted in me losing everything – my business and my home – and I had years of abuse in a marriage.” In July 2020, she attempted suicide and woke up in AE.</p>
<p>But then she discovered the Steart nature reserve: “If you can just be quiet, you can find your balance again. I feel like everything is possible here.”</p>
<a>good evidence of nature’s efficacy</a>, such as a 2019 study showing that a
<a>two-hour “dose” of nature a week significantly improved health</a> and wellbeing. The missing link has been connecting health services and nature activities.
<a>National Academy for Social Prescribing</a> (NASP), which was launched in 2019 with funding from the Department of Health.
<p>Among the projects championed by NASP are <a>Wild Being in Reading</a>, an open-water swimming group in Portsmouth, <a>Dorset Nature Buddies</a>, the <a>Green Happy cafe in Northampton</a>, and a Moving in Nature project in Chingford, Essex.</p>
<p>The flat landscape and good paths on the reserve, which hosts otters and samphire beds, are important, he says: “We are trying to break down barriers – the people I am after are not walking at all.”</p>
<p>Hammond said: “The challenge for the NHS is that it is full of patients who need to move beyond NHS care. The potential is massive, but it is early days.”</p>
<p>Walks taken by people in UK woodlands save £185m a year in mental health costs, according to a report.</p>
<p>The researchers believe the true savings are likely to be significantly higher. The report shows the importance of woodlands, they said, which the government is already aiming to expand to tackle the climate and wildlife crises.</p>
<a>social prescribing</a>, where activities including nature visits are used to help sufferers. In polling by Forest Research, more than 90% of respondents said woodlands were important to them in reducing stress.
<p>Sir William Worsley, the chair of the Forestry Commission, which funded the report, said: “It demonstrates just how vital it is to invest in healthy trees and woodlands.” It makes medical, economic and environmental sense, he said.</p>
<a>just 13,300 hectares were planted</a>. The Woodland Trust warned recently that the UK’s native woodlands are reaching a crisis point, with just
<p>The <a>Forest Research report</a> uses evidence of reduced depression and anxiety as a result of regular nature visits, as well as data on woodland visitor numbers, and prevalence of mental health conditions and the associated costs.</p>
<a>reduced overall rates of depression by 7%</a>, and a UK study led by White that found a
<a>two-hour “dose” of nature a week</a> significantly boosted wellbeing. The evidence on the benefits of street trees came from studies in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.
<p>“Although many of us feel like hibernating in winter, getting outside in green spaces and making the most of the little daylight we get can really benefit both your physical and mental health,” said Stephen Buckley at the mental health charity Mind.</p>
<p>A two-hour “dose” of nature a week significantly boosts health and wellbeing, research suggests, even if you simply sit and enjoy the peace.</p>
<a>mental health benefits</a> of time spent in parks, woods or the beach are well known, but the new research is the first major study into how long is needed to produce the effect. If confirmed by future research, two hours in nature could join
<a>five a day</a> of fruit and veg and 150 minutes of exercise a week as official health advice.
<p>It also applied to those with long-term illnesses and disabilities, White said. “So getting out in nature seemed to be good for just about everybody. It doesn’t have to be physical exercise – it could be just sitting on a bench.”</p>
<p>The researchers were also surprised that it did not matter whether the two hours in nature were taken in one go or in a series of shorter visits, or whether people went to an urban park, woodlands or the beach.</p>
<p>“I am continually surprised by the size of the effect,” White said. The boost to health was the same as previous studies have shown come from taking recommended levels of exercise, or living in well-off neighbourhoods compared with poorer areas. </p>
<p>The researchers took a series of factors into account in reaching their conclusions, including the greenness of a person’s neighbourhood, levels of air pollution, and whether they were married, had children or had dogs.</p>
<a>Japanese “forest bathing”</a> – for instance, suggested that various psychophysiological benefits can be gained from merely sitting passively in natural versus urban settings.”

<p>Every week, more than 350,000 people take to their local green space for the free, timed 5km (3.1-mile) parkrun, expecting to reap the health benefits.</p>
<p>After its creation in 2004, the first parkrun outside the UK was started in Zimbabwe three years later. In April, Japan became the 21st country to host the event, launching a Tokyo parkrun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parkrun Russia started with two simultaneous runs in parks in Moscow in March 2014, and there is now an event in Siberia, where organisers have pledged never to let snow, ice or cold weather force them to cancel.</p>
<p>In Africa, runners in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and South Africa’s vast cities and grasslands are also regulars.</p>
<p>The combined distance so far is 162m miles (260m km) at 53.8m parkruns globally, which adds up to 3,118 years, 25 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes and 18 seconds of running and walking.</p>
<p>For many, the event, entirely organised by volunteers within communities, has changed their lives.</p>
<p>The NHS assistant director, who has since completed four 10km runs and a half marathon, said she was drawn to the event due to the lack of hierarchy and intensity normally associated with mass participation sporting events.</p>
<p>Of the almost 2,000 parkruns held each week in 21 countries, 25 take place in prisons – 18 in the UK, two in Ireland and five in Australia – where prisoners and staff often complete multiple laps of an exercise yard to reach 5km.</p>
<p>Next week, parkrun will reach another landmark by launching its first prison event in the UK for women only, following the lead of Australia.</p>
<p>The fastest recorded time at any parkrun was set in 2012 in Bushy Park by the British Olympian Andy Baddeley, who finished in 13 minutes and 48 seconds.</p>
<p>Charlotte Arter set the best women’s time of 15 minutes and 50 seconds in Cardiff in January. Notable participants include the Olympians Jessica Ennis-Hill and Dame Kelly Holmes.</p>
<p>But parkrun organisers, who are keen to avoid putting people off with competitive comparisons and are delighted for people to walk the course, do not have a record of the slowest time.</p>
<p>Sinton-Hewitt said: “One of the things that I’m most proud of is that every year the average finish time at parkrun has slowed. That means we are reaching more people for whom physical activity hasn’t been the norm.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, a second Time Trial, as it was then known, was started, not far away on Wimbledon Common. More followed, in England, Wales, Scotland and Zimbabwe, where Sinton-Hewitt was born.</p>
<p>For Sammy Doublet, 17, a sixth-form student in Brighton, it is all about running as fast as possible and trying to beat as many people as possible. “It’s my deep-rooted competitiveness that drew me to parkrun,” he says.</p>
<p>A Sheffield Hallam University survey in 2018 looking at the effects of parkrun found that the mental health benefits were as important as the physical ones – and it was not the runners but the volunteers that accrued the most. </p>
<p>And that’s a sentiment that echoes round and round the parkrun community. Parkrun plays a big part in a lot of lives, it has been sorely missed, and a lot of people badly want it back. Need it back, too.</p>

<p>For both women, the mental benefits have been crucial during the pandemic. Cook’s running club set members running tasks during lockdown: “They kept us going, it was brilliant. It really made lockdown so different.”</p>
<p>Jones agrees: “You think they’re judging you.” He tried and disliked other gyms (“just a room with kit and pumping music”) before finding a small, supportive one.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call myself a role model in any way,” says Jones, “But both my boys in their early 20s now take better care of themselves. I think there has been a kind of shared awakening.”</p>
<p>Organiser says requiring volunteers to confirm immunisation status of all participants would ‘fundamentally break’ its operating model</p>
<p>Parkrun Australia has cancelled its Victorian schedule indefinitely because of mandatory Covid vaccination requirements.</p>
<p>Under Stage C of the state government’s roadmap, parkruns are classified as “physical recreation” in Victoria and require all attenders to be checked for their vaccination status prior to the event for it to go ahead.</p>
<p>Parkrun Australia said the “logistics” of mandating its volunteers to confirm the vaccination status of all participants would “fundamentally break” its simple operating model.</p>
<p>Parkruns are also on hold in <a>New South Wales</a> and ACT.</p>
<p>“As is the case in NSW, we will seek to reopen parkrun events in Victoria as soon as vaccination status is not a contributing factor,” it confirmed in a statement.</p>
<p>NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has <a>delayed the reopening of the state to unvaccinated people</a> until 15 December, or whenever 95% double dose targets are met.</p>
<p>Marketing and communications coordinator, Scott Trickett, said he was “confident” the charity would be granted an exemption from the Victorian government to return soon.</p>
<p>“We just want to come back, but we’re waiting for restrictions to ease based on vaccination,” Trickett said.</p>
<p>“Parkruns have a simple operating model, all our 440 Australian events are delivered by volunteers. To keep that model, we can’t put the onus back on them to check the vaccination status of every participant.</p>
<p>“All our events are open, in open areas – we have no way of controlling it. It’s one of the appeals of parkrun, but one of the barriers too.</p>
<p>“We could implement a program to ask everyone to show their vaccination certificate but there’s nothing to stop someone joining halfway through. And we don’t want to put volunteers in that position with people refusing to get vaccine.”</p>
<p>Parkrun has been reclassified three times in Victoria throughout the pandemic from an event, to community sport, to physical recreation.</p>
<p>“We’re struggling to find reasoning why we can’t reopen, we’re an outdoor activity, the risk of transmission is low,” Trickett said.</p>
<p>Katie Johnson discovered running at the beginning of the pandemic, and quickly became a regular at Albert Park parkrun.</p>
<p>Between lockdowns, Johnson attended the Albert Park parkrun every Saturday morning with friends, where “hundreds of people” would rock up weekly.</p>
<p>More than 90 parkruns operate across greater Melbourne and regional Victoria, usually attracting about 10,000 runners every weekend.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Victoria’s department of health said fun runs could only go ahead if all attenders, including volunteers and runners, were fully vaccinated.</p>
