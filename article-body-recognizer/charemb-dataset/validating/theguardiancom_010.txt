<p>She was transferred to the Senkwekwe Center after its creation in 2009 and lived with other orphaned mountain gorillas viewed as too vulnerable to return to the wild.</p>
<p>“It was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature,” Bauma said in a statement. </p>
<p>“It was Ndakasi’s sweet nature and intelligence that helped me to understand the connection between humans and great apes and why we should do everything in our power to protect them.”</p>
<p>Bauma said he was proud to have called Ndakasi a friend. </p>
<p>“I loved her like a child and her cheerful personality brought a smile to my face every time I interacted with her,” he said.</p>
<p>Virunga national park in eastern DRC is home to some of the world’s last mountain gorillas. Neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda are also home to mountain gorillas, and together their population has recently risen to <a>more than 1,000</a>.</p>
<p>Nearly 700 rangers in Virunga park <a>risk their lives to protect its wildlife</a> in a region that has faced more than two decades of armed conflict and instability. </p>
<p>In late December, the incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, tweeted about her plans for the first hundred days of the Biden administration. She promised “to ensure Americans mask up, distribute 100M shots, and get students safely back to school”.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of responses was an angry tweet from a 35-year-old air force veteran in San Diego.</p>
<p>“No the fuck you will not!” Ashli Babbitt replied to Harris. “No masks, no you, no Biden the kid raper, no vaccines...sit your fraudulent ass down…we the ppl bitch!”</p>
<p>Babbitt wasn’t just tweeting. She had a plan to fly to Washington DC the very next week to take part in a major public demonstration demanding that Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, be sworn in as president.</p>
<p>Babbitt was shot to death during Trump supporters’ chaotic invasion of the Capitol, officials said, while four other people, including a Capitol police officer, also died.</p>
<p>In the days since Babbitt and other Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January, forcing lawmakers to flee or hide, her social media has been scoured for insights into her radicalization.</p>
<p>The QAnon conspiracy theory, although lurid in its claims about the torture of children, is very much a political movement, not just a personal delusion, experts say.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Babbitt had been sharing messages urging people like herself to take action, with messages like: “Your government doesn’t fear you anymore. That needs to change. ASAP.”</p>
<p>Babbitt was a small business owner and self-described libertarian. She owned a San Diego-based business, Fowler’s Pool Service and Supply, according to California business records. Her LinkedIn profile lists her as the company owner since May 2017.</p>
<p>In one tweet, <a>first reported by Bellingcat</a>, Babbitt said that she had voted for Barack Obama before voting for Trump. In recent months, she had become a devoted adherent of conspiracy theories boosted by Trump and others.</p>
<p>“She was screaming at me and verbally threatening,” the complaint states.</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Babbitt’s family were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Since 2018, QAnon has been identified as <a>a potential domestic terror threat</a> and linked to a series of violent and criminal acts.</p>
<p>Travis View, the host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, said posts showed that Babbitt was “100% a dedicated QAnon follower. She was not casual about it. She was deep into it.”</p>
<h2>The scene at the Capitol</h2>
<p>“You’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong,” Trump told them.</p>
<p>“It was amazing to get to see the president talk,” Babbitt said afterwards, in a Facebook video obtained by TMZ. “We are walking to the Capitol in a mob. There is a sea of nothing but red, white and blue patriots.” She was grinning.</p>
<a>shot by a Capitol police officer</a>, and that the shooting is under investigation.
<p>Lawmakers from both parties who were present at the moment when Babbitt was shot have spoken out about the dangerous behavior of the crowd.</p>
<p>“The mob was going to come through the door; there was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time,” the Oklahoma Republican congressman Markwayne Mullin said, according to Fox News.</p>
<p>In interviews, members of Babbitt’s family have defended her political views, and her anger.</p>
<p>“My sister was a normal Californian,” her brother, Roger Witthoeft, told the New York Times. “The issues she was mad about were the things all of us are mad about.”</p>
<p>Babbitt had served in the military for 14 years, Witthoeft said. “If you feel like you gave the majority of your life to your country and you’re not being listened to, that is a hard pill to swallow. That’s why she was upset.”</p>
<a>Lindsey Graham</a>, reportedly knew the agenda.
<a>an editorial</a> declaring, “Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.”
<a>trying to block</a> the formation of the 6 January committee to investigate what had happened.
<a>election laws</a> they’ve pushed across the country seem aimed at such goals, and voter suppression has long been one of their anti-democratic tactics (it played
<a>a substantial role</a> in Trump’s 2016 win, and the genuine illegitimacies of that election –
<a>foreign interference</a>, anomalies the recount might have uncovered had the Republicans not
<a>stopped it</a> – were appropriated as false claims for 2020).
<p>The crisis isn’t just that we had a coup attempt and have a political party that has gone rogue, but that much of the rest of the nation seems to be normalizing or forgetting or sleepwalking through the crisis. The warnings are getting more urgent.</p>

<p>A volcano that has been <a>spewing lava in the Canary Islands for almost three months</a> has quietened but scientists warned the lull did not necessarily mean the eruption was over.</p>
<p>Experts recorded no seismic activity from the Cumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma island since Monday night, the Canary Islands’ volcanology institute tweeted.</p>
<p>La Palma’s longest eruption on record has destroyed about 3,000 local buildings, entombed large areas of farmland in lava and forced several thousand people to abandon their homes.</p>
<p>No injuries or deaths have been directly linked to the eruption on the island of about 80,000 people. Life has continued largely as normal on most of La Palma, where a section of the south-western side is hardest hit.</p>
<p>The Canary Islands are a popular European holiday destination off Africa’s north-west coast.</p>

<p>Because? Well, take a look at the picture.</p>
<p>Or that bit from The Godfather? Perhaps.</p>
<p>Most of the conversation was about Kardashian, then? Obviously. She went to a listening party of her ex’s new album, Donda, sporting <a>a similar all-black mask</a>, while West has been wearing a blacked-out head covering, too. </p>
<p>Booooo (West, not the outfits). She posted another <a>picture of herself</a> in a different all-black leather costume, complete with full mask.</p>
<p>Is black the new black then? Possibly, unless bondage is the new black. One thing is for sure, though: it’s either absolutely genius … or else a bit weird and creepy.</p>
<p>Do say: “$30,000 a seat you say? Super, I’ll take a table.”</p>

<h2>Frank Ocean’s mechanical baby date</h2>
<a>softboi</a> (Frank, not Cody) is no stranger to red-carpet absurdism. In 2019 he arrived at the otherwise colourful camp-themed Met Gala in a sober black-and-white set, drawing comparisons to valets and security guards, and immediately inciting
<a>debate</a> about the definition of camp itself.
<h2>Whoopi Goldberg on vaccines</h2>
<a>Nicki Minaj</a>. Minaj gained instant infamy for tweeting a story from a famously reliable source (a friend of her cousin) involving intimate swelling and a cancelled wedding, by way of explanation for her absence.
<p>Whoopi Goldberg, on the other hand, was all for the vaccine mandate. In a red carpet interview, she said: “If you’re not going to get vaccinated you really have to question where you stand in the country.”</p>
<h2>Kim Kardashian West covers up</h2>
<h2>Billie Eilish’s bargaining power</h2>
<p>Continuing her <a>run of references</a> to classic glamour, Eilish paid homage to <a>Old Hollywood</a> in a peachy Oscar de la Renta ballgown complete with a four-metre train floating down the <a>famously hazardous stairs</a> of the Met Gala.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 people have arrived on Lampedusa in 24 hours as people smugglers took advantage of calm seas to launch at least 20 boats, pushing the reception centre on the tiny Italian island to its limit.</p>
<p>Four boats carrying 635 passengers arrived overnight, after 1,400 migrants had arrived on the island on Sunday.</p>
<p>The mayor of Lampedusa, Salvatore Martello, who has launched a massive campaign to vaccinate all the residents of the tiny island against Covid ahead of the summer holiday season, has urged the Italian government for assistance.</p>
<a>Italy</a> and I urge other member states to support resettlements.
<p>“I know it is harder to manage migrant flows during the pandemic, but it is possible to do so, and it is time to show solidarity to Italy.”</p>
<p>A police union official, Domenico Pianese, described the situation on Lampedusa as “literally explosive” in a statement which noted that about 2,150 migrants had stepped ashore on the island since before dawn on Sunday.</p>
<p>“If we have another day like yesterday, with an incessant succession of disembarking, it won’t be possible to manage public and health safety,” he said.</p>
<a>Italy and Libya were accused of deliberately ignoring a mayday call</a> from a migrant boat in distress in Libyan waters, as waves reached six metres. A few hours later, an NGO rescue boat
<a>discovered dozens of bodies</a> floating in the waves. That day 130 migrants were lost at sea.

<p>They call him Father, but as he sits at the breakfast table eating Cheerios with fruit and yogurt, giggling as he teases and is in turn teased, Archbishop Desmond Tutu looks more like a mischievous little boy.</p>
<p>“How about the one I ironed for you?” Franklin says.</p>
<p>“When a pile of cups is tottering on the edge of the table and you warn that they will crash to the ground,” he once said, “in South Africa you are blamed when that happens.”</p>
<p>It’s all just a performance?</p>
<p>The following correction was printed in the Guardian’s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 28 May 2009</p>
<p>The feature above on Desmond Tutu listed other Anglican preachers who stood against apartheid in South Africa. Included was Denis Hurley, who was a Roman Catholic.</p>
<a>he told the United Nations in 1988</a>, adding that politicians in the west who failed to support sanctions campaigns against the regime in Pretoria were racists.
<a>in 1984</a> that a British invitation to the South African prime minister to visit the UK was “a slap in the face of millions of black South Africans who are the daily victims of one of the most vicious policies in the world”.

<a>excess mortality figures</a>, and suffers from widespread vaccine hesitancy.
<p>Politicians, religious figures and activists from around the world have paid tribute to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the cleric, social activist and giant of South Africa’s struggle against white minority rule who <a>died on Sunday aged 90</a>.</p>
<a>South Africa</a>, Cyril Ramaphosa, said: “The passing of archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa.
<p>“Desmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead.”</p>
<p>The US president, Joe Biden, said he was “heartbroken” by the archbishop’s passing. “His courage and moral clarity helped inspire our commitment to change American policy toward the repressive apartheid regime in South Africa,” he said.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II said: “I am joined by the whole royal family in being deeply saddened by the news of the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man who tirelessly championed human rights in South Africa and across the world.</p>
<p>Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King, said: “I’m saddened to learn of the death of global sage, human rights leader, and powerful pilgrim on Earth … we are better because he was here.”</p>
<p> Desmond Mpilo Tutu, priest, born 7 October 1931; died 26 December 2021</p>
<p> Stanley Uys died in 2014.</p>
<p>Desmond Tutu, the South African cleric and social activist who was a giant of the struggle against apartheid, has died aged 90, prompting tributes from religious leaders, politicians and activists from around the world.</p>
<p>Tutu, described by observers at home and abroad as the moral conscience of the nation, died in Cape Town on Boxing Day, <a>weeks after the death of FW de Klerk</a>, the country’s last white president. </p>
<p>Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, a farming town 100 miles (160km) south-west of Johannesburg. The sickly son of a headteacher and a domestic servant, he trained first as a teacher before becoming an Anglican priest.</p>
<p>As a cleric, he travelled widely, gaining an MA in theology from King’s College London. Though he only emerged as a key figure in the liberation struggle in the mid-1970s, he was to have a huge impact, becoming a household name across the globe.</p>
<a>Tutu later said he had been “very hurt”</a>.
<a>It described climate change as “one of the greatest moral challenges of our time”</a>.
<p>He also spoke out against homophobic legislation in Uganda and <a>argued in favour of assisted dying.</a></p>
<p>Among those paying respects at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral on Sunday was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”.</p>
<p>“We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country. He was just good,” Mokwadi told Agence France-Presse, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. </p>
<p>Friends remembered Tutu as a man of deep faith whose charm, warmth and intelligence few could resist, and who was happiest when active on behalf of others.</p>
<p>“I love to be loved,” he told the BBC’s Sue Lawley when appearing on Desert Island Discs in 1994.</p>
<a>South Africa</a> in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast.
<p>“Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday.</p>
<p>In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity.</p>
<p>Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence.</p>
<p>Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”.</p>
<p>“We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country. He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter.</p>
<p>“His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building.</p>
<p>Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said.</p>
<p>South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”.</p>
<a>FW de Klerk died in November</a>.
<p>“Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.”</p>
<p>The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”.</p>
<p>The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters.</p>
<p>Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931.</p>
<p>In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards</p>
<p>The Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu “an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.”</p>

<p>As with previous closures, children of key workers and pupils from vulnerable backgrounds will continue to attend but all other students will shift to remote and online learning from Tuesday.</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that staff absences had been at “unsustainable” levels at some schools, with up to 25% of staff off in the week leading up to the Christmas break.</p>
<p>Barton said he “absolutely agrees” with the government’s guidance allowing schools to restrict attendance only as a last resort, but argued that school leaders would need to make difficult choices if there were widespread staff absences.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph reported that DfE sources were unable to confirm how many had actually signed up with agencies so far, but that it was “at least hundreds”.</p>

<p>The UK’s newly appointed chief post-Brexit negotiator, Liz Truss, said she would speak to her EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, on Tuesday amid renewed calls to rip up the controversial <a>Northern Ireland</a> protocol.</p>
<p>The cabinet minister, who is also the foreign secretary, said she wanted to negotiate “a comprehensive solution” to the agreement, which requires post-Brexit checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.</p>
<p>Allies added that she wanted to “hit the ground running”, but offered no further details on how she will handle the technical discussions about customs arrangements, which could have wide political ramifications.</p>
<p>No EU-UK talks had been scheduled in the last days before Christmas, until <a>the surprise weekend resignation of Lord Frost</a>, who had been Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator.</p>
<p>Ministers remain under pressure from Conservative hard Brexiters and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists to resolve an issue they argue has led to the creation of a border down the Irish Sea – and damaged the integrity of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Truss supported remain during the 2016 referendum campaign, but is popular with Tory activists at a time when Johnson’s premiership is in crisis due to a string of revelations about lockdown-breaking gatherings at No 10.</p>

<a>was critical to the successful exports of the spirit</a>. “Europe has a taste for Scotch and the industry will do better if we remain in the EU,” she said.
<p>Britain’s economy grew at a slower pace than first thought between July and September amid a poorer performance from health, hairdressers and lower trade volumes after <a>Brexit</a>, according to official figures.</p>
<a>Office for National Statistics</a> said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.1% in the three months to September, down from an initial estimate of 1.3%.
<a>trade barriers from Brexit</a>. Exports fell by 3.5% during the third quarter, while the overall trade balance – which measures the difference between imports and exports – fell to a deficit of 1.9%, from a deficit of 1.2% in the first estimate.
<p>In contrast, total imports to the UK rose by 1.1%, more than previously estimated, as a result of an increase in the import of fuels, goods and chemicals.</p>

<p>Gabriella Dickens, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Brexit-related weakness and supply chain disruptions were to blame for the weaker performance for international trade.</p>
<p>“While high levels of business confidence suggest that [investment] will rebound in 2022, net trade likely will continue to be a drag, as British manufacturers continue to be slowly cut out of global supply chains, due to Brexit,” she said.</p>
<p>Despite the weaker performance in the third quarter, revisions to the economic performance in 2020 showed GDP fell by less than expected in the year when the coronavirus pandemic first shook the global economy.</p>
<p>The figures cover a period before the spread of Omicron prompted the government to <a>introduce Covid plan B measures</a>, leading to a steep decline in trade for hospitality venues and other firms as more people decided to stay at home. </p>

<p>Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll.</p>
<p>Global <a>supply chain problems</a> prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world.</p>
<p>Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had.</p>
<p>The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages.</p>
<a>the crisis in September and October</a>. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country.
<p>More than six out of 10 voters believe <a>Brexit</a> has either gone badly or worse than they expected – a year after the UK left the EU, according to an anniversary poll for the Observer.</p>
<p>The Opinium survey – coming a week after<a> the minister in charge of Brexit, Lord Frost, resigned</a> from Boris Johnson’s government – also found that 42% of people who voted Leave in 2016 had a negative view of how Brexit had turned out so far.</p>
<p>26% of Leave supporters said it had gone worse than they expected, while 16% of those who voted for <a>Brexit</a> said they had expected it to go badly and had been proved right.</p>
<p>Among people who voted Remain, 86% said it had gone badly or worse than they expected. Overall, just 14% of all voters said Brexit had gone better than expected.</p>
<p>Adam Drummond, of Opinium, said the most striking finding was that Leavers were now more hesitant about the virtues of Brexit than previously.</p>
<p>“For most of the Brexit process any time you’d ask a question that could be boiled down to ‘is Brexit good or bad?’ you’d have all of the Remainers saying ‘bad’ and all of the Leavers saying ‘good’ and these would cancel each other out,” he said.</p>
<p>Post-Brexit changes to Britain’s immigration rules have triggered an unprecedented collapse in bookings for school trips from the continent, organisers say, with countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands now more popular than the UK.</p>
<p>While the pandemic has depressed European school travel in general, the number of short-stay educational visits planned in 2022 to alternative EU destinations where English is widely spoken is significantly higher than inquiries for UK visits.</p>
<p>The British government has said the collapse is because of the pandemic and that the <a>measures</a> are needed “to strengthen the security of our border”, but critics say they are unnecessary for under-18s on short, organised trips with teachers.</p>
<p>Eurovoyages, a big French school trips operator, said that as of last month it had received 53 requests for short-stay visits to Ireland next year, as well as others for the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>“We have received precisely two requests for the UK, one of which has already changed its mind and decided to visit Ireland,” said Monique Tissot Martel, the company’s general manager. “Schools have forgotten the UK was a destination.”</p>
<p>Tissot Martel said that French schools wanting an English-speaking environment were even considering going to Normandy, where British host families and youth hostels with native speakers were offering immersive English stays.</p>
<p>“It is really a shame, as trips to the UK were very popular,” she said. “In 2019 we sent more than 11,000 students to the UK. Next year it will be between zero and 100.”</p>
<p>In the UK, Susan Jones of LinguaStay, a UK homestay accommodation provider that usually welcomes 10,000 continental schoolchildren a year into about 300 host families in Chester, said the slump was “absolutely dramatic”.</p>
<p>Verdié Voyages, a French company that in 2019 sent 800 coachloads of schoolchildren to England, said it had received just 146 inquiries for UK trips next year, a fall of 80%. By contrast, inquiries for trips to Ireland were down only 40%.</p>
<p>“Requests are down for all destinations because of Covid,” said Marie Bayol, the company’s accommodation manager. The slump in interest for the UK “is due to Brexit, a second impact that makes our main destination almost unsaleable”, she said.</p>
<p>Edward Hisbergues of PG Trips, a French operator specialising in English-speaking countries, said that besides the passport and visa issue, business to the UK had fallen more sharply than elsewhere because of Britain’s day two test requirement.</p>
<p>His company normally books 80% of school trips to the UK and 20% to Ireland. “For next year it is more like 10% of requests for the UK and everything else is focused on Ireland, even though it is more expensive,” he said.</p>

<a>resignation</a>, when it came two days later, he had become mostly disappointed with two big government policies of late: the reinstatement of Covid restrictions and the hiking of taxes in order to pay the country’s way out of the pandemic.
<p>But those who have known Frost well over the years suggest that there may have been an overarching disappointment bearing down on the ministerial mind.</p>
<p>In the wake of the third New Caledonian referendum on independence from France, French president Emmanuel Macron declared that “France is more beautiful because <a>New Caledonia</a> decided to stay.”</p>
<p>The vote in the 12 December referendum – supposedly the finale of a 30-year process of preparation and consultation – <a>was an overwhelming 96.5% against independence</a>.</p>
<p>Macron’s centre-right Republican rival, Valérie Pécresse, has hailed the vote a “massive choice” to stay, while the emerging far-right candidate Eric Zemmour said the decision was final.</p>
<p>But New Caledonia’s future as a French territory is anything but settled and a return to the violence that wracked New Caledonia a possibility.</p>
<p>Only one side turned up to vote, and the result was entirely predictable. Only 43.9% of eligible voters cast their ballot as against nearly 86% in the previous referendum.</p>
<p>The abstainers were mostly indigenous Kanaks, who have been agitating since the 1980s to follow their fellow Melanesians in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu into independent statehood.</p>
<p><a>Many Kanak communities were plunged into traditional mourning rituals that can take up to a year</a>. In addition, a lockdown restricted campaigns by Kanak parties, which typically rely on villages meetings and tours by leaders.</p>
<p>The Kanak parties appealed to Macron to postpone the referendum but he refused. A last-minute court appeal for delay also failed. So the Kanak coalition called a boycott of the referendum.</p>
<p>Not only did nearly all Kanaks heed their parties’ call for “non-participation” they did so peacefully. Paris had sent 2,000 extra gendarmes and 30 armoured cars to maintain security – they were not needed.</p>
<p>A key question now is whether electoral rolls in any future referendum or local government elections will be thrown open to more recent arrivals to New Caledonia. Until now, only Kanaks and long-established settlers have been allowed to vote.</p>
<p>To open the vote to all the residents of New Caledonia would be “recolonisation” and definitively end the Kanak dream of independence, said Mathias Chauchat, professor of public law at the University of New Caledonia in Noumea.</p>
<a>issued a statement proclaiming the results “null and void</a> due to the ‘non-participation’ of the indigenous people of Kanaky.”
<p>The Pacific Islands Forum – a wider regional grouping – noted the boycott and said that “civic participation was an integral component of any democracy and critical to the interpretation and implications of Sunday’s poll.”</p>

<p>On a weekday evening, in between coronavirus lockdowns and curfews, Camille, Natacha and Cindy are out with a bright yellow plastic bucket of glue, two large brushes and a wad of A4 paper, each sheet covered with a single letter.</p>

<a>Julie Douib</a>, 34, a mother of two children, shot dead at her home by an abusive ex-partner who goes on trial in June and denies her murder.
<p>Douib had reported the man to the police five times before her death, but no action was taken. Stern began putting up posters denouncing violence against women in Marseille, later moving to Paris where she set up a collage collective.</p>
<p>“Suddenly we had people all over the place contacting us.” says Camille. “At the last count more than 200 cities, towns and villages in France had collage groups others in London and in more than 15 countries around the world.”</p>
<a>Europe</a>. In 2019, 146 women were killed in France by a partner or ex-partner. More than 40% of the victims had already suffered violence at the hands of their partner and nearly half of those had reported it to the police.
<p>The term femicide is sometimes defined as the murder of women by men but in France it generally refers to the murder of a woman by a partner, ex-partner or family member.</p>
<p>About 200,000 women in France are estimated to suffer domestic violence every year, but fewer than one in five go to the police and the problem has worsened during Covid-19 lockdowns, Natacha said.</p>
<p>A hotline for female victims of violence set up by the government received <a>45,000 calls</a> during the first three-month lockdown last year.</p>
<p>The government responded to the outcry at the alarming levels of femicide in 2019 with new legislation including 40 emergency measures such as <a>electronic bracelets</a> to keep violent abusers from approaching their victims.</p>
<p> Critics say the rules, which took effect last July, are being implemented too slowly.</p>
<p>Marlène Schiappa, a junior minister at the interior ministry, was formerly the country’s equalities minister. She told the Guardian combatting violence against women was a government priority.</p>
<p>“Of course there is progress to be made in France in terms of the rights of women. The subject remains a priority for the government. We must always do more as long as violence exists,” Schiappa said.</p>

<p>De Haas warns against making national comparisons because varying definitions of femicide can create a misleading picture.</p>
<p>Eurostat is coordinating an EU-wide survey on gender-based violence the results of which are expected in 2023.</p>
<p>An <a>EU-wide survey</a> in 2014 by the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency, the first of its kind for the bloc, placed France on the same level as the UK, with 44% of women respondents saying they had suffered physical or sexual violence.</p>
<p>The collages movement split last year after Stern co-authored an opinion piece defending the idea of biological sex. Death threats followed and Stern left the group she had founded.</p>
<p>Among the many and varied posters on the streets to highlight France’s femicide victims, there is one particularly chilling message that appears regularly: “We are the voice of those women who no longer have one.”</p>

<a>maintain</a> they have been in regular consultation with Prague and that there was no reason to escalate the dispute.
<p>But some on the Polish side concede that the souring of the relationship has as much to do with a communications breakdown as with the mine.</p>
<p>In addition to the lawsuit, the Czech government has applied to the European court for an injunction that would bring an immediate halt to mining in Turów. For citizens of Bogatynia, overnight closure would spell disaster.</p>
<p>“The consequences would be dramatic. We cannot even imagine that”, the acting mayor of Bogatynia, Wojciech Dobrołowicz, said. Closing the mine would leave thousands of people in the region out of jobs and halve Bogatynia’s budget.</p>
<p>“Even the prospect of 2044 is scary for us. It doesn’t even give us 50 years, which would be enough to conduct a transition that would be full, safe and without negative consequences for the region,” Dobrołowicz said.</p>
<p>Economic forces mean the writing is on the wall for Turów much sooner, some analysts believe. “The whole complex will no longer be viable in less than 10 years,” said Robert Tomaszewski, an energy analyst at Polityka Insight in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The EU’s commitment to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to carbon-neutrality by 2050 makes it imperative to ditch coal for cleaner alternatives.</p>
<p>In the short term coal also faces growing pressure from skyrocketing prices on the European carbon emissions trading market, which in recent weeks <a>exceeded €40 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub></a>. </p>
<p>EU state aid rules, meanwhile, limit Warsaw’s scope to provide support to struggling coal plants, so the decline of the plant seems inevitable.</p>
<p>The story of Turów is hardly unique. Coal still generates most of Poland’s energy and many of its towns and regions rely on coal-heavy industries that EU climate policy will make obsolete. But it illustrates a wider political dilemma.</p>
<a>78% of Poles agree</a> that the climate crisis requires urgent action. Many communities, however, are fearful for their future prospects without coal. And some politicians are only too happy to exploit those fears.

<p><a>Founded in California in 2003</a>, Palantir may not have been cold-calling around European governments. It has, at times, had a uniquely powerful business development ally in the form of the US government.</p>
<p>On 23 March, the EU’s Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) received an email from their counterparts at the US CDC, extolling their work with Palantir and saying the company had asked for an introduction.</p>

<a>by ambassador Pyatt</a>. A teleconference followed in December between Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp, where the latter spoke of “deepening cooperation” between them.
<p>Journalists who asked for a copy of the agreement were refused and it took opposition MPs to force disclosure via parliament. The tone then abruptly changed.</p>
<p>Greece’s data protection authority has since launched an investigation. The government says it has ended cooperation with Palantir and that all data has been deleted.</p>

<p>Since 2013 Palantir has made a sustained drive to embed itself via Gotham in <a>Europe’s police systems</a>.</p>
<p>The agreement signed in December 2012 with the French multinational Capgemini, subcontracted the work to Palantir and Gotham.</p>
<p>By May 2016 the issues were so entrenched that Europol agreed a settlement with Palantir, the terms of which they have refused to disclose. Capgemini, the contractor which brought in Palantir, also declined to comment.</p>
<p>The caution was well advised. Palantir has form for suing large public bodies, <a>including the US army</a>, and winning.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, Palantir has received €4m (£3.4m) from Europol.</p>
<p> Europol, as the data controller, said that such data was “treated with the greatest care”.</p>
<h2>‘The hottest shit ever in policing’</h2>
<p>“Those people who went to Silicon Valley, they were turned around by what Palantir had to offer,” said Mortvedt.</p>
<p>The system was handed over in 2020 but is still not functional. Palantir said that the problems were “not a function of our collaboration and, to the best of our knowledge, have their root cause elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Abortion became “probably one of the most endangered rights in Europe”, said David Paternotte, a researcher at the Université Libre de Bruxelles.</p>
<p>As some European countries restricted abortion, others took a quite different approach, innovating to minimise in-person consultations in a way that some experts believe could permanently change the face of abortion rights.</p>

<p>For Kay, the new law was a huge relief. “I am ashamed to say I had always been very anti-abortion during my younger years, however, now older and wiser, I researched my options and found out about telemedicine,” she said.</p>
<p>Kay and others were fortunate to have the treatment they needed when they needed it. It would prove to be more than thousands of women elsewhere in Europe could possibly hope for.</p>

<p>For Dr Dhammika Perera, global medical director at MSI, Europe is at a crossroads – and which way the continent goes will depend on leadership.</p>
