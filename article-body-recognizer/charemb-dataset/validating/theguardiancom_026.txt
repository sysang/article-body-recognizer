<p>Preheat the oven to 225C. Place the beetroot in a casserole dish. Coat in 1 tablespoon of the oil, then roast for 1 hour, until soft. Peel while warm and set aside.</p>
<p>Tuck in the ends of the pastry to seal the log, then cut the remaining puff pastry sheet into thin strips and create a lattice on top of the wellington. Place in the fridge for an hour to firm up. Preheat the oven to 200C.</p>
<p>Combine the remaining olive oil, soy milk and aquafaba in a jug, then brush all over the wellington. Transfer to the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, until lovely and golden.</p>
<p>Allow the wellington to rest for 15 minutes, then slice into portions and serve with the good old gravy.</p>

<p>For chicken-style flavouring 2 tbsp white miso paste2 tbsp canola oil2 tbsp chicken-style stock powder1 tbsp soy sauce2 tsp onion powder1 tsp garlic powder1 tsp dried sage1 tsp dried thyme1 tsp dried rosemary½ tsp ground white pepper</p>
<p>For turkey-style flavouring2 tbsp white miso paste1 ½ tbsp Maggi seasoning 4 tbsp canola oil (knead in last)1 ½ chicken-style stock powder2 tsp onion powder 1 tsp liquid smoke ¼ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground nutmeg</p>

<p>To seasonBlack pepper Pinch chilli flakes2 rice paper sheets</p>
<p>Combine the vital wheat gluten and torula yeast or mushroom seasoning in a bowl. Add your choice of chicken or turkey-style flavourings.</p>
<p>While the dough is steaming, prepare the stuffing mix as per the packet instructions. Incorporate the butter, then form the stuffing into a log and set aside for a few minutes to firm up. Lay the seitan dough over the stuffing log. </p>
<p>Add a third sheet of plastic wrap, further shaping the roast as desired. Firmly place your hand down on one end of the roast, and allow the other end to balloon out, mimicking the shape of a poultry roast.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease and line a large roasting tin.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven, rest for 20 minutes and serve.</p>
<p>Wrap the tofu in paper towel and press under a heavy weight for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Prepare a steamer basket. Steam the whole mushrooms for 3 minutes. Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor into rubble, then tip into a large bowl.</p>
<p>Lightly spray a frying pan with cooking oil and crumble in the walnuts. Toast over medium heat for 2 minutes, then transfer to the food processor and process until fine. Add to the mushroom rubble.</p>
<h2>Bacon-coated brussels sprouts</h2>
<p>24 brussels sprouts1 tbsp dairy-free butter, meltedSea salt and black pepper, to season2 tbsp smoked maple syrup or maple syrup12 pieces store-bought vegan bacon</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 170C. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p>Cut the hard end off each brussels sprout, then make a slice from the top to almost halve the sprout, leaving the base intact. Transfer to a plate and microwave for 1 minute on high.</p>
<p>Bake for 45 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the outside is crispy. Remove from the oven and drizzle over the remaining maple syrup while the sprouts are still hot.</p>
<p>Serve with other delicious finger food as a decadent dinner party starter.</p>
<h2>Herb-crusted lamb chops</h2>
<p>You’ll want to serve your chops with a potato-centric side dish.</p>
<p>For the crust ½ bunch flat-leaf parsley¼ bunch mint1 lemon, zest finely grated50g (½ cup) dry breadcrumbs1 bunch chopped rosemary leaves1½ tbsp olive oil</p>
<p>For the olive caramel75g pitted kalamata olives125ml (½ cup) kalamata olive brine5 black garlic cloves1 tsp balsamic vinegar110g (½ cup) granulated sugar</p>
<p>Cut the leek in half lengthways and wash thoroughly, taking care to keep the leek halves intact. Cut each half lengthways again to create four long “bones”.</p>
<p>Peel the eggplants, then cut a thin slice lengthways off each side of the eggplants to create two flat sides, then halve lengthways to create four roughly rounded “chop”-shaped slabs.</p>
<p>Add some of the reserved eggplant marbled fat and secure with more mince mixture. Insert a leek bone, white end first, and secure with more mince.</p>
<p>Firmly squeeze and smooth everything into a lamb-chop shape. Level off the mince and smear it over the leek bone to hide it inside, making sure the marbled eggplant is exposed.</p>
<p>Place on baking paper, then repeat with the remaining eggplant, mince and leek ingredients to make four chops. Transfer to the fridge for an hour to firm up.</p>
<p>To serve, divide the crusted lamb chops among plates and serve with the olive caramel on the side. Leftover olive caramel will keep in a glass jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</p>
<h2>Leftover Christmas roast pie</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook/chill 1 hr 30 minServes 4</p>
<p>For the rough puff65g wholemeal (or plain) flour45g cold butter, cut into 1cm cubes35ml cold water</p>
<p>Mix the shredded roast turkey, ham strips and diced leftover roast vegetables in a large bowl (if you have less of one of the ingredients, replace it by weight with more of one of the others).</p>
<p>Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden, then remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Serve hot – mash and greens would go down a storm alongside, as would a dollop of English mustard.</p>

<a>La Mère Brazier</a>, where the soul of Lyonnaise cooking had been created by Eugenie Brazier, the first female chef to gain three Michelin stars.
<p>At the beginning, in 2008, the idea – 54-year-old American, without a word of the native language, wants to be accepted as a proper French chef – seemed preposterous. Was he confident it would succeed?</p>
<p>“Not entirely,” Buford says. “The thing that I was most doubtful about was learning my skills well enough that I could acquit myself as a French cook. That just seemed a long, long way away.”</p>
<a>Bocuse died in 2018,</a> aged 91, having held three Michelin stars for a record 55 years.
<p>Does he think things have changed for good in those male-dominated kitchens after #MeToo?</p>
<p>Buford has brought some of that insider’s understanding back to New York with him. He is writing a sporadic column on French cooking for the New Yorker. He’s had enough of total immersion, he thinks; he is happy to reflect on what he has learned.</p>
<p>Having experienced some years of Buford’s chaotic relationship with deadlines, I wonder if that wisdom now extends to timekeeping. Is dinner ever on time?</p>
<p>“We weren’t really set up,” Freeman says. “Our business is more about people coming in and the ambience and brunch doesn’t travel that well.”</p>
<p>“People were going a bit crazy,” Freeman says. “Everyone was at home for long periods of time and we all kept saying, what can we do, how can we help?”</p>
<a>FeedtheNHS</a> campaign. Around
<a>25% of London Ambulance Service paramedics</a> are Australians or New Zealanders, and with huge numbers in the hospitals too, lamingtons were the obvious choice.
<p>“It was just something nice that we could do, and a bit of a taste of home,” says Freeman. “The people working there are doing such a lot for everyone. We just wanted to do something a bit lighthearted in an otherwise dark situation.”</p>
<p>As London re-enters tough lockdown restrictions, the lamingtons will keep coming. “Out of everything we make, lamingtons are the most labour intensive,” Freeman says. “They definitely aren’t the quickest things to make, but they’re worth it.”</p>

<p>When Brooke Blurton stood beside a lake in a shimmering blue ballgown and professed her love for Darvid Garayeli, it seemed to viewers of The Bachelorette Australia that the proud Noongar-Yamatji woman had finally found her fairytale ending.</p>
<p>While it’s true the months following filming have been filled with love and connection, there has also been profound grief and isolation.</p>
<p>“We’d just been on the show … and you’ve got a massive high and then tragedy. I don’t know, I was very close to hitting rock … ”</p>
<p>As she trails off Garayeli clasps her hand. “You lent on me a lot at the beginning, and we leaned on each other ... We both had moments where we would just cry,” he says.</p>
<p>“But it’s difficult to do that via FaceTime. I felt really like I wasn’t doing enough during that time, because we were completely away from each other.”</p>
<p>Blurton adds: “You couldn’t even get across the border to be able to comfort your partner who’s lost her sister. It’s not an easy thing … there were definitely moments where I was breaking down.”</p>
<p>“I read a couple of comments and it was like, I think these people just don’t get the meaning of bisexual, which is an attraction to male and female … I just was really frustrated with the level of biphobia that was happening,” Blurton says.</p>
<p>“It was pretty disheartening to read [the online comments],” Garayeli adds. “Being such a big groundbreaking TV series, people obviously wanted a certain result … so I get that.”</p>
<p>“I had been in control of my life literally from back when I was moved out of home when I was like 15, so handing over control … was one of the things that made me feel really uneasy,” Blurton says.</p>
<p>First Nations and inclusivity consultants were brought on board for the season, and elements such as the smoking ceremony to open the show were added.</p>
<p>Blurton says she understands why Chhina felt that way, but ultimately it came down to time constraints.</p>
<p>“We had some really, really beautiful moments … she made me some beautiful, traditional Indian food … and we also had some serious chats about IVF, which I thought were really valuable,” Blurton says.</p>
<p>“So those conversations that I hoped would have aired, didn’t. But mind you, I also see on a production level, there is just so much footage … they simply cannot fit that much in.</p>
<p>“Also if [production] had shown that, people would have been so invested in Ritu, then she would have left, and I probably would have looked like I just sent her home after that.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s just now [about] changing it up in different ways,” Blurton says. “Whether that’s a person of colour, whether that’s just solely a lesbian Bachelorette … a gay Bachelor, I don’t know. I would love to see it,” she says.</p>
<p>Blurton says she’s incredibly proud that her season brought unparalleled representation of LGBTQ+ and Indigenous communities to Australian prime time. On top of that, she says she really did find the love she was looking for.</p>
<p>I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost seven years, and our relationship has gotten stale. We both feel that we are not very happy, but we don’t want to break up, as we love and care for each other.</p>

<p>Alex was impressed by her fearlessness. “I had only lived in smaller cities and was a bit intimidated by some parts of New York.”</p>
<p>In 2010, they focused on travelling, and then bought a home of their own in 2013 – the day before their wedding. Their children were born in 2017 and 2020.</p>
<p>“Alex has made my life so much more adventurous,” says Amanda. “He’s expanded my horizons and I didn’t realise how insular my world was before I met him.”</p>
<p>In turn, Alex says Amanda makes him a better person. “She has helped me to develop my emotional intelligence. I’ve grown as a person and I don’t think anyone else could have done that. We are always finding out new things about each other.”</p>

<p>“The world as designed by men has destroyed many things,” <a>Cop26</a> delegates have been told, as leaders and campaigners warned that the climate crisis could not be ended without the empowerment of women.</p>
<a>80% of those displaced by the climate emergency</a> are women.
<p>The focus on gender equality on Tuesday saw indigenous women and politicians including Scotland’s first minister, <a>Nicola Sturgeon</a>, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, demand increased investment.</p>
<p>Alok Sharma, the UK minister and president of <a>Cop26</a>, said: “We know from our efforts to tackle climate change that it is more effective when we put women and girls at the heart of those efforts.”</p>
<p>Pelosi said: “If I ruled the world, the one thing that I would do is invest in the education of women. When women succeed, the world succeeds.”</p>
<p>Germany also announced that gender justice was to become a “guiding principle” for its €4.5bn (£3.8bn) International Climate Initiative.</p>
<p>Diaka Selena Koroma, an ActionAid climate activist from Sierra Leone, witnessed the devastating mudslides that hit Freetown in 2017 and was meant to attend Cop26, but her visa did not arrive in time.</p>
<p>“If women and young people who are most affected by climate impacts are not represented at platforms like Cop26, leaders will not feel the pressure to commit to climate targets,” she said.</p>
<p>Sophie Rigg, also at ActionAid UK, said: “It is all well and good hosting a dedicated ‘gender day’, but the UK government must commit to making sure that all UK financing on climate also tackles gender inequality.”</p>

<p>Thousands of people affected by Covid have had to physically separate from loved ones. Here’s how some hope to stay connected</p>
<p>Rebecca Miller is cooking up a <a>Christmas</a> Day feast – even though she can’t taste a thing.</p>
<p>“Even though I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell, I’m still cooking up a full vego roast, a big stuffed butternut pumpkin with roast veggies,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“We’ll do the things we normally do Christmas Day but without people. We’ll drink, we’ll have fun.”</p>
<p>The couple are double vaccinated, and are now mostly recovered. “It turned around quickly to feeling quite normal again,” Miller said. “It’s quite surprising how good we feel.”</p>
<p>Ros Ben-Moshe, an adjunct lecturer at La Trobe University’s school of psychology and public health, said it is critical for people to connect with others if they’re isolating.</p>
<p>“If you can, in some way, whether it’s FaceTime, Skype or Zoom, beam in to see another person’s face, that can be very comforting,” she said.</p>
<p>Emma Stevens, from regional Victoria, is expecting a baby boy in mid-January. It’s a high-risk pregnancy in a high-risk time, and she didn’t want to take the chance of catching Covid, even though she’s double-vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I’m so close now, and the numbers are up,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m actually really looking forward to some time, just me and him.”</p>
<p>She’ll enjoy mince pies and custard, and virtual catch-ups with friends.</p>
<p>Ben-Moshe said that finding things to be grateful for is another really important way to cope with being alone.</p>
<p>“Rather than focusing on the obvious downer of not being with family or celebrating the way you want to, spend some time with a grateful mindset,” she said.</p>
<p>“That will help steer your brain away from what you don’t have, to what you do have. That helps people from going down that emotional spiral.”</p>
<p>Tracy Crisp’s son is a close contact, so the whole family is in isolation in Adelaide. The 52-year-old said she had been really sad, but often finds Christmas a bit sad anyway, “remembering all the people that aren’t there”.</p>
<p>“But it’s fine. We’ve got pavlovas and cherries. It’ll be a nice day still.”</p>
<p>“I am frustrated that here in SA … I’m not against borders opening, I just feel like we could have done it later,” she said.</p>
<p>Ben-Moshe said another idea for people who are missing out is to look through photos of past Christmas celebrations with loved ones.</p>
<p>The Millers hope to be out by 3 January, which is Rebecca’s 50th birthday. But for now it’s home, the roast, and experimenting with food and drink without any flavour. Sangria is on the menu.</p>
<p>“Because it’s got lots of texture in it, with the fruit,” Miller said.</p>
<p>You’ve navigated Christmas lunch. Everyone has eaten and drunk well. Peace and harmony reign. So now it’s time to tackle the washing up. Or is it?</p>
<p>Certainly, it’s sobering to face a Kosciuszko-sized pile of grimy plates and glassware. But if you’re still feeling a post-lunch booze glow, experts suggest you defer dealing with the dirt – at least when it comes to caring for precious stemware.</p>
<p>“Modern dishwashers do a sterling job of washing stemware. Some models even have special glass holders. But personally, I recommend not using them,” he says.</p>
<p>“Wine glasses are fragile and need gentle handling. If you put them in a dishwasher after a few glasses yourself, there’s potential for accidents,” he says. “You lose not only your wine glass, but you’ve got a dishwasher full of broken glass.”</p>
<p>Repeated dishwashing has implications for the life of some stemware – glassware brand Riedel, for example, says its products can last up to 1500 washes in a Miele.</p>
<p>Unlike Iredale, he welcomes the ease a dishwasher brings to a boring chore. “I run all my glasses through the dishwasher – most are very safe these days and you don’t get any detergent build up.”</p>
<p>“It’s much easier to break glasses when you’re doing them by hand because you have to get right inside the bowl to clean them,” he says.</p>
<p>Feeling confused about which method is best? That’s because there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
<p>Many upscale glass makers now recommend using a dishwasher – even for fine-stemmed wine glasses – so if you don’t want to hand-wash, it’s worth paying attention to cleaning instructions when buying glassware in the first place.</p>
<p>Still, he remains firmly team hand-wash. His pro tip for successful washing after heavy, Christmas-style use? Leave it until the morning after.</p>
<p>And if your wine glasses have serious red wine staining, use denture cleaner. It’s designed to shift tannins, and it works with teacups too.</p>
<p>Another way to ease tension over the matter? Just reduce the number of glasses you use. </p>
<p>But what about the environment – which washing method does the least damage here? The science is not cut and dried.</p>
<p>There are many variables to take into account – different dishwasher models and also styles of hand-washing – from what he calls “the bachelor rinse” (just 150 millilitres of water and no detergent) to a full sink of hot soapy water.</p>
<p>“In layman’s terms it comes down to the energy source you use, how efficient that energy source is at heating the water and how efficient the method is at using water.”</p>
<p>Human behaviour is key. If you’ve got a 20-litre sink and you’re only washing 20 items, that’s a litre per item. If you’re using a fully stacked dishwasher that’s super-efficient and reuses water, it’s likely to have less impact.</p>
<p>And if you need more tips on how to maximise your next dishwasher load, Iredale has made dishwashers do amazing things at Choice. He’s even whipped up a post-dishwashing snack, served on plates washed during the same cycle, naturally.</p>
<p>“We wanted people to understand more about how their dishwasher works – and the boss was away,” says Iredale with a laugh.</p>
<p>A vulgar anti-Biden slogan made for an awkward moment on Friday during Joe Biden’s phone calls with children tracking Santa’s flight when a father said, “Let’s Go Brandon.”</p>
<p>The refrain, a sanitized version of “Fuck Joe Biden,” has been an internet sensation since a television journalist told race car driver Brandon Brown that a Nascar crowd shouting the vulgarity was actually saying, “Let’s go Brandon.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go Brandon, I agree,” a relaxed Biden responded, before asking Jared if he was in Oregon. By that point, the call was disconnected.</p>
<p>Much about the Christmas Eve exchange was not immediately clear, including what the caller intended, why Biden repeated the slogan and whether either knew the origin of the phrase.</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to requests seeking comment. Jared’s full name and contact information were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Trump asked seven-year-old Collman Lloyd from South Carolina if she still believed in Santa “because at seven it’s marginal, right?” Lloyd later told the media that she did indeed believe in Santa and had no idea what marginal meant.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be the substitute for a cuss word,” he recently told the New York Times.</p>

<p>When you’re a kid, Christmas is about the presents. Now middle age has made me maudlin, it still is about the presents – but in a different way. It’s about people’s presence as much as the gifts they give.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest: I didn’t exactly go gaga over these random gifts that now, inevitably, clutter my apartment. But even if they don’t “spark joy”, I can’t toss them. Every time I see these gifts, I think of the people who gave them to me.</p>
<p>But plenty of us are closet sacramentalists: people who may not identify with any faith who, nonetheless, have a sacramental approach to everyday life.</p>
<p>The journalist Nadine von Cohen <a>writes</a> movingly about her kettle that leaks everywhere and turns off mid-boil. Yet she can’t part with it because it once belonged to her cherished mum.</p>
<p>“When someone you love dies, everything they owned, everything they ever touched seems sacred,” she writes. “Whether or not you ever saw your loved one use or wear an item is inconsequential. It was theirs and so you vow to treasure it forever.”</p>
<p>Not every time, of course – that would be creepy. But these everyday hauntings suggest that ordinary life is no less a sacred space than within the walls of a church.</p>
<a>observes</a> the novelist Sandra Newman. “If I pick up a pebble, I put it down haunted.” Not just stones, either. Souvenirs, heirlooms, homes, stories and, of course, gifts: each bears the trace of people and their imprint on the world.
<p>But God does not remain an absent presence. At Christmas, Christians believe the giver behind all gifts shows up in the flesh: in the birth of Jesus Christ called Emmanuel, which means “God with us”.</p>
<p>That’s the haunting and mysterious claim at the heart of Christmas.</p>
<p>Despite surging <a>Omicron cases</a> of the coronavirus in the US, Joe and Jill Biden made an unannounced joint visit to a children’s hospital in Washington DC on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The US president’s visit to Children’s National Hospital was a surprise for patients and staff, the White House reported, and was believed to be the first visit to the institution by a sitting president.</p>
<p>Barack Obama made a holiday visit to the hospital in 2018, almost two years after he’d left office.</p>
<p>Pictures on Friday showed the first couple with young patients, everyone wearing face masks to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Children at the hospital were making paper lanterns and some read the Bidens their <a>Christmas</a> wish lists.</p>
<p>“You’re bringing us some joy,” Biden told the patients, and he also thanked medical staff.</p>
<p>First ladies traditionally visit the hospital around the Christmas holiday, dating back to first lady Bess Truman during the post-second world war presidency of Harry Truman, and they often read a book to patients, the White House reported.</p>
<p>Jill Biden, a community college educator, sat by the Christmas tree and also read aloud to children at the hospital.</p>
<p>The president also knelt to speak to a young boy sitting in a wheelchair and one girl told the Bidens that she has been a patient at the hospital for a month and a half.</p>
<a>of the new “first puppy”</a> who has come to live at the White House – Commander, a German shepherd dog, following the death of the Bidens’ old dog, Champ, and the removal of their younger dog, Major, after biting incidents.
<p>The White House reporting pool had earlier reported observing Commander being exercised on the south lawn in Christmas Eve sunshine.</p>
<p>Justin Welby, who led the Christmas Day service at Canterbury Cathedral, added that the past 22 months has also shown people’s capacity for compassion and generosity.</p>
<p>In particular, he praised those who have rescued refugees crossing the Channel to reach the UK, and volunteers who have welcomed and cared for people seeking a new life.</p>
<p>He told the congregation: “As a nation we have been … faced collectively as never before with our limits – our fragility, the contingency of life and our mortality. Millions have faced suffering and loss.</p>
<p>“We all face uncertainty, uncontrollability and unpredictability, from Sage and Cabinet to each one of us, from huge companies to those sleeping rough.</p>
<p>But, added: “There is no doubting our human capacity to solve problems and show great kindness. I’m sure the deputy lord lieutenant going around Kent has been inspired over the last year with what volunteers do.</p>
<p>“It’s not politics, it’s simply humanity.</p>

<p>Shetland and parts of eastern Scotland have woken up to a white <a>Christmas</a>, the Met Office confirmed.</p>
<p>As of 7am on Christmas Day, the weather agency said there had been snowfall, with more forecast for later in the day in the southern Highlands.</p>
<p>Aboyne in Aberdeenshire and Strathallan in Perthshire had some snowfall overnight.</p>
<p>On Twitter, the Met Office said: “We’ve already seen some #snow in Shetland, parts of eastern <a>Scotland</a>.”</p>
<p>A tweet from the Met Office also noted that snow had been seen in the Yorkshire Dales on traffic cameras.</p>
<p>“Up until then we saw snowfall across Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and Shetland. We have seen snowfall on Christmas Day, so it is officially a white Christmas.”</p>
<p>No further significant snow is expected until after midnight, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>On Boxing Day more snow is expected in parts of central and southern Scotland and the north-west of England, with the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning. Coming into effect just after midnight, the warning will last until noon.</p>
<p>A combination of strong winds and snow on higher ground is expected to disrupt travel. Roads and railways could be affected, with the possibility of power outages.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a Christmas weather warning has been issued for rain in Northern Ireland. Due to be in effect from 3pm on Saturday to 9am the following day, parts of County Down and County Armagh can expect heavy downpours.</p>
<p>The rain could also result in travel disruption and the Met Office said “flooding of a few homes and businesses is likely”.</p>
<p>London will see temperatures of around 7C dropping to 6C around noon, with a chance of rain in the evening, while Manchester will be colder, dropping from 4C to 3C later in the day, with a likelihood of rain after 10pm.</p>
<p>Edinburgh will fluctuate between 2C and 3C with no rain expected, while Belfast is likely to see rain all day and temperatures of 6C.</p>
<p>Forecasters say Cardiff will be around 8C or 9C on Christmas Day, but with rain expected throughout.</p>
<p>The Queen looked back on a year marked by personal, as well as national, grief in her <a>Christmas</a> Day message – the first since the loss of her husband – yet strived to strike a more hopeful tone for the year to come.</p>
<p>She wore the same sapphire chrysanthemum brooch as on her honeymoon in 1947, and displayed a framed picture of her and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, on their 60th wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>She also spoke fondly of Princes Charles and William, and their families, for their shared focus on climate change.</p>
<p>But there was no reference – either on screen or by name during the nine-minute broadcast – to her middle son Prince Andrew or Harry and Meghan; the trio having recently stepped back from royal duties.</p>
<a>The Queen</a> acknowledged the impact of the Omicron variant, having cancelled her regular trip to Sandringham in order to spend Christmas at Windsor.
<p>She was joined on the day by Charles and Camilla, Clarence House announced.</p>
<p>The Queen, whose speech was recorded in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, said: “While Covid again means we can’t celebrate quite as we may have wished, we can still enjoy the many happy traditions.”</p>
<p>The Queen also hinted at the prospect of reuniting with loved ones in the new year.</p>
<p>She said: “February, just six weeks from now, will see the start of my Platinum Jubilee year, which I hope will be an opportunity for people everywhere to enjoy a sense of togetherness … and also to look ahead with confidence.”</p>
<p>The Queen concluded: “I wish you all a very happy Christmas.”</p>
<p>The speech was broadcast hours after the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived for their annual morning service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, without the Queen.</p>
<p>It is understood the Queen’s absence from the service is a personal choice and follows a precautionary approach seen over the past six months.</p>
<p>The service, which is ticketed, is attended by residents of the Windsor estate and members of the chapel congregation.</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla were joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.</p>
<p>In the broadcast, recorded in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, the Queen said she had drawn great comfort from the 'warmth and affection' shown in the tributes to the duke’s life</p>
<p>With hundreds of thousands of Britons forced to self-isolate on <a>Christmas</a> Day, the spectre of Covid still hung over many people’s celebrations.</p>
<p>But, thanks to social media, people were able to share their festivities, posting pictures of their drinks, decorations and, of course, their pets.</p>
<p>The initiative was driven by comedian Sarah Millican, who urged followers not to “leave people hanging” if they were looking for companionship.</p>
<p>Breakfast shares included Christmas tree-shaped crumpets and various forms of sandwiches while others opted for biscuits, teacakes or early Christmas pudding.</p>
<p>Others took the discussion away from food, posting up pictures of their pets <a>dressed in Christmas clothing</a>, <a>wreaking gift-wrapping havoc</a>, and their own <a>forms of entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>The conversations sought under Millican’s campaign included offers of jokes and singing, simple conversations about how people were spending their day and empathic exchanges about precious moments missed during the past year.</p>
<p>Beside the entertainment, some shared how difficult Christmas could be because of loneliness or longing for relatives they had lost in the past year and received outpourings of sympathy.</p>
<p>Samaritans, which highlighted that its hotline was open for anyone wanting to talk, also tweeted <a>advice on calming breathing exercises</a> for anyone struggling with stress or anxiety.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Christmas miracle. Not only did my niece, nephew and I all test negative for Covid, so did the cast of the Old Vic’s production of A Christmas Carol. After days of uncertainty, our longed-for outing was on.</p>

<a>Robert Robinson</a>, of Call My Bluff fame. ‘Christmas a predicament?’ he asked rhetorically. ‘It’s more like a jail sentence – in a jail, moreover, where the prisoners are supposed to like it.
<p> For three days, sometimes four, life closes down. Whole families withdraw into frosty and unnatural proximity… the human race hides behind its separate front doors, celebrating the Feast of St Salesman by eating birds.’</p>
<p><a>Jane Bown</a> suggested a magazine subscription for children – ‘the one thing they wouldn’t break by Boxing Day’ – and a ‘multi-purpose penknife. Will open bottles and take grit from a horse’s eye’. Can’t see any potential problems there.</p>
<p>Caroline Glyn chose 12 umbrellas for her ‘absent-minded mother’ (one for each month) and a Beatles wig for her balding father, ‘to make him feel young and vital’.</p>
<p>The caller who ended a conversation with Joe Biden with the rightwing meme “<a>Let’s go Brandon</a>” – which means “fuck Joe Biden” – has <a>insisted</a> he was joking and meant no disrespect to the president.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day I have nothing against Mr Biden,” Jared Schmeck, 35, <a>told the Oregonian newspaper</a>. “But I am frustrated because I think he can be doing a better job. I mean no disrespect to him.”</p>
<p>Schmeck, from Central Point, also said he was not a “Trumper” but rather a “free-thinking American and follower of Jesus Christ”.</p>
<p>A traditional duty for American presidents, in 2018 it was nearly upended when Donald Trump told a seven-year-old belief in Santa Claus was “<a>marginal</a>” at that age.</p>
<p>Biden and Schmeck discussed presents Schmeck’s four children were hoping to receive, and how one, Hunter, shared a name with the president’s son and grandson. Schmeck said he was hoping for a “quiet night”.</p>
<p>Biden sad: “Lots of luck, dad.”</p>
<p>At the end of the call, Schmeck said: “Merry <a>Christmas</a> and Let’s go Brandon.”</p>
<p>Biden also said: “By the way are you in <a>Oregon</a>? Where’s your home?”</p>
<p>But the call was disconnected.</p>
<p>“Let’s go Brandon” originated in an interview with a racing car driver by a TV reporter who may have misheard a crowd’s obscene chant.</p>
<p>It has <a>flourished</a> in rightwing and pro-Trump circles – even being promoted by Republican congressmen and the Texas senator Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>Schmeck, a former police officer, told the Oregonian he was “being attacked for utilising my freedom of speech”.</p>
<p>“I understand there is a vulgar meaning to ‘Lets go Brandon’ but I’m not that simple-minded, no matter how I feel about him,” Schmeck said.</p>
<p>“[Biden] seems likes he’s a cordial guy. There’s no animosity or anything like that. It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner.”</p>
<p>Schmeck said subjects stoking those frustrations with Biden included vaccine mandates and supply chain problems.</p>
<p>He also insisted: “I love him just like I love any other brother or sister.”</p>

<p>A coalition of women’s rights campaigners have voiced their disappointment and frustration after the Law Commission decided to reject a proposal to make misogyny a hate crime.</p>
<p>Instead, in a report published on Tuesday, it recommends that the government consider introducing a specific offence to tackle public sexual harassment, which it claims would be more effective.</p>
<a>Sue Fish</a>, said the Law Commission had failed to address “widespread concerns about lack of action by the criminal justice system” and vowed to keep fighting.

<p>Organisations working with women in prisons around the world are not attracting the support they deserve, as even feminists shy away from helping people with “complicated” narratives, according to new research.</p>
<p>Lawyer Sabrina Mahtani, founder of <a>Women Beyond Walls</a> (WBW), said many charities and NGOs around the world were doing vital work “supporting some of the most marginalised and overlooked women” in society.</p>
<p>But their futures were insecure, partly because of insufficient funding from mainstream feminist groups as well as other organisations, she said.</p>
<p><a>In a survey</a> published by WBW, more than 60% of organisations working with women in prison said they were in a precarious financial situation, and more than a quarter said they may be unable to operate next year due to a lack of funds.</p>
<p> More than 70% said they did not receive funding from women’s rights or feminist foundations. “Foundations that fund feminist organisations etc [sic] are not interested in incarceration issues,” said one organisation.</p>
<p>A third said: “In the broader women’s rights movement it is very difficult to embrace work in prisons and funders exclude such initiatives. They base their argument on the [small] number of women [in prison] versus the number of men.”</p>
<p>Though there is a lack of precise data, <a>Penal Reform International</a> put the global female prison population at about 740,000 – not quite 7% of the global total.</p>
<p>At the <a>Generation Equality Forum</a> in June, more than <a>$40bn (£30bn) was pledged</a> to support efforts to tackle gender inequality. But, the WBW survey noted, “any attention to incarcerated women was notably absent”.</p>
<p>“We have specific portfolios focusing on LGBT rights, for example, or reproductive health rights. Why can’t we have specific portfolios focusing on women’s incarceration?”</p>
<p>The survey, Forgotten By Funders, features responses from 34 organisations in 24 countries, including Nigeria, South Africa, the UK, Australia and India.</p>

<p>Human rights groups are demanding Qatari authorities show proof of life for a feminist activist, amid growing fears that she has been killed or detained.</p>
<p>A Qatari official told the Guardian that al-Maadeed is safe and in good health, but said they were unable to speak publicly due to a request for privacy.</p>
<p>GCHR said they had received multiple reports that the Qatari authorities handed al-Maadeed to her family on 13 October. </p>
<p>Ibrahim and other supporters of al-Maadeed have said it is the responsibility of the Qatari authorities to prove that the activist is alive and safe.</p>
<p>“What we know for sure is that she is at imminent risk at the moment. She was either killed or detained, there is no doubt about it,” said Ibrahim. </p>
<a>tweeted</a> “Sheikh Tamim is the only one who can prevent the danger to my life,” a reference to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.

<p>Gloria Jean Watkins, better known by her pen name bell hooks, has died aged 69.</p>
<p>Her niece <a>Ebony Motley tweeted</a>: “The family of @bellhooks is sad to announce the passing of our sister, aunt, great aunt and great great aunt.”</p>
<p>The author, professor and activist was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1952, and published more than 30 books in her lifetime, covering topics including race, feminism, capitalism and intersectionality.</p>
<p>She went on to write Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center in 1984, All About Love: New Visions in 2000 and We Real Cool: Black Men and Masculinity in 2004, continuing to draw on themes of feminism, race, love and gender.</p>
<p>Since 2004, she taught at Berea College in Kentucky, a liberal arts college that offers free tuition.</p>
<p>“Oh my heart,” <a>writer Roxane Gay tweeted in response to the news.</a> “bell hooks. May she rest in power. Her loss is incalculable.”</p>
<p>The author of The Handmaid’s Tale added: “Her impact extended far beyond the United States: many women from all over the world owe her a great debt.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Aminatta Forna, the Scottish and Sierra Leonean writer, remembered meeting hooks in the early 90s. “I met bell hooks as a young reporter when I was sent to interview her for the BBC’s Late Show,” she said.</p>
<p>hooks’ family said that contributions and memorials can be made to the Christian County Literacy Council, which promotes reading for children, or the Museums of Historic Hopkinsville Christian County, where a biographical exhibit is on display.</p>
<p>Here’s a handful of her most memorable quotes:</p>
<blockquote><div> <p>The one person who will never leave us, whom we will never lose, is ourself. Learning to love our female selves is where our search for love must begin. – Communion: The Search for Female Love, 2002</p> </div></blockquote>
<p>The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others.– Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations, 1994</p>
<h2>On racism and white supremacy:</h2>
<blockquote><div> <p>Marginality [is] much more than a site of deprivation. In fact I was saying just the opposite: that it is also the site of radical possibility, a space of resistance. – Marginality As a Site of Resistance, 1990</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>All our silences in the face of racist assault are acts of complicity.– Killing Rage: Ending Racism, 1995</p> </div></blockquote>
<h2>On forgiveness and hope:</h2>
<blockquote><div> <p>The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is – it’s to imagine what is possible.– Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations, 2012</p> </div></blockquote>
