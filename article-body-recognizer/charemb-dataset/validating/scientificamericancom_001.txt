<div><ul><li>By Devin Williams on <time>November 12, 2021</time></li></ul></div>
<a>some studies</a> have shown just this. But Maynard Okereke’s life has been anything but slow recently. He just got back from a month at sea where
<a>he worked</a> with a team of oceanographers and roboticists to map the deep ocean and explore hydrothermal vents. That was right after he spent some time experiencing the sensation of weightlessness
<a>during a “zero gravity” flight</a> with a group called
<a>Space for Humanity</a>. And at the end of 2020 he even made an appearance on
<a>Shark Tank</a> to co-pitcha “plant-based chicken.” (The nonchicken chicken wowed the “sharks” and received venture funding.) 
<p>Okereke, better known as the “<a>Hip Hop M.D.</a>,” is all hustle for science. Recently he (virtually) sat down with the Springer Nature Black Employee Network to discuss his background, accomplishments and current projects.</p>

<a>in June</a>, South African researchers described

<h1>December Fires Raise Concerns Over Remarkable Colorado Drought</h1>
<p>Higher temperatures and a dearth of snow is extending the fire season</p>
<div><ul><li>By Avery Ellfeldt, EE News on <time>December 10, 2021</time></li></ul></div>
<p>Two wildfires ignited in the foothills of the Colorado Rockies last weekend, pushing residents out of their homes and stretching the state’s fire season past its traditional endpoint.</p>
<p>Authorities quelled the Miner’s Candle blaze Tuesday afternoon after it damaged several buildings.</p>
<p>Experts told EE News the December infernos raise concern because they underscore the effects of a remarkable dry spell in the Centennial State — which is seeing record-low precipitation across the Front Range and into the mountains.</p>
<p>Driven in part by rising temperatures, they say the dearth of snow so far this year has implications for waning water supplies and increasingly catastrophic forest fires in the West.</p>
<p>State climatologist Russ Schumacher, who directs CSU’s Climate Change Center, said in an interview that it’s still early in the season, and the state will see more snow in the coming months.</p>
<p>But he added that “this is not the position we want to start the snow season in, especially because we’ve had lingering drought concerns for quite a few years now.”</p>
<p>Farther east, Denver has yet to see any substantial snow. With every passing day, the Mile High City breaks its previous record for the latest first snowfall: Nov. 21,1934.</p>
<a>According</a> to the National Weather Service, the last time the city didn’t see snowfall for that long was in 1887, when Denver went snowless for 235 days.
<p>The irony wasn’t lost on Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D). “Hawaii has more snow than Denver? WTF?” he <a>tweeted</a> on Friday.</p>
<h2>‘Not a good situation’</h2>
<p>Two factors are driving the delay.</p>
<p>The La Niña climate event that began in the latter half of 2020 is likely spurring a particularly wet fall in the Pacific Northwest, while the Southwest grows drier.</p>
<p>Hanson of NOAA added: “You need below-freezing temperatures to make snow. And those have been a rarity so far.”</p>
<p>To be sure, snow could pile up this winter and into early spring, when Colorado typically gets larger storms. In Denver, forecasters say there’s a chance residents could see snow later today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>That’s good news in the short term. But the record-smashing dry season could have major repercussions for Colorado and beyond.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most concerning impact could be on the region’s water supply, which relies heavily on the snowpack in the Rockies.</p>
<a>according</a> to the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention Control. The second-largest among them, the East Troublesome Fire, started in mid-October, which Hanson noted isn’t “typical big fire season.”
<p>The ramifications will likely extend into the summer months.</p>
<p>“Not having that around, it’s not a good situation.”</p>

<h1>How Scientists Can Update COVID Vaccines against Omicron</h1>
<p>A microbiologist explains how Pfizer and Moderna would rapidly adjust mRNA vaccines</p>
<div><ul><li>By Deborah Fuller, The Conversation US on <time>December 7, 2021</time></li></ul></div>
<p>The following essay is reprinted with permission from <a> The Conversation</a>, an online publication covering the latest research.</p>
<a>microbiologist who has been studying mRNA and DNA vaccines</a> for over two decades. Here she explains why vaccines might need to be updated and what that process would look like.
<h2>1. Why might vaccines need to be updated?</h2>
<p>Basically, it’s a question of whether a virus has changed enough so that antibodies created by the original vaccine are no longer able to recognize and fend off the new mutated variant.</p>
<a>ACE-2 receptors on the surface of human cells and infect them</a>. All mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work by giving instructions in the form of mRNA that direct cells to 
<a>pattern of mutations to its spike protein</a>. These changes could disrupt the ability of some – but probably not all – of the antibodies induced by the current vaccines to 
<a>bind to the spike protein</a>. If that happens, the vaccines could be less effective at preventing people from getting infected by and transmitting the omicron variant.
<h2>2. How would a new vaccine be different?</h2>
<p>Existing mRNA vaccines, like those made by Moderna or Pfizer, code for a <a>spike protein from the original strain of coronavirus</a>. In a new or updated vaccine, the mRNA instructions would encode for the omicron spike protein.</p>
<p>By swapping out the genetic code of original spike protein for the one from this new variant, a new vaccine would induce antibodies that more effectively bind the omicron virus and prevent it from infecting cells.</p>
<h2>3. How do scientists update a vaccine?</h2>
<p>To make an updated mRNA vaccine, you need two ingredients: the genetic sequence of the spike protein from a new variant of concern and a DNA template that would be used to build the mRNA.</p>
<a>published the genetic code for the omicron spike protein</a>, all that’s left to do is make a DNA template for the spike protein that would be used to produce the mRNA part of new vaccines.
<a>fatty nanoparticles that protect the instructions</a> until they are safely delivered into cells in your arm.
<h2>4. How long until a new vaccine might be ready?</h2>
<h2>5. Does an updated vaccine need full clinical trials?</h2>
<p>One important thing to note is that if vaccine manufacturers decide to update their vaccines for the omicron variant, it wouldn’t be their first time making this kind of change.</p>
<a>sufficiently resistant to then-current vaccines to warrant updating them</a>. Manufacturers quickly responded to the potential threat by developing an updated mRNA vaccine to match this variant and performed clinical trials to 
<a>test the new vaccine</a>. Fortunately, this variant did not become the dominant variant. But if it had, vaccine manufacturers 
<a>would have been ready to roll out an updated vaccine</a>.
<p>If it turns out that omicron – or any future variant, for that matter – warrants a new vaccine, companies have already completed the dress rehearsals and are ready to meet the challenge.</p>

<p>The rapid spread of new variants such as Omicron offers clues to how SARS-CoV-2 is adapting and how the pandemic will play out over the next several months</p>
<div><ul><li>By Ewen Callaway, Nature magazine on <time>December 9, 2021</time></li></ul></div>
<a>highly mutated Omicron variant</a>. But its rapid rise in South Africa suggests that it has already found a way to dodge human immunity.
<p>Researchers are learning as they go, says Andrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “We haven’t had much to go on.”</p>
<p>“I was thoroughly expecting that this new coronavirus would adapt to humans in a meaningful way—and that would probably mean increased transmissibility,” says Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London.</p>
<p>“If the virus entered at a reasonably high point, any one-step mutation would take it downhill,” Otto says. Summiting higher peaks required the combinations of several mutations to make more-significant gains in its ability to spread.</p>
<p>Instead, he and other researchers suspect that Omicron’s rise may be largely due to its ability to infect people who are immune to Delta through vaccination or previous infection.</p>
<a>weaken the potency of neutralizing antibodies</a> triggered by infection and vaccination. Variants carrying these mutations, such as Beta, have blunted the effectiveness of vaccines. But 
<a>they have not obliterated the protection that the shots offer</a>, particularly against severe disease.

<h3>COVID Quickly, Episode 19: Mandate Roadblocks, Boosters for All and Sickness in the Zoo</h3>
<div><ul><li>By Josh Fischman, Tanya Lewis, Jeffery DelViscio on November 19, 2021</li></ul></div>
<a>Josh Fischman</a> catch you up on the essential developments in the pandemic: from vaccines to new variants and everything in between.
<p>Josh Fischman: This is your fast-track update on the COVID pandemic. We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research and help you understand what it really means.</p>
<p>Lewis: I’m Tanya Lewis.</p>
<p>Fischman: I’m Josh Fischman.</p>
<p>On the docket today, a court imperils Biden’s big workplace vaccination mandate..., </p>
<p>Fischman: ... booster shot eligibility expands, as does evidence the shots help ...</p>
<p>Lewis: ... and zoo tigers and leopards get COVID and their own vaccine.</p>
<p>In early November the Biden administration laid out a rule to get most American workers vaccinated because unvaccinated people were filling up hospitals. You’ve been tracking the backlash, so what’s the latest? </p>
<p>We talk a lot about boosters on this podcast, but it seems there’s always more to say. What’s the latest on who’s eligible for a booster? And should you get one?</p>
<p>But some states and cities have not waited. California, Colorado, New Mexico and New York City have already opened up boosters to any adult who wants one.</p>
<p>Fischman: Does it matter which booster you get?</p>
<p>Lewis: That’s a good question. The FDA has said you can get a booster of any vaccine, regardless of what you originally got. While all of the vaccines have been shown to boost antibody levels after vaccination, there are some differences.</p>
<p>Finally, the pandemic isn’t limited to human beings. It’s impacted a few animals in zoos as well.</p>
<p>There have been outbreaks at other zoos, too. Two lions and other big cats at the Saint Louis Zoo tested positive early this month. All are getting better.</p>
<p>It’s a puzzle how the cats got sick since the Lincoln zoo says keepers were masked. People can pass the virus to animals, the CDC says.</p>
<p>But if you have pets, relax. Pets don’t give the virus back to people, two veterinary studies done this summer showed. And pets themselves usually have very mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Lewis: Now you’re up to speed. Thanks for joining us.</p>

<p>Saladino: I am Raffaele Saladino from University of Tuscia in Italy.</p>
<p>Vitak: Then, much like today, when a researcher goes to start an experiment, often one of the first things they do is reach for their glassware. Well, today, actually, we use a lot of plastic as well.</p>
<p>Saladino: But 20 years ago in the lab, only glass containers because, in the mind of the researcher, glass is inert.</p>
<p>Vitak: He said inert, meaning that it doesn’t react with the chemicals you put inside it. But in reality, that is not necessarily always the case.</p>
<p>But the pH of the Miller-Urey experiment is much higher. In the original experiments, they used a pH of 8.7, which is more alkaline, or basic.</p>
<p>Saladino: Why alkaline environment is an important topic? Since under alkaline condition borosilicate can be impacted through blinds in the reaction menu, it is not inert it became a reagent. </p>
<p>Saladino: The attention was concentrated on modifying the atmosphere, on modifying the energy, the intensity, and modifying the analytical tools.</p>
<p>Vitak: And the role of the silica got forgotten entirely. </p>
<p>Saladino: There is the experiment only glass, the experiment only Teflon, and in the middle, there is the experiment in teflon with some pieces of glass added inside.</p>
<p>Vitak: Then they used a technique called mass spectrometry to analyze what each reaction produced. Mass spectrometry is great for figuring out what kinds of molecules are in a complex mixture.</p>
<p>They found that teflon produced very few organic compounds. There were more compounds in the teflon with glass pieces. But the glass container, by far, created the greatest number and largest variety of organic molecules.</p>
<p>The mechanism of exactly how the silica helps catalyze the reaction is not clear yet--but it is very clearly does.</p>
<p>The obvious question then is: Was there silica available in the early earth environment?</p>
<p>Saladino: The water is not suspended in a vacuum. No? The water is in geochemistry, it is surrounded by minerals. Borosilicate and silica are the most abundant minerals surrounding the water.</p>
<p>Vitak: The team has two next major objectives in mind. First, to try updating the experiment to model more closely the amount of silica that would have been available in the early Earth.</p>
<p>Second, they want to try replacing the silica with extraterrestrial minerals like, pieces of meteorite or rocks from other planets. Apart from just being very cool, that could give a more concrete idea of how to look for life in space. </p>
<h3>To Better Persuade a Human, a Robot Should Use This Trick</h3>
<div><ul><li>By Karen Hopkin on December 1, 2021</li></ul></div>
<div><p>A new study finds that, for robots, overlords are less persuasive than peers.</p></div>
<p>Shane Saunderson: Every year we’re seeing more and more robots, in greater numbers of tasks and environments around our world.</p>
<p>Hopkin: Shane Saunderson, a roboticist at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Hopkin: To engage with the humans, they also have to be relatable. For example, imagine a robot helping out in a care facility…delivering a meal or dropping off meds.</p>
<p>Hopkin: But could that kind of critical cajoling actually be accomplished by some clever coding?</p>
<p>Saunderson: The reality is if robots are going to take on those types of tasks they do need to know how to be persuasive.</p>
<p>Saunderson: And so any time someone had to do a task, Pepper would offer suggestions to try and persuade them and help them out. </p>
<p>Experimenter: So, what’s your initial guess?</p>
<p>Subject: Um, I’ll go with row 6 column 1. </p>
<p>Experimenter: Ok, and Pepper, what do you think?</p>
<p>Pepper: I actually think that we’re in row 7 and column 1.</p>
<p>Hopkin: Now…in the other half of the tasks, Pepper runs the show.</p>
<p>Saunderson: So Pepper was alone in the room with the participant. It was Pepper’s study, Pepper saying, you know, welcome to my study.</p>
<p>Pepper: Please take a seat at the chair in front of you and we’ll get started. My name is Pepper and I’d like you to join me.</p>
<p>Hopkin: The tasks were the same…tests that challenge attention and memory. But this time, it was Pepper the Experimenter…Dr. Pepper, perhaps... offering the suggestion after the person made an initial guess.</p>
<p>Pepper: Personally I counted seven police stations. Now, what is the final guess you would like to lock in?</p>
<p>Saunderson: It made people seemingly very uncomfortable with this idea of a robot not only in charge but using that authority in a slightly negative way.</p>
<p>Hopkin: And some were more bothered than others.</p>
<p>Saunderson: Everyone didn’t love the sort of dominant nature of the robot, but men in particular were very uncomfortable and seemingly had their sense of autonomy or status threatened by this cute little four foot-tall robot.</p>
<p>Hopkin: Does this mean there’s no future for robot nurses or instructors?</p>
<p>Hopkin: And if all else fails, just make it more adorable. Saunderson recalls a study in which engineers had designed a library robot.</p>
<p>Saunderson: It was just literally like a cart that drove around and put books back. </p>
<p>Hopkin: But the book bot kept getting vandalized.</p>
<p>Hopkin: Then those robots can give us a hand when we want help folding the laundry or doing the dishes or making the bed or programming the robots. No, wait…</p>

<h3>COVID Quickly, Episode 20: The Omicron Scare, and Anti-COVID Pills Are Coming</h3>
<div><ul><li>By Josh Fischman, Tanya Lewis, Jeffery DelViscio on December 3, 2021</li></ul></div>
<a>Josh Fischman</a> catch you up on the essential developments in the pandemic: from vaccines to new variants and everything in between.
<p>Josh Fischman: This is your fast-track update on the COVID pandemic. We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research and help you understand what it really means.</p>
<p>Lewis: I’m Tanya Lewis.</p>
<p>Fischman: I’m Josh Fischman.</p>
<p>Fischman: ... and what vaccines can do to protect you against it ...</p>
<p>Lewis: ... and the latest on antiviral pills.</p>
<p>We have a new coronavirus variant to worry about: Omicron. The World Health Organization is alarmed, and some international travel has been restricted. What do scientists know about the variant now?</p>
<a>Omicron last week</a>, and it was quickly listed as a
<p>Thirty of those changes are arrayed along the spike protein, which the virus uses to infect cells. The changes are in spots targeted by three types of antibodies against the virus.</p>
<p>We do know Omicron was already in the Netherlands before South African scientists identified it, and it’s shown up in many European countries and in the U.S. So it may be good at getting around.</p>
<p>One of the big concerns about Omicron is that its mutations will let it evade the immunity you get from vaccination or prior infection. What do we know about that?</p>
<p>For now, we’ll have to be patient and wait for the data to come in. But Sette says we shouldn’t panic. We should keep our cool, get people vaccinated and boosted, and be careful about exposure to the virus without overreacting.</p>
<p>Fischman: Finally, there’s been news this week about antivirals. What’s the latest?</p>
<p>In places where people don’t have ready access to vaccines or other forms of treatment, these anti-COVID pills could be game-changers in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now you’re up to speed. Thanks for joining us.</p>

<h3>Astronomers Spot Two Dust Bunnies Hiding in the Early Universe</h3>
<div><ul><li>By Christopher Intagliata on December 8, 2021</li></ul></div>
<div><p>The scientists found several previously hidden galaxies that date back to 13 billion years ago—and many more might be missing from our current census of the early universe.</p></div>
<p>If you’ve ever looked up at the Milky Way, you’ve seen what’s known as cosmic dust.</p>
<p>Pascal Oesch: When you see this band of the Milky Way, you can see these dark patches. So that’s really just dust that is obscuring the stars behind it.</p>
<p>Intagliata: Pascal Oesch is an associate professor at the University of Geneva. He points out that cosmic dust isn’t exactly the kind of dust you or I might be familiar with.</p>
<p>Oesch: Cosmic dust is not quite the same as dust we know from the apartment. Cosmic dust is really just very small particles in the universe that are consisting of just a few molecules, often containing carbon or silicate.</p>
<p>Intagliata: And—as in that Milky Way example—that cosmic dust absorbs the light of stars behind it, making it harder for us to see those stars with instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>But there is one way around that: Astronomers can observe the sky with longer wavelengths—using telescopes like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile, or ALMA. </p>
<p>With ALMA, astronomers can see even the dust bunnies hiding up in the sky—because as the dust absorbs photons from the stars behind it, it heats up.</p>
<p>Oesch: And so then, with ALMA, we can directly see the emission of this heated up dust even in the very early universe.</p>
<p>Intagliata: Oesch and his team have now stumbled upon two previously obscured galaxies using ALMA observations. The galaxies date back to the very earliest days of the universe, 13 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Oesch: So those are the first building blocks, right, of the galaxies that we see around us in the universe today. So these are the first kind of Lego stones. And apparently we have been missing some of those Lego stones.</p>

<p>The key to the creation of kombucha is fermentation.</p>
<p>It is the process of using microorganisms - specifically yeast and bacteria - to convert carbohydrates to alcohol or organic acids.</p>
<p>People have always used fermentation to preserve fish, meat and vegetables. Some of the procedures originally used in Asia have become a global culinary trend since the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p>The beverage is created through the action of a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, or SCOBY. It produces the drink through fermentation.</p>
<p>Usually, this is done by letting the SCOBY loose in a fermentation vessel containing an infused sugared tea.</p>
<p>Once the SCOBY is added to the tea, it forms a loose floating mat to get as much contact with the nutrient medium as possible. The mixture is left exposed to the air, and a complex chemical dance begins.</p>
<p>Acetic acid bacteria, such as Gluconacetobacter and Acetobacter, and lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, work with several yeast populations.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that Kombucha has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and even anticarcinogenic properties, at least in a petri dish. </p>
<p>There are various rumors circulating about how kombucha is supposed to be good for people:</p>
<p>It is said to help prevent high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Drinking it is supposed to make you feel more energetic.</p>
<p>Some believe it strengthens the immune system, lowers bad cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attacks.</p>
<p>But this has yet to be scientifically proved. Further studies of the health effects on humans under controlled research are merited. Some studies have even reported cases of toxicity related to kombucha consumption.</p>
<p>That’s why kombucha is not classified as a drug: it’s a refreshing drink with a lot of health hype.</p>
<p>To guarantee that kombucha is safe to consume, industry standards are needed for the brewing process.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Kombucha Brewers International has established best-practice guidelines to guarantee the safety and quality of these products.</p>
<p>In Europe, such an organization does not yet exist.</p>
<p>In any case, correctly produced kombucha is a harmless and refreshing drink.</p>
<p>But watch out: Some kombucha brews can contain between 0.1 and 2 percent alcohol.</p>
<p>Unless you’re looking for a kombucha buzz, be sure to avoid drinking it by the pitcherful. And that’s your serving of science.</p>

<div><div><a>Engineering</a></div><h1>What Is 5G? Here Is a Short Video Primer</h1><div><ul><li>By Michael Tabb, Jeffery DelViscio, Andrea Gawrylewski on October 13, 2021</li><li/></ul></div></div>
<div><p>You see it mentioned in countless phone commercials, and your phone might use it. But do you know how it works?</p></div>
<p>You’ve likely heard a lot about 5G lately. But what is it, exactly? </p>
<p>5G is the latest standard for mobile internet networks.</p>
<a>80lb. car phones</a>. And networks could only handle a few calls at once, since the Federal Communications Commission wouldn’t let them use much of the radio spectrum.
<p>Over the next few decades, engineers at ATT’s Bell Labs devised plans for a mobile network that could span across the country. They envisioned a dense network of hexagonal “cells” with transceivers at the center of each.</p>
<p>Different stations could operate <a>over the same frequencies</a> as long as they weren’t right next to each other.</p>
<p><a>In 1972</a>, electrical engineer Amos E. Joel Jr. devised a system for callers to stay connected even as they moved from one cell to another: a “handoff” from one tower to the next.</p>
<p>A year later, Motorola developer Marty Cooper <a>invented the first cell phone</a>: the DynaTAC.</p>
<p>It came to market in 1983, the same year that Ameritech—a company broken off from the Bell System monopoly before it was acquired by ATT—launched the nation’s first 1G network.</p>
<a>2G switched from part-analog to fully digital radio systems, a change that enabled texting</a>. Further increases in bandwidth meant 3G phones could access the internet, and 4G supported high-speed internet.
<p>And now we have 5G. The latest evolution uses new technology to connect users to the network more reliably and achieves much faster speeds.</p>
<a>can transfer data at more than a gigabit per second</a>, vs. 4g networks that typically offer speeds
<a>closer to 50 megabits</a> per second. And they do this with half the latency of 4G ones. That means it takes half as long for your web requests to come back. When you’re streaming a game, this translates to reduced lag. 
<a>more than just phones</a>. It could also link sensors embedded in everything from farm machinery to medical devices, forming the so-called “internet of things.” That’s been difficult with the lags of 4G.
<p>5G has required a host of new technologies.</p>
<a>wider range of frequencies</a>—for the first time, utilizing the super-fast millimeter-
<a>wave spectrum</a>. mmWave wavelengths are a few millimeters long. They are much higher-frequency than the radio waves 4G has used. Faster waves can carry more data, which means incredibly fast data transfers. 
<a>adaptive bandwidth</a>,” lets your phone automatically switch to faster, more battery-guzzling internet speeds when you need them, and preserve power when you’re just doing low-data activities like checking email.
<a>small cells</a>”: which are radio transceivers the size of pizza boxes that can be mounted onto street lights or buildings. Some could also be
<a>installed indoors</a> to create private networks for homes or other businesses. Since 5G is likely faster than your home WiFi, it could end up being your only internet connection.
<p>The fastest 5G signals travel by mmWave, but those signals can only travel short distances. So bringing those speeds to the masses will require small cell infrastructure—which still has a long way to go.</p>
<a>likely to change soon</a>—for the 17% of US subscribers currently using 3G, they should expect their phones to stop working sometime in 2022.
<a>Motorola DynaTac</a> brick from the 80s, which supported 1G.The big questions with 5G, though, are when we’ll get it, and what we’ll do with it once it’s standard.
<p>Currently, 5G is only available in <a>certain areas</a>, largely in the US and Asia. <a>But by 2022</a>, one-third of the global population should have access to it, and by 2025, more than half the planet.</p>
<a>may be left waiting</a>: the infrastructure is very costly, and many people in developing countries are still using 2G devices. This has led some to worry that 5G could widen the gap of internet accessibility. Since wireless access is a
<a>huge driver of economic growth</a>, that may only deepen economic division.

<div><p>Our electric grid is old and fraying, but new technology could insulate us from the possibility of widespread blackouts and cyberattacks.</p></div>
<p>What would you do if your electricity was suddenly cut? What if you didn’t have power for days or weeks? What if no one in the city or the state you live in had any power either?</p>
<p>The possibility of a massive, extended blackout may sound far-fetched, but recent events show there are reasons for concern.</p>
<p>In February 2021, an electric grid failure in Texas caused more than 4.5 million homes and businesses to lose power. Months later, wide-scale droughts and wildfires threatened the western US with rolling blackouts. </p>
<p>But what is the power grid exactly? And how might making it “smart” help to protect us all from the shock of widespread power failure?</p>
<a> if there’s an imbalance</a>, it can end up
<p>With new energy sources such as wind and solar power, maintaining a steady balance gets even more complicated. This is because power from these sources is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Before going too deeply into how our electrification system can evolve, it helps to know where it started.</p>
<p>The U.S.’s grid was born on<a> September 4, 1882, at 3 P.M</a>. Thomas Edison himself threw the switch.</p>
<p>He built the first central power plant in the country at<a> 255–257 Pearl Street</a> in New York City. The small grid it powered in lower Manhattan initially served about 80 customers, providing electricity to 400 lights.</p>
<p>Edison was devoted to direct current, or DC, where power flows in one direction. But his DC system had limitations because of its low voltage, which meant that the power station could only move current to lights up to a half-mile away.</p>
<p>Famous inventor and scientist Nikola Tesla thought Edison was wrong. He pushed for an electric grid powered by alternating current, or AC, where power regularly flows back and forth across a line.</p>
<p>AC grids are hard to set up because every generator has to be perfectly<a> synchronized</a>, producing electricity with equal frequency, voltage and phase.</p>
<p>The two would be locked for years in what was called “<a>war of the currents</a>.”</p>
<a> until the 1930s</a>. Because it was so expensive to build power plants and lines, state governments let power companies
<a> form monopolies</a> over large areas in exchange for connecting everyone to the grid.
<p>Starting in the 1970s,<a>Congress began to open power lines</a> to companies that could generate cheaper electricity. And many utilities started getting their power from more distant sources. </p>
<p>The delivery chain was never built to handle these loads, and no one had an incentive to upgrade shared power lines. This became a big problem by the early 2000s.</p>
<p>In<a> 2003</a> overgrown tree branches knocked out some power lines in Ohio. The failure cascaded, and 50 million people lost power.</p>
<p>That emphasized the need to improve real-time monitoring across the grid—which would help check for the warning signs of an impending blackout so the system could automatically prevent failures or contain them to small areas.</p>
<p>In 2007 Congress called for developing a<a> “smart grid</a>”. Since then, it has spent<a> billions of dollars</a> on new infrastructure with the ultimate goal of<a> fully deploying a smart grid system</a>.</p>
<a> high-voltage power lines</a>, direct current has actually become
<a> more efficient</a> over longer distances than before. And renewable energy sources tend to generate direct current anyway.
<p>More reliance on renewable energy also increases the need for big storage<a> batteries</a> that can quickly be turned on and off to balance supply and consumption even when it’s not sunny or breezy enough to meet demand.</p>
<a> say</a> we’ve placed ourselves at high risk for potentially disastrous cyberattacks.
<p>Russian hackers have managed to break into American power companies<a> at least once</a>. And utilities are<a> still trying to figure out</a> how extensively their systems may be compromised.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t necessarily blame smart grids. Hackers can target generators<a> even if they aren’t directly connected to the Internet</a>.</p>

<p>Jell-O, salad dressings, puddings, jams and jellies, marshmallows, tofu, cream cheese, low-fat hot dogs: they all have it. And in fact, without it, they would not look or taste like they do. It alters the solid-state physics of these foods.</p>
<p>But what is a gel, really? And how does it give these distinctive foods—and even some laxatives, pill coatings and cosmetics—their distinct gelness?</p>
<p>A gel is known as a “viscoelastic” substance. Physically, it lives somewhere between liquid and solid.</p>
<p>Gels are fundamentally composed of polymers—long chains of repeating molecules. Gelling agents used in food consist of either protein- or sugar-based polymers. They come from a variety of natural sources, including animals and plant parts.</p>
<p>But there are still other plant-based gels. The next time you pick up a can of soup, a jar of jam or a pack of candies, pay attention to the following additives.</p>
<p>Other plant-based gels are: Pectin: a soluble fiber found in virtually all plants. Carrageenan: an extract from red seaweed. Cellulose: the main substance in the walls of plant cells.</p>
<p>But despite their history and wide use, some gelling agents may not agree with everyone. For example, carrageenan and agar-agar have caused allergic reactions in some and abdominal cramps or diarrhea in others.</p>
<p>In the European Union, carrageenan is even banned in infant formula as a precautionary measure. No similar ban exists in the U.S.</p>
<p>That is all the more reason to understand if a gelling agent has made its way onto your plate. And that’s your “Serving of Science.”</p>

<div><p>It governs a lot of your digital life these days, but the story of where it first materialized is likely deeper than you know. </p></div>
<p>You’re surrounded by it.</p>
<p>You can’t send an e-mail without touching it.</p>
<p>You can’t watch your favorite streaming series without welcoming it into your home.</p>
<p>You don’t know where you’re going, but it’s tracking your every move and telling you to turn left.</p>
<p>It is “the cloud,” and whether you realize it or not, it has probably taken over your digital life.</p>
<p>But what is “the cloud” actually?</p>
<p>The cloud is a system of millions of hard drives, computer servers, signal routers and fiber-optic cables.</p>
<p>These elements are, in a way, like the water droplets, ice crystals and aerosols that make up a true cloud.</p>
<p>They are nebulous. They are constantly shifting. But they are in close connection with one another over large distances of space and time.</p>
<p>The cloud’s true purpose is to float unseen all around us, silently, creating ever present connectivity.</p>
<p>To understand why, let’s take a step back to the early days of the cold war with the Soviet Union.</p>
<a> Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>. That agency would create the rough draft of the Internet a decade later. It was called
<a> ARPANET</a>, and it connected four university computers
<p>ARPANET was the offspring of a novel and controversial view of computers championed by engineer and psychologist<a> J.C.R. Licklider</a>.</p>
<p>In 1962 Licklider, known as “Lick,” was put in charge of the agency’s Information Processing Techniques Office. And with his budget, he advanced a view of these machines that was<a> very different</a> from that of his peers.</p>
<p>One of the first visual representations of a network as a cloud comes from 1971.</p>
<p>It showed a couple of cloudlike shapes that would tie together the hardware needed—even if Dorros didn’t know which computers or phone lines would be working together at any one time.</p>
<a>By the early 1990s</a>, engineers had gotten used to referring to the Internet this way. But the idea of “cloud computing” really went mainstream in the 2000s. In March 2006 Amazon launched its
<a> first cloud-based service</a> as part of its Amazon Web Services, or AWS.
<p>Initially, Amazon just planned to build a platform to help other companies set up online shops. But it quickly started to recognize that many of the tools and databases it was building could be useful outside of e-commerce.</p>
<a> 100 terabytes of house pictures and data</a> rather than maintaining the necessary servers itself.
<p>The cloud can also give you access to more computational power than you can easily get on your own, letting you effectively use a<a> supercomputer</a> from your smartphone.</p>
<p>Cloud services generally fall into<a> three categories</a>: software, platforms and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Next, cloud platforms, such as Google’s App Engine, are digital environments that developers build their software to run on.</p>
<p>Last, cloud infrastructure provides server space that a customer manages remotely.</p>
<a> regularly track our digital movements and sell those data to marketers.</a> Cloud service providers can also collect data from applications built on their servers. This is often done to monitor efficiency, but some worry the data
<p>As we connect more of our daily lives to the cloud, we become reliant on a network that controls everything from who we meet on dating apps to whether our credit cards work.</p>
<a> from a company you’ve never heard of</a> can knock huge chunks of the Internet offline, it’s hard not to wonder if we’ve made a bad bargain.
