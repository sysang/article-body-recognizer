<div><p><a>Company Town</a></p><p> <a>It’s never too late to pursue acting. What to consider as you pivot to Hollywood</a> </p></div>
<p>Actors who have chosen to pursue Hollywood later in life as a second career share their experiences and advice. </p>
<h2><b>What are the career paths?</b></h2>
<p>Multicamera comedy is often its own career path because of the specific nature of the production. Directors of single-camera shows can be pigeonholed into comedy or drama, but many are able to bounce between genres.</p>
<p>Hernandez said it’s important to figure out exactly where your interests lie, whether it be directing multicam comedies or hour-long single-cam dramas, so that you can figure out how to work on your craft.</p>
<div><p><a>Company Town</a></p><p> <a>How to pay your bills when you’re starting out in Hollywood</a> </p></div>
<h2>How do you make money? (And what kind of money?)</h2>
<p>Career sustainability is one of the main reasons that directors want to go into television. Some direct TV full time, while others supplement it with other projects.</p>
<a>pilot episodes</a>, the first episode of a series which is used to sell the show to a network, as well as
<a>television shows</a>. The rates vary depending on whether you’re directing for a network, cable or nonnetwork show, how long the episodes are and what kind of budget the production has.
<p>Minimums range from $12,721 an episode for a half-hour nonnetwork show, to $25,432 an episode for an hour-long drama on basic cable, to $135,287 for a two-hour program on network prime-time television.</p>
<h2>How is this career different than it was 10 or 25 years ago?</h2>
<p>Before Windsor worked at Warner Bros., she worked at the Sundance Film Festival, and she remembers indie filmmakers not wanting to work in television, even if they were struggling to make a living directing movies.</p>
<h2>What advice do pros always hear that is wrong?</h2>
<p>Bennett said that there was a perception for years that the director has to be very tough. She considers herself soft-spoken. </p>
<p>“You just have to figure out what kind of director you are,” she said. “And, you know, I’m not gonna be somebody who’s yelling and screaming, but I will get what I need out of the take.”</p>
<p>When she’s directing a television episode, she thinks of herself like a cheerleader. She tries to bring positive energy and show that she’s happy to be there. </p>
<div><p><a>Company Town</a></p><p> <a>Explaining Hollywood: Your child wants to act. What do you need to know?</a> </p></div>
<p>Every year, thousands of kids decide they want to try to land jobs as professional actors. The learning curve for parents is steep, and the path can be costly.</p>
<h2>What’s some good advice?</h2>
<p><b>Get experience as a crew member</b></p>
<p>Pan said an executive once told her that TV directors are hired based on who can “win over the trust of the cast and crew in the shortest amount of time.” </p>
<p>Bennett was also a production assistant. She said that if you want to learn to direct, you want to be near the director, so try to get a job assisting the director or the cinematographer. </p>
<p><b>Apply to fellowship programs</b></p>
<p>“We are looking for strong voices and people who have that point of view that is unique,” Muma said. “So that’s your superpower. Lean into that.”</p>
<a>studio-run fellowships</a> — ViacomCBS, Disney/ABC, HBO, NBC, Sony and Warner Bros. — that train specifically for TV, there are many broader director training programs, including Film Independent’s
<a>Amplifier Fellowship</a> for Black artists, the
<a>CAPE Animation Directors Accelerator</a>, the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival’s
<a>Latinx Inclusion Fellowship Series</a>,
<a>UCLA Extension courses</a> and more.

<h1> L.A. Affairs: Empty-nest syndrome turned me against my husband </h1>
<div><div> By Marni Battista </div></div>
<p>When I crafted my first online dating profile post-divorce, I sought a man who wouldn’t make me feel invisible. Someone who wouldn’t take up all the space in the room. I wanted a partner who’d encourage <i>me</i> to shine.</p>
<p>I was done with rich men, men who seemed driven by title and expense account. </p>

<p>The new book features our favorite tales of searching for love in Southern California, curated from the beloved L.A. Affairs column.</p>
<p>I kept searching, dating all kinds — bartender-actors, a teacher or two, and an up-and-coming entrepreneur who sat his laptop between us on every date. No, no and definitely not.</p>
<p>Six months later, it happened.</p>
<p>We had a baby shower. We set up a nursery. We clung to the popular 12-week rule — that once a pregnancy reached that milestone, all would be well.</p>
<div><div><p><a>Lifestyle</a></p><p> <a>Afraid to make the first move? These 13 L.A. stories will inspire you to do it anyway</a> </p></div><p>The secret to making the first move? Realizing that we’re all afraid to make the first move.</p></div>
<p>Over the years, and after we married, he began to choose his own work less in favor of my work and our family. Just last year, he briefly became my full-time caretaker after a traumatic ski injury left me bedridden for months.</p>
<p>But when my daughters grew up and left the nest, and the role I loved as a mother became unnecessary, I wanted him to change.</p>
<div><p><a>Lifestyle</a></p><p> <a>Here are 10 of the best L.A. Affairs columns of all time</a> </p></div>
<p>On the day the last of our daughters moved out, I found myself complaining to my best friend: “He should go back to work now. He should find a job.” </p>
<p>Would I feel differently if the roles were reversed?</p>
<p>Maybe, I thought, I wanted him to change because what I was really terrified of was the freedom.</p>
<i>should</i> be. I would ask clients whether their partner violated their own “deal breakers.” Did their partner uphold those five or so values that trulymattered most?
<p>My husband easily aced such tests. </p>
<p>Still, one night, I just couldn’t help myself. I began bugging him about whether he had researched becoming a paramedic, a career about which he had recently expressed interest.</p>
<p>“Look, I love taking care of you. I guess I’m just confused,” he said, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>That night in bed, I melted into his arms, yearning to let go of my resentment and fear, only to remember yet another list I had made of things for him to do, all of them seemingly so urgent.</p>
<p>“What happened to fixing the grout in the shower?” I asked, my voice jarring him awake just as his breath had begun to settle into the peaceful lull of sleep.</p>
<i>. </i>Rather than focusing on my deep fear of shedding the mom role, or the terror I had about any number of empty-nester discussions, I was trying to control the only thing left: him.
<p>A mentor had once asked me to explore how my husband might meet my needs if I could take my hands off the steering wheel and let him meet me in a way that was authentic to him.</p>
<p>I wiped my tears remembering her words.</p>
<p>“Need a hand?” my husband asked as he entered the kitchen. I turned toward him and took his hands, appreciating his still-sexy accent, remembering the picture we took in front of that sailboat, leaned in and kissed his lips.</p>
<p>He had met my needs — is still meeting my needs — in ways I could never have imagined.</p>

<h1> L.A. Affairs: I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me whole </h1>
<div><div> By Kerry Brennan </div></div>
<p>I renewed my dating profile during the incredibly tedious shelter-in-place order. I knew I shouldn’t have, but I did it anyway. </p>
<p>I’ve been on both sides of the equation. </p>
<p>I went on my first socially distanced date in March after a few phone conversations. I liked his voice, and he seemed pretty woke to why his past relationship didn’t work out. I really thought he might be special. </p>
<p>As I quickly concluded our date, he leaned out of his window and asked for a kiss. </p>

<p>Oh, my God, no. I had zero remorse blocking his number. Zero attachment equals no FOMO fantasy that I may have cooked up after contemplating photos of him surfing some exotic shoreline or ruffling the head of his doe-eyed Labrador retriever.</p>
<p>I know that conventional wisdom says, ‘Don’t date your roommate.’ But this felt different. </p>
<p>I forgot about the lawyer and chatted with the other guy in my dating queue. </p>
<p>I distracted myself from my quarantine existence with daily chores. </p>
<p>He saw me — and ignored me. I didn’t wave or smile either. I felt too exposed, vulnerable and horribly rejected. As I watched him ride away, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me whole. </p>
<p>We were engaged but in no rush to be married. Our lives in 2019 were oriented toward the fulfillment of our future selves. Coronavirus erased that.</p>
<p>The truth is, I am a self-sufficient, adult woman. I was possibly rejected and yet I am also still safe — viral apocalypse or not. Just like that, the whole incident lost momentum and I stopped thinking about the lawyer. </p>
<p>Not once in all those years did I get the vibe that he wanted to reconcile. Not once. And it seemed to me that he just turned the page. We didn’t work out, so it was history. Maybe I had to turn the page too. </p>
<p>Introspection is worthless if it doesn’t change your life for the better. The fact that I was able to see this tiny, infinitesimal snub for what it was and move on with my day equaled success in my book.</p>
<p>My pandemic dating life is a set of Russian nesting dolls. As the weeks melt into months, each hollow figurine reveals yet another degree of social adjustment, anxiety, indecision and ultimately acceptance of a new dating normal. </p>
<p>I deleted the dating app again, but I haven’t given up on online romance. I think I’ll wait a while and see how this pandemic pans out.</p>
<h1> L.A. Affairs: I’d been single for 32 years. Then he walked in </h1>

<p>No thank you, he’d said. “I think I’ll just eat my trail mix.” </p>

<p>I admit to having some bruised feelings as I made my way out of the observation car and headed for lunch. But we’d seemed to really hit if off. Maybe he just wasn’t hungry?</p>
<p>When I made my way back through the observation car, he was still sitting there. But a new passenger — a young man — was in the seat I had earlier occupied. </p>
<p>I decided to be uncharacteristicly bold. I decided to give him one more chance. I patted him on the shoulder as I walked by and said, “You didn’t save my seat!” The young man bolted straight up and offered me the seat back. </p>

<p>Still, as we exchanged contact information, I couldn’t help but wonder if I would ever hear from him again. Soon we were in Denver being shuttled away and Thanksgiving was in the air.</p>
<p>That Friday, Paul texted me. “I really enjoyed our conversation,” he said, “Hope you had a fun Thanksgiving!” He said he was heading back to California the next morning, once again aboard the Zephyr. </p>
<p>My heart leapt. As luck would have it, “I am on the same train,” I texted back. “Hope to see you ...” </p>
<p>If you asked me during the early days of my marriage, I would have told you our 20th anniversary would be spent at the Eiffel Tower with baguettes and romance, not in my dining room with pandemic takeout and bickering.</p>
<p>We just looked at each other, unsure of what to do next. We both moved in for a hug. It turned into a kiss that surprised us both — and was spotted by my shocked daughter, who had arrived to pick me up. </p>
<p>“What was that?” she said as soon as I was within earshot.</p>
<p>Walking our little dog Foxy at Hendry’s Beach and the Douglas Family Preserve has been so invigorating to me that it has given me a new outlook on life.</p>
<i>32 years</i>. I was not looking for love. I thought my life was full and felt that I had a happy life.
<p>It has been so very unexpected to find myself falling in love at this time of my life. </p>
<p>But it has been <i>so</i> wonderful learning to love again.</p>

<p>I joined Jdate and then Match.com. I made it through several one-date experiences that could warrant their own sitcom (or a “how-to-not” handbook).</p>
<p>One man clearly just wanted someone to invest in his new business. I got up and walked out of the lunch we’d been having at Las Brisas in Laguna Beach. </p>

<h1> Hospice reforms to become law after Times investigation reveals widespread fraud, abuse </h1>
<div><div> By Kim Christensen, <div>Ben Poston</div></div></div>
<p>Decades of unchecked growth in the California hospice industry will come to a halt Jan. 1, when a moratorium on new licenses takes effect along with reforms aimed at curbing widespread fraud in end-of-life care.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bills into law Monday. An <a>extensive examination</a> by the state auditor also is underway to identify deficiencies and recommend improvements to hospice licensing and oversight.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion has spawned widespread fraud, negligence and mistreatment of some of California’s most vulnerable residents, the newspaper found.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>End-of-life care has boomed in California. So has fraud targeting older Americans</a> </p></div>
<p>Nowhere has the hospice industry’s growth been more explosive, and its harmful side effects more evident, than in Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County’s hospices multiplied sixfold in the last decade, accounting for more than half of the state’s roughly 1,200 Medicare-certified providers last year, The Times’ analysis of federal healthcare data<b> </b>showed. </p>
<p>Scores of hospices have sprung up along a corridor stretching west from the San Gabriel Valley through the San Fernando Valley, which had<b> </b>the highest concentration of providers in the nation. </p>
<p>Glendale had 60 hospices, while Burbank had 61 and Van Nuys 63. New York state and Florida each had fewer than 50.</p>
<p>The moratorium is tied to a comprehensive audit requested by state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), the author of <a>Senate Bill 664,</a> which mandates it.</p>
<li>Evaluate the growth of hospice providers in California over the last decade, as well as factors that led to it, and determine whether other states have experienced similar expansion and taken steps to address it.</li>
<li>Assess the scope of hospice fraud and abuse in California and their impact on the Medicare and Medi-Cal programs, which pay for most end-of-life care.</li>
<li>Identify the most prevalent types of hospice fraud and whether state regulators could do more to protect older Californians.</li>
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of California’s systems to identify, address, prosecute and deter hospice fraud and whether more resources are needed.</li>
<li>Assess the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of state systems to screen and license new hospice providers.</li>
<p>To qualify for hospice, patients must be certified as terminally ill by their attending physicians, if they have them, and by a hospice doctor.</p>
<div><div><div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>What you need to know if you or a loved one requires end-of-life care</a> </p></div><p>Choosing a reputable hospice can be a challenging task at an emotional time for families.</p></div> </div>
<p>But many of those signed up by recruiters with promises of medical care, equipment or housekeeping services were not dying, The Times found. Some later learned they had signed away their rights to lifesaving emergency medical treatment.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks), <a>Assembly Bill 1280</a> prohibits hospice providers or their agents from paying recruiters or others for patient referrals.</p>
<p>“A lot depends on what comes of the state audit that is underway,” he said. “Hopefully it will pave the way for comprehensive oversight reforms.”</p>

<h1> Former USC campus gynecologist’s accusers call for investigation of top university officials </h1>
<div><div> By Paul PringleStaff Writer </div></div>
<a>cost C.L. Max Nikias</a> the school presidency and the university
<a>more than $1.1 billion</a> in legal settlements.
<p>But there was at least one prominent person detectives never approached for an interview, The Times has learned: Nikias himself.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>A secret USC payout had a catch: Images of ex-dean using drugs had to be given up</a> </p></div>
<p>USC entered into a secret legal settlement with the family of a young woman who had a drug-fueled relationship with the university’s medical dean, Carmen Puliafito, The Times has learned.</p>
<a>cover up the allegations</a> against the doctor, something Nikias has denied doing.
<a>Jerry Sandusky</a> and former Michigan State University physician
<a>Larry Nassar,</a> authorities broadened their investigations to examine how university administrators responded to complaints about the abuse.
<a>stepped down as president</a> amid an uproar after The Times’ investigation detailed decades of allegations against Tyndall.
<p>Tyndall, 74, faces more than 30 charges accusing him of sexually abusing patients at the campus health center between 2009 and 2016. He has <a>pleaded not guilty.</a></p>
<p>Nikias, who was USC president from 2010 to 2018, declined to be interviewed by The Times but provided written answers to questions submitted through his attorney.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>For USC women, largest-ever sex abuse payout leaves bitterness, vast disparities</a> </p></div>
<p>USC’s $1.1 billion settlements to former patients of Dr. George Tyndall was the largest sex-abuse payout in education history. Behind the numbers lies a lopsided economic landscape.</p>
<p>Dist. Atty. George Gascón, LAPD Chief Michel Moore and state Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta declined through spokespeople to be interviewed for this article, and their representatives did not answer several written questions submitted by The Times.</p>
<p>“I was not part of any elite group or anything like that with regard to the university,” she added. She said her relationship with Nikias was “very formal…. We were not close. We were not buddies.”</p>
<p>In his statement, Nikias said he met Lacey on occasion but “never had a business or social relationship” with her.</p>
<p>“At the very minimum, interviews should have been conducted” of USC administrators, he said.</p>
<p>“This is like ‘Criminal Investigation 101,’” Giacalone said.</p>
<p>Legal experts said detectives could have examined whether administrators broke other state laws, including obstructing law enforcement and destroying or concealing evidence during an investigation.</p>
<a>still hold professorships</a> at the university. Nikias is also a life trustee on the USC board.
<p>“It sickens me for them to still be working there,” said Riley Ransom, a 2018 graduate.</p>
<p>Another of the women in the Tyndall case, Ja’Mesha Morgan, who earned a law degree from Gould, said keeping Nikias and Quick on campus “really shows that USC has no intention of being accountable.”</p>
<p>A USC grad himself, Manly had called on the state attorney general’s office three years ago to take over the Tyndall investigation. He said the office never responded.</p>
<p>Manly said it was “shocking” that the attorney general’s office did not investigate, and he noted that both the state attorney general and the county district attorney are elected officials. </p>

<h1> A top LAFD official accessed confidential complaint files while he was under investigation </h1>
<div><div> By Paul PringleStaff Writer </div></div>
<a>during the Palisades fire</a>.
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>LAFD received complaints that a top official was drunk on duty. Some say it was covered up</a> </p></div>
<p>The L.A. Fire Department’s top administrative commander reportedly appeared to be intoxicated at work during the Palisades fire, records show.</p>
<a>have asked for a federal investigation</a> of what they alleged are discriminatory and corrupt practices in the department, a request the U.S. attorney’s office
<a>has said it is reviewing</a>.
<p>In a statement to The Times, Terrazas defended in a general way the department’s handling of the Mathis case. “The department follows all aspects of the investigatory procedure to ensure due process for all our employees,” he said.</p>
<p>The president of Los Angeles Women in the Fire Service, Battalion Chief Kris Larson, echoed that sentiment, saying, “I don’t even know how to comment on that. Nothing shocks me anymore.”</p>
<p>Several members of the Fire Commission told The Times the department had not informed the civilian panel about Mathis’ accessing the system. </p>
<p>“That’s very inappropriate behavior,” Commission President Jimmie Woods-Gray said in reference to Mathis. “It’s a lot of nerve.”</p>
<p>Woods-Gray said the department often keeps the commission in the dark about allegations of misconduct. “We really don’t get much information,” she added. “They don’t tell you anything unless they’re asked.”</p>
<p>Representatives of the organizations of nonwhite and female firefighters contend Feuer’s use of the private firm is a means of keeping information embarrassing to the department from public view.</p>
<p>Getuiza said that once the firm completes its investigation, Terrazas will decide what, if any, discipline Mathis will face. She said any findings implicating Terrazas in wrongdoing will be referred to the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>She said in an interview that the Mathis scandal reflects a larger problem in the department of too many firefighters being “allowed to act with impunity.”</p>
<a>reported on allegations</a> of female firefighters being subjected to hazing, retaliation and discrimination, with one saying she faced threats of sexual violence after she complained.
<p>“The mayor is part of the problem, and the union is a lackey for the chief,” said Butler, who retired this month as an assistant chief. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Garcetti did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>UFLAC President Freddy Escobar rejected the criticism of the chief and the union, describing it in a statement as “the same old quotes from the same small group of people.”</p>
<p>Escobar said the LAFD “has made tremendous progress on issues related to discrimination, diversity, and inclusion. ... Chief Terrazas has been a critical part of this progress and UFLAC does not support any calls for his termination.”</p>

<h1> A drama professor told students they got their feelings hurt too easily. They decided to fight back </h1>
<div><div> By Jenny JarvieAtlanta Bureau Chief </div></div>
<p>It all started with a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>A Black theater student at Coastal Carolina University told a visiting drama teacher she wanted to connect with nonwhite students, so the teacher drew up a list of names on a whiteboard, then forgot to erase it when they left the studio.</p>
<p>When several other students walked in, they saw the list and were left with the suspicion that those on it had been singled out with racist intent.</p>
<p>The visiting teacher also wrote an apology: “No matter the good intention. ... I still want you to know I’m an idiot and I am sorry.”</p>
<p>Things might have ended there. But at a time when college campuses have become center stage for the polarizing issues of race, identity and what constitutes harm, the theater department was primed for conflict. </p>
<p>Within minutes, his iPad lit up with messages, mostly from Black theater majors.</p>
<p>“Thinking like that is part of the problem,” wrote Kelis Herriott, a 21-year-old senior. “This department is a joke.”</p>
<p>“Grow up. Full Offense,” wrote senior Jihad Levermore, 23, addressing Earnest, adding that instead of inquiring privately and trying to learn, “you decided to chalk it up to sensitivity.”</p>
<p>The professor replied that night. “Thanks for all of your hate mails!” he wrote, adding, “Deleting this chain.” </p>
<p>Raised by her grandparents in the small South Carolina city of Georgetown, Herriott fell in love with acting during a governor’s summer program for high school students. </p>
<p>Immersing herself in Shakespeare felt like a personal awakening. Playing a 70-year-old man in the Sam Shepard play “Buried Child” was a chance to channel the dialect and life experience of her grandfather.</p>
<p>Upon her enrollment at nearby Coastal Carolina University, which had wooed her with two scholarships, Herriott was assigned an advisor: Earnest.</p>
<p>At first, he struck her as laid-back and lenient. But as she got to know him more, she came to see him as out of touch and awkwardly inappropriate. Two incidents stood out.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Wrenching struggle to define critical race theory divides an Orange County school district</a> </p></div>
<p>An Orange County school district’s debate over critical race theory exemplifies how a hard-to-define academic concept has become a proxy for uncomfortable conversations about racial injustice in the U.S.</p>
<p>The first one was when he returned to campus after a fellowship in China. “Oh, wow, looks like you’ve shaped up well!” she said he told her. “You look so good now!”</p>
<p>Herriott understood that he was complimenting her on having lost weight — she had weighed more than 200 pounds when she joined the department — but it still felt wrong.</p>
<p>Then, just this fall, he advised her to audition for outdoor Shakespeare theater companies that were seeking diversity and “definitely casting people like you.”</p>
<p>She wondered if he told her that only because she is Black.</p>
<p>For his part, Earnest said that he didn’t recall ever mentioning her body and that while her race could help in the hiring market, her talent — her voice and her stage presence — was her biggest selling point.</p>
<p>Herriott, who never saw the whiteboard, was not surprised Earnest thought the students overreacted. But she was surprised he thought it was acceptable to say so. Or that other professors had not jumped into the email thread to tell him to stop.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after sending his first email, Earnest tried to make amends.</p>
<p>That night, Herriott asked herself: “Why am I doing all this homework to go to class and be awkward? And for other people to have to go to Steve’s class — like nothing happened.”</p>
<p>And so she gathered other students to organize a boycott.</p>
<p>“I should have control over my education to remove toxic people, regardless of freedom of speech, or whatever,” she said later. “Hate speech is hate speech.”</p>
<u>RESIGN</u>” and “Black Actors Matter.”
<p>Soon, local TV crews descended on the 10,000-student campus, which is about two-thirds white. By the end of the day, a dean had ordered Earnest not to come to classes.</p>
<p>After working at the university for 16 years, he was no longer allowed to teach. He said no administrator told him what rule or policy he had broken.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how I can defend myself, when I don’t even know what I’m accused of doing,” he said.</p>
<p>If there was one thing Earnest tried to instill in his students, it was toughness. He would warn them that acting is a brutal profession full of rejection and requires a sturdy exoskeleton to survive. </p>
<p>He himself is a rare species in the world of theater: a Donald Trump-voting conservative from a small town in Alabama with a deep passion for avant-garde European theater. </p>
<p>Among the videos his freshmen watch in class is a postmodern remake of Henrik Ibsen’s “The Wild Duck” that includes a scene in which a father places his penis on a table while his blind daughter swings at it with a hammer. </p>
<p>In his home office, he stores pens in a mug that reads “LIBERAL TEARS.” </p>
<p>He didn’t say too much about his political beliefs on campus. New social mores on comfort and safety, race and intersectionality felt unsettling to him and in his view made teaching more fraught.</p>
<p>And that was before the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year launched a nationwide reckoning over racism. </p>
<a>website</a> — “We See You CCU Theatre” — and a
<a>petition</a> calling for the “deconstruction” of “racist structures” in the theater department that was “currently a harmful environment for BIPOC students.”
<p>It wasn’t long before department leaders released a <a>response</a>: “We failed. We, the CCU Theatre department, were negligent in our responsibility to render care and compassion. … We acknowledge the pain and triggering.”</p>
<p>Ethnic studies is now required for future graduating California high school students. A look inside what students talk about in ethnic studies classes.</p>
<p>In his Dramatic Theory and Criticism class, Earnest said, whenever the topic of race or gender came up, students were quick to dismiss his opinions.</p>
<p>“You don’t know,” he said they would tell him. “You’re of the wrong class and person to talk to me about this.”</p>
<p>After Earnest was relieved from his teaching duties, he worked on the humanities and arts college’s annual report, published an article in the journal European Stages and auditioned for acting gigs.</p>
<p>Worried he would lose his job, he also took a real estate licensing exam.</p>
<p>Most distressing to Earnest was the rush of administrators to side with the students. He said that in a faculty Zoom meeting the department chair, Eric M. Hall, had characterized the words in his email as “white supremacist language.”</p>
<p>“I think of people burning crosses and wearing white robes,” Earnest said. “And that’s about as far away from me as I can ever imagine.”</p>
<p>To students, Earnest’s dismissal of their concerns about the whiteboard episode was part of a pattern of racial insensitivity and boundary crossing, including an incident last November that had earned him widespread scorn in the department. </p>
<p>“Sorry, not attractive,” he wrote in a now-deleted comment on an <a>Instagram post</a> that showed a former student, Nikko Austen Smith, raising a middle finger to the camera.</p>
<p>Earnest said he meant his comment as friendly advice to someone he had worked closely with as a student, co-founding a tap dance club. Smith filed a Title IX complaint against him.</p>
<p>As in most workplaces, explicit discrimination — using racial slurs maliciously or grading students based on race or gender, for example — is grounds for termination. </p>
<p>Earnest’s case was more complicated. That he had not been blatantly racist didn’t excuse what students viewed as a lack of empathy and a refusal to get on board with the new mood of sensitivity on campus.</p>
<p>California’s student-housing crisis has forced hundreds of UC students to live in hotel rooms and vehicles. But campus building efforts have sparked litigation and outcry at campuses, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>The most painless solution, administrators told Earnest, would be an early retirement. But he and his wife had too little savings for that, and he worried that it would send the wrong message.</p>
<p>“It proves to students that you can’t speak out — if you think something, you can’t say it,” he said. “At some point someone has to stand up and say ‘no.’”</p>
<a>wrote</a> that stopping him from teaching “is not only overly dramatic, but also unconstitutional.”
<p>Conservative outlets swiftly picked up the story, which they cast as another example of a professor who had been “canceled” for voicing unpopular opinions or presenting contentious material in class.</p>
<p>Last month, Earnest filed a formal grievance with the dean of the college<b> </b>alleging that his rights to free speech, due process and academic freedom had been trampled.</p>
<p>A few days later, more than two months since he had taught a class, the university informed him that the emails didn’t warrant disciplinary action “at this time.” </p>
<p>In a statement to the media, Daniel J. Ennis, the provost, wrote:<b> </b>“A university cannot succeed without freedom of expression, freedom of thought, and an environment that makes academic growth and development possible.”</p>
<p>But Ennis also made clear that those freedoms were not absolute and that the university “will never tolerate offensive behavior, harassment, or bullying.”</p>
<p>Earnest expects to return to teaching next month.</p>
<p>He said he would be more cautious about his behavior, taking care not to socialize with students or inject himself into conversations that are “none of my business.” </p>
<p>“I’m in the midst of an environment that is currently in flux and changing,” he said. “I have the ability to adapt, even at my age.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Earnest said, the controversy had also given him the opportunity to be a little more open about his conservative political beliefs. </p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean I have to put on a red-white-and-blue shirt and prance around a hall or whatever,” he said. “But I don’t have to be so hidden and so quiet.”</p>
<p>As for the students who led the boycott, they remain uneasy about Earnest coming back to campus. </p>
<p>“Keeping up with the times is important,” he added.</p>
<p>Even if Levermore was disappointed that Earnest was returning, he said he was not surprised. “I just hope that he’s open to growth as we move forward,” he said. </p>
<p>“When you put everything in perspective, people don’t know the entire story,” she said. “And I guess people will never know the entire story. And it’s just interesting how quickly people are able to judge.”</p>
<p>Asked whether she had any sympathy for Earnest, she paused.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say I do.”</p>

<h1> San Diego County district plans to offer in-person classes for unvaccinated students </h1>
<div><div> By Kristen Taketa </div><div>San Diego Union-Tribune</div></div>
<p>Now the small district is working on a way that would allow students who don’t get a COVID-19 vaccine to continue learning in person, even if <a>vaccines are required by the state</a> for in-person school attendance.</p>
<p>The district is creating a learning option called Alpine Choice Academy, where unvaccinated students can learn together at an off-campus location, getting instruction from district teachers. </p>
<p>The goal is to create as regular a school day as possible for these students, Supt. Rich Newman said.</p>
<p>Newman said he doesn’t want to take “a political stance” on whether students should be required to be vaccinated. He added that he is in favor of the vaccine and has received three doses, including a booster. </p>
<p>Regardless of a family’s political views, he said, students whose parents choose not to have them vaccinated should not receive a lesser quality education. </p>
<p>“I don’t want students caught in the crossfire of politics,” Newman said.</p>
<p>When parents protesting the vaccine mandate <a>kept their kids home from school</a> on one day in October, 41% of Alpine’s approximately 1,500 students were absent, he said. </p>
<p>That sent a message, he said, that potentially many of his students would no longer come to school once the state mandate kicks in starting next year. </p>
<p>Newman said he has been meeting with several parents, including people from the anti-mandate group <a>Let Them Breathe</a>, to work on plans for Alpine Choice Academy.</p>
<p>The district has not yet figured out the details of Alpine Choice Academy, such as where it will be located, Newman said. The academy will not be a separate school, Newman added. It will be part of the district’s independent study program.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Who can opt out of school COVID vaccine mandate? California lawmakers eye crackdown</a> </p></div>
<p>Lawmakers are expressing concerns that allowing broad exemptions in the mandate will undermine the state’s effort to protect schools.</p>
<p>Some accused Newman of segregating unvaccinated students in a “separate but equal” arrangement. </p>
<p>Newman noted that under the state’s mandate, unvaccinated students would be separated from their vaccinated peers since the mandate requires remote learning for unvaccinated students.</p>
<p>“It’s not me saying they can’t come to campus, not at all,” Newman said. “I want every student on campus, every day, 100% of the time.”</p>
<p>Newman said that if mandates happen and the academy doesn’t, then some students would be back at home, learning with packets of classwork.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in October that California’s K-12 public and private school students will be required to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend in-person school.</p>
<p>When that requirement will kick in has not been finalized. State officials have said July 1 is the likely date by which students 12 and older, in grades 7-12, would be required to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Students will be required to get vaccinated after the Food and Drug Administration fully approves a COVID-19 vaccine for their age groups. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has emergency-use authorization for children 5 and older.</p>
<p>The vaccine is fully approved for people 16 and older.</p>

<h1> LAUSD’s independent study program is overwhelmed. Students with disabilities pay the price </h1>
<div><div> By Melissa GomezStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Maya Flores stared at her laptop screen, watching as her teacher guided classmates on how to complete online assignments. </p>

<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Surge of families seeking remote learning overwhelms L.A. public schools</a> </p></div>
<p>Parents were frustrated after receiving little help enrolling into LAUSD’s independent study program. The school district is not alone.</p>
<p>“I hate that it had to go that way, but they violated her civil rights,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Los Angeles school officials have not yet decided whether to extend the court<b> </b>order beyond the seven district students named in the lawsuit to all students with disabilities, said Shannon Haber, a district spokesperson. </p>
<b> </b>receiving all of their required accommodations and services.
<p>“With a lack of support it’s impossible to roll [the program] out effectively,” one special education teacher said.</p>
<p>City of Angels Principal Vince Carbino was not available for an interview, Haber said. Carbino did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<a>44,000 eligible students</a> had missed the district’s deadline for receiving the first of two shots. Failing to meet the early deadline did not impose consequences.
<b> </b>The district has not released updated student vaccination figures.
<p>For parents, the frustration begins when they reach out for help — and no one answers.</p>
<p>“I’ve left messages in different places,” said Evelyn, who is seeking a virtual aide to help him. “Crickets.”</p>
<p>In Maya’s case, the district said the months-long delay was due to a shortage of sign language interpreters. Tafoya, Maya’s mother, said she wishes the district had been upfront about the shortage.</p>
<b> </b>an in-person assessment, which felt unsafe — her son was unvaccinated and they live with her 85-year-old grandmother. Rebecca declined and instead began to coach him through assignments.
<p>But without specialized support, the 12-year-old struggled. His first report card came back with no grades, just rows of question marks. </p>
<p>After a Times reporter inquired about Evelyn’s and Rebecca’s situations, district staff members connected with the families and said support services would be provided.</p>
<p>Others said several of their students are failing based on the online curricula, and they’re not sure they can catch up even with <a>extra help.</a></p>
<p>Fornari’s students are also failing. Even with extra time to improve grades, he worries they are burnt out. </p>

<h1> Clippers could find answers to offensive struggles against Trail Blazers </h1>
<div><div> By Andrew GreifStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Since their friendship began as teenaged opponents on the travel-ball circuit, Tyronn Lue and Chauncey Billups have always found ways to help the other out.</p>
<p>Their reunion Monday, in the fourth and final meeting this season between Billups’ Trail Blazers and Lue’s <a>Clippers</a>, finds each once again seeking help. And the other’s roster could be uniquely prepared to provide it.</p>
<p>“… It’s still early in the season. Think it’s a lot of teams that’s hitting that block and once we get down and we get going I think everything’s gonna be OK.”</p>
<div><p><a>Clippers</a></p><p> <a>Clippers have long ride to Sacramento, where they lose to Kings</a> </p></div>
<p>The Clippers had a long ride north to Sacramento, where they lost 104-99 to the Kings. It was Los Angeles’ first loss there since 2013.</p>
<a>teams’ last meeting Nov. 9</a>, has turned into a sieve, producing the NBA’s worst defensive rating, at 118.5 points per 100 possessions allowed, and allowed the highest opponent effective field goal percentage of 56.2.%.
<sup/>in points allowed off of pick-and-rolls that include passes, per Synergy Sports.
<p>With weaknesses that align this well, it’s easy to see why this matchup comes at an important time for each team, more than a quarter of the way through the season. But only one will depart with what is needed most — a victory.</p>
<p>After seeing Portland (11-13) allow 145 points in a loss Saturday to Boston — only the third time since 1992 the Celtics had scored at least that many points — Billups ripped the Blazers.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen a team that needs its bench to inspire our starters,” Billups told reporters. “That s— is crazy to me. It’s supposed to be the other way around.”</p>
<p>Though the Kings ranked in the league’s bottom third in defensive rating, the Clippers (12-12) made just one of 15 shots during a key second-quarter run that effectively decided <a>Saturday’s 104-99 loss in Sacramento</a>.</p>
<p>“We also always, every now and then we have to be willing to just move it, move the ball, move the defense, and continue to play with pace in the half court.”</p>

<h1> Consistent scoring and defense? Lakers searching for right five-player mix </h1>
<div><div> By Dan WoikeStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Malik Monk’s eyes locked on the right side of the news conference room as he tried to unravel the biggest riddle the Lakers are still facing.</p>
<a>Lakers</a> scoring and defending all at once? It’s the simplest route to victory and maybe the most difficult challenge in roster construction. Good teams have an answer and can play lineups that excel on both sides of the ball.
<p>“It’s a good question,” Monk said. “I really don’t know man. We still figuring each other out.”</p>
<div><p><a>Lakers</a></p><p> <a>Elliott: Building momentum difficult for Lakers with LeBron James in and out of the lineup </a> </p></div>
<p>The Lakers never led in a loss to the Clippers, remaining inconsistent even with LeBron James back from a false-positive coronavirus test.</p>
<a>Russell Westbrook</a> in them. And because of injuries and a mostly wasted preseason, the Lakers are still left searching for the right players to play around them.
<p>“And we’re working on those things. They’re getting better, and that is part of the challenge.”</p>
<div><p><a>Lakers</a></p><p> <a>LeBron James was ‘frustrated, angry’ when placed in NBA’s COVID protocols</a> </p></div>
<p>Lakers star LeBron James voices his frustration over being placed in the NBA’s COVID protocols even though he supports the league’s safety rules.</p>
<a>Talen Horton-Tucker</a> starting in place of
<a>Avery Bradley</a>. The Lakers, when looking for offensive punch late in games, have had Malik Monk on the court with their stars.
<p>Until Trevor Ariza returns (he underwent some on-court shooting drills prior to Friday’s game with the <a>Clippers</a>), the team could look more to Monk to answer some of their questions.</p>
<p>He’s been improving defensively, especially in fourth quarters, with the Lakers allowing only 102 points per 100 possessions with Monk on the floor.</p>
<p>“Just to be solid and don’t give straight-line drives,” Monk said of his defensive assignments.</p>
<p>Probably not coincidentally, the Lakers haven’t won more than three games in a row. </p>
<p>“Not being able to keep my rhythm, it’s just ... it’s been a very challenging year to start a fourth of the season for myself,” James said after losing to the Clippers. “But only good things ahead.”</p>
<p>Getting James on the floor playing consistently would solve a lot of the Lakers’ ills.</p>
<p>“Not all of them, you know? There are still things we need to do better and we’re working on those,” Vogel said. “But certainly that will help a lot.”</p>

<h1> Frank Vogel and LeBron James address the heat Lakers coach is feeling amid slow start </h1>
<a>LeBron James</a> at the front of that line. Admittedly not always the most patient person, James knew wading through the Lakers’ big changes this offseason was going to take time.
<p>It’s unclear, though, how much longer anyone is willing to wait.</p>
<p>Asked about the criticism directed at coach <a>Frank Vogel</a> for the Lakers’ slow start, James said that anyone on the sidelines should be used to it.</p>
<div><p><a>Lakers</a></p><p> <a>Consistent scoring and defense? Lakers searching for right five-player mix</a> </p></div>
<p>Finding the right five-player combination of scoring and defense has been a struggle for the Lakers all season. Are they any closer to finding a fix?</p>
<p>Vogel said the pressure with this job isn’t different than what he’s already felt in his career.</p>
<p>“Not really. There’s gonna be criticism with this job,” Vogel said. “It’s something we’re all accustomed to. And I’ve been a coach for 10 years, I’ve seen it all.”</p>
<p>He’s seen it all — except for this Lakers team coming together on the court.</p>
<p>He acknowledged Monday that Kendrick Nunn almost certainly would miss all of December because of a bone bruise in a knee, postponing his Lakers debut to 2022.</p>
<a>Trevor Ariza</a>, who was a full participant in practice Monday, continues to improve, the sample sizes might start getting large enough to make evaluations of the Lakers.
<p>For now, James said, things are still too new, particularly when discussing his on-court partnership with <a>Russell Westbrook</a>.</p>
<p>The team has struggled on both sides of the court, things ticking upward on defense. Vogel has pointed to lack of effort, buy-in and execution as key reasons why the Lakers have struggled on defense.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought the team needed to play harder, James deferred to Vogel’s assessment.</p>
<p>“Whatever Frank says, he’s seen. He’s watching it. The coaching staff sees it,” James said. “We’ve just got to do a better job being more accountable for each other.”</p>
<p>James joked that the Lakers have played some of their best defense in the games he’s missed.</p>
<p>“I feel decent physically,” James said. “I’m still getting back to where I was.”</p>
<p>So are the Lakers. Who leads them back and whether they even get there at all are still to be determined.</p>

<h1> Clippers grind out win against shorthanded Trail Blazers </h1>
<div><div> By Andrew GreifStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Tyronn Lue doesn’t expect perfection. He can live with plays that do not work and shots that do not go in.</p>
<p>“Random basketball,” Lue called it, before the Clippers’ 102-90 victory in Portland.</p>

<p>The Clippers could find answers to their recent offensive struggles against a Portland Trail Blazers team that currently has the league’s worst defensive rating.</p>
<p>“We just had to grind this win out,” Lue said.</p>
<p>Yet when the Clippers needed crisp execution, leading by two with 2 minutes 49 seconds to play, they finally played as Lue has expected.</p>
<p>A dunk by George was followed by a Portland turnover, an elbow jumper by George and a free throw from Isaiah Hartenstein, after he was caught in the neck by an elbow from Portland center Jusuf Nurkic.</p>
<p>“Credit to the guys,” said Luke Kennard, who scored 13 of his 15 points in the first half. “Staying patient, staying with it, trusting what we were doing.”</p>

<p>The Clippers had a long ride north to Sacramento, where they lost 104-99 to the Kings. It was Los Angeles’ first loss there since 2013.</p>
<p>Asked what Ibaka’s role in the rotation is moving forward Lue said, “We’ll see.” Kennard had played with the team’s starters late in games previously, and said it did not take long to find comfort.</p>
<p>George scored 21 points for the Clippers, scoring as many field goals (four) in the final quarter as all of Portland combined. He hit “big-time shots, as usual,” Kennard said.</p>
<p>“He’s a professional, he wants to win, had no problem with it at all,” Lue said of Bledsoe’s handling of a reserve role.</p>

<h1> Striking Kellogg workers reject contract offer with 3% raises </h1>
<div><div> By Josh Funk </div><div>Associated Press</div></div>
<p>Kellogg Co. workers turned down a contract offer Tuesday that would have provided 3% raises, so 1,400 workers at the company’s four U.S. cereal plants will remain on strike.</p>
<p>The workers have been on strike since Oct. 5 at plants in Battle Creek, Mich.; Omaha; Lancaster, Pa.; and Memphis, Tenn. They make all of the company’s well-known brands of cereal, including Apple Jacks and Frosted Flakes.</p>
<p>“The members have spoken. The strike continues,” union President Anthony Shelton said. “The International Union will continue to provide full support to our striking Kellogg’s members.”</p>
<div><p><a>World Nation</a></p><p> <a>Workers are fed up. But is this really #Striketober?</a> </p></div>
<p>After decades of stagnating wages and diminishing pension and healthcare benefits, many U.S. workers are fed up. A small but growing number are organizing.</p>
<p>Kellogg said it would move forward with plans to start hiring permanent replacements for the striking workers. The company has already been using salaried employees and outside workers to keep the plants operating during the strike.</p>
<p>“By voting ‘no,’ the workers are making a strong statement that they are not satisfied by the agreement, but they are also signaling they believe they have the leverage that’s needed to win more,” Vachon said.</p>
<p>One of the sticking points in the negotiations has been the company’s two-tiered system of wages that gives newer workers less pay and fewer benefits. As much as 30% of the workforce at the cereal plants has been receiving the lower wages.</p>
<p>The Battle Creek-based company said the new contract would allow all workers with at least four years’ experience to move up to the higher legacy pay level immediately, and some additional workers would move up in later years of the contract.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we don’t want to leave anyone behind. And we want a secure future,” Osborn said.</p>
<p>Union members would also like to see the company offer bigger raises to its mechanics and electricians so Kellogg can better compete for those workers, Osborn said.</p>
<p>Victor Chen, a sociologist at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies labor, said he understands why the union is taking a stand against the two-tiered wage system, because it is a divisive issue within its ranks.</p>
<p>At times during the strike, the disagreements between the company and the union have been bitter.</p>
<p>In another recent strike, more than 10,000 John Deere workers secured 10% raises and improved benefits, but those gains came after workers remained on strike for a month and rejected two offers from the company.</p>
<p>The offer that Kellogg’s workers rejected was the first one they’ve voted on since the strike began.</p>
