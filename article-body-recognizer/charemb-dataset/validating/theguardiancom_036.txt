<p>The remarks were Franco’s first extended comments about accusations leveled against him nearly four years ago when the Los Angeles Times reported that five women had <a>accused Franco</a> of conduct they considered inappropriate.</p>
<p>Franco said he had developed a sex addiction after he became sober from an alcohol addiction he developed at a young age.</p>
<p>“It’s such a powerful drug,” he said. “I got hooked on it for 20 more years. The insidious part of that is that I stayed sober from alcohol all that time.”</p>
<p>In the podcast interview, Franco also said he had been in recovery from sex addiction since 2016 and had “been doing a lot of work” after the allegations against him “and changing who I was”.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to hurt people,” he said.</p>

<p>Girls and young women aged between 14 and 24 are taking responsibility for the majority of household chores during the pandemic, leaving them less time to focus on their education, according to a new survey.</p>
<p>Sixty-six percent of girls and women aged between 14 and 24 said they are spending more time cooking for their families as a result of the pandemic, compared with 31% of boys and men in the same age group.</p>
<p>The research also suggested that not attending school is taking its toll on mental health. One in five girls said they were struggling, while 46% described access to quality education as a source of current concern.</p>
<p>Theirworld is calling for governments around the world to put education, especially for girls, at the heart of their responses to the pandemic by expanding budgets for schools, colleges and universities.</p>
<p>“There is no better way of creating a more equitable recovery, and subsequently more equal societies, than prioritising girls’ education,” said Justin van Fleet, the president of Theirworld.</p>
<a>shouldering the burden of home schooling</a>, with 67% of women taking the lead compared with 52% of men. Half of the survey’s 16- to 18-year-old respondents also said that home schooling was having a damaging effect on their mental health.
<p>During the last lockdown, the ONS found that parents were <a>dividing home schooling responsibilities equally</a> but that women spent much more time feeding, washing and dressing children.</p>
<p>“While home schooling seems to be delivered more effectively now than it was last year, with more resources available from schools, it appears to be taking a greater toll on parents and children,” said Hugh Stickland from the ONS.</p>
<p>More than half (53%) of parents said home schooling was putting a strain on relationships, and more than a third (37%) said their jobs had been negatively affected.</p>
<p>Two-thirds (65%) of the young adults interviewed said they were concerned that their future life plans would be held back by studying at home, while half (50%) reported lower overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>The pollsters interviewed more than 6,000 adults in surveys running between January and February, which revealed that many parents and children were struggling even more with the demands of work and education at home than during the first lockdown.</p>

<p>The Power of the Dog is the first feature film Jane Campion has directed in 12 years. That it happened at all is down to her picking up Thomas Savage’s 1967 novel of the same name and not being able to put it down.</p>
<a>Bright Star</a>, which traced poet John Keats’s doomed romance with Fanny Brawne, it is the first of her films to feature a male lead.
<p>“Sometimes, actors arrive on set and they have their performances all figured out,” she says. “They don’t want to unpack it, they just want to film it as if they are the only person in the scene. That is just so disturbing to me.”</p>
<p>“Film-making set me free,” she says. “Before I found it, I had a lot of energy, but I was lost as to how to express it or even be in the world. I found the challenge of making a film so exciting, it was as if I had found myself.”</p>
<a>Julia Ducournau</a> became the second woman to win the Palme d’Or.
<p>The Power of the Dog is in select cinemas on 19 Nov and on Netflix from 1 Dec</p>

<p>After 396 years, the sun has set on the British monarchy’s reign over the Caribbean island of Barbados, with a handover ceremony at midnight on Monday marking <a>the birth of the world’s newest republic</a>.</p>
<p>“Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage,” Mason said in her inauguration speech as the first president of the country, recognising the “complex, fractured and turbulent world” it would need to navigate.</p>
<p>“Our country must dream big dreams and fight to realise them,” the former governor-general told those gathered for the ceremony.</p>
<p>“A significant number of persons were not interested one way or the other,” said Cynthia Barrow-Giles, a professor at the University of the West Indies and a lead investigator for the poll, which is yet to be released.</p>

<p>A planned protest in Bridgetown over the presence of Prince Charles at the handover ceremony was denied permission on grounds of avoiding the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>“Windrush would have been one of those significant events that showed the divergence between where the Queen, as the queen of the United Kingdom, and her role as the queen of Barbados, may have been irreconcilable,” he said.</p>
<p>The poll of Barbadian attitudes to the monarchy suggests any personal admiration for Queen Elizabeth that outlasted the colonial era has long dissipated on the island. “People are neither here nor there about her,” Barrow-Giles said.</p>

<p>When Jodie Whittaker was cast as the 13th incarnation of the eponymous star of Doctor Who <a>it made headlines everywhere </a>because she was the first woman. Now, finally, that “gender question” is going away.</p>
<p>Whittaker will star in her second series of <a>Doctor Who</a> in 2020 with the opener being a highlight of BBC One’s New Year’s Day schedule.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Big Issue magazine Whittaker has spoken about the pressures of portraying the 13th Doctor.</p>
<p>“The gender question is now going away. Hopefully it won’t make the news next time.”</p>
<p>Whittaker replaced Peter Capaldi as the Doctor in 2018, cast by new showrunner Chris Chibnall who worked with her on Broadchurch, where she played grieving mother Beth Latimer.</p>
<a>overwhelmingly positive</a>. The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan
<p>“It fascinates me that my natural traits are deemed masculine and so they’re complimented. You know: ‘Well done, you’re not very girly.’ Yes, I am. It’s massive to have a first woman Doctor, but I won’t let it be used as an excluding technique.”</p>
<p>In her Big Issue interview Whittaker talks about being inspired by young people, especially <a>climate activist Greta Thunberg</a>.</p>
<p>She said: “What we should do going forward, and what I feel I need reminding of, is take huge inspiration from the groups of young people who are putting their voices out there and articulating what we grown-ups can’t.</p>
<p>“We have Greta putting herself at risk of criticism to say what needs to be said to move us forward – and we as grown-ups can take inspiration from a united massing of non-violent protest and voice. It’s inspiring.</p>
<p>“You are never too old or too young to give advice. So you need to be able to receive it from any age group. The new year needs to be open ears and open hearts. Don’t lose hope.”</p>

<p>The Labour MP <a>Keith Vaz</a> is facing a six-month ban from parliament for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an inquiry.</p>
<p>The MP for Leicester East will face an automatic recall petition after the standards committee found he “caused significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons”.</p>
<p>The inquiry examined claims published in the Sunday Mirror in 2016 that he offered to buy cocaine for male sex workers while posing as an industrial washing machine salesman.</p>
<p>Vaz’s explanation, which included that he had amnesia and could not recall key events, was “not believable and, indeed, ludicrous”, the inquiry found.</p>
<p>“They needed to move in there not later than Monday 5 September, on which date the House of Commons was due to return from its summer recess, requiring Mr Vaz’s attendance at Westminster,” the report said.</p>
<p>A statement on Vaz’s website said he had been receiving treatment for a “serious mental health condition” for the past three years as a result of the events of August 2016.</p>

<a>New Zealand immigration service</a> has added “sex work” (as prostitution is increasingly described) to the list of “employment skills” for those wishing to migrate. According to information on Immigration NZ’s (INZ)
<a>website</a>, prostitution appears on the “skilled employment” list, but not the “skill shortage” list. My
<a>research</a> on the sex trade has taken me to a number of countries around the world, including New Zealand. Its sex trade was decriminalised in 2003, and has since been hailed by pro-prostitution campaigners as the gold standard model in
<a>operate illegally</a>. Violent attacks on women in the brothels are as common as ever. “The men feel even more entitled when the law tells them it is OK to buy us,” says
<a>Sabrinna Valisce</a>, who was prostituted in New Zealand brothels both before and after decriminalisation. Under legalisation,
<a>women are still murdered by pimps and punters</a>.
<p>The decision to include prostitution as an “employment skill” is a green light for pimps to populate brothels to meet the increased male demand for the prostitution of the most vulnerable women.</p>
<a>carry a baby</a> on behalf of privileged westerners.
<p>In the Netherlands, which legalised its sex trade in 2000, it is perfectly legal for driving instructors to <a>offer lessons in return for sex</a>, as long as the learner drivers are over the age of 18.</p>
<a>New Zealand</a> should investigate the harms, including sexual violence, that women in prostitution endure.
<p>If prostitution is “sex work”, then by its own logic, rape is merely theft. The inside of a woman’s body should never be viewed as a workplace.</p>
<p>Every woman old enough to remember the 1970s recalls nights in the north of England during Peter Sutcliffe’s decade of terror.</p>
<p>“Leeds was really in a state of almost lockdown and women were afraid to go out,” remembered Mo Lea, who was a student in the city at the time.</p>
<p>By autumn 1980, when Lea was in her final year of an art degree, 12 women had been murdered in towns and cities across Yorkshire as well as over the Pennines in Manchester.</p>
<p>Talking to Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Lea, <a>now an artist</a>, recalled the “nightmare terror” when she realised the man in fact posed her severe danger.</p>
<p>Bindel lived less than a mile away from where Hill’s body was found and had been followed up the hill late one night the week before the murder by a man fitting Sutcliffe’s description. She reported it to the police, but they dismissed her.</p>
<p>She was involved in a group campaigning to end violence against women in Leeds and described how women felt under attack from all sides – not just by the Ripper, but by the blatant sexism from the press and West Yorkshire police.</p>
<p>The way police talked about the victims was appalling. One told Smith’s colleague that one of the women, who was also raped by Sutcliffe, had “a fanny as wet as a paper-hanger’s bucket”.</p>
<p>John Robins, the current chief constable of West Yorkshire police, has apologised for the “language, tone and terminology used by senior officers at the time in relation to Peter Sutcliffe’s victims” and said “it was as wrong then as it is now”.</p>
<p>Police ignored Sutcliffe’s survivors, some of whom were clear their attacker had a Yorkshire accent – preferring to believe the fake claims of Humble, who sent letters with a Sunderland postmark and spoke with a Wearside twang.</p>
<p>In Leeds today, Basis Yorkshire is a charity supporting sex workers who work the same streets Sutcliffe once prowled – some in the controversial “managed approach” zone in Holbeck, where prostitutes can work without fear of prosecution.</p>
<p>Sutcliffe contributed to the creation and galvanisation of “a very vibrant women’s movement against violence”, said Bindel. “Because as soon as you pick up the rock and see the misogyny underneath you can’t unsee it.</p>
<p>“We still haven’t got the message about the violence inherent in prostitution; we still haven’t got the message about how women in prostitution are not disposable, that there are no innocent victims because there were no guilty victims.” </p>
<a>Women</a> and Girls board. “Now we’re now in the situation where women’s organisations are having to take the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] to court for not prosecuting rapists.”

<div> <time> Published: 16 Mar 2021 </time> </div> Soho sex workers' protest did bring about change
<p>Two weeks at Stradbroke Island was a Christmas tradition with my Dad. One that I resisted every year because none of my friends were there, leaving me feeling like the lonely older kid hanging out with my little brother’s friends.</p>
<p>After that we started doing it whenever and wherever we could. To two teenagers who had just discovered sex, the whole world looked like a bed. It felt thrilling, illicit, each time like lightning.</p>
<p>Every space – public and private – was an opportunity. My bed, her bed, behind the pool shed at a party on a surprisingly cold night. The spa in the pool area of the complex where she lived. Standing up in the change rooms at Myer Queen Street.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter that the sex itself was rushed and messy, we felt warm and excited and alive, stealing moments to press ourselves together at parties while our friends necked Smirnoff Double Blacks and fell into bushes. </p>
<p>As our list of secret sex locations grew, so did our ambition. We looked for somewhere to cap it all off. Somewhere thrilling and romantic and beautiful.</p>
<p>It was the beach. We had to have sex on the beach.</p>
<p>Which is how we came to be standing, at 10pm on New Year’s Eve, on a beach on Stradbroke Island, halfway through my family holiday, Havaianas in our hands and sex in our hearts.</p>
<p>We played it cool for a few days, then on 31 December, the most romantic night of the teenage year, we made our move.</p>
<p>After all that planning and anticipation, it was … fine. It was hard to make it work around our clothes, and the excitement wore off pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And that relationship? Reader, I married him. Thirty-three years later, he is still banned from booking any holiday accommodation, whatever the season. But especially, especially in winter.</p>
<p>The question I am due to be the bridesmaid at my friend’s wedding. She’s been engaged for five years. The whole thing has had to be rearranged twice due to the pandemic and now it’s on for 2022.</p>
<a>I’d Rather Ride Around With You</a>, about a bridesmaid who jumps into a sports car with her boyfriend when she should have been at church holding the bouquet for her cousin, the bride. It’s a great story-song, have a listen.
<p>Free yourself from dread. Release her from having a hostage at her wedding. There is a strong possibility she’ll not see it like that and be very hurt. But one of you will suffer – either you with the dread, or her with the hurt.</p>
<p>Now I’m playing Please Release Me, Let Me Go, by Engelbert Humperdinck, and one of the lines in that song is “to live a lie would be a sin”. </p>
<p>His training placement in Manhattan was coming to an end, though. By Christmas he’d be home again. We had just weeks, we’d met too late and, anyway, he had a girlfriend. It was all very chaste, until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>He’d buy the ticket; he had a hotel room already paid for, and we could see the northern lights. We’d be alone with all that ice and snow for three whole days. Then we’d go our separate ways.</p>
<p>After the past few years, despite the pain and heartbreak, I feel as strong as an ox and I have learned so much about myself. Thank you for helping me all those years ago. I needed to wake up – and I did.</p>
<p>Thank you, too, for reminding me that the daily challenges we each face in life are often mirrored in those encountered by so many others.</p>

<p>At the age of 69, I am not allowed to see my original birth certificate or know the basic facts of my origin.</p>
<p>It’s different now: Those homes no longer exist. Illegitimacy is no longer the taboo topic it once was. We don’t even use the term “unwed” anymore.</p>
<p>In the delivery room, my doctor announced, “You have a beautiful baby girl.”</p>
<p>My husband looked confused. “You’d better check on that.”</p>
<p>We spent a week trying out names for her. As I diapered her, I’d say, “Hi Caroline. Or are you Christine?” Eventually we filled the open field on her birth certificate with “Elizabeth.” Did I have an original name too?</p>
<p>Then follows an awkward moment as confusion travels across the physician’s face. I break the silence between us.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Anne Rudig has contributed to the New York Times and other publications. She is at work on a memoir</p></li> </ul>
<p>Never confuse fantasy and “realty”.</p>
<p>It’s a sentence that has floated, jokingly, around my family ever since my father’s colleague uttered the bungle to him years ago. We New Yorkers, of course, never confuse fantasy and realty. But in our house we happily confuse the two all the time.</p>
<a>Jeremy Strong</a> and other method actors, insisting her pajamas were made of calico and roasting in the dress throughout the summer, even as she pretended a blizzard was swirling outside and she could see her breath in the air.
<p>“At two and a half, three years old, the fuzziness between reality and fantasy is blurred,” Kathy Hirsh-Pasek told me when I reached her by phone. “And I think fantasy is very powerful for kids – it’s a safe place.”</p>
<p>When Hirsh-Pasek’s children were in that liminal reality-fantasy age, she told me, there were real monsters in their closet.</p>
<p>“They pick up on every little thing we do, they model it, they understand it, they watch us like they are sociologists,” Hirsh-Pasek said. “And we’ve been a wreck.”</p>
<p>The conceit of the book, which you learn in the last few pages, is that the BFG actually wrote the thing, and just published it under another name. The night we finished, my kindergartner looked at the cover for a while.</p>
<p>And of course, in a way, she’s right.</p>

<p>I sought your help 15 years ago when I was desperate: depressed, suicidal and helpless. I couldn’t take the pain any more and, after seeing many psychiatrists and therapists without improvement, I arranged to see you.</p>
<p>Every hint you gave led me to buy you more luxurious, more expensive items. I am wealthy, so I could afford them: a first-class holiday for your family, designer watches, an expensive chess set.</p>
<p>When you saw I was troubled, you hugged me with your smile and I knew everything would be OK. On days when I was overwhelmed by life, you would catch me to say hello. You made parents feel as cared for as our children.</p>
<p>Your creativity was inspiring. I’ll never forget the children’s faces when you’d beautifully transformed the classroom into the Deep Dark Wood. I remember their animated faces talking about the Magnificent Tower Building you’d created.</p>
<p>In the short time I knew you, you taught me about the type of teacher I aspire to be. You never seemed fazed by the mountain of paperwork or impossible work-life balance that comes with the role. Instead, you appeared to embrace every minute.</p>
<p>The prolific Yolŋu artist Dhambit Munuŋgurr has been waiting a long time to get Julia Gillard’s attention.</p>
<a>made the journey to Yirrkala instead.</a> Munuŋgurr is too polite to publicly take sides but, suffice to say, the painting remains in her bedroom on Gunyaŋara, the tiny island in the Arafura Sea some 25 minutes’ journey away.
<p>Will Stubbs, the longtime coordinator at Buku who is facilitating and translating my conversation with Munuŋgurr, says the Yolŋu in the painting are “supporting and dancing their identity and shepherding [Gillard] in – they’re her bodyguards”.</p>
<a>Painting</a> for her is “healing”, she explains. “It keeps me alive.”
<p>She chose the hue, <a>she has explained</a>, “because the earth is blue, the sky is blue and the sea is blue”.</p>
<p>Stubbs adds: “There’s a shipping container full, because Dhambit is not painting for money, fame or profit – she needs to paint. She has to paint compulsively all day, every day.”</p>
<p>Munuŋgurr nods her head: “Every day.”</p>
<p>Before we hang up, Munuŋgurr fixes her gaze on me through the computer screen and smiles. “I’ll paint you one day,” she says, grinning. “You, talking to me.”</p>

<p>I wanted to know more about the experiences of other people, in order to fully understand my own.</p>
<p>“I came to the UK on 25 July 1999 at 5.30am at Heathrow airport. I came for three months, as a life experience, with a return ticket that I’ve never used.</p>
<p>“My hope for the future is that we are going to carry on the way we are. That the UK will be as good as now: looking after their people”</p>
<p>“Becoming a British citizen was such a hard process; it took me about four months to get all the paperwork. Many native British people have no idea how hard and expensive it is, not everyone can afford it, even if they have the right to get it.</p>
<p>“But I always did and always will identify myself as European, as I believe London is not the UK. London is still a massive melting point of culture beyond the EU where diversity is incredible.” </p>
<p>“Also, I wanted to be able to vote, and now I have more right to say what I think, express it with my vote and be fully part of the society. Hopefully all the new citizens like me are going to have an impact on future elections.</p>

<p>“I moved to UK on 10 September 2003, initially with a student visa, then once Poland joined the EU I decided to stay longer.</p>
<a>freedom of protest</a>, almost takes that freedom and ability away. Sometimes your freedom can be taken away indirectly by creating so many new rules around it.

<p>It’s a Friday night in Johannesburg. Lockdown has just been eased as Covid infection rates have plateaued. The restive city is slowly springing back to life, with cars once again careering along the city’s recently empty arterial roads.</p>
<p>Near the wreckage, about 20 food couriers are lined up on their bikes. They have rushed to the scene to see if they can assist, having been alerted via a WhatsApp group used to communicate during emergencies. Some such groups are up to 200 strong.</p>
<p>These men are among an army of thousands of riders who spend up to 16 hours a day, usually seven days a week, frantically ferrying food around the city.</p>
<p>It is hazardous work. Accidents and muggings, sometimes at gunpoint, are common. Rainy weather, when roads are slippery and visibility poor, is feared most.</p>
<p>The Covid pandemic led to an exponential growth in the number of food couriers operating here, using a number of delivery apps. These include Mr D Food, Bolt Food, MyChef and Uber Eats – the latter by far the most popular.</p>
<p>Many of those joining the burgeoning ranks of Joburg’s food couriers had lost formal employment owing to the devastating economic impact of repeated lockdowns. Others were drawn by higher wages for unskilled work.</p>
<p>Before long the boom resulted in an oversupply of couriers.</p>
<p>Most are foreigners with few prospects, eking out a meagre living in straitened circumstances. Some are undocumented, leaving them doubly vulnerable to police shakedowns and exploitation in an unregulated gig economy.</p>
<p>Despite their ubiquitous presence on the streets, their lives and travails are largely invisible to the residents of Johannesburg. </p>
<p>Four motorbikes fitted with courier boxes are parked in the back yard of a working-class suburb of western Johannesburg, where their Ugandan owners rent rooms.</p>
<p>Soon after sunrise the men haul themselves out of bed to fill plastic basins with water from an outside a tap to wash. Tinny pop songs from a portable radio drift across the yard.</p>
<p>Such good fortune is rare. Of the dozens of Joburg food couriers we interviewed, almost all had harrowing tales.</p>
<p>By far the most onerous part of the job, though, is the constant risk of injury or death.</p>
<p>Pardon Sibanda isn’t taking any chances. The 28-year-old Zimbabwean is clad in boots, leather pants and a jacket with padding that resembles body armour. The outfit has earned him the nickname “Robocop”.</p>
<p>Wisely, he decided not to fight back. “You can’t lose your life over a phone or a bike. There’s no need to act like a hero,” he says. “They took both my phones, my power bank, and my wallet with my driver’s licence. It was terrible.”</p>
<p>Duane Bernard, who heads an informal union that represents more than half of South Africa’s 3,000-odd Uber Eats couriers, says customers often rob the couriers, covering their tracks by using unregistered sim cards to download the food app.</p>
<p>“Then they steal the food, and the driver needs to pay,” he says. “You’ll never trace that customer. Recently two guys in Joburg were robbed of their bikes that way.”</p>
<p>Despite the hazards, the couriers we interviewed said they valued the freedom of being able to manage their own time or take other jobs, even with rival companies.</p>
<p>The potential for higher earnings than in other unskilled jobs is a major drawcard, too. Migrants can earn up to four times what they would back home.</p>
<p>Tips are a significant, if variable, source of income. As a rule, higher tips are earned in more affluent suburbs than in the inner city or areas where students live. But business is less brisk there, so a trade-off must be made.</p>
<p>These considerations are becoming increasingly important as costs keep rising while delivery fees decline.</p>
<p>In the past year, bike rentals have doubled and the fuel price has increased by 30%. Expenses now typically approach half the couriers’ monthly earnings.</p>
<p>Uber Eats has refused to budge, saying it has stimulated customer demand, so couriers spend less time waiting idly for customers.</p>
<p>Those who report being in an accident are blocked on the app until they submit a police statement and photos showing their bike has been repaired. So accidents are not reported either.</p>
<p>The London-based law firm Leigh Day, which represented the UK drivers, has announced it plans to launch a class action lawsuit for drivers and couriers in South Africa, together with local attorneys.</p>
<p>We asked Uber about similar complaints from food couriers in Johannesburg of being fired by robots without adequate redress.</p>
<p>But most couriers have little faith in these initiatives. None of those we interviewed knew of a single person who had submitted an insurance claim.</p>
<p>A pan-African community spirit has spread among Joburg’s food couriers. Typically, half a dozen nationalities are represented at social events. South Africans attend some, too.</p>
<p>On public holidays, many gather for a game of five-a-side football in a field on the edge of the inner city, opposite a McDonald’s. Of late, South Africans workers at the fast-food outlet have joined in.</p>
<p>Those not playing gather under trees to share a meal of grilled meat, pap (maize porridge), salads and beer. Everyone contributes. Now and then a bike disappears, returning minutes later with a bag of ice or other supplies.</p>
<p>Similar scenes play out in parks all over Johannesburg.</p>
<p>His new role has brought him to deepest Dorset in the middle of winter for the final race in the inaugural season of the innovative Extreme E championship, an FIA-sanctioned series for electric off-road SUVs.</p>
<a>at least 231 times since March 2015</a>, when the coalition intervened. In 2018,
<a>a coalition airstrike dropped a US-made missile on a school bus of boys in the Houthi heartland of Saada</a>, killing 44.
<p>“Students do not feel safe while they get lessons. They can’t afford supplies. Schools are destroyed, homes are destroyed … years go by, and there is still no chance to get a proper education,” Ziad says.</p>
<p>“If the war continues, I do not think that my child or the rest of the children in Hodeidah will be able to have a better future. It has to end,” he says.</p>

<p>Three generations of the Kim family have ruled North Korea with absolute authority since 1948, and analysts say the regime has used carefully crafted images to ensure their power.</p>
<p>Carefully crafted photographs and films were “a universal part of politics” to win public support, said Michael Madden, fellow at the Stimson Center, but Pyongyang’s propaganda had different motives.</p>
<p>“In North Korea, it is not a matter of being responsive to public opinion, but influencing how … citizens view or regard the leadership.”</p>
<p>But analysts say that images carried by North Korea’s official KCNA news agency or the Rodong Sinmun newspaper have a wider purpose beyond aesthetics.</p>
<p>The images were aimed at “showing that sacrifices are being made at a time of hardship for the country”, Town said – but added that their effectiveness was unknown.</p>
