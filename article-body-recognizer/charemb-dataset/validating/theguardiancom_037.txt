<p>Shoppers have been shunning single-use plastic bags to save pennies rather than the planet, a “big data” study of more than 10,000 consumers has found.</p>
<p>The research by Nottingham University business school’s N/LAB analytics centre of excellence suggests the massive decline in plastic bag use in the UK may have little to do with shoppers’ concern for the environment.</p>
<p>The study drew on more than 1m loyalty card transactions to explore the psychological and demographic predictors of single-use bag purchases.</p>
<p>Researchers found bags are most likely to be bought by younger shoppers who are often male and less frugal but whose environmental concerns do not affect their decisions to buy or not.</p>
<p>The findings emerged with plastic bag consumption at its annual peak during the festive period, despite all retailers in England being legally required to charge 10p per bag.</p>
<p>The study co-author Dr James Goulding, N/LAB’s associate director, said: “Until now very little was known about the people who still regularly buy plastic bags – or those who don’t.</p>
<p>“Previous research has tended to focus exclusively on consumers’ personalities or motivations not, crucially, on whether an individual’s beliefs actually translate into action in the real world.</p>
<p>“Our approach recognises that people today leave in their wake a substantial amount of data that can help do social good and shed significant light on how they really behave in practice.”</p>
<p>Identified from the original dataset of 1,284,825 transactions at 1,222 stores, more than 10,000 consumers participated in a questionnaire exploring their circumstances, traits and environmental opinions.</p>
<p>Their survey responses were linked to their purchasing data, and a machine-learning algorithm was then used to determine the factors that actually predicted bag-buying behaviour.</p>
<p>The survey included questions about views on environmental considerations in general and climate change in particular, but these were found to have little influence on purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Dr Gavin Smith, an associate professor in analytics, said: “We expected our findings would show infrequent bag-buyers are at least partly motivated by a desire to save money.</p>
<p>“But what we didn’t expect, not least given environmentalism’s role in underpinning the levy on plastic bags, was that environmental concerns wouldn’t predict consumption at all.</p>
<p>Amid growing concerns over the contribution plastic bags make to pollution and litter, Wales introduced the UK’s first levy in 2011, with Northern Ireland following in 2013 and Scotland in 2014.</p>

<p>My insurer, the AA, appears to have lost my crashed car and can’t, or won’t, pay my claim as a result.</p>
<p>However, English Ford told me it had no record of the car. The AA then said it would ring me the next day. When it failed to do so, I raised an official complaint. I cannot afford to purchase another car until the claim is settled.</p>
<p>So far, as I am not able to determine that the AA has lost my car, my claim remains unsettled.</p>
<p>The AA told me that, despite appearances to the contrary, your car was never lost. It is at the salvage depot of the policy underwriter (Covéa) and has been deemed a total loss. Therefore payment is on its way.</p>

<h2>But there’s thunderous applause from a Bose customer</h2>
<p>Passengers travelling over the Christmas holiday have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 4,500 flights, according to a flight tracking website.</p>
<p>A surge of cancellations on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day came as the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant meant carriers were unable to staff their flights.</p>
<p>The bulk of the cancellations came from five firms, with China Eastern cancelling 474 journeys, while Air <a>China</a> scrapped 188. United cancelled 177 flights, Air India 160 and Delta called off 150.</p>
<p>In response to the pre-holiday chaos, airlines have called for the relaxation of quarantine rules for vaccinated staff.</p>
<p>Airlines’ social media feeds have been filled with frustrated passengers asking for assistance after a spate of cancellations on Christmas Eve owing to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season.</p>
<p>“We just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas,” Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York’s LaGuardia Airport.</p>
<p>New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year’s Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases, capping the number of attendees 15,000.</p>
<p>Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled <a>“race for space”</a> could be waning.</p>
<p>UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities.</p>
<p>However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged.</p>
<p>“When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove.</p>
<p>Rightmove said that flats had become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The complete reversal in demand from bigger houses to flats paints a picture of society opening up again and a group of people looking to be closer to city centres,” said Bannister.</p>
<p>Rightmove’s findings chime with trends identified by mortgage lender Halifax, which found that in November <a>flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year</a>, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more.</p>
<p>Despite the boost in popularity of flats, Rightmove said the longer-term trend towards bigger houses, in outer-city and rural or coastal locations, is here to stay.</p>
<p>Prospective buyers have widened their searches for their ideal home by an average of 50 sq km (19 sq miles), according to Rightmove.</p>
<p>In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached property.</p>
<p>“The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,” said Bannister.</p>
<p>Last week, Halifax forecast that the <a>boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year</a> as household finances become increasingly stretched.</p>
<p>The damaging effects of <a>Covid-19 on employment</a> and earnings for young people from less affluent backgrounds is revealed in a stark new report on the economic and social fallout from the pandemic.</p>
<p>The effects, it argues, would further widen the pay gap between those from rich and poorer backgrounds, and so damage social mobility.</p>
<p>In contrast, levels of financial security among young people from richer backgrounds rose from 79% to 94%.</p>
<p>Last month concerns were raised that chancellor <a>Rishi Sunak</a>’s flagship <a>£2bn pandemic jobs scheme</a> to get young people into work might not be delivering value for money.</p>
<p>The NAO, which monitors value for money on public spending, said the Department for Work and Pensions had only “limited assurance” that the scheme was working as intended.</p>
<p>Private sector firms that received state subsidies to hire young people might well have done so anyway, the NAO said, because the economy was reopening just as the scheme began to ramp up.</p>
<p>The report also found that there was relatively little early take-up for Kickstart due to successive lockdowns depressing demand for workers.</p>
<p>Labour said its own analysis had found that the scheme was heavily weighted towards the south, with as many jobs created there as in the north and Midlands combined, despite higher youth unemployment in those regions.</p>
<p>The government says its plans for jobs is working with the number of young employees on payrolls back above pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The number of homes bought by Londoners outside the capital increased by 62% compared with 2020, according to estate agent Hamptons.</p>
<p>Aneisha Beveridge, the firm’s head of research, said: “City leavers have changed the geography of not only the commuter belt, but smaller towns and cities across southern England.”</p>
<p>Beveridge said that while most (57%) of those leaving London were selling a home in the capital and buying a new one elsewhere, a record number of London renters were buying their first home in a more affordable location.</p>
<p>Fry said the family had planned to move out of London “in theory” in a few years time when Willa would be starting school, but the pandemic accelerated their plan.</p>
<p>“We got a lot more for our money. We weren’t looking for acres and acres of land, but we have got a nice big garden and the countryside on our doorstep.”</p>
<p>The family visits London often, but Fry said lockdown had taught them that more space, a garden and easy access to wide open natural spaces is “more important to us than the buzz of the big city”.</p>
<p>“We love London so much – the convenience, and all the excitement that comes with it – but the quality of life is just much better here and we can get to London in no time and enjoy it for its best bits without having to live with its worse bits.”</p>
<p>“Many people don’t need to be so close to their work and commutes can be longer and coincidently we want better services like faster broadband to make these homes work better.</p>
<p>They spent £54.9bn, the highest annual spend on record, reflecting soaring property prices, which have been lifted by the government’s temporary cut to stamp duty. The average London house price has risen from £450,460 in 2020 to £486,890 in 2021.</p>
<p>“It is getting tense,” said Rob Hannaford, leader of the Labour group of Devon county council. “People coming down with big budgets is causing anger and resentment.”</p>
<p>Newcomers resist any suggestion they are causing a problem and some stressed they wanted to become part of the community and contribute with their different skills and experience.</p>
<p>But, said Laura Wright, the Exeter city councillor in charge of council housing and deputy leader, there was “growing alarm at the prices that some people are willing and able to pay to move here from London”.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we have been locked into a way of thinking and acting over the last 20 years which values making the biggest profit possible above collective responsibility for social cohesion and welfare.”</p>
<p>Becky Merriman, 34, a youth worker, has been unable find a rental home in Exeter, which means she has to commute 40 minutes each way and continue to live with her parents.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying since May and it has been quite traumatic,” she said. “We would ring agents as soon as a property went up [online] and they would say the viewings were all gone in 10 minutes. It’s mentally exhausting.”</p>
<p>In West Devon, which includes half of Dartmoor, house prices have risen 20% in the last year and 800 households are waiting for social housing.</p>
<p>The government has quietly backtracked on proposals to require every shop, office or factory in England to install at least one electric car charger if they have a large car park, prompting criticism by environmental campaigners.</p>
<a>response</a> to a consultation.
<p>“It is inexplicable that a government committed to phasing out conventional cars has failed to follow through and implement its own proposals from more than two years ago, and instead say it needs longer to consider the options.”</p>
<p><a>Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans last month</a> for a charging point to be required for every new or refurbished residential building from next year amid great fanfare, saying the regulations were “world-leading”.</p>
<p>However, the decision to drop the requirement for existing non-residential buildings means the UK could fall behind the EU, which is introducing a rule for existing buildings to install cable routes for chargers after 2025.</p>
<a>separate consultation</a> that closed last month on the future of transport regulations.
<a>recouped within a few years</a> by charging users for electricity.
<p>All the large UK supermarket chains, led by Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, have already started installing electric car chargers to try to lure shoppers – who can top up on energy while they shop.</p>
<p>A DfT spokesperson said: “We have recently introduced world-leading legislation which requires new homes and non-residential buildings, such as offices and supermarkets, with associated parking to have charge points installed.</p>

<p>As always, there are so many worthy contenders for an award, but it’s been a pleasure to narrow them down to the following standout takes on customer service. In all cases, the customer was only offered effective service after I intervened.</p>
<h2>Bleeding heart for empathy</h2>
<h2>Surrealism in Whitehall</h2>
<a>penalised a universal credit claimant for not applying while in an induced coma</a>. The Home Office, whose rules on residency permits are so misleading and whose stance, when applicants are duly misled, so intransigent, that
<a>an eligible spouse was denied indefinite leave to remain</a> and presented with a £1,000 bill for NHS services.
<a>left families in legal limbo for up to nine months</a>.
<a>refused to require hosts to refund customers whose trips were banned by government rules</a>, while deducting its 15% service fee from hosts who decided to do the right thing.
<h2>Distinguished desertion order</h2>
<p>Ministers’ crunch talks with energy bosses have failed to deliver a breakthrough despite the industry’s calls for an urgent intervention and a warning from the founder of Ovo Energy that household bills will “almost certainly” double in April.</p>
<p>The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, held the virtual meeting on Monday to <a>address fears that the winter energy crisis</a> may escalate after new gas price highs across Europe last week.</p>
<p>Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of energy supplier Ovo, told the BBC there had been “nowhere near enough urgency” from the government, even as soaring wholesale costs threatened “an enormous crisis for 2022”.</p>
<p>“From where they were April 2021 to April 2022 it looks almost certain now that bills are going to reach £2,000 per household, which is going to be double what they were paying last year,” he said.</p>
<p>A source told the Daily Telegraph that the UK faces a “doubling or trebling of bills”, with the government being called on to plug an estimated £20bn rise in the global cost of energy.</p>
<p>“We’ve had <a>more than 30 bankruptcies in the sector</a>, we’ve had millions of customers forced to change supplier. The cost to the consumer has already been more than £4bn.”</p>
<p>He added: “We haven’t seen any action from the government or from the regulator. There’s an acceptance that there’s a problem, but nowhere near enough urgency to find a solution.”</p>
<p>A government spokesperson confirmed that a meeting was held between the business secretary, energy bosses and <a>Ofgem</a> to discuss “the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector”.</p>
<p>“Throughout the meeting there was discussion of the issues facing the sector and an agreement for meetings to continue over the coming days and weeks to ensure UK consumers are protected,” the spokesperson added. </p>
<p>Energy bosses are expected to call for the government to offer help to hard-hit households by cutting VAT from bills, and moving green support levies into general taxation.</p>
<p>They are also expected to discuss new ways to manage the cost of energy company failures, which has affected millions of households since September.</p>
<a>even larger increases in April</a> when the regulator is due to reset its energy price cap.
<p>The Liberal Democrats have calculated that households are likely to pay a total of £100m more for their gas and electricity between Christmas and the new year compared with last year.</p>
<p>Ed Davey, the party’s leader, said the government had “totally failed to tackle the problem” and called on ministers to double the financial help offered through the <a>warm home discount</a> scheme.</p>
<p>A mortgage lender is letting homebuyers borrow up to seven times their income – well above the traditional maximum – which it says will allow some to buy a property they might have assumed was well out of their price range.</p>
<p>Banks and building societies look at various aspects of people’s finances when deciding how big a mortgage they will let someone take out.</p>
<p>Traditionally the typical maximum “income multiple” available in the UK is about 4.5 times salary, though in 2021 a number of big lenders including <a>Halifax</a> and <a>HSBC</a> have lifted their caps to 5.5 times for certain borrowers.</p>
<p>Higher-income earners on a minimum £75,000 basic salary are also eligible. Borrowers will need a deposit of at least 10%.</p>
<p>In a joint application only one person will be accepted for up to seven times salary, while the other will have their salary multiplied by five. Interest rates on the mortgages start at 2.99%</p>
<p>The <a>Bank of England</a> has announced plans to ease mortgage lending rules in a move that could help thousands of first-time buyers get on to the property ladder.</p>
<p>The central bank said it wanted to remove a requirement that forces borrowers to be able to afford a three-percentage-point rise in interest rates before they can be approved for a home loan.</p>
<p>It will consult on the change in the first half of next year, as part of an overhaul to measures first introduced in 2014 after the 2008 financial crisis to curb excessive risk-taking by high street lenders.</p>
<p>Speaking as the Bank issued its regular financial stability report, Bailey said the UK financial system was well equipped to deal with a potential fresh economic downturn caused by the emergence of the coronavirus Omicron variant.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be a big stress event,” he said.</p>
<p>Publishing the results of its annual stress tests of the banking system, Threadneedle Street said the UK’s eight biggest banks had sufficient resources to continue lending to the UK economy in a more severe downturn to the one experienced in 2020.</p>
<a>countercyclical capital buffer</a>”, a rule which forces banks to have a sufficient cushion of capital to absorb losses. The buffer will be set at 1% with a 12-month implementation period.
<p>It said it expected to announce a further increase in the buffer to 2% – equating to about £22bn of capital – if the economy continued to recover as hoped between now and the middle of next year.</p>
<p>Threadneedle Street <a>cancelled its stress tests last year</a> during the first wave of the pandemic, saying that bank resources should be aimed at supporting households and businesses through the emergency.</p>
<p>The tests, first undertaken in 2014, were developed after the 2008 financial crisis to determine whether the UK’s biggest banks could keep lending during a recession.</p>
<p>Borrowers are being given the chance to lock their mortgage repayments at the same level for up to 40 years with the launch of the longest fixed-rate deal on the market.</p>
<p>The lender Habito plans to launch a range of mortgages for borrowers with a 10% deposit that offers fixed-rate terms of up to four decades. The rates are based on the size of the deposit and how long the borrower wants to repay their mortgage.</p>
<p>Someone taking the 40-year option with a 40% deposit will fix at 4.2%, while a borrower with just 10% to put down will pay 5.35%.</p>
<a>have led to borrowers extending their repayments over a longer period</a>, even though over the course of the mortgage they will pay much more in interest.
<p>Many opt to lock in to a fixed rate for only the first few years of their borrowing, because these tend to have lower rates, and switch to a new deal after that.</p>
<p>Long-term fixed-rate mortgages are popular in other countries but have never taken off in the UK, despite previous moves to encourage lenders and borrowers to consider them.</p>
<p>A <a>2004 review of the mortgage market recommended them</a>, but in the intervening years only a handful of deals offering a fixed rate for longer than 10 years have been launched.</p>
<p>The 95% mortgage guarantee announced in last week’s budget came with a condition that <a>lenders offer borrowers the opportunity to fix their rates for at least five years</a>, which the Treasury said would offer “valuable extra certainty”.</p>
<p>The Habito One mortgage lets borrowers fix their interest rate for a term from 10 to 40 years, with those opting for the longest terms paying the highest rate. </p>
<p>The lender plans to offer 95% mortgages from early summer.</p>
<p>Daniel Hegarty, the founder and chief executive of Habito, said: “The future has never been less predictable and we need our homes to provide us with safety and financial security.</p>
<p>“The vast majority<sup> </sup>of us on a mortgage that’s fixed for two to five years are effectively trapped in a system that doesn’t fit our financial future or our homebuying habits.”</p>
<p>David Hollingworth at the mortgage broker LC said the 40-year rate was “something of a departure from the mainstream maximum fixes of 10 to 15 years”.</p>
<p>Early repayment charges had previously been a problem with long-term fixed-rate offers, he said, as borrowers often liked the flexibility to review their mortgage at a later date.</p>

<p>Bulb <a>Energy</a> was once the fastest-growing supplier in Britain’s energy market, and one of the UK’s most celebrated startups.</p>
<p>But the company may be best remembered as the biggest casualty of the energy market crisis after it handed the responsibility for supplying gas and electricity to 1.7m homes <a>to a special administrator</a> on Monday.</p>
<a>“toxic work culture”</a> and rising
<p>The company’s collapse came as little surprise to anyone in the energy industry.</p>
<p>“Sadly, today’s news has been a long time coming,” said Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower.</p>
<p>Bulb’s major strength was its marketing: it excelled at attracting new customers through lucrative referral payments <a>and green energy claims</a>, and managed to secure willing investors by talking up its credentials as a tech startup.</p>
<p>But Bulb’s rivals have long claimed that the company’s business model, green credentials and fundraising were all unsustainable because it relied on <a>greenwashing</a>, and “too good to be true” energy prices to help fuel its rapid growth.</p>
<p>Government officials and ministers were also taken in by Bulb’s seemingly unstoppable success, and as one senior industry source said, and “loved them” because “they came in to challenge the incumbent suppliers and grew at scale”.</p>

<li>Latest: Ryanair predicts higher loss and cuts January capacity</li>
<li>Investec: UK energy bills could hit £2,000 next year when cap lifted</li>
<p>The surge in energy prices is forcing industrial giants to cut production, threatening the economic recovery, points out Bloomberg tonight:</p>
<p>With energy costs spiking to fresh records day after day, financial strain is mounting for industries including metals and fertilizers. Aluminium Dunkerque Industries France, Europe’s top smelter of the metal, curbed output in the past two weeks.</p>
<p> Trafigura’s <a>Nyrstar</a> will pause zinc production in France in early January and Romanian fertilizer maker Azomures temporarily halted activity.</p>
<h2>Gas prices close lower, but near record levels</h2>
<p>Gas prices eased back from their record highs set yesterday, despite ongoing tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, and rising demand as the weather turns chillier.</p>
<p>The UK next-day gas price slipped by 11% to end at 404p per therm - its second highest close ever, after yesterday, and still six times higher than back in January.</p>
<p>The month-ahead price of European gas dropped too, down 8.5% to €165.5 per megawatt hour, again the second highest price on record.</p>
<p>Back in the gas sector, Ukraine’s Naftogaz said today it has asked the EU competition watchdog to stop what it says is abuse by Russia’s Gazprom of its dominant position in the European gas market, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Gazprom, which accounts for around a third of total gas supplies to Europe, did not respond to a request for comment on Ukrainian energy company’s move.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the European Commission said it had received the complaint which would be assessed based on its standard procedures.</p>
<p>Vitrenko said in a statement that Gazprom was also blocking exports of gas produced by private companies in Russia and the transit of gas from Central Asia to Europe.</p>

<h2>FTSE 100 closes higher</h2>
<p>After a late burst, the UK’s FTSE 100 index has ended the day up 44 points or 0.6% at 7341.6 points.</p>
<p>That’s the blue-chip index’s highest level in almost two weeks, and its highest close in over a month.</p>
<p>Risers included hotel groups InterContinental (+2.7%) and Whitbread (+2.4%) and conference organiser Informa (+2.36%).</p>
<p>The more UK-focused FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies jumped 1.1%, with travel catering group SSP (+4.7%) and shared office letting company IWG (+4%) gaining.</p>
<a>The FT has more details here</a>.
<p>However, a <a>World Health Organization</a> (WHO) official has said it is too soon to say whether the new variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant, almost a month after South Africa first raised the alarm about its emergence.</p>
<p>WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said.</p>
<blockquote> <div> <p>“We do have some data suggesting that rates of hospitalisation are lower,”</p> </div> </blockquote>
<p>But she warned against drawing conclusions from early data because:</p>
<p>European markets hit their highest levels in nearly a week, with the Stoxx 600 ending at a two-week closing high.</p>
<p>Here’s some expert reaction to Ryanair’s news, from Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst:</p>
<p>Omicron is taking a toll and an update from Ryanair clearly shows the impact it’s having on the travel sector.</p>
<p>But there is a glimmer of hope woven between the lines that time may yet bring a positive update from those clever scientist types that could flick the switch of consumer confidence back to on. </p>
<p>... and Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor:</p>
<p>Airline stocks have had a torrid time during the pandemic, with no let up in the face of the latest Omicron variant. Ryanair <a>has cut its full-year earnings guidance</a> in yet another sign of pain for the embattled travel sector.</p>
<h2>Ryanair doubles annual loss forecast and slashes January capacity over Omicron</h2>
<p>Ryanair has more than doubled its forecast annual loss and cut its planned January schedule capacity by 33% due to the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Irish budget airline has warned that Omicron and recent Government travel restrictions across Europe have “notably weakened” its bookings for Christmas New Year travel.</p>
<p>Ryanair has cut its December passenger forecast to a range of 9 to 9.5 million, from 10 to 11 million before, saying:</p>
<p>Ryanair now expects to make a net loss of between €250m and €450m in the 12 months to the end of March, up from a previous forecast of a loss of between €100m and €200m.</p>
<p>It now expects to carry between 6m and 7m passengers in January, down from approximately 10m before, due to its 33% reduction in flight capacity.</p>
<p>In light of the current uncertainty about the Omicron variant, and intra Europe travel restrictions, no schedule cutbacks have yet been decided for February or March 2022, Ryanair adds, explaining:</p>
<h2>US consumer confidence beats expectations</h2>
<p>The Conference Board’s index of consumer morale has increased to 115.8 from an upwardly revised 111.9 reading in November. </p>
<p>Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, explains:</p>
<p>The latest ONS consumer trends report shows UK household spending grew by 2.7% quarter-on-quarter in the July-September period.</p>
<p>That’s a 5.3% rise year-on-year, thanks to a 38.1% jump in spending on restaurants and hotels, as interactive investor’s Victoria Scholar explains:</p>
<p>Plus with interest rates at rock-bottom and inflation on the rise, the impetus to spend rather than save has increased.</p>
<h2>Full story: Kremlin denies restricting gas supplies to Europe for political gain</h2>
<p>The Kremlin has denied using Russia’s gas resources to turn the screw on Europe, after gas in a pipeline to Germany switched direction to flow eastwards for a second day, keeping prices near record highs as midwinter approaches.</p>
<p>Flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline to Germany declined over the weekend before stopping on Tuesday and reversing, data from the network operator Gascade showed.</p>
<p>Gazprom, the Russian state gas firm, said the supply was flowing to Russia instead because of cold weather and high demand there.</p>
<p>The supply squeeze came as Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, called for urgent action to counter rocketing fuel costs. </p>
<p>He said companies profiting from the crisis should contribute to efforts to curb higher bills for households and businesses.</p>
<blockquote> <div> <p>“There are big producers and sellers of energy that are having fantastic profits. They will need to participate to support the economy, they too need to help families.”</p> </div> </blockquote>
<p>It could be a signal that Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, is ready to run for the Italian presidency and return the running of the government back to political parties.</p>
<p>Associated Press explains all:</p>
<p>“My personal destiny matters absolutely not at all,” he said. “I don’t have particular aspirations of one type or another. I’m a man, a nonno (grandfather) if you like, at the service of institutions.”</p>
<p>The US economy grew a little faster than previously thought in the third quarter of the year, new figures show.</p>
<p>US GDP grew at an an annualised rate of 2.3%, or nearly 0.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. That’s up from the previous estimate of 2.1%, but still slower than the 6.7% annualised growth in Q2.</p>
<p>From the second quarter to the third quarter, spending for goods turned down (led by motor vehicles and parts) and services decelerated (led by food services and accommodations), the Commerce Department reports.</p>
<p>Wall Street is set for a mixed start, with the futures market showing the Dow Jones industrial average slightly higher but Nasdaq futures a little lower.</p>
<p>Investors continue to weigh up the likely impact of the fast-spreading Omicron variant which has led to new restrictions in parts of Europe:</p>
<p>Rabobank macro strategists Bas van Geffen and Elwin de Groot told clients in a note that: </p>
<p>Despite more reports that European governments are introducing new measures to curb the spread of COVID, market participants already seem to have made up their minds that the threat of the quick advancing Omicron variant is manageable, for now.</p>

<p>Rising energy prices will hand <a>Rishi Sunak</a> a “windfall” of £3.1bn since October’s budget, a Labour analysis has claimed, which the party has urged the chancellor to spend on cutting household bills.</p>
<p>Labour said the receipts would cover the projected £2.4bn cost of removing VAT from gas and electricity bills over the winter months .</p>
<p>The figures come from House of Commons library research, commissioned by Labour, which projects £3.1bn extra in VAT receipts in 2021-22, making a total of £135bn.</p>
<p>But the shadow chancellor, <a>Rachel Reeves</a>, said the additional cash compared with pre-budget forecasts meant the chancellor could give some relief on energy bills.</p>
<a>review of the energy price cap</a>, which some experts have predicted could rise by as much as 40% when Ofgem sets it again in February. The energy regulator is also expected to enact a series of changes after the collapse of so many small providers.
<p>The cap for the average household is £1,277 a year, but the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change estimated it could rise to almost £1,800.</p>
<p>“We need a sustainable and ambitious approach to energy, which is why Labour would also ramp up ambition with our plan to retrofit 19m homes, making our energy supply chain more secure without hitting household savings,” Reeves said.</p>
<p>“On top of the biggest tax burden in 70 years, Conservative complacency is making the cost of living crisis worse and storing up long-term problems, with working people paying the price.”</p>

<p>The financial impact of the pandemic is likely to make more people vulnerable to these scams, which promise attractive returns on diminished savings.</p>
<p>Howland was sent a series of professional-looking emails from what appeared to be a Saga email address, bearing the Saga logo and a link to its genuine website.</p>
<p>They stated that the investment schemes in question were being offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs International and were protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>

<p>After discussions with our asset manager, we both invested a further £205,000. I’d asked about financial protection and been reassured, in a detailed letter, about the FSCS and first charge legal protection.</p>
<p>The real Vanguard told me that it was aware of a number of attempts to impersonate it and that it reports all scams to the regulators. Action Fraud said it was investigating.</p>
<p>What it means, however, is that there’s no coverage for customers who booked accommodation after 15 March, unless the host’s terms and conditions include a refund clause.</p>
<p>Government lockdowns and tier restrictions are not considered “extenuating circumstances” because, Airbnb argues, Covid-19 is no longer an unforeseen event.</p>
<p>It takes a different stance with hosts who cancel because of government rules. They can do so without incurring the usual cancellation fee demanded by Airbnb, or compromising their coveted “superhost” status.</p>
<p>Even when hosts with no-refund policies do agree to reimburse guests who cancel, Airbnb still retains its service fee, which is usually 14% of the total booking. Meanwhile, the host may retain the cleaning charge in these circumstances. </p>
<p>“I understand booking a holiday during a pandemic was always a risk and that we have been lucky to afford to go away, but for us to be punished as responsible travellers feels a kick in the teeth,” said Tyler.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are enshrined in law and the CMA is adamant that customers should be refunded if the legislation scuppers their holiday.</p>

<p>Women who applied for EU settled status in the UK under their married names may struggle to access jobs and housing because of a government computer anomaly, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Many have been left unable to prove their status to councils and employers because they have been wrongly registered to the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) in their birth names.</p>
<p>A French woman who has lived in the UK since 1977 told the Guardian she fears she could lose her state pension after the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) wrote to remind her to apply to the settlement scheme before the 30 June deadline.</p>
<p>The Home Office told the Guardian that individuals must use one name for all official documents and can update their details by following the process on the <a>“update your UK visas and immigration account details”</a> service on gov.uk.</p>
<p>The DWP told the Guardian that the state pension is based on an individual’s national insurance record, not their nationality.</p>
<p>Unlike other migrants living in the UK, EU nationals have to rely on digital share codes to prove their right to remain, and campaigners are urging the government to issue physical permits as backup.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesperson said agents have had seven months to adjust and that technical problems affecting access to EUSS accounts are usually resolved swiftly.</p>
<h2>The lowdown on the EUSS</h2>
<p>Anyone who fails to apply before the deadline or who does not qualify for the scheme will become an illegal immigrant from 1 July, while landlords and employers face large penalties if they do not confirm an applicant’s legal rights.</p>
<p>To prove they have been granted settled status, EU-born residents must generate a share code via an online immigration portal, which they can give to landlords and employers.</p>
<p>UPS didn’t comment on the fact that the parcel was redelivered after you had rejected it and Loxhome didn’t address the confusion of the invoice. Instead it blamed UPS for not returning the parcel to the sender.</p>
<p>The eBay seller Jordan Thomis took the precaution of insuring the £165 shoes he was sending to a buyer. It was just as well because the parcel was collected from the drop-off point by the courier firm DPD and never seen again.</p>
<p>But when Thomis made a claim, DPD refused to pay because, it insisted, the parcel contained a prohibited item.</p>
<p>“I was prompted to check the list of prohibited items when filling out the online order and footwear did not appear,” he says. “Nor was it flagged as prohibited when I identified footwear in the item description box.”</p>
<p>UPS and DPD ban “personal effects”. Hermes says it will not offer compensation for “composite items of any description” and “items which can be exchanged by themselves, or with any other item, for money or goods or services”.</p>
<p>The lists provide an opt-out clause for some delivery firms to deny liability if they lose or damage parcels of a wide range of everyday goods – even when customers have paid extra for insurance.</p>
<p>Thomis had checked DPD’s prohibited list for footwear. It wasn’t mentioned but shoes were excluded from cover.</p>
<p>Shoes have since been removed from the list but any customer sending an ornament, or cheque, or any of the 160 items ranging from bulbs to seat belt tensioners that DPD prohibits will find themselves without recompense if they go astray.</p>
<p>Because the extra cover sold by delivery firms is a built-in extension of their conditions of carriage rather than an insurance policy, it is outside the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service, so customers can’t seek arbitration.</p>
<p>The prohibited lists have allowed firms to avoid liability for inadequate security at drop-off points, and for mistakes by overstretched drivers.</p>
<p>The cast-iron casserole was badly damaged, as was a second identical one posted days later, but Hermes refused to pay out for either item, claiming they were prohibited.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, our customer services team will make goodwill payments in clear-cut cases where loss is the primary issue,” it says.</p>
<p>DPD says it prohibits items that, if not adequately packaged, might break or put workers at risk. When asked why customers aren’t alerted if they try to send a banned item, it insists that the required information is on its website.</p>
<p>Yodel declined to comment.</p>
<p>Penelope’s daughter, Jessica, one of the beneficiaries of the will, says the experience has been “like a nightmare. I have found it difficult to sleep because I feel very responsible – I am also one of the executors – for my cousins and siblings”.</p>
<p>A backlog caused by Covid restrictions has been compounded by a £1bn shake-up of the courts and tribunals process.</p>
<p>“Most of the probate services I encountered are entirely online forms and sympathetic videos. I was alarmed that at the one time you really need to talk to a financial service, you can’t.”</p>
<p>The centralised system includes a helpline, but callers face waits of up to an hour and agents are often unable to find information.</p>
<p>Ormerod explains that when she started the process, there was an Oxford office with “helpful staff that I could bike over to in 10 minutes”.</p>
<p>She was granted probate within 12 hours when the Observer intervened. The Ministry of Justice blamed “human error”.</p>
<p>Probate solicitors report the same problems and claim the mandatory online application process was rolled out prematurely.</p>
<p>The human cost can be immense. Pauline Alvarez from Oxford applied for probate after the sudden death of her brother and was still waiting, unable to get through on the helpline, nine months later.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice says average waiting times for paper applications have fallen to between five and six weeks after extra staff were hired, and straightforward online applications are taking a week to process.</p>
<p>It told the Observer that centralisation of services spared applicants the need to travel to registries, and user feedback was monitored to ensure the to make the service as empathetic as possible.</p>
<p>What the website should have said is that applicants with family visas must have been living on the five-year route to ILR for five years. My wife was put on that in 2017.</p>
<p>The head of customer and client operations has requested a detailed report of your experience so the many failings can be addressed, and you have received a call from a senior manager and a letter offering £500 in goodwill.</p>
<p>You have fallen victim of a double whammy – PayPal’s inadequate filters and the fact you are buying from a US company. UN sanctions against Iran were lifted in 2016 and UK businesses can buy and sell there, but the US reimposed restrictions in 2018.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson will seek to boost the UK’s clean energy credentials after a tricky UN climate crisis conference by announcing that all new buildings in England will be required to install electric vehicle charge points from next year.</p>
<p>In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in the north-east of England on Monday, the prime minister will reveal plans, briefed as “world-leading”, to toughen up regulations for new homes and buildings.</p>
<p>Buildings undergoing renovations that leave them with more than 10 parking spaces will also be subject to the new measures.</p>
<p>Heralding the importance of clean energy just weeks after the UK hosted Cop26, Johnson will say the country is at a pivotal moment, adding: “We cannot go on as we are.”</p>
<p>Defending the new requirements, Johnson will add: “We must regulate less or better and take advantage of new freedoms.”</p>
<p>The prime minister’s climate spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, raised eyebrows in August when she revealed she was still driving a third-hand diesel. When asked why she did not drive an electric vehicle, she said: “I don’t fancy it just yet.”</p>
<p>However, in October, just before world leaders gathered for Cop26, Stratton revealed she had ditched the diesel car.</p>
<ul><li><a>Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars</a></li></ul>
<p>The UK’s competition authority has called for the government to intervene in the electric car charger market to prevent “charging deserts” and increase availability in <a>locations outside London, which remain underserved</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Competition and Markets Authority</a> (CMA) also said it had opened an investigation into the dominance of one provider, Electric Highway, in the fast-charging network at motorway service stations.</p>
<p>In a statement, Gridserve said its chargers already aligned with the CMA’s principles on being open to all.</p>
<p>“There needs to be action now to address the postcode lottery in electric vehicle charging as we approach the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.”</p>
<p>The UK car industry backed the call for urgent action. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government needed to “make recharging as simple and accessible as refuelling.”</p>

<p>Reports of a “death of the city” due to the Covid crisis have been greatly exaggerated, according to a survey of Parisians and Londoners that found little change in people’s satisfaction with urban life or plans to move out in the near future.</p>
<a>The report by King’s College London and the Université de Paris</a>, based on polling carried out in April and May, found that cafe, club and restaurant closures, lockdowns and home working had not dented inhabitants’ enthusiasm for the two capitals.
<p>Compared with a pre-pandemic survey in 2019, the study found little change in the share of Londoners and Parisians planning to leave, greater satisfaction with local services and majorities believing their capital will bounce back, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has forced a change in the way we live our lives, and that has had a particular impact on cities, with offices left vacant or only minimally used for long periods of time,” said Kelly Beaver of pollsters Ipsos Mori.</p>
<p>“The ‘decline of the city’ doesn’t seem to take enough account of the views and beliefs of the people who live in them – who are mostly happy with where they live. The future of London and Paris as powerhouse capital cities seems secure.”</p>
<p>Most Londoners (66%) and Parisians (57%) said they thought it likely their city would bounce back from the Covid crisis, although most also expected the recovery to be slow rather than fast (57% in London and 58% in Paris).</p>
<p>“At a time when the pandemic has brought the future of urban life into question, it’s reassuring to see that the ‘death of the city’ feared by some has not manifested,” said Jack Brown, a lecturer in London studies at King’s College.</p>
<p>More than 60% of greater London residents said they thought immigration from outside the UK has had a positive impact on the capital, compared with 27% of greater Paris residents who said the same about immigration from outside <a>France</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, 53% of people in greater Paris said they felt their city was a good place to live for families, compared with 43% of Londoners, and 50% of Parisians said their city is good for older people, compared with 31% of Londoners.</p>
<p>Among people who do not own their own home, Londoners (89%) were more likely than Parisians (76%) to agree property was too expensive for them – but 73% of Londoners thought their city was a good place to start a career, against 51% in Paris.</p>
<p>The plan would also oblige employers to respond to such requests more quickly, and is being billed as a major reshaping of the way people work in a post-pandemic world, making flexible work the default.</p>
<p>But before the release of the document, unions are warning that the proposals do not go far enough and that rather than obliging people to ask for flexible working, job adverts should set out what sort of options are available for the role.</p>
<p>The consultation document, due to be published on Thursday by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis), comes from a wider programme called <a>the Good Work Plan</a>, begun in 2019.</p>
<p>It is examining the full range of flexible working, including working fewer or different hours, or so-called compressed hours – working more hours on fewer days – working from home for some or all the time, and job shares.</p>
<p>While the proposals have not yet been released, it is understood that the key recommendation will be to allow people to seek flexible working from day one of a job rather than, as now, having to wait for six months.</p>
<p>Sue Coe, the TUC’s senior equalities policy officer, said labour force survey statistics showed that between 2013 and 2020 the proportion of people who did any kind of flexible working rose only from 26% to 30%.</p>
<p>Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Labour will give workers the right to flexible working – not just the right to request it – and give all workers full rights from day one on the job. </p>
<p>While Beis is not commenting before the consultation is released, officials are understood to believe that the proposals are a sensible attempt to find a balance between the needs of staff and those of employers.</p>
<p>Gould decided she wanted space to “breathe and walk around”, to be somewhere you don’t have to lock your front door.</p>
<p>Now she is moving to Norfolk, more than 100 miles away.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has prompted a shift: city dwellers such as Gould are moving en masse to rural regions as the pandemic exposes the shortcomings with people’s living arrangements, with many wanting more space as they work from home.</p>
<p>Data provided to the Guardian by Hamptons International estate agents shows 63% of new properties in Tandridge in Surrey and Sevenoaks in Kent have been bought by Londoners.</p>
<p>But moving has been hard, she says, because properties are getting snapped up, leading to price rises, and so far she has been unable to secure anything.</p>
<p>Working from home was also a key contributor; with so many Londoners no longer based at their workplace full-time they have the freedom to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sally Yates, 44, from Hackney, lives in social housing in Highbury, and has never lived anywhere other than London – until now. She has just had an offer accepted on a property in Dorset.</p>
<p>“What I really want is to have space around me, some privacy and more living space. I live in a basement flat and coronavirus has been pretty intense as it has been me and my 22-year-old daughter shuffling around the flat,” he says.</p>
<p>“I have got a vulnerable family so I have to be very cautious. I want a nicer environment – more space and to be in a community that is small and supportive. I want to be near the sea.”</p>

<p>Chancellor <a>Rishi Sunak</a>’s flagship £2bn pandemic jobs scheme to get young people into work may not be delivering value for money, the spending watchdog has said.</p>
<p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), and a separate one by a group of peers, has highlighted concerns that youth unemployment policies are either insufficient or flawed.</p>
<p>The Kickstart scheme, launched by Sunak in September 2020, offers government-funded “high-quality” job placements for 16- to 24-year-olds who are on universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>A <a>report by the NAO</a>, which monitors value for money on public spending, said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had only “limited assurance” that the scheme was working as intended.</p>
<p>Private sector firms that received state subsidies to hire young people might well have done so anyway, the NAO said, because the economy was reopening just as the scheme began to ramp up.</p>
<p>The report also found that there was relatively little early take-up for Kickstart due to successive lockdowns depressing demand for workers, so far the scheme has created 96,700 jobs rather than the targeted 250,000.</p>
<p>When firms did start hiring, the NAO said, there was little monitoring by government to check that the jobs it funded were of good quality, with young staff offered training and support, and that they were offered to the right people.</p>
<p>Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “At the start of the pandemic, DWP acted quickly to set up Kickstart to help young people into work when youth unemployment was predicted to rise significantly.</p>
<p>Labour said its own analysis had found that the scheme was heavily weighted towards the south, with as many jobs created there as in the north and Midlands combined, despite higher youth unemployment in those regions.</p>
<p>“The chancellor’s ‘plan for jobs’ has failed to plan for the jobs our country actually needs in the places that need them most,” said shadow DWP minister Jonathan Reynolds.</p>
<p>Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said Kickstart was “not perfect” but that it had an important role to play.</p>
<p>“The government should now work more closely with unions on the next phase so that we can give young workers a voice in improving the scheme,” she said.</p>
<p>“The scheme has already delivered over 100,000 new life-changing jobs for young jobseekers on universal credit who were at risk of long-term unemployment and will continue to deliver opportunities for young people.”</p>
<p>The NAO’s assessment of Kickstart was accompanied by a separate but similarly critical report by a cross-party committee on youth employment, which stands at 11.7%.</p>
<p>The peers accused the government of allowing hundreds of thousands of young people to languish in unemployment when they could be learning new skills or serving apprenticeships.</p>
<p>The report produced 71 recommendations to bridge a skills gap that left many young people trapped on low incomes without the skills to change their circumstances.</p>
<p>Shipley, a liberal peer and former leader of Newcastle city council, said 631,000 young people were not in education, employment or training (NEET) and 475,000 were unemployed.</p>

<p>The relaxation of lockdown rules in July sparked a surge of hiring among UK firms, but staff shortages caused by the pandemic and <a>Brexit</a> could still undermine the recovery, the professional services group BDO reported on Monday.</p>
<p>BDO’s latest business trends report found that the jobs market strengthened last month, as hospitality venues such as restaurants and bars were allowed to operate without Covid-related capacity limits.</p>
<p>Pressure on global supply chains, and problems importing goods and materials due to the UK’s exit from the EU, both pushed up costs, BDO reported, along with rising wages as employers paid more to attract and retain talent.</p>
<p>Some companies have recently <a>introduced signing-on bonuses of up to £10,000 to attract</a> job applications.</p>
<p><a>Last week, the Bank of England predicted that unemployment had peaked</a>, with a tight labour market leaving some employers struggling to hire staff. The Bank also forecast that inflation would hit a 10-year high of 4% by the end of the year.</p>
<p>But the SME barometer also found a regional split, with 71% of London and south-east small firms feeling positive about the UK’s economic outlook, in comparison with 60% in Scotland and 59% in the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside.</p>
<p>Many firms, especially outside London and the south-east, cited Brexit as a threat – along with the economy, Covid-19 and competition.</p>

<p>The “race for space” that became characteristic of the property market during the Covid pandemic could be starting to slow, according to Halifax.</p>
<p>As people shunned city centre work and life during lockdowns, and the government introduced a stamp duty holiday, demand for country living – or at least a spare room – grew.</p>
<p>In November, flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more.</p>
<a>England and Northern Ireland</a>, until the end of June homes costing up to £500,000 could change hands with no tax to be paid.
<p>Buyers paying more than that for a property could save £15,000 in duty – enough to persuade many to bring forward purchases, or to look in a slightly higher price bracket than they might have otherwise.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the stamp duty break, which was phased out over the summer and ended on 30 September, plus the reopening of some city centre offices, could have tipped demand towards flats.</p>
<p>There is evidence of an increase in demand from buyers. According to the property website Rightmove, in November last year detached homes were the most searched for, but last month flats took over.</p>
<p>“Flats are making a bit of a comeback now that post-furlough working and commuting patterns have been formalised for many, at least in the medium-term,” he said.</p>
<p>Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the market in flats may not purely be driven by those taking early steps on the housing ladder.</p>
