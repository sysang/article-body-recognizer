<a>Heathrow</a> chief executive John Holland-Kaye. The airport has been told by Boris Johnson that the government is aiming to begin trials by mid-October, with the potential for a New York-London route opening by the end of November.
<a>Facilities have been ready to go</a> at Heathrow terminals 2 and 5 for some time, along with temperature scanning equipment. The airport is now waiting for the green light to roll out the pilot, with a decision possible within days, said Holland-Kaye.
<p>Unlike PCR testing – the “gold-standard” test used by the UK government, where samples have to be sent off to a lab – rapid testing technology can provide results within as little as 20 seconds, and an hour at most.</p>
<p>Although the government has yet to make any official announcements on airport testing, transport secretary Grant Shapps has signalled several times that he <a>favours a double-test approach</a>. </p>
<p>Recent <a>research from Skyscanner </a>found that 84% of travellers would be more likely to travel if testing was in place. </p>
<p>We’d flown over the ice field on the approach to Juneau, and my spirits had soared. Ice was what I’d come for. I needed a giant ice cave for the book I was writing, and I’d arranged a guided hike to a glacier the following day.</p>
<p>Viper’s Daughter by Michelle Paver is out now (Zephyr, £7.43 at <a>GuardianBookshop</a>). Her next book, Skin Taker, is out in hardback on 1<sup> </sup>April 2021 (£11.30 at <a>the Guardian Bookshop</a>)</p>
<p>“In the beginning of the pandemic, I was giving out free hot meals to anyone who needed it. When everyone started to see what we were doing, they wanted to chip in,” says Mock.</p>
<a>Send Chinatown Love</a> raised more than $48,000 for the initiative, Broadway retailer Pearl River Mart provided the lanterns, and local artists commissioned by
<a>Instagram account</a>. And while it wasn’t able to save 88 Lan Zhou, it did raise more than $20,000 to donate 1,000 bags of frozen dumplings and offer a lifeline to the owner’s family.
<p><a>Welcome to Chinatown</a>, founded around the same time by Jennifer Tam and Victoria Lee, has raised nearly $650,000, much of which has been given out in the form of donated meals and $5,000 grants to businesses.</p>
<a>a large swath of Chinatown found itself ineligible</a> because it shared a zip code with the affluent neighbourhoods of Tribeca and Soho. Yet,
<a>24% of residents</a> in Chinatown live below the poverty line – double the average for New York – and nearly 47% have used food stamps within the past year.
<a>Chinatown grew tenfold</a> thanks partly to newcomers from Hong Kong and Vietnam. Today, the area sprawls over roughly
<a>50 blocks</a>, spilling into parts of Little Italy, the Lower East Side and Two Bridges.
<a>Chinatown Arts Week</a>. “The grassroots arts in Chinatown is really the soul of our community. We need to continue the cultural practices in order to keep them,” says Yin Kong, co-founder and director of nonprofit Think!Chinatown.
<p>“We want to make the Lunar New Year as festive as we can,” says Mock. “I don’t want us to just focus on the bad. The community needs that light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Hello”, he said, “I was just going out for a stroll around.”</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected to meet anyone. Would we like to come up and see the cabin? He was Jim Henterly, the Desolation Peak fire watchman.</p>
<p>“The motto of my army division was ‘Rendezvous with destiny’,” he said. “The motto of my battalion was Ne desit virtus – Let valor not fail.”</p>
<p>I’m delighted to report that we’re still in touch.</p>
<p>“The edges of any landscape – horizons, the lip of a valley, the bend of a river around a canyon wall – quicken an observer’s expectations. That attraction to borders, to the earth’s twilit places, is a part of the shape of human curiosity.”</p>

<a>Garth’s place</a> 10 years ago while on holiday. I’d been doing Palm Springs fabulous for too long, so I drove 40 miles north to an area they call the High Desert. I asked a local shopkeeper if he knew of a “middle of nowhere experience”.

<a>George van Tassel built the Integratron</a>, a white-domed, acoustically perfect would-be time machine, following instructions he claimed to have received from an alien who visited from Venus in 1953.
<p>He smiled. “I guess I still am in a mental hospital.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what he meant. But Garth said I could stay, so I wandered off, wondering what my malady might be.</p>
<a>Beatrix Potter</a> character in a floral apron.
<p>Pxl produced a black plastic box and told me to keep my food in it so the rats didn’t eat it. When he had gone, I flashed my torch under the base of the board bed. Then I talked to the cave and the creatures.</p>
<p>“Hello everyone,” I said, with a wobbly bravado. “Thanks for letting me stay in your cave. Please make sure there’s not too much action tonight.”</p>

<p>And yet where is the lizard? Where is the cheeseburger dinosaur? Where is the giant’s garden? And so I return. </p>
<p>“So what did she feel like?” Carey Ann, the wildcard hairdresser from Palm Springs asked the next morning at green juice.</p>
<p>“She felt … ” I thought for a bit. “Unknowable.”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “My mother was terrified of spiders. I was always killing them for her.” Then she paused. “Maybe you just have to accept that you’re scared of spiders.”</p>

<p>Workers having to test and isolate leads to Christmas Eve havoc, with Jetstar saying ‘vast majority’ of passengers rebooked</p>
<p>Thousands of Australians have had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases.</p>
<p>At least 117 domestic services scheduled to fly to various cities from Sydney and <a>Melbourne</a> were cancelled on Friday.</p>
<p>A <a>Sydney</a> Airport spokesperson told Guardian Australia that 80 of the 500 domestic services scheduled to arrive and depart Sydney on Friday had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Many flights cancelled on Friday are Jetstar services, with the airline unable to staff all of its planned services because employees were sidelined due to Covid testing and isolation requirements.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the airline had rebooked “the vast majority” of displaced passengers “within a few hours of their original departure time so they can get to their destination in time for Christmas”.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the frustration these schedule changes cause and sincerely apologise for the impact to customers’ travel plans,” she said.</p>
<p>It is understood that most of Qantas’s cancellations had been made to consolidate services due to lower-than-expected demand during the Christmas period, and that the airline is not suffering from staff shortages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the requirement for tourists to show a negative PCR test within 72 hours of entry to states including Queensland and Tasmania is contributing to growing queues at Covid-19 testing clinics and long delays for results across the country.</p>
<p>Demand for fast-turnaround PCR tests offered by private pathology providers for a fee has spiked in recent days, with some tourists unable to wait days for results before travelling.</p>
<p>Histopath, a company that offers PCR test results within 90 minutes for a $79 fee, has been forced to limit customers at its clinics inside Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports to only international tourists travelling that day.</p>
<p>The <a>Biden administration</a> will lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the fast-spreading Covid-19 Omicron variant, the White House said Friday.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Kevin Munoz tweeted that Biden “will lift the temporary travel restrictions on Southern Africa countries” effective 31 December.</p>
<p>He said the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>“The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, esp boosted,” Munoz <a>tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>The restrictions have not prevented flights or Americans from returning from southern Africa.</p>
