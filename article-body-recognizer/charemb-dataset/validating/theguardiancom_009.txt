<p>By any objective measure, Chloë McCardel is also a crazy woman, her commitment to putting herself through demented levels of physical and mental torture almost inexplicable. “I own crazy, I wear it as a badge of pride,” she tells me later.</p>
<p>McCardel has conquered other waters too: in 2014 she set a world record for the world’s longest non-stop ocean swim – 124.4km from Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas to the capital Nassau, a 41-hour, 21-minute journey.</p>

<p>There are several solutions: do what the industry wants and buy new bulbs. Or lift and dry them, to stop them splitting, and store at 18-20C, in a dark, well-ventilated spot. Unless you feed them post-flowering, they still might be small.</p>

<h1>From dragon boat racing to highlining: the year’s best women’s sport photos – in pictures</h1>
<a>Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn</a>. Hostyn has made about $400,000 (£300,000) in prize money during her career since 2011; a far cry from the millions of men above her.
<a>Katherine “Mystik” Gunn</a> has competed in various games. They are ranked #760 and #1,478, respectively.
<a>Kim “Geguri” Se-yeon</a>, did not compete in the most recent season, returning the league to a fully male player base. Many competitors
<a>turn to Twitch</a> to supplement their incomes by livestreaming when they’re not competing, but a recent leak of the company’s financial data revealed that only
<a>three</a> of the top 100 paid creators were women.
<p>Unlike traditional sports, <a>esports</a> is, theoretically, an equal playing field regardless of gender. So why is there such a distinctive pay gap?</p>
<a>our players don’t want female coaches</a>”.
<a>Girl Gamer esports festival</a> has been running since 2017, aiming to give female players experience in competitive games including League of Legends and Valorant. Organiser Fernando Pereira told
<a>the Verge</a> that the event hopes to make itself obsolete once enough women are playing in major tournaments, but that that might be “quite a long time” away.
<a>Esports and its Reinforcement of Gender Divides</a>, published last year, the lawyer, visual artist and gender in sports specialist Kruthika NS questioned whether these were “quick fixes for a larger systemic problem in the esports industry”.
<a>One 2018 study</a> found that responses to the announcement of an all-female team were hostile, in part because fans professed the belief that esports was already meritocratic, despite evidence to the contrary.
<p>Kruthika explains that sexist attacks are simply seen as a normal happening in the community. “If the industry continues to stay silent, it will be an active participant in such normalisation leading to no real action,” she says.</p>
<a>proper prioritisation</a>, could significantly improve their games’ cultures.
<p>Wrapped in an Australian flag as she celebrated her record-breaking swim, McCardel said she had been waiting a long time to celebrate.</p>
<p>“So many people helped along the way to make my dreams come true and hopefully I can inspire the next generation of open water swimmers and young people to go after their dreams.”</p>
<p>McCardel, 36, surpassed the men’s world record of 34 Channel crossings last year, and on Wednesday, passed the current record of 43 crossings held by British swimmer Alison Streeter.</p>
<p>McCardel hopes her feat of endurance, skill and sheer grit will inspire other women. She speaks openly about being a survivor of domestic violence, and credits swimming with helping her begin to recover from PTSD.</p>
<p>“After going through so much trauma, swimming the English Channel helped rebuild my confidence, which was shaken a lot. My sense of identity and my sense of self worth was shaken,” she said. </p>
<p>The rules of the Channel Swimming Association are strict: she cannot wear a wetsuit or anything that could provide protection – even a thermal swimming cap. After hours in the fiercely cold water, her brain starts warning that she is dying of cold.</p>
<p>As the end of her epic challenge grew nearer, she did worry about experiencing a sense of loss – but said she had been very careful “not to wrap my whole self-worth up into one thing”.</p>
<p>With the feat completed she plans to grow her business and spread positivity about endurance and adventure through her keynote speaking. Whatever plaudits now pour in, she knows she will have earned them.</p>
<p>“It’s been a really tough journey,” she said. “But I’ve persisted.”</p>

<div> <time> Published: 21 Nov 2021 </time> </div> It’s time for me to take my young son to the cinema…
<p>Through the rains and steamy heat of November, day and night, Anupama S Chandran sat by the gates of the Kerala state secretariat. She refused to eat, drink or be moved. Her single demand was written on a placard: “Give me my baby.”</p>
<p>The story of Chandran’s fight to get back her child, who was snatched from her by her own family days after he was born and put up for adoption without her knowledge, is one that has been greeted with both horror and a sad familiarity in India.</p>
<p>In a society that remains split by the fault lines of caste, Chandran’s ordeal exposed the cruelties still inflicted upon women who dare to cross those lines.</p>
<h2>‘It completely broke me’</h2>
<p>Kerala is widely considered one of India’s most progressive states. It has the country’s highest literacy rate, exceeding 96% – 92% for women – as well as its highest life expectancy and lowest child mortality rates.</p>
<p>For over seven months she hid her pregnancy from her family. But when she broke the news, they were horrified. “I was extremely saddened when my sister told me to abort my baby, saying it was just a ‘lump of flesh’,” she said.</p>
<p>Standing at the roadside, her caesarean wound still sore, Chandran held on tightly to her son, refusing to let him go. But she alleges that her parents slapped her and wrenched the boy from her arms.</p>
<p>Chandran and Kumar allege that her father’s political connections meant no one would touch the case. One state minister told the media that Chandran’s parents “had done what any parents would do”.</p>
<h2>‘Every day is like a celebration’</h2>
<p>She added: “I am trying to forget those painful days. I am trying to forget the worst year of my life.”</p>
<p>Festive anxiety hits me hard: not just because of the work involved, but because a recent survey from eco-retailer Flora and Fauna suggested that despite an average spend of $1bn on new toys at Christmas, Australians still bin 26.8m toys every year.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, says paediatric psychologist Deirdre Brandner, who believes that toy manufacturers can play into the vulnerability of parents who “overanalyse every decision” in the pursuit of giving children the best opportunities they can.</p>
<p>“Play is about a process and open-ended play will allow the child to have autonomy over the outcome,” she says. “Children need play to be fun or else it isn’t play, it’s work.”</p>
<p>Kennedy-Costantini says that it’s important to remember that humans have evolved over thousands of years through playful behaviour, and encouraging a child’s own play helps them make sense of their world.</p>
<p>“Play is not frivolous,” she explains. “In play, children are testing and refining theories, making connections, understanding relationships and figuring out how the world works.”</p>
<p>Jayne Pavic, who founded toy store Monti and Me to help adults see the purpose in play after becoming a mother herself, agrees, arguing that “it’s impossible to play without learning”.</p>
<p>“I think we need to redefine for adults what learning and play looks like,” she says. “If adults reframe everyday moments as brain building experiences – which they are – the emphasis on specific outcomes of toys becomes less relevant.”</p>
<p>Despite selling toys, she insists “children can play longer and more happily with less toys”.</p>
<p>Brandner says that investing in your child’s play through your time and attention can be a profound way of understanding how beneficial play can be, just for play’s sake.</p>
<p>“A child’s life is going to be filled with many educational and learning opportunities,” she says. “Let’s not derail their enjoyment of play by putting constraints around it.”</p>

<p>Analysis carried out by Which? for the news agency PA found that 4,735 branches have been shut or earmarked for closure over the past six years. The figure is equal to 48% of the network as it stood in January 2015.</p>
<p>Many of the big banks have been cutting their branch networks in recent years, claiming customers are spurning traditional counter service in favour of banking online and via mobile phones.</p>
<p>In October, Lloyds <a>Banking</a> Group said it would close 41 Lloyds Bank and seven Halifax branches across England and Wales between January and April 2022. That came on top of 100 closures earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Several weeks <a>later TSB announced it was closing 70 branches</a> – a quarter of its network, meaning it had more than halved the number of outlets it had over less than two years.</p>
<p>Jenny Ross, Which? Money editor, said: “Wave after wave of bank branch closures in recent years have left many people who depend on them for essential banking services – particularly the elderly and vulnerable – at risk of being cut adrift.</p>
<p>“Recent proposals put forward to help secure the future of cash are very promising, but we will be watching closely to see if they are preventing further communities from losing cash access and vital banking services.”</p>
<p>The government has said it will legislate to protect the future of cash, and has introduced <a>cashback without a purchase in shops</a> to enable people to access their money without a bank branch or ATM.</p>
<p>In December <a>several major banks announced an initiative to share services</a>, and there are plans to extend a pilot scheme in which Post Offices hosted bank staff and offered counter services to individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>Natalie Ceeney, chair of Cash Action Group, said there were still millions of people for whom the decision to close a bank branch was really disruptive.</p>
<p>“That’s not only vulnerable people who may be on low incomes or have a disability, but small businesses, whose customers pay in cash and can no longer deposit their takings at the branch that was once across the high street,” she said.</p>
<p>Britain’s housing market is to slow dramatically in 2022 as borrowing costs rise and household budgets come under mounting strain, property experts have predicted.</p>
<p>After a year of booming prices driven by stamp duty holidays across the UK and changes in the types of properties being bought and sold, forecasters typically suggest house price growth of between 3 and 5% next year.</p>
<p>The most recent figures from <a>Nationwide building society showed annual price growth running at 10%</a>.</p>
<p>The property firm Savills said it expected growth of 6% in prime London neighbourhoods in 2022, up from 3.2% in 2021, but that renewed uncertainty over Covid could push that growth into later in the year.</p>
<p>Savills said prices had started to rise again for flats in prime areas, as people began to return to the city or looked for a pied-à-terre to use while there.</p>
<p>“Still, we believe it’s a question of when and not if prices rebound, particularly as more pent up demand builds, so prime central London remains a market to watch closely. Its bounce can be surprisingly rapid.”</p>
<p>The London market had fallen as wealthy buyers left the capital during months of home working, and overseas travel restrictions dampened the interest of buyers from other countries.</p>
<a>“race for space” during the pandemic</a> along with government initiatives such as stamp duty holidays, the last of which ended in September in September, and cheap mortgage deals thanks to record low interest rates.
<p>The Bank of England <a>unexpectedly lifted interest rates</a> for the first time in three years in December in response to growing concerns over inflation, which reached a decade high of 5.1% in November.</p>
<p>Borrowing costs, however, are still lower than before the pandemic, and analysts believe any future rate increases will be limited because it appears far from over.</p>
<p>Savills has forecast house price growth across the UK market of 3.5% next year as the economy rebounds from the pandemic and a shortage of homes for sale continues to underpin prices.</p>

<p>The most widespread symptoms of the <a>Omicron variant</a> now match those of common colds, with calls for the government to update its public health messaging to include a wider number of likely Covid symptoms.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms reported among users of the <a>Zoe Covid app</a> have been a running nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats, according to the study’s most recent analysis of confirmed cases in London.</p>
<a>meeting held on Thursday</a>. The committee said there was “preliminary evidence” of changes in symptoms accompanying Omicron infections, as loss of taste or smell “seem to be reported less frequently”.
<p>Prof Tim Spector, lead scientist on the Zoe Covid study, said public messaging needed to acknowledge that Covid symptoms would appear more like a common cold to many of those infected.</p>
<p>Spector said he was shocked by what he called “misinformation” in the government’s latest stay-at-home guidance about the symptoms of Covid.</p>
<p>“Zoe data clearly shows that the most important symptoms are no longer a new continuous cough, a high temperature or loss of taste or smell.</p>
<p>“We need to change public messaging urgently to save lives as half of people with cold-like symptoms now have Covid.”</p>
<p>Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London speaking in a personal capacity, said there was evidence that the virus was changing the way it behaved, in terms of cells that it infected, leading to changing symptoms.</p>
<p>Recent data, including a <a>study from Hong Kong</a>, found that Omicron was less able to infect deep lung tissue but more able to infect higher bronchial tissue.</p>
<p>“It appears to be shifting towards a virus that infects higher up in the respiratory tract and is therefore adapting to be more transmissible partly because it is changing the cell types it infects,” Openshaw said.</p>
<p>“That would go along with it producing more common-cold-like symptoms. Those laboratory studies support what the Zoe app is telling us.”</p>
<p>Openshaw said it would be “sensible” to update the list of Covid symptoms: “The semi-lockdown has been terrible for colds, they are struggling to survive. So if you have a cold at the moment, there’s about a 50% chance that it is actually Covid.”</p>
<p>Staff absences from the Omicron Covid variant are leaving public services in a “perilous state”,a union leader has said, amid new grim warnings about the variant’s impact on the <a>NHS</a> workforce.</p>
<p>As much as 40% of NHS staff in <a>London</a> alone could be absent because of rising Covid-19 infections under the “worst-case scenario” envisaged by experts, it emerged on Monday.</p>
<p>London’s absence rate was up by about 30%, depending on the organisation, which included people who were isolating because of positive tests, she told BBC Radio 4’s World at One.</p>
<p>Dr Ian Higginson, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the programme that the number of staff absences in NHS emergency departments could “push us over the edge”.</p>
<p>Severe staff shortages could also undermine efforts to keep pupils in schools, with headteachers in England saying that they <a>may be forced to send children home</a> if they do no have enough staff.</p>
<p>Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that staff absences had been at “unsustainable” levels at some schools, with up to 25% of staff off in the week leading up to the Christmas break.</p>
<p>Staff shortages are also being felt across the board in other sectors such as transport, where rail operators have been running reduced services and implementing measures such as running longer trains.</p>
<a>annual average of 2.9%</a>. More recent data has yet to be made available.
<p>The National Police Chiefs’ Council said that it had continued to closely monitor absence rates within policing, which was not currently having an effect on forces’ ability to provide their normal service to the public.</p>

<p>Usually a mortgage is repayable over 25 years, although you can organise a longer or shorter-term deal, or even vary the length of the repayment schedule as you progress. You also numerous choices in paying your loan back.</p>
<h2>Mortgage type and interest rate</h2>
<p>Most lenders offer a range of different mortgages with varying interest rates. Some of these will be based on the lender's standard variable rate (SVR) - a rate above the Bank of England base rate, which the lender can change at any time. </p>
<p>Rather than choosing an SVR mortgage, you will probably go for one of the following:</p>
<p>A small handful of mortgages will track a different index to the base rate, often the Libor (London InterBank Offered Rate). It can be difficult to keep track of the rates on these loans, so they tend to be less popular with borrowers.</p>
<p>Many short-term mortgage deals revert to the SVR after the initial offer period, which usually means increased repayments.</p>
<h2>Interest-only or repayment</h2>
<p>You can also have a mortgage split into part interest-only and part repayment, for example, if you have taken a top-up loan or want to keep the monthly repayments down on part of the debt.</p>
<p>Although there is no set definition for the term, a flexible mortgage is widely accepted to do the following:</p>
<p>· Allow you to overpay by any amount without penalty, including redeeming the loan</p>
<p>· Allow you to take payment holidays or underpay providing you have overpaid enough in advance</p>
<p>· Allow you to borrow back on the mortgage (or drawdown) without charging</p>
<p>However, not all flexible mortgages offer all of these features, and some are available on "regular" mortgages. You will need to read the small print to discover just how flexible a mortgage is.</p>
<p>Current account mortgages are a similar proposition, although they combine your day-to-day banking with your borrowing. </p>
<p>Offset and current account mortgages often have higher interest rates than other loans, and you need to make sure you have enough savings to make the deal worthwhile.</p>

<p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu has resigned as an ambassador for Oxfam, saying he is “deeply disappointed” about the <a>charity’s sex scandal</a>.</p>
<p>The South African, who was regarded as a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement, has retired as a church leader but still continues to work with the <a>Elders</a> – a group of senior international figures. </p>
<p>Tutu said in a statement that he had decided to resign following allegations of “immorality and possible criminality” at <a>Oxfam</a>.</p>
<p>Tutu’s resignation came amid fresh turmoil at the charity, which admitted on Thursday that it had rehired one of the workers it had sacked in a sexual misconduct scandal in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tutu’s office said: “Archbishop emeritus <a>Desmond Tutu</a> has supported Oxfam International’s good work for many years, most recently as one of its global ambassadors.</p>
<p>“The archbishop is deeply disappointed by allegations of immorality and possible criminality involving humanitarian workers linked to the charity.</p>
<p>“He is also saddened by the impact of the allegations on the many thousands of good people who have supported Oxfam’s righteous work.”</p>
<p>Roland van Hauwermeiren <a>said in the letter</a> he did not want to cast himself as a victim but feared that Oxfam, other aid workers and those they help would suffer from false accusations. </p>
<p>In the four-page letter, seen by Reuters, he accused an unnamed former employee of being the source of reports that have shaken the global humanitarian community and prompted Britain and the EU to <a>review funding</a> for Oxfam. </p>
<p>“I am not a saint. I am a man of flesh and blood and I have made mistakes (not easy to admit) and I am DEEPLY ASHAMED,” the 68-year-old former soldier wrote in Dutch to broadcaster VTM.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of chaos swirling around Oxfam also deepened as the organisation admitted a “serious error” in rehiring one of those accused of sexual misconduct as a consultant in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The man was one of several staff who were sacked or resigned in 2011 over a string of lurid claims, including that they had used prostitutes while delivering aid to Haiti.</p>
<p>The agency said in a statement it had identified that “one of those dismissed by Oxfam as a result of the sexual misconduct case in Haiti” was “subsequently hired by Oxfam as a consultant in Ethiopia”.</p>
<p>Hiring the man “even in an emergency as a short-term consultant” was a “serious error and should never have happened”, it continued.</p>
<p>The charity is now checking whether there were “any issues” while the man was posted in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Desmond Tutu, the cleric and social activist who was a giant of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, has died aged 90</p>

<blockquote> <div> <p>Don’t raise your voice. Improve your argument.</p> </div> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <div> <p>We need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in.</p> </div> </blockquote>

<p>At least 150 houses have been destroyed by a raging fire that surrounded a monastery and a dozen villages on the Greek island of Evia, one of over 100 blazes burning in the country.</p>
<p>Firefighters were also continuing to battle a blaze near Athens on Thursday morning, while the mayor of Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, pleaded for help as flames threatened the site.</p>
<p>The blazes erupted as <a>Greece</a> is in the grip of a heatwave.</p>
<p>“We’re waging a battle of the titans!” deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias told journalists. “The hardest is still to come.”</p>
<p>Experts have warned that global heating is increasing both the frequency and intensity of such fires.</p>
<p>On Evia, the huge flames leaping up from the forest could be seen from the sea. Firefighters said it was a difficult blaze to control on an island of rolling hills with little visibility.</p>
<p>Three monks from Saint David Monastery had refused to leave, they added, but everyone had been evacuated from nearby villages.</p>
<p>“We’re suffocating due to the smoke,” one of the monks told the ANA news agency by phone, describing flames 30 to 40 metres (100 to 130 feet) high surrounding the monastery.</p>
<p>Police told AFP they would force the monks to evacuate if their lives were in danger. Around 85 people gathered on a beach were evacuated on five boats.</p>
<p>Some 100 firefighters backed by seven helicopters and water-bombing planes were fighting the blaze, civil protection officers said.</p>
<p>But local politicians denounced the lack of resources.</p>
<p>“We are asking the authorities to reinforce the air and land forces to so as not to risk human lives,” Giorgos Tsapourniotis, the mayor of Limni, told ANA news agency.</p>
<p>Argyris Liaskos, deputy mayor of Mantoudiou, told Skai TV that no air support had been deployed there to tackle the fires. “At least 150 houses have burned,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Hardalias, Greece has faced a total of 118 fires in the last 24 hours as temperatures soared above 40C (104F).</p>
<p>Evia island is some 200km (125 miles) away from Athens, where more than 500 firefighters, a dozen water-bombing planes and five helicopters battled another wildfire on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>The blaze started on Tuesday in a pine forest at the foot of Mount Parnitha, one of three ranges that surround the Greek capital, s<a>ending plumes of dark, acrid smoke over Athens </a>and leaving carcasses of burnt-out houses in its wake.</p>
<p>Around a dozen houses have been destroyed in the flames, and dozens of businesses, bars and holiday accommodation severely damaged in the suburb of Varybombi, 30km (20 miles) north-west of Athens, officials said.</p>
<p>But by Wednesday afternoon, the blaze was coming under control, Hardalias said.</p>
<p>Authorities in Athens have recommended residents stay indoors and wear a mask to protect against the ash and smoke.</p>
<p>Dozens of people had contacted the emergency services complaining of breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>In Olympia, around 100 firefighters were battling the blaze, aided by three helicopters and two planes.</p>
<p>“Everything that can be done to protect from the flames the museum and the archaeological site, where the Olympic games started, has been done,” said culture minister Lina Mendoni on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Earlier, the mayor of Olympia, Giorgos Georgopoulos, had called for more aerial support.</p>
<p>The European Union’s crisis management commissioner said it would help, and Cyprus and Sweden were both sending two water-bombing planes to help battle the fires.</p>
<a> Abdul Rahman al-Logari carried out “the martyrdom operation near Kabul Airport”.</a> The name suggests the killer of at least 12 US servicemen and more than 60 civilians was Afghan.
<p>Many have been worried by an intensification of attacks linked to ISKP in recent months.</p>
<a>Charlie Winter</a>, a senior research fellow at London University’s International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR).
<p>ISKP is likely to see an attack against the airport as a “great victory”, said Tore Hamming, an expert on IS also at the ICSR.</p>
<p>“They achieve several things: they hit legitimate targets (from their perspective), they send a signal of still being a force to be reckoned with and they challenge the Taliban’s state project by highlighting that the group can’t secure Kabul.”</p>
<p>ISKP was founded just under six years ago after representatives of IS made their way to south-western Pakistan to meet disaffected Taliban commanders and other extremists who felt marginalised within the jihadist movement in the region.</p>
<p>The main IS parent organisation was then approaching its zenith – seizing swaths of Syria and Iraq after a lightning campaign and establishing affiliates all over the Islamic world.</p>
<a>the Taliban opposed the expansion of </a>ISKP. So too did al-Qaida, the Afghan government’s forces and the US. A series of offensives resulted in heavy casualties and the death of a series of leaders.
<p>Others, however, say the group remains seriously degraded and that the number of attacks is not necessarily the best metric to judge its strength.</p>
<p>Antonio Giustozzi, an expert and author at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said ISKP was proving more pragmatic than some expected, despite its extreme ideology.</p>
<p>“The group is navigating regional politics. Between Afghanistan and Pakistan there are a lot of actors jockeying for leverage and ISKP has been quite effective at positioning itself.”</p>
<p>There is circumstantial evidence that ISKP has some kind of relationship with military intelligence services in Pakistan, Giustozzi said.</p>
<p>One ISKP strategy has been “positioning itself as the sole pure rejectionist group in Afghanistan, to recruit disaffected Taliban and other militants to swell its ranks”.</p>
<p>“The options for expansion available to IS around the world are limited now so Afghanistan looks more attractive and there’s been renewed interest,” Giustozzi said.</p>
<p><a>The Taliban may try to prevent such operations</a> but will be unable to watch every corner of the sprawling, rugged country.</p>
<h1>The fall of Kabul – in pictures</h1>
<p>The United Nations secretary general urged Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers to observe the ceasefire and called on global leaders to develop a reconstruction package “that supports the Palestinian people and strengthens their institutions”.</p>
<a>said</a> after Thursday’s announcement of an end to 11 days of clashes: “Israeli and Palestinian leaders have a responsibility beyond the restoration of calm to start a serious dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict.”
<a>Palestinian territories</a> and its blockade on the already-devastated Gaza enclave, within which 2 million people live under hardline Hamas rule.
<p>However, Guterres said the UN was ready to work with Israel, the Palestinians, and others to return to “meaningful negotiations” on a two-state settlement based on territorial lines before the 1967 war.</p>
<p>In a televised address from the White House, the US president, Joe Biden, vowed to continue what he called “our quiet and relentless diplomacy” towards a long-term settlement, adding: “I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress.”</p>
<p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, planned to visit the region in the coming days “to discuss recovery efforts and working together to build better futures for Israelis and Palestinians”, the state department said.</p>
<p>In the short term, the international effort will be focused on ensuring the truce holds, and beginning the task of humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Gaza.</p>
<p>Cars packed Gaza’s main streets, with drivers honking their horns and waving flags from the windows. Mosque loudspeakers hailed a “victory”, and men fired rifles into the air, while others set off noise bombs or firecrackers.</p>
<p>In Tel al-Hawa in Gaza City people said they were celebrating their safety, and what they viewed as their victory. </p>
<p>The truce took hold after the Israeli cabinet met to discuss the “mutual and unconditional” ceasefire proposed by Egypt. </p>
<p>Hamas and Islamic Jihad also confirmed the “mutual and simultaneous” agreement.</p>
<p>The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “All sides must work to make the ceasefire durable and end the unacceptable cycle of violence and loss of civilian life.”He added that Britain supported “efforts to bring about peace”.</p>
<p>If it holds, the agreement will put an end to the heaviest fighting since 2014, in which Israeli airstrikes have inflicted widespread destruction in Gaza, while militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel.</p>
<p>When it was over, both sides claimed victory. One Hamas official, Ali Barakeh, told the AP news agency that the truce was a defeat for Netanyahu and “a victory to the Palestinian people”. Israel’s military similarly claimed “great accomplishments”.</p>
<p>In recent days, Israeli media had suggested the military believed its goals had largely been met and Hamas officials said a ceasefire was in reach.</p>
<p>Ndakasi, a mountain gorilla that famously <a>posed in the background of a selfie</a> taken by rangers at Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has died at 14 after a long illness, the park said.</p>
<p>“It is with heartfelt sadness that Virunga announces the death of beloved orphaned mountain gorilla, Ndakasi, who had been under the care of the park’s Senkwekwe Center for more than a decade,” a statement from the park said.</p>
<p>“Ndakasi took her final breath in the loving arms of her caretaker and lifelong friend, Andre Bauma,” said the statement, adding that she died on 26 September after a prolonged illness in which her condition rapidly deteriorated.</p>
