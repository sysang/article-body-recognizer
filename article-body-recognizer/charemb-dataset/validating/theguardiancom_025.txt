<h2>Potted duck with baharat butter</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 2 hr 40minChill 1 hr+Serves 6</p>
<p>Lift out the duck legs and transfer them to a large bowl. Put a sieve over a small bowl and pour through the roasting juices. Pick out the shallots and set these aside, then discard all the other solids.</p>
<p>About half an hour before you want to serve, take the ramekins out of the fridge, so the butter softens and is spreadable. Serve with toasted bread or crackers and cornichons.</p>

<h2>Crisp smashed new potatoes with spiced salt and spring onion creme fraiche</h2>
<p>The potatoes can be boiled ahead of time and the spiced salt can be made the day before, but when it comes to serving and eating these, as fresh out of the pan as possible is best.</p>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 40 minServes 6</p>
<p>750g baby new potatoes 2 tbsp table salt 1 litre sunflower oil 5 spring onions, thinly sliced (40g) 150g creme fraiche 1 tsp lemon juice</p>
<p>For the spiced salt2 tsp coriander seeds, toasted 1 tsp kelp or nori flakes 1½ tsp aleppo chilli1½ tsp paprika 1 tsp flaked sea salt</p>
<p>In a medium pan, bring a litre and a half of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and table salt, and boil for 20 minutes, until a knife goes through the potatoes easily. Drain, then set aside until the potatoes are cool enough to handle.</p>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, make the spiced salt. Roughly grind the coriander seeds in a mortar, then add the kelp flakes, aleppo chilli, paprika and flaked sea salt, and grind two or three more times, until everything’s well mixed.</p>
<p>Put the spring onions in a small bowl with the creme fraiche, a teaspoon of lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, mix to combine, then set aside.</p>
<p>Once the potatoes are cool enough, press them between your hands (or on a flat work surface) until the skin breaks and the white flesh pokes out. Be as brutal as you like: all those rough edges crisp up very nicely when fried.</p>
<p>Put the potatoes on a platter and serve hot with the spring onion creme fraiche for dipping.</p>

<p>During the Han dynasty, more than 2,000 years ago, there was a great division: what had been a singular fermented condiment made of fish and soy, used to stretch out that precious commodity salt, became two.</p>
<p>In the east, soy sauce became another thing entirely. The production of soy-based products are unique to each geographical location – like miso in Japan and doenjang in Korea. </p>
<p>Whether you call it shōyu or sii ew or just old faithful soy sauce, we are referring to a condiment that’s soybean-based. And that is where the similarity ends.</p>
<p>All right, let’s break it down a bit.</p>
<li><p>Koikuchi: the dark brew most generally used in everyday cooking.</p></li>
<li><p>Tamari: literally the crema of miso production, it is the liquid byproduct of miso making and perhaps the closest in method and flavour to the original soy sauce of China, predominantly wheat-free, used for dipping and cooking.</p></li>
<li><p>Blended soy/dark sweet soy/thick soy: can have inclusions of molasses, starches, colour, MSG, mushrooms and even dry spices; used for longer cooking methods and also as a component to dipping sauces. </p></li>
<h2>South-east Asian soy sauces</h2>
<p>As a side note, while seasoning sauce like Maggi enjoys worldwide popularity, it is not considered a soy sauce as it does not actually contain soybeans. Instead, it is a product of hydrolysed vegetable protein and additives.</p>
<h2>When shopping for soy sauces my tips are:</h2>
<li><p>Read the ingredients label: preservatives, N-numbers, MSG, colouring and GMO-inclusions are a no-go for me, but that is completely up to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick smaller sizes: soy sauce oxidises from the moment you open it, so unless you go through loads, buy smaller or keep it in the fridge upon opening.</p></li>
<p>Here are some of my tried and true soy sauces. They will see you through most of Asia’s expansive cuisines.</p>
<p>The thing with soy sauce is, it aides and abets the dishes it is used in to draw out and enhance complex flavours.</p>
<p>What should I have in my store cupboard and freezer now to make cooking easier?Katie, Leeds</p>
<p>Now is the time to get those soups, stews and dals going, so making space (in moderation. No stockpiling, please) for lentils, coconut milk, warming spices (turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, cumin) and tinned tomatoes is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Serves 4Special equipment: food processor</p>
<sub>2</sub> cup) fresh ricotta 1 egg1 garlic clove500g tomato passataPreheat the oven to 180C.
<p>In the meantime, finely chop the garlic and reserved roasted onion, place in a large sauté pan over medium heat and add the remaining oil. Add the passata and 180ml (¾ cup) of water and season to taste.</p>
<p>Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes until thick and rich. Add the fennel polpette and turn to coat. Scatter over the reserved fennel fronds and a good sprinkling of extra parmesan.</p>
<p>Serve with toasted sourdough or pasta.</p>
<p>Serves 8Special equipment: food processor</p>
<p>For the sauce125g (½ cup) tomato sauce3 tbsp apple cider vinegar2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce or vegetarian alternative1 tsp Chinese five spice 1 garlic clove, finely grated tomato relish, to serve</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C.</p>
<p>Combine all the barbecue sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to the boil for one minute. Stand until required.</p>
<p>Place the onion, carrot and celery in a food processor and whiz until finely chopped. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat, add the vegetable mixture and sauté for five minutes, or until softened.</p>
<p>Add the bread and walnuts to the uncleaned food processor and process until crumbs form. Add to the vegetable mixture along with the dried oregano and smoked paprika. Sauté for a further two minutes, or until aromatic. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p>Thickly slice the lentil and bean loaf and serve with the parsley scattered over the top and some rocket leaves and tomato relish on the side.</p>
<h2>Slow-baked sweet potato with smoked tofu cream</h2>
<p>I used to avoid tofu whenever possible but, after developing fun ways to use it with flavours like chipotle in adobo sauce and lime, I have a new-found love for it.</p>
<p>It’s a wonderful carrier of flavour and a great vegan alternative to dairy when you’re still wanting that creamy effect. Pair with slow-baked whole sweet potato and it’s a winner.</p>
<p>Serves 4 Special equipment: blender</p>
<p>4 small-medium sweet potatoes (350-400g each), washed and patted dry2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzlingsalt flakes freshly ground black pepper80g (1 cup) corn chipslime wedges, to servesmoked paprika, to serve</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 150C. Line a baking tray with foil, then baking paper. Arrange the sweet potatoes on the prepared tray, rub all over with the olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Bake the sweet potatoes for two hours or so, turning halfway through, until soft when the thickest part is pierced with the tip of a knife. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of your sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>For Iberian flavour year round, fill the freezer with summer salsa and stock your pantry with good olive oil, sherry vinegar and lots of garlic, so one of Spain’s classic base sauces will always be mere moments away</p>

<ul><li>In the first of her new fortnightly cooking column, Pantry Remix, chef Rosheen Kaul explores Australia’s favourite sauce</li></ul>
<p>The term “pantry staple” is so boring. How are you expected to find inspiration from a dusty cupboard of jars, spices and unidentifiable flours?</p>
<p>That being said, let’s start with something most of us will probably have sitting in the fridge or pantry: ketchup.</p>
<p>Ketchup is underrated. We call it tomato sauce in Australia. Or just “sauce”. I like it, it’s straight and to the point. Like there are no other sauces.</p>
<p>FountainAnother good all-rounder. Fountain tomato sauce has quite a lovely, rich tomato flavour with some warm cinnamon-esque spicing. Beautiful balanced sweetness and acidity.</p>
<p>WoolworthsThe Woolies tomato sauce is smooth but rather acidic and lacks much needed sweetness for balance. It is somewhat lacking in the flavour and body department too.</p>
<h2>Spaghetti naporitan (Japanese ketchup pasta)</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 20 minServes 2</p>
<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta as per the packet instructions. Drain the pasta and reserve half a cup of starchy cooking water.</p>
<p>Stir the ketchup, Worcestershire, Tabasco and soy sauces together in a small bowl.</p>
<p>Pour the prepared sauce into the pan and fry over high heat for 30 seconds. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat. If the pasta is a little too dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water. Fry over medium-high heat for two to three minutes.</p>
<p>Divide the pasta between two warm plates and top with grated parmesan and parsley. A bit more Tabasco too, if desired.</p>
<h2>Nasi pattaya (omelette fried rice)</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 20 minServes 4</p>
<p>For the omelette5 eggs½ tsp soy sauce¼ tsp white pepperVegetable oil for fryingKetchup</p>
<p>Turn the heat down to low and add the ketchup, soy sauce, salt and a pinch of white pepper. Stir-fry over medium-high heat, then check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. Set the rice aside while you make the omelette.</p>
<p>Drizzle more ketchup over the top to finish, and repeat for the remaining three servings.</p>

<p>“I just thought a few friends would read it,” the author, Andy Corren, told me.</p>
<p>He was “deeply touched” by readers’ response to the obituary, and speculated that it may have to do with the pandemic. With Covid killing so many people, “Maybe we all needed a laugh, and a way to talk about death in a funny way.”</p>
<p>He’s currently working on a writing project about a “tumultuous” period of early-career misbehavior in LA – “a redneck <a>Less Than Zero</a>.” I asked what it’s about. “Are you sitting down?” he said. “Shocker! It’s about me and my family.”</p>

<h2>‘I’m finding separation from my wife quite difficult’</h2>
<h2>‘In blended families like our own, it’s more complex’</h2>
<p>“In blended families like our own, it is more complex. If anyone tests positive, none of our plans work any more. We would have to figure out what to do, but it would probably mean the boys missing seeing one of their parents on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>“If we all make it to new year without testing positive, we will go and visit my parents who are in their 80s and were previously shielding. If all fails, family celebrations will have to be on Zoom, assuming we are all well enough for that.”</p>

<p>Consequently, my hopes for Shrine temporary hair colourant were low, but when my own hairdresser asked what I thought of them, I felt it my job to have an answer, and bought several bottles.</p>
<p>With the exception of a new must-have brand of oat milk and an aesthetically pleasing tin of chopped tomatoes, the supermarket experience is not an especially chic one – unless Anya Hindmarch is along for the ride.</p>
<p>Intended to put paid to the idea of the shopping bag as an unloved item that is mislaid, disposed of, or left in the boot of the car, Hindmarch’s new bag is a luxury item with a supermarket price tag of £10.</p>
<p>Billed as “the next generation reusable shopping bag”, it is a response to government data showing nearly half a billion single-use plastic bags were sold from 2020-2021 – five years after the government levy on carrier bags was introduced.</p>
<p>The bag is made from recycled plastic and is fully recyclable, with minimum effort required – a built-in pocket acts as a pre-addressed envelope, allowing the bag to be placed in any letterbox when the user is ready to part with it.</p>
<p>It is designed to withstand 10 years of hard labour. “You can get your week’s shopping in it and schlep and lug but you can also put it down in a puddle while you wait for a bus,” says the designer.</p>
<p>Zoe Avison, of the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, welcomes the arrival of a bag likely to appeal to consumers. “If it encourages shoppers to ditch their throwaway habits it will have a positive impact,” she says. </p>
<ul><li><a>Plastic bags</a></li></ul>
<p>Leading industry figures say that if fashion brands are to have any chance of having a meaningful impact on the climate crisis, legislation is needed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, says Simpliciano, “we need to see willingness from our legislators to take bold and unpopular action now”.</p>

<h2>Make sure your gift looks the part</h2>
<a>The Antik Store</a>. “They have already gone through the trouble of sourcing of-the-moment and interesting pieces.” If you’re buying luxury clothes secondhand, sites such as
<a>Vestiaire Collective</a> have a rigorous authenticity process, which will dramatically reduce the chances of you passing on a fake.

<p>While the <a>Easy On Me</a> singer has marked the return of the cyclical trend, party tights – unofficially classed as anything other than your typical 40 denier – have already had the recent endorsement of some heavyweight fashion influencers.</p>
<a>Cardi B</a> threw a celebrity-packed birthday party for herself, to which she wore a wide-cutout design. On the catwalks, the Fendace collaboration, featuring
<a>Kate Moss</a>, saw tights with the brands’ amalgamated logo walk the runway and in London last week,
<a>1960s style icon Mary Quant</a> who is arguably the most famous pin-up for party tights, is set to further inspire a 2021 revival.

<p>The government is being urged by a cross-party group of MPs to take urgent steps to fix throwaway ‘‘<a>fast fashion</a>’’ by supporting the development of fabrics with a lower environmental impact and boosting clothing recycling facilities.</p>
<p>After Covid-19 exposed its “faultlines”, the industry needs to follow a more sustainable route to survive, recommends the report from the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for <a>ethics and sustainability in fashion</a>.</p>
<a>Research</a> carried out by the environmental charity
<a>Hubbub</a> and released on Tuesday with the report reveals that 65% of UK residents agree that the government should urgently do more to reduce
<a>the negative impact</a> of the fashion industry on the environment.
<a>destroy unwanted clothing</a> than give it away, and investment in skills to bring more clothes manufacturing jobs back to the UK.
<p>Even before the virus struck, the environmental and social impact of the industry was under public scrutiny, with fast fashion resulting in <a>£140m</a> worth of clothing being sent to landfill every year in the UK.</p>
<p>Despite high charity shop donation rates, 300,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in household bins every year – 20% of which goes to landfill and 80% is incinerated – according to <a>a recent report</a> from the environmental audit committee.</p>
<a>a Guardian investigation </a>– thriving.
<p>High street casualties, meanwhile, include Aldo, <a>Cath Kidston</a>, Debenhams, Laura Ashley, Monsoon Accessorize, Oasis, Quiz and the UK arm of Victoria’s Secret, all of which have fallen into administration.</p>
<p>The market research company Global Data said in March the UK clothing sector would be the worst hit with a slump in spending by a fifth (20.6%). Sales of clothing and footwear in the UK alone are expected to decline by £11.1bn.</p>
<a>Mulberry</a>, which ran up 8,000 hospital gowns for NHS hospital staff in Bristol, and Mackintosh, which gave up its Lancashire factory to produce nurses’ uniforms.

<p>Supermarkets are still putting nearly 900,000 tonnes of plastic packaging on to the market, representing a plastic footprint which is bigger than in 2017, a new report has found.</p>
<a>Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency</a>, which called for the government to require companies to publish independently verified audits of their plastic footprint, alongside their financial reports each year.
<p>In 2019 the 10 biggest UK supermarkets put 896,853 tonnes of plastic packaging on the market. The weight of plastic waste was down on 2018, but up 1.2% from 2017.</p>
<p>The amount of plastic cutlery sold or given away has also risen sharply, from 143m items in 2017 to 195.5m in 2019.</p>
<p>“Instead, we are looking at a relatively static picture which represents a drop in the ocean of tackling plastic pollution. The sector urgently needs to pick up the pace of plastic reduction.”</p>
<p>Waitrose was ranked as the leader in plastic reduction by the study, reporting an absolute plastic reduction of 6.1% since 2017, with the lowest plastic use per unit market share of all 10 retailers.</p>
<p>Iceland was bottom. Although the supermarket has reduced the plastic in its own-brand products by 29% since 2017, increases in plastic from branded goods offset its progress.</p>
<p>Iceland also sold 73m more “bags for life” in 2019 than in 2018.</p>
<p>Morrison’s position fell from second place to ninth, primarily because of an increase in sales of plastic bags since 2018.</p>
<p>The report praised the positive news that many supermarkets had stopped selling single-use plastic bags completely and that overall sales of single-use carrier bags had fallen by 56% between 2017 and 2019.</p>
<p>But not enough was being done to cut plastic packaging. “A higher and more consistent trajectory across the board would be expected if plastic reduction efforts were sufficient and having the necessary impact,” the report said.</p>
<p>While supermarkets have become more open about their plastic footprint, more transparency was needed, said the report.</p>
<p>All the supermarkets were approached for comment. The following responded.</p>
<p>A Tesco spokesperson said: “We recently announced we successfully removed 1bn pieces of plastic and got rid of hard-to-recycle materials. Through these actions, Tesco is driving change.</p>
<p>“However, we know there is more to be done and have an ambitious goal to remove 3bn pieces of plastic packaging from our operations by 2025.”</p>
<p>“We call today, yet again, for national reduction targets to be set by our government and for mandatory plastic footprint transparency throughout all supermarkets and industry.”</p>
<p>Few bags show your fashion sense and green credentials, carry a designer label and cost just £5, so it is little wonder that customers are expected to queue round the block tomorrow to get their hands on such an item.</p>
<p>Some 8,000 cloth bags bearing the logo "I'm not a plastic bag" will go on sale at five London stores - and they are expected to sell out within hours.</p>
<p>The accessories designer Anya Hindmarch created the cloth bags for the organisation <a>We Are What We Do</a> to support its campaign against carrier bags.</p>
<p>A book put out by the organisation, Change the World for a Fiver, begins with a call for people to decline plastic bags when shopping. Britons use an average of 167 plastic bags each a year, 10m in total.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Hindmarch has resulted in a bag that promotes a message and, thanks to its appearance on the shoulders of celebrities including Keira Knightley and Lily Allen, has become a fashion must-have.</p>
<p>Some of the limited number already sold have been changing hands on eBay for £175, and even today, a day ahead of new stock hitting the shelves, bids of up to £87 have been made.</p>
<p>Bidding could reach a new frenzy tomorrow as some of those people trying to buy one of the bags in London are disappointed.</p>
<p>We Are What We Do says it has received 11,000 requests for bags through its website but will only be selling 4,000 bags tomorrow.</p>
<p>"We've been inundated with calls for the past month," says Kate Southworth, a spokeswoman for Anya Hindmarch. "We've had people phone and say they're coming down from Manchester to get one so, snow permitting, we are definitely expecting queues."</p>
<p>The store is limiting sales to two bags a customer, while Sainsbury's, which will have 20,000 bags to sell from April 25, will limit sales to one to each customer on each shopping trip.</p>
<p>Ms Southworth says celebrity appeal has undoubtedly helped fuel the bag frenzy, but that they were attracting attention before they were first snapped on A-listers' arms.</p>
<p>"We did put a small allocation of 1,000 bags on our website in the early days. They pre-sold in five days with no press support at all, purely through word of mouth," she says.</p>
<p>"There has been a real interest in the message behind them."</p>
<p>Roger Granada, who works for We Are What We Do, says the organisation had been surprised by the level of interest in the bags, but concerned at the eBay sales.</p>
<p>He says the organisation has put adverts on eBay urging people not to pay over the odds and pointing out that the bags have not yet sold out.</p>
<p>Granada says he hopes people attracted by the bags are taking on board the message behind them.</p>
<p>The campaign is to go international, with a navy blue version of the bag to be launched in the US in the summer. Japan will get its own, green version later in the year, and more will eventually be more for sale in the UK.</p>
<p>In the meantime, shoppers desperate to show off their green credentials may have to settle for a less glamorous but just as practical bag-for-life.</p>

<p>And so it’s with some awkwardness that I now heap praise on a dry shampoo that does actually clean your hair, and which has brought down my weekly shampoo average.</p>
<p>It has allowed me to don a shower cap for five days in every week, and my hair looks better for it.</p>
<p>For those temporarily unable to wash their hair (hospital residents and festival-goers, for example), it is terrific. But Advanced Clean is not cheap, and frankly, there is no reason to reject traditional dry shampoos in its favour.</p>
<a>Love Beauty Planet</a>, all under £10.
<p>But if you are someone who likes your hair best on “day one” (that’s me), when it’s freshly washed and dried, Advanced Clean will best mimic it and is well worth having to hand.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old actor, known for the 90s comedies Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy as well as 2019’s Uncut Gems, beat Harry Styles, Lizzo, Melania Trump and Britney Spears to the top spot.</p>
<p>On TikTok, Sandler’s look is popular. More than 330,000 videos have used the “sandlercore” hashtag to discuss the actor’s look.</p>
<p>Ashley Ogawa Clarke, the deputy editor of Mr Porter, says the Covid pandemic has been a crucial factor in the popularity of the actor’s look.</p>
<p>Sandler’s new style status is part a wider trend for “<a>slob-ebrities</a>” that includes Jonah Hill, Larry David, Davidson and Bieber.</p>
<p>If David’s oversized blazers and khakis made him an icon for the intentionally unremarkable normcore trend that emerged in 2014, Sandler takes things further. He is, as Ogawa Clarke puts it, “taking-the-bins out-core”.</p>
<p>“He’s a multimillionaire how many times over, and he’s dressed like the least cool kid,” Barker says. “He is unashamedly himself in the way he dresses.”</p>
<p>Ogawa Clarke says Sandler’s popularity demonstrates how menswear has changed: “It is not one thing any more. It can be a big mess sometimes. Sandler being voted best dressed is so unexpected.</p>

<a>I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free</a>. The goal wasn’t merely to join the elite, it was to redefine it.
<p>Grace Mirabella, the editor of American <a>Vogue</a> throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s, has died aged 92.</p>
<p>Mirabella was a no-nonsense champion of practical fashion. She succeeded the more whimsical and bohemian Diana Vreeland as editor in 1971 and remained in the role until 1988.</p>
<p>A native of New Jersey and an economics graduate, she began her career at the New York department store Macys before joining the publicity department at Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Mirabella set about reining in Vreeland’s fashion fantasy, and ascribed her loyalties to a new generation of working women who wanted to put careers and financial independence first.</p>
<p>“I wanted to give Vogue back to real women … I wanted to give Vogue over to women who were journalists, writers, actresses, artists, playwrights, businesswomen,” she continued.</p>
<p>In 1988, owner Condé Nast replaced Mirabella at Vogue with Anna Wintour, who remains in the title role.</p>
<a> said in tribute</a> Friday. “She eschewed fantasy and escapism in favor of a style that was chicly minimalist and which spoke clearly and directly to the newly liberated ways we wanted to live.”

<p>“The original Y2K trends were very much about the birth of digital culture, and now we live entirely online it makes sense that those trends are being revived.”</p>
<p>Tinsel hair, recently sported by singer <a>Katy Perry</a> to mark her Las Vegas singing residency, is also about the revival of certain hair accessories.</p>
<p>“I believe that they revert to the past, not out of single-minded nostalgia but as a means to escape and find comfort and inspiration at a time that the world around them is overwhelmingly confusing and challenging,” she says.</p>
