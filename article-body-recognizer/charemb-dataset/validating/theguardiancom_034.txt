<div> <time> Published: 4:17 PM </time> </div> Trump’s lackeys would rather defy US Congress than anger their old boss. Sad!
<a>emotional testimony</a> to the House select committee investigating the attack. He announced last week that he had resigned as a police officer,
<p>“There will only be one chance,” Judge Jackson said then. “If you violate my conditions, it will indicate my trust was misplaced.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in a filing <a>first reported by Business Insider</a>, Sibick sought permission to use social media to look for a job and to “interact with members of the opposite gender for the purpose of establishing a friendship”.</p>
<p>Sibick has <a>said</a> he now views the Capitol attack as “without question unconscionable”, a “disgrace to our nation” and “a scar Trump is ultimately responsible for”.</p>
<p>Robert Palmer, 54 and from Florida, <a>told a judge</a> he now recognised that Trump and others stoked the riot by “spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny”.</p>
<p>“Little did I realise that they were the tyrannical ones desperate to hold on to power at any cost,” Palmer said, “even by creating the chaos they knew would happen with such rhetoric”.</p>
<p>Trump was impeached for a second time for inciting an insurrection. Ten House Republicans and seven senators turned against him but he was still acquitted.</p>
<p>Members of the House 6 January committee have indicated that they could recommend Trump <a>be criminally charged</a>.</p>

<p>Jessica Rebeschini was advised to take at least six weeks off work to recover from an emergency C-section surgery and bond with her newborn child, Karter.</p>
<p>But with no paid maternity leave and bills due, the 26-year-old had no choice but to immediately start looking for a job.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing was that I was kind of scared. When you have major surgery like that and then you’re pushing your body so harshly,” said the mother of three from Bondurant, Iowa, who is remarkably phlegmatic about the experience.</p>
<p>When she got home, Rebeschini would take over childcare duties from her husband Ron, 33, an optician, so he could go to work.</p>
<p>“I remember every time I had to work I was like ‘please don’t reopen,’” she says of the scar on her abdomen. “I mean I was essentially risking my life.”</p>
<p>Rebeschini’s experience is far from rare for America’s mothers. One in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to the advocacy group <a>Paid Leave US</a> (PL+US).</p>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury.</p>
<a>analysis</a> by the International Labour Organisation, and only 17% have access to paid leave, according to US Department of Labour
<p>“If you look at paid leave rates between white families and families of colour, it’s even worse,” said Myra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at child development non-profit Zero to Three. “Parents just can’t afford to stay home with their babies.”</p>
<p>Rebeschini, who left her previous job around a month before the birth, said financially she had no option but to work.</p>
<p>“We had two dollars left in our bank account. I remember thinking to myself, had I not been working, my [rent] cheque would have bounced and we wouldn’t have had a place to live.”</p>
<p>Working shifts of up to 12 hours, she found the separation from her newborn agonising.</p>
<p>“I would come home and the first thing I did was make sure that he was breathing … When you’re not physically there you just have to trust that he’s fine. You worry about the bond of being gone for so long … is he going to recognise you?”</p>
<p>Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence.</p>
<p>“[He] has disabilities and we didn’t catch that until he was over a year old … I don’t know if we would have caught it sooner had I been home more.”</p>
<p>Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon.</p>
<p>Dr Rebecca Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said breastfeeding is one of the biggest challenges for women who return to work early – especially low-wage workers.</p>
<p>“If you’re driving a bus, how do you stop that bus to pump milk?”</p>
<p>After a C-section, she recommends women take eight weeks off and to avoid heavy activity to prevent complications. “A lot of women still have significant pain at two weeks after,” she said.</p>
<p>As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights. Parting with her newborn son was intolerable.</p>
<p>“Oh God it was horrible. I cried and cried and I would sit at work and I would cry.”</p>
<p>Paid family leave has gained broad support and looks set to become a policy point in the 2020 presidential election, though there are still disagreements in Washington on how to pay for it.</p>
<p>But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready.</p>
<p>“On the politician front at least there’s progress,” said Jones-Taylor. “But any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that’s not good for mum, it’s not good for babies, and it’s really just not good for the workforce.”</p>
<p>It also reports a reduced chance of new mothers having postpartum depression and women who take paid leave are 93% more likely to be working nine to 12 months after childbirth than those who don’t.</p>
<p>Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila.</p>
<p>Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children.</p>

<p>Nearly two years ago, the dawn of Covid lockdowns forced us to contend with the prospect of solitude and self-reflection. Naturally, we rushed to find other stuff to do.</p>
<p>Some of these trends have faded. But through all the Zoom fatigue and screen-time overdoses, the pandemic has forced us to find new ways to relate to each other – and that has meant creative opportunities and connections we’d otherwise have missed.</p>
<p>As we enter a new year, with the faintest glimmer of hope that someday, maybe, the pandemic will end, we spoke to those who say their lockdown-born activities are worth keeping – Covid or no Covid.</p>
<h2>The film buffs: ‘It came naturally to me’</h2>
<p>When lockdown began, 29-year-old gym trainer Stevie Rock began to feel isolated from friends and family as she hunkered in her Oakland, California, apartment. So she started up a new tradition: a weekly movie night with a friend in Seattle.</p>
<p>“It was a really good way to feel connected to somebody who felt very far away and have a shared experience,” she said.</p>
<p>And while strict lockdowns have lifted and Rock has gone back to working in person and spending time with friends in real life, the movie nights have persisted.</p>
<p>“I am very comfortable forming bonds with people online, so it came very naturally to me,” she said. “In some ways I feel like the pandemic has normalized something I would like to be doing more of anyway.”</p>
<h2>The virtual trivia master: ‘It’s fun to see people quibble’</h2>
<a>wave of trivia nights gone virtual</a> during lockdown.
<p>Every couple of months, he gathers contestants in Google Meet rooms for a set of head-to-head competitions. Groups of three or four contestants race to answer trivia questions for points. Winners then play against each other.</p>
<p>Morell has used the events as an opportunity to bring together people who haven’t met in person. “It’s pretty fun to see people who don’t know each other get together and quibble over who buzzed in first,” he said.</p>
<a>Geeks Who Drink</a> continue to offer virtual events alongside real-life ones. Morell expects them to live on even if and when the pandemic fades.
<p>“Part of the fun is having everything virtual,” he said. “You don’t have to go out and you don’t have to spend any money.”</p>
<h2>The role players: ‘Dungeons and Dragons helped us meet people’</h2>
<a>jumped 33% in 2020</a>, and the game’s popularity doesn’t seem to be fading, with Fandom, maker of a digital tool used to track players’ progress, reporting a
<h2>The Animal Crossing gamer: ‘Sometimes you just want to hear something nice from a stranger’</h2>
<a>to find at the time</a> amid soaring demand and going for hundreds of dollars over retail price. Sary wasn’t going to be ripped off – so she made a 16-hour round-trip journey to Montana, where a seller was offering the console at a reasonable price.
<h2>The support group user: ‘I’ve heard impactful stories in my online 12-step program’</h2>
<p>She said the accessibility of online meetings and extra level of anonymity provided by video-free chatting made the barrier to entry lower. Though she lives in New Jersey she spent time connecting with fellows in New York City meetings.</p>
<h2>The never-ending Zoom chat: ‘A lifeline that I didn’t know I needed’</h2>
<a>described it</a> as “the quarantine version of going to work in a coffee shop” – participants could silently work while others did the same on their cameras, interacting through the chat feature.
<p>Meanwhile, she’s been learning Spanish in order to talk to users in Central and South America.</p>
<p>Mainz’s decision to use its financial windfall to also slash corporate tax rates in the hope of attracting industry, especially biotech companies, however, is drawing criticism from neighbouring cities and economists.</p>
<p>But the success of BioNTech, whose founders Uğur Şahin and ‎Özlem Türeci worked with the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer for trials and manufacturing of their Comirnaty vaccine in 2020, has transformed Mainz’s fortunes.</p>
<a>Germany</a> and has not said to which municipalities the money went.
<p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Mainz’s main gift to the world was the printing press, whose inventor, Johannes Gutenberg, developed a method of printing from movable type in the city in about 1440.</p>
<p>But in Wiesbaden, notionally Mainz’s richer brother across the Rhine, local politicians have criticised Mainz as “extremely lacking in solidarity”, while economists predicted the move could trigger a race to the bottom among German cities.</p>

<p>So early, tentative evidence that the Omicron variant may result in <a>less severe health outcomes</a> is the best Christmas present the prime minister could have hoped for.</p>
<p>But there is now hope that at the very least, the decision on whether to impose strict new restrictions after Christmas may not be cut and dried.</p>
<p>The devolved administrations in <a>Scotland, Wales</a> and Northern Ireland have each announced a package of new rules from Boxing Day, ranging from limits on the largest outdoor events to the return of social distancing.</p>
<p>Johnson will now be hoping hospitalisations and other data provide a sufficient glimmer of hope to avoid a new year circuit breaker or other measures, such as limits on mixing.</p>
<p>But the pressure from within Johnson’s party over everything from political mismanagement to lockdown-busting parties, and from MPs looking at the <a>North Shropshire result</a> and fearing for their own future, is unlikely to abate.</p>
<p>Evidence that infections caused by Omicron may be less severe than other Covid variants is good news but is <a>likely to make little or no difference</a> to the duration of the pandemic, according to experts.</p>
<p>Those with the variant are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend AE compared with the Delta variant, and 50% to 70% less likely to be require admission to hospital, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday. </p>
<a>studied infections from the Delta and Omicron</a> variants since November and said the results “suggest that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation when compared with Delta”.
<a>119,789 new infections</a> reported on Thursday – means that even if only a small proportion of people with Covid need to attend hospital, it could cause difficulties for the NHS.
<p>“It’s good but it doesn’t get us out of the woods. Severity of infection is clearly very important but it is only one factor in terms of the public health burden,” Woolhouse said, speaking in a personal capacity.</p>
<a>workforce getting infections</a>,” they said. “But obviously it’s good news if a smaller fraction of those infections lead to severe illness.”
<p>Woolhouse said there remained substantial gaps in scientists’ knowledge of Omicron, such as how the UK’s booster campaign would affect the spread of infection.</p>
<p>“If it did have an impact on the spread of cases that would be further good news, and that would affect the size of the wave and therefore the public health burden.”</p>
<p>Ministers have confirmed that no <a>new Covid-19 restrictions will be imposed in England before the new year</a>.</p>
<p>It puts <a>England</a> at odds with the rest of the United Kingdom in how people will be allowed to ring in the new year. Here is what you can, and cannot, do:</p>
<p>There will be limits on the size of live public events for three weeks beginning 26 December. Indoor events will be limited to 100 standing or 200 seated, while outdoors events will be limited to 500 seated or standing.</p>
<p>Nightclubs will be closed for three weeks from 27 December. Pubs, bars and other settings where alcohol is being served will return to table service only. One-metre social distancing will be enforced in all indoor hospitality and leisure settings.</p>
<p>In England, Covid passes for nightclubs and other venues have been in place as of 15 December. People are required to show they have been vaccinated or recently tested negative (or are exempt) to gain entry.</p>
<p>Face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public venues, including theatres and cinemas as well as on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in pubs or restaurants.</p>
<p>People wishing to celebrate in pubs, cinemas and restaurants must do so in groups of six or fewer. Licensed premises will be restricted to table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected.</p>
<p>Social distancing of two metres will be in place and nightclubs are closed from Boxing Day. Large events will not be allowed, with a maximum of 30 people in indoor events and a maximum of 50 people at outdoor events.</p>
<p>When Britain fully left the European Union in January, it marked the start of a very difficult 12 months for the entrepreneur Rob Law, whose Trunki children’s suitcases used to sell well in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>In 2021, companies across Britain have suffered from the worst trade disruption in recent memory, as problems caused by <a>Brexit</a> collided with the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it is Brexit that Law fears will have a permanent impact. “There’s always going to be more cost, more delays, it’s never going to be as smooth as it used to be,” he said.</p>
<a>a 12-point plan</a> and a new slogan.
<p>The most up-to-date figures from the <a>Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS), which cover the first 10 months of the year, show goods exports to the rest of the world are down by 14%, or more than £40bn, compared with 2019.</p>
<p>Fish and meat exporters say they have been hit by higher costs for sending lorry shipments through ports, with an army of extra workers required to deal with additional bureaucracy and paperwork.</p>
<p>Figures from the ONS show more than a quarter of firms currently <a>trading in the UK have seen a rise in their costs</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy what they’ve done,” said Angus MacNeil, the SNP chair of the Commons international trade committee. “I compare it to saying we need six or seven planets populated entirely by Americans to make up for Brexit.”</p>
<p>For Trunki, sales in Britain are back to pre-pandemic levels as families bought more wheelie suitcases and bags in anticipation of going on holiday, but EU sales are still at 80% of 2019 levels.</p>
<p>“The [Brexit] deal was obviously done very last-minute, and it was very slapdash,” said James Officer, sales manager at the firm.</p>
<p>While some might say expanding horizons outside of the EU is part of the point of Brexit, Officer disagrees. Selling to Russia and Belarus isn’t as profitable, and the countries he now does business with carry significantly more risk.</p>
<p>“You’re out of the frying pan with Europe and into more hot water in Belarus. Brexit absolutely was not a good thing for our business. I haven’t seen any benefit,” Officer said.</p>
<a>worst backlogs on record in southern California</a> – caused by pandemic restrictions, shortages of lorry drivers and mismatches in supply and demand.
<p>In the UK, car exports are down 30% on 2019 levels, held back in large part by shortages of microchips around the world.</p>

<p>Hospitality bosses have welcomed news that the government has <a>ruled out additional Covid restrictions in England</a> before the busy New Year’s Eve trading period.</p>
<p>Businesses had been calling for certainty, with bars and restaurants saying they had been left in limbo at a time of potentially lucrative bookings – or costly cancellations.</p>
<p>The industry had feared that Boris Johnson and ministers would toughen up Covid-19 measures in England, after the Omicron variant led to a surge in Covid infections.</p>
<p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already imposed tougher Covid rules on physical distancing and the number of people who can meet, including the closure of nightclubs.</p>
<p>Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry body, said the confirmation by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that no further clampdown would come in England until early 2022 was welcome news for businesses.</p>
<p>She said the government had taken a “pragmatic and proportionate approach” which would “give a real lifeline for many who have struggled with the loss of trade in the run up to Christmas”.</p>
<p>She added: “Losing new year on top of December would have been devastating, and keeping restrictions to a minimum helps protects businesses and jobs.”</p>
<p>The possible restrictions that ministers were reportedly considering, including advice to households not to mix indoors, would have been a lockdown in all but name, she said “with trade pushed to unsustainable levels”.</p>
<p>Martin Wolstencroft, the CEO of ARC Inspirations, which runs 18 bars in the north of England, said that having no further restrictions would be “fantastic for the industry”.</p>
<p>Speaking before the prime minister confirmed that there would be no changes, he said certainty was needed for “our managers and staff, our customers – who want to know if they can meet up with loved ones – and the full supply chain”.</p>
<p>He said: “Our industry can now start to plan with some certainty over the next week, and make up for lost time promoting one of the key nights of the year in the coming days.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Nita called the announcement “amazing news”, saying: “New Years is on!!”</p>
<p>Kill said a longer-term strategy was needed, adding: “It is clear that the open, close strategy, which has had a huge impact on our industry, is not sustainable.”</p>
<p>“The government has to give a clear statement to consumers that it’s safe to go out, or if it isn’t then enact a circuit breaker and compensate all of the businesses affected.”</p>
<a>drew an angry response from hospitality bosses</a>, who said it was not nearly enough after a collapse in pre-Christmas trade.
<p>Nicholls reaffirmed the warning on Monday, adding: “Without further rate relief and a lower rate of VAT to sustain employment, businesses will fail and jobs will be lost.”</p>
<p>Speaking to state governors on Monday, Joe Biden said the dramatic surge in US Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant “should be a source of concern but it should not be a source of panic”.</p>
<p>“If you’re fully vaccinated and got your booster shot,” Biden said, “you’re highly protected. If you’re unvaccinated, you’re at a high risk of getting severely ill from Covid-19, being hospitalised and in some cases dying.”</p>
<p>Omicron accounts for 73% of US coronavirus infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week.</p>
<p>Fauci added that he hoped the surge in cases would subside in January. But he said infections could still overwhelm hospitals, especially in highly unvaccinated areas.</p>
<p>“We really still need to be extremely careful,” he told MSNBC.</p>
<p>The president and Fauci’s statement comes as health authorities on Monday shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases to five days, down from the previous guidance of 10 days.</p>
<p>“CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses,” said Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, in a statement.</p>
<p>His message, he said, was simple: “If you need something, say something. We’re going to have your back any way we can.”</p>
<p>He also outlined three federal measures to help states: more capacity “to get shots in arms”; more testing, from eight authorised home tests and from federally run pop-up locations; and more federal support for hospitals.</p>
<p>“America has made progress, and things are better,” he said.</p>
<p>But Biden also said he anticipated rising hospitalisations. The federal government has stockpiled millions of gowns, gloves, masks and ventilators.</p>
<p>Additionally, Biden said: “We’re mobilizing an additional 1,000 military doctors and nurses and medics to help staff hospitals.”</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Biden said, would deploy hundreds of ambulances and emergency crews, and had deployed emergency response teams in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Mexico.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to provide more hospital beds as well,” Biden said. “Bottom line is, I want assure the American people we are prepared and we know what it takes.”</p>
<p>Americans seeking to travel over the Christmas weekend saw chaos as the Omicron surge <a>snarled air travel</a>. Fight crews contracted the virus, causing thousands of cancellations.</p>
<p>More than 800 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the US on Monday, the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com showed. That was on top of more than 3,000 cancellations during the Christmas holiday weekend.</p>
<p>United said it canceled 115 flights on Monday, out of more than 4,000, due to crews out with Covid. Delta and American did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Fauci <a>said</a> a vaccine mandate should be “seriously” considered for domestic flights.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to ask yourself why you’re making that requirement,” Fauci told MSNBC.</p>
<p>“If you’re making a requirement for vaccination for people to get on planes who are coming into the country, that’s understandable. You don’t want to bring more cases into the country.</p>
<p>“But if you’re talking about requiring vaccination to get on a plane domestically, that is just another one of the requirements that I think is reasonable to consider.”</p>
<p>Fauci declined to indicate whether he had discussed a mandate with Biden, but did reiterate that mandates can push more people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>“When you make vaccination a requirement, that’s another incentive to get more people vaccinated,” he said. “If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that’s something that seriously should be considered.”</p>
<p>Other travel stocks also came under pressure on Monday. At least three cruise ships were forced to return to port over the weekend after Covid cases were detected.</p>
<p>Infections are up across the US, with 205,509 new infections reported on average each day, a Reuters tally shows. <a>More than 816,000 people</a> have died.</p>
<p>In New York, Monday saw a sweeping mandate take effect, requiring nearly all private-sector businesses to ban unvaccinated employees from the workplace.</p>
<p>Spurs will travel to the south coast without knowing the results of the PCR tests taken on Monday but Conte believes it is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>“But we did have these problems two weeks ago. We were having training sessions, I was preparing for the game and then at the end of the training session you can have a positive player in your team.”</p>
<p>No walk-in PCR tests available in England for a few hours due to ‘high demand’; French PM <a>announces new measures</a></p>
<p>Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far:</p>
<li>Denmark and Iceland, both of which had some of Europe’s lowest infection rates before the arrival of Omicron, reported record daily Covid cases today. Denmark now has the world’s highest infection rate, with 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. </li>
<li>Europe recorded the most cases and deaths in the past seven days, according to statistics compiled by Agence France-Presse. The five countries with the highest case rates over the last seven days were all European.</li>
<p>That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has told employees that all individuals coming into the bank’s US offices will be required to show proof of a booster shot.</p>
<p>The new policy will come into effect on 1 February and applies to both employees and visitors. In addition, Goldman Sachs plans to double mandatory testing to twice weekly, beginning on 10 January. </p>
<p>“Children have not been dying in a way that justifies a vaccine for children,” he told reporters in the southern state of Santa Catarina. </p>
<p>Bolsonaro himself has refused to get vaccinated and has repeatedly called into question the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccines, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Vaccinating children against coronavirus has been a hot topic in Brazil. More than 300 children between the ages of 5 and 11 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, according to a government coronavirus advisory body.</p>
<p>Ministers have confirmed that no new Covid-19 restrictions will be imposed in England before the new year.</p>
<p>It puts England at odds with the rest of the United Kingdom in how people will be allowed to ring in the new year. Here is what you can, and cannot, do:</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shortened its recommended time for isolation for people who test positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to five days if they don’t have symptoms.</p>
<p>The reduction follows the CDC’s decision last week to cut its isolation period for infected health care workers assuming they are asymptomatic and later test negative.</p>
<p>Health officials have similarly shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to five days if they are vaccinated, and often to no time if they are boosted.</p>
<p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of Omicron cases. “Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,” she told The Associated Press. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science.”</p>
<p>Hospitality bosses have welcomed news that the government has ruled out additional Covid restrictions in England before the busy New Year’s Eve trading period.</p>
<p>Businesses had been calling for certainty, with bars and restaurants saying they had been left in limbo at a time of potentially lucrative bookings – or costly cancellations.</p>
<p>The industry had feared that Boris Johnson and ministers would toughen up Covid-19 measures in England, after the Omicron variant led to a surge in Covid infections.</p>
<p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already imposed tougher Covid rules on physical distancing and the number of people who can meet, including the closure of nightclubs.</p>
<p>Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry body, said the confirmation by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that no further clampdown would come in <a>England</a> until early 2022 was welcome news for businesses.</p>
<p>She said that the government had taken a “pragmatic and proportionate approach” which would “give a real lifeline for many who have struggled with the loss of trade in the run up to Christmas.</p>

<p>Spain’s Covid infection rate has exceeded 1,000 cases per 100,000 people for the first time, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The rate, measured over the preceding 14 days, rose to 1,206 cases following the Christmas weekend, according to health ministry data. That compares with 911 reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The figures have added 214,619 new cases and a further 120 deaths since Thursday. Daily deaths have been hovering below 100, far lower than the 1,000 mark at the peak of the first wave last year or about 600 in January.</p>
<p>“We are obviously going to see high numbers of infections, but not hospitalisations and ICU admissions compared to previous waves,” the country’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters earlier today.</p>
<p>The number of patients in England admitted into hospital with Covid-19 has reached its highest level since mid-February after a 74% rise in a week.</p>
<p>NHS figures updated for the first time since the Christmas break show here were 1,281 Covid-19 hospital admissions in England on 25 December.</p>
<p>In London, hospital admissions increased by 73% with 364 admissions reported on 25 December. </p>
<p>A total of 8,474 people were in hospital in England with Covid-19 as of 8am today – the highest number since 5 March.</p>
<h2>France announces stricter measures, but no curfew for New Year's Eve</h2>
<p>France has narrowed the delay for a third booster shot to three months from four in response to the rapid spread of Omicron but there will be no curfew for New Year’s Eve, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>Jean Castex, the French prime minister, also said that from Monday and for the next three weeks, all public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people for indoor events, and to 5,000 people for outdoor events.</p>
<p>Consumption of drinks and food will be banned in long-distance transport and home working will become mandatory for at least three days per week where possible, Castex said. Mask wearing will also become mandatory in city centres.</p>
<p>Speaking to state governors on Monday, Joe Biden said the dramatic surge in US Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant “should be a source of concern but it should not be a source of panic”.</p>
<p>“If you’re fully vaccinated and got your booster shot,” Biden said, “you’re highly protected. If you’re unvaccinated, you’re at a high risk of getting severely ill from Covid-19, being hospitalised and in some cases dying.”</p>
<p>Federal officials have said people can safely gather with their families if they are vaccinated but say larger celebrations are riskier. On Monday, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, urged Americans to avoid large gatherings.</p>
<p>Fauci added that he hoped the surge in cases would subside in January. But he said infections could still overwhelm hospitals, especially in highly unvaccinated areas.</p>
<p>Italy reported 142 Covid-related deaths on Monday, compared with 81 deaths the previous day, according to health officials.</p>
<p>The number of daily cases rose to 30,810, up from 24,883 on Sunday, Reuters reports. Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 9,723 on Monday, up from 9,220 a day earlier.</p>
<p>There were 100 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 85 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,126 from a previous 1,089.</p>
<h2>Paraguay confirms first Omicron cases</h2>
<p>Three confirmed cases of the Omicron variant have been recorded, Paraguay’s health ministry said today. </p>
<p>An official said the government would not take immediate action on travel, but urged people to plan safely. </p>
<p>Here’s the UK health secretary Sajid Javid confirming that no further measures will be introduced in England before the new year. </p>
<p>Good evening, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from my colleague Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Denmark and Iceland reported record daily Covid cases today as the fast-spreading Omicron variant makes Europe the global hotspot for infections and deaths.</p>
<p>Europe recorded the most cases and deaths in the past seven days, according to statistics compiled by Agence France-Presse. The five countries with the highest case rates over the last seven days were all European.</p>
<p>In Denmark, authorities registered 16,164 cases in 24 hours, the first time the daily caseload has exceeded 15,000 since the pandemic began. Denmark now has the world’s highest infection rate, with 1,612 cases per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Iceland reported 672 cases today. Until mid-December, the country had never reported more than 200 cases and daily cases never exceeded 100 during last year’s autumn wave.</p>
<p>Both Denmark and Iceland had some of Europe’s lowest infection rates before the arrival of Omicron. </p>
<h2>Boris Johnson will impose no further Covid restrictions before new year</h2>
<p>England will have no further Covid restrictions over New Year’s Eve, Boris Johnson has ruled, meaning nightclubs and mass events can continue but people will be urged to test before seeing those who are vulnerable.</p>
<p>The decision makes England an outlier in the UK, after Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put limits on social gatherings and mass events.</p>
<p>Greece has announced further restrictions effective between 3 and 16 January to contain a further surge in Covid infections, targeting mainly night-time entertainment venues.</p>
<p>As confirmed new Covid cases surged to a record of 9,284 on Monday, resulting in 66 deaths, the health minister said that under the new measures, high-protection masks would be compulsory at supermarkets, public transport and eating establishments.</p>
<p>Bars and restaurants will have to close at midnight and no standing customers at entertainment venues will be allowed. There will also be a maximum limit of six people per table, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>“If we find that these measures are not complied with we will ban music [at entertainment venues],” the health minister, Thanos Plevris, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Authorities had already tightened existing regulations last week, mandating mask wearing in open spaces and banning Christmas and new year festivities.</p>
<p>Flight cancellations that disrupted holiday travel stretched into Monday, with major US airlines each cancelling dozens of flights.</p>
<p>Winter weather in the Pacific Northwest led to nearly 250 flight cancellations to or from Seattle on Sunday, said Alaska Airlines, and the airline expects more than 100 flight cancellations on Monday.</p>
<p>United said it cancelled 115 flights Monday, out of more than 4,000 scheduled, due to crews out with Covid.</p>
<p>Health minister Brad Hazzard says all states should make rapid antigen tests the norm for travel to ease pressure on overwhelmed system</p>
<p>Queues of up to eight hours for PCR testing in <a>New South Wales</a> have led to calls to standardise interstate testing requirements and make rapid antigen tests the norm.</p>
<p>The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, blamed interstate travel requirements for a significant increase in demand on an already overwhelmed system and the lengthy delays.</p>
<p>Hazzard accused the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of “passive-aggressive stupidity” over the issue.</p>
<p>Wait times had blown out to the point the test results were no longer relevant, Hazzard said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It is taking up to four days, sometimes five days, to get test results.</p>
<p>“They might have been negative on day one when they had their test, but they could well be positive on day four or day five when they cross the border.</p>
<p>Testing delays in NSW, Victoria and the ACT were expected to continue until at least New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>“They were supposed to open the testing site at nine so I got there 7.15. As I was in line, one nurse came out at 8.10 and put a line suspended poster 100 metres behind me,” she told Guardian Australia.</p>
<p>Gabriela said there was a woman in line standing up and breastfeeding as they waited for their tests.</p>
<p>“There were two women in the line who told her they would keep her place if she wanted to sit down and breastfeed.</p>
<p>Gabriela said the people around her in the line did not have symptoms, and most were having tests so they could travel.</p>
<p>“We’ve got rapid antigen tests, we need to start using them. I have one at home, I could have easily done one.”</p>
<p>In NSW, Dr Effie Karageorgos said she had encountered testing lines several kilometres long.</p>
<p>In Victoria, at least one resident, who did not want to be named, chose to ignore the mandatory isolation over Christmas after waiting four days to get her test result back.</p>
<p>“On Wednesday night I found out a colleague had Covid, so everyone who worked with her had to get a test,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple waited four days to receive their negative results. After talking to their family, they decided to go to her parent’s house for Christmas.</p>
<p>“The rapid test should be free and we should be able to do that if we have no symptoms,” she said.</p>
<p>Prof Adrian Esterman from the University of South Australia said the long lines created problems.</p>
<p>“We’re getting a lot of people infectious in the community because they’re not willing to wait,” Esterman said.</p>
<p>“The second issue is that all of our modelling assumes testing and contact tracing are working well, and they’re not.</p>
<p>“So our modelling isn’t accurate and we are getting far more cases than we expected.”</p>
<p>On Sunday the South Australian government moved to rapid antigen testing for interstate travellers, but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, was standing firm, saying the PCR testing requirement would not be reconsidered until 1 January.</p>
<p>Esterman said all interstate travel should require a rapid antigen test instead of a PCR, to release some pressure from the system.</p>
<p>The chaos had resulted in calls to disregard testing altogether, especially after Hazzard said on Sunday that everyone in the state “at some point will get Omicron”.</p>
<p>But Esterman said that was “a gross exaggeration” and to save lives the testing system, especially for healthcare workers and those people who were symptomatic, still needed to be in place.</p>
<p>“The reason why we still need it is to say if people are infected. The rapid antigen test is good, just not as accurate – you have to have the right tool for the right job,” Esterman said.</p>
<p>“If you’ve got an aged care worker and they’ve got symptoms you want to know for sure if they’re infected or not. The PCR is test is by far the best way in certain situations.”</p>
<p>A NSW Health spokesperson said it was constantly monitoring <a>demand for testing </a>alongside private testing labs.</p>
<p>“Testing capacity in NSW is currently under enormous pressure … NSW has requested that the requirements for PCR testing by other states be terminated and, where necessary, substituted by a rapid antigen test.”</p>
<p>Hazzard said rapid antigen tests were “absolutely” the way forward in the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We need to look seriously, very seriously, at all these pressures on PCR testing,” he said. “NSW by far does the most PCR testing in the country … two years ago we thought we were doing well when we were doing 40,000 tests a day.”</p>
<p>The state has been averaging 132,240 Covid tests a day in the past week, peaking at 164,144 on Christmas Eve. At the same time, the test positivity rate has risen <a>beyond 6%</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to Omicron, NSW was also averaging about 130,000 tests a day in September, during the Delta wave of the virus when the positivity rate hovered at about 1%. Testing peaked at 173,913 tests at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>At the end of August, the state was recording an average in excess of 140,000 Covid tests on some days.</p>
<p>Private testing clinics were seeing similar pressures with wait times in excess of 100 hours in some instances.</p>
<p>Laverty’s contact number connected patients with a recorded message – “Due to unprecedented demand NSW <a>Health</a> says not to call for test results until after 72 hours” – and then hung up automatically.</p>
<p>All three clinics were approached for comment.</p>
<p>Many hospitality and tourism operators have shut during the crucial summer holiday period due to a lack of staff</p>
<p>Small businesses have been forced to close during the crucial summer holiday period because of the failure of state and federal governments to bring in free Covid rapid antigen tests, the sector’s peak body says.</p>
<a>Dominic Perrottet</a>, that the state had ordered 20m rapid antigen tests, which he expected to be available by the end of January.
<p>But Boyd said many hospitality and tourism businesses had already been forced to slam shut their doors due to a lack of staff amid a dramatic increase in case numbers, led by NSW, caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant.</p>
<p>In October, Cosboa, unions and transport industry bodies called on governments to make rapid antigen tests, which deliver results within minutes, free for small businesses.</p>
<p>“We could see with the reopening of the economy that we needed to see workers not re-entering the workforce unnecessarily and endangering people,” she said.</p>
<p>She said the long waiting times seen at stations delivering polymerase chain reaction tests, which are more reliable than rapid antigen tests but take longer to return a result, were foreseeable at the time.</p>
<p>“These lines at PCR testing facilities, of course they were going to happen,” she said.</p>
<p>Speaking in Wagga Wagga on Tuesday, Perrottet said the NSW government had “put an order in for 20m rapid antigen tests”.</p>
<p>“My expectation is they will be available by the end of January,” he said.</p>
<p>“As we move into 2022, as we are living alongside the virus, taking personal responsibility, rapid antigen tests will be key.</p>
<p>“They are not to be used in circumstances where you are going out to the shops. These tests will be used for people going to high-risk settings. Going to hospitals, visiting elderly relatives, going clubbing.”</p>
<p>“If all governments around Australia, including the federal government, had taken some action we might have found ourselves in a different space.”</p>
<p>The ACTU has also criticised Scott Morrison for failing to provide rapid antigen testing.</p>
<p>Last week, the acting secretary, Liam O’Brien, said Morrison’s inaction led to “testing sites jammed and a looming crisis on our hands”.</p>
<p>Boyd said small businesses had “really risen to the challenge of keeping their workers and customers – even the not so nice ones – safe” and were now suffering from worker shortages at what for many was their high season.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of businesses that chose to close over the Christmas period because of the low foot traffic, but more because of the risk of transmission.”</p>
<p>She said some business owners who remained open were burning out due to long hours caused by a shortage of workers.</p>
<p>The Morrison government’s decision to slam Australia’s borders shut during the pandemic cut off the supply of overseas labour relied upon by some Australian businesses.</p>
<p>“Worker shortages – that’s across the board from accounting and IT to hairdressing and retail,” Boyd said.</p>
<p>“You’ve got worker shortages caused by border closures, you’ve got the ongoing confusion over vaccine mandates, you’ve got the problems around rapid antigen tests.”</p>
<p>She said long waits for PCR results, which can take days to arrive, were also making life difficult for contractors who work in the concert and event industries.</p>
<p>“They’ve been told they need to have results a certain time period before an event occurs,” she said. “That’s causing additional stress.”</p>
