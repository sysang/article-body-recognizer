<h2>Joe Biden was not made for the age of TikTok. But his team is trying.</h2>
<p>The White House is producing videos that they know will get mocked on political Twitter. They don’t care. They have other plans. </p>
<p> Screenshots from the Jonas Brothers TikTok vaccination video with President Joe Biden are displayed from the @jonasbrothers TikTok account. | POLITICO Illustration </p>

<p>“You know what’s going to be great is the f---ing, ‘Well who are the Jonas Brothers?’” he said, the last bit delivered in a nasally voice that conveyed the mocking from the political Twitterati that he was sure was to come.</p>
<p>The result <a>was a 17-second video</a> set in different areas of the White House, shot a few days before the meeting, which subtly pushed Covid vaccinations. It did precisely what Flaherty imagined.</p>
<a>"backfired” with the youths</a>.
<p>“This was the first time we (as the White House and POTUS) took part in a viral social trend and then crafted the original audio to stay on message with vaccinations and boosters,” a White House official said in an email.</p>
<a>as the most visited site of 2021</a>.
<a>shot a video (co-starring press secretary Jen Psaki)</a> this summer using a character he’s played before,
<a>The video the White House</a> released followed Rodrigo around the White House for the day.
<p>“It's about setting the principals up to not feel like, you know, grandparents in the nightclub and feel sort of native,” is how Flaherty puts it.</p>
<a>Harvard Youth Poll</a> found 51 percent of voters 18 to 29 disapproved of the president, with 46 approving of the job he’s done. That was down 13 points from the same poll in March.
<p>Flaherty points to the “loud anti-vax propaganda machine” online as something the famous folks help to fight against.</p>
<p>The one thing that is measurable? The digital team is going to keep on calling up the most famous among us to lend a hand on all types of topics. As for the Moby Dick of celebrity influencers?</p>
<p>“Beyoncé,” Morgado said. “The dream.”</p>
<p>Obviously. No bookings have yet been made but digital staff “has spoken” with Queen Bey’s team.</p>

<h2>Puerto Rico’s shattered power grid could become a ‘big experiment’ for Biden</h2>
<p>The crumbling electricity network that serves the island's 3 million people is at the center of a debate on renewable energy vs. fossil fuels — with billions of federal dollars at stake.</p>
<p> Renewable energy and consumer advocates say that money is best spent on putting solar panels on the roofs of every home on the sunny island, with the aim of creating a decentralized source of power generation. | Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By GLORIA GONZALEZ</p> <p><time>12/25/2021 07:00 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/25/2021 09:45 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>A pair of hurricanes and an earthquake left Puerto Rico’s power system in tatters.</p>
<p>First, though, the U.S. territory has to get past a pitched fight over the privatization of its power grid, as well as a debate on how to leverage billions in recovery dollars from the federal government.</p>
<b> </b>is off to a rough start.
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has $9.4 billion — the largest amount awarded in the agency’s history — allocated to restore and protect Puerto Rico’s power network from the type of disasters that have plagued it.</p>
<p>But opposition remains, particularly among skeptics who think a<b> </b>wholesale shift to renewable power sources will introduce new doubts about reliability.</p>
<p>“Puerto Rico could be the big experiment for the whole nation in terms of having a diversified portfolio of energy, not just one experiment in terms of renewables,” she told POLITICO.</p>
<h3>'The grid is in need of complete replacement'</h3>
<p>The system has been in “severe decay” due to years of poor maintenance and further destabilized by the 2020 earthquake, said Luis Martinez, director of Southeast energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean energy program.</p>
<p>Plants that run on fuel oil or diesel still provided half the island’s power in 2020, while imported natural gas has seen its share reach 29 percent and coal generated 19 percent. Hydropower and other renewables provided only 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Those figures are roughly in line with Biden’s goal for the country and set a pace that climate advocates say should preclude further dependence on fossil fuels on the island.</p>
<p>But González-Colón dismissed those green ambitions as unfeasible for the immediate future, saying the island needs to take an “all-of-the-above” approach while the grid is being rebuilt to enable more renewables.</p>
<p>”We need to use LNG as a way to cut expenses and stabilize the system at the same time you are investing in renewable energy,” she said.</p>
<b> </b>compared with less than half that time in 2020
<b> </b>since it took over the grid in June,
<b> </b>according to a report in The New York Times, though CEO Wayne Stensby has said figures from previous years undercounted the outage time. Those service disruptions prompted a protest that closed a highway in San Juan in October.
<p>Stensby, at an Oct. 6 hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee, blamed a union blockade for a slow start to repair work and observed that “PREPA is unquestionably the worst performing utility in the United States by each and every measure.”</p>
<p>LUMA said it has made improvements in its first six months of managing the grid, such as upgrading more than 1,800 power poles and dozens of critical distribution breakers to reduce the likelihood of future outages.</p>
<p>“Any service interruption is one too many and we are working hard to make the service and infrastructure improvements so that customers see fewer interruptions,” the company said in a Dec. 3 statement.</p>
<h3>Pushing ahead with fossil fuels</h3>
<p>In particular, the group says the agency should look at alternatives such as battery energy storage and rooftop solar.</p>
<p>A FEMA spokesperson said via email that it carefully reviews all requests and is evaluating this one.</p>
<p>But NRDC’s Martinez said FEMA could “put its foot down” and say the funding proposals must meet the Biden administration’s goals, requirements imposed by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau and the island’s renewable energy legislative target.</p>
<p>“If they say that, I think that will clarify how much wiggle room the utility has to essentially go rogue,” he said. “They’re not following what the law says or what the regulators say.”</p>
<p>But Queremos Sol’s Santiago said the island’s continuing power outages and its slow transition to solar power pose an environmental justice issue — one that the Biden administration has the power to address.</p>

<h2>Dan Crenshaw to his fellow conservatives: Come ‘correct’</h2>
<p>The combat veteran often voted with Donald Trump but doesn't act Trumpishly. And he'll slam other Republicans when he feels he must.</p>
<p> Rep. Dan Crenshaw, known for the eye patch he wears after a combat injury in Afghanistan, isn't easily rattled. Asked about other Republicans swiping at him for his recent criticisms, he replied: “Who cares?” | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p>
<div> <div> <p> By OLIVIA BEAVERS</p> <p><time>12/22/2021 04:30 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>He voted with Donald Trump most of the time but isn’t a loyalist. He’s a stalwart conservative willing to criticize other conservatives. </p>
<p>Rep. Dan Crenshaw, in short, is a GOP anomaly. </p>
<a>caught on tape</a> in his home state of Texas — that separated his fellow House Republicans into two camps: "Performance artists ... ones you think are more conservative because they know how to say slogans real well,” and “legislators.”
<a>turned to friendly</a> conservative media to claim that 80 fellow House Republicans compromised individuals' privacy by voting yes, but Crenshaw and GOP leaders countered that the bill included new protections against federal government tracking.
<p>“Unfortunately, many Republicans you trust are lying to you,” <a>Crenshaw tweeted</a> with an accompanied video explaining what the bill does. </p>
<p>And after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Crenshaw torched his colleagues' arguments for challenging President Joe Biden’s electoral victory, calling claims of voter fraud part of a “mass manipulation” by members of his own party.</p>
<p>“They said they were protecting the Constitution. They knew full well they were shredding it,” he said on his podcast, recorded two days after the attack.</p>
<p>But the second-term Texan, known for the eye patch he wears after a combat injury in Afghanistan, isn't easily rattled. Asked about other Republicans swiping at him for his recent criticisms, he replied: “Who cares?”</p>
<p>“The people who really reacted harshly probably are the people I'm talking about, because I struck a nerve with them,” he said.</p>
<p>Some conservatives who responded more mildly are still displeased. </p>
<p>And while Crenshaw has no leadership position, members say he doesn’t need one to have influence. </p>
<p>“I think he is one of the most important members of the Republican conference. And I think that he has the potential to be an incredible leader going forward,” said Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.), who entered Congress the same year as Crenshaw. </p>
<p>His outspokenness has also prompted questions among his colleagues about where he wants to go next. Crenshaw says he isn’t angling for any senior spot in the GOP, but nor has he ruled anything out.</p>
<h2>Senate GOP feels another Trump effect: The rise of celeb candidates</h2>
<p>House experience isn't necessarily the best way to get traction across the Capitol anymore — as Herschel Walker and Mehmet Oz are proving.</p>
<p> In this Sept. 25, 2021, photo Senate candidate Herschel Walker speaks during former President Donald Trump's Save America rally in Perry, Ga. | Ben Gray, File/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By MARIANNE LEVINE and SARAH FERRIS</p> <p><time>12/23/2021 04:30 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>The most reliable springboard to the Senate used to be House experience — before Donald Trump vaulted from reality TV to the White House.</p>
<p>“I started a trend, didn’t I?” Tuberville quipped.</p>
<p>On the other hand, celebrity candidates can be unaccustomed to the intense vetting and media scrutiny that comes with running for office.</p>
<a>academic credentials</a> in the Georgia Senate race. Oz has to battle skepticism about his promotion of
<a>scientifically dubious remedies</a> on his show, not to mention his
<a>Pennsylvania residency</a> given his years living in New Jersey.
<a>told a Senate panel</a> that he has given the products he promotes to his family, but also said he recognized “that oftentimes they don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.”
<p>“My worry is that as you get more people here who have no experience in cutting a deal, it makes a place that’s already pretty dysfunctional even worse," Murphy added.</p>
<p>And the Senate GOP conference could see several new members with zero legislative experience. In addition to Oz and Walker, author J.D. Vance is mounting his own campaign in Ohio.</p>
<p>Fame outside of politics "gets your foot in the door, that gets eyeballs on you, but you still got to perform,” said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), the current frontrunner in his party's primary to capture that Buckeye State Senate seat next year.</p>
<p>Democrats have seen celebrity candidates on their side of the aisle, too.</p>
<p>Despite his own roots in the House, Cramer said he’s come to appreciate higher-profile Senate candidates for at least one reason: “Being elected to Congress isn’t the biggest thing that’s ever happened to them. And I think that’s sort of nice.”</p>
<p>“There’s no question that Donald Trump broke the mold,” Cramer added. “I don’t know that he’s the new mold, but he certainly broke the old one.”</p>

<p>Michigan’s new congressional map likely sets up three battleground seats for the next decade, while teeing up a Democratic member-on-member clash between Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin.</p>
<p>Michigan is on track to be much more hotly contested at the congressional level than during the previous decades, when just two seats switched party hands, both in 2018.</p>
<p>John James, a twice-failed Senate candidate, is a possible Republican contender for the open 10th District — though so is former GOP Rep. Mike Bishop, who may be considering a comeback after losing to Slotkin in 2018.</p>
<p>Rep. Peter Meijer, a freshman Republican who voted to impeach Trump earlier this year, said he would run in the state’s new 3rd District, which has become more Democratic.</p>
<p>Perennial battleground Republican Rep. Fred Upton announced he would run in the state’s 4th District, which could also be a competitive if marginally red-leaning seat.</p>
<p>The maps may still be challenged in court. Gustavo Portela, a spokesperson for the state Republican Party, said that “we are evaluating all options to take steps necessary to defend the voices silenced by this commission.</p>
<p>The state’s panel was already facing tough choices going into the map-making process, with Michigan losing a congressional seat after the 2020 census, dropping down to 13 districts.</p>

<p>When Senate Democrats are in a jam, a question sometimes quietly bubbles up on Capitol Hill: What would Harry Reid have done?</p>
<p>While Schumer leads the party with relentless messaging discipline and a focus on lockstep party unity, Reid favored all-out political combat. Sometimes Reid battled members of his own party, but he reveled in partisan bomb-throwing. </p>
<a>took to the Senate floor together in 2015</a> to dispute the tone of
<a>along with two other senators</a>, didn’t matter in a chamber where Reid controlled 55 votes and just needed a simple majority for a rules change.
<p>At the moment, Schumer is left with 50 seats — severely handicapping what can be done on both Biden’s agenda and to the fabric of the Senate entirely.</p>
<p>Remembering Reid, Schumer called him “my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends.” The two continued speaking regularly since Reid left office. </p>
<a>longtime conservative bona fides</a> to the curb. Reid's majority was stacked with moderates from red states; Schumer's senators from Arizona and Georgia reflect the new direction of the party.
<a>voted against him in his last leadership election</a> after Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, a sign of how polarizing he was within the Democratic Party.
<p>Yet even during that period of discontent, Democrats credited Reid with having the party’s best interests in mind as he drew relentless heat from Republicans for not allowing more amendment votes. </p>
<p>“He’ll be a good leader. He won’t be like me, we’re different,” Reid predicted in a 2016 interview. “Two different personalities. He’s a press guy, I’m not.”</p>
<a>he casually explained</a> he wasn’t going to put Obama’s fast-track trade bill up for a vote. He showered Mitt Romney with dubious attacks on the Senate floor in 2012.
<p>And Reid was unrepentant about his tactics a few years later. <a>He explained the entire Romney episode</a> in blunt black and white: “Romney didn’t win, did he?”</p>
<a>he excoriated Trump</a> as a “sexual predator who lost the popular vote.” But even though he was still the minority leader, Reid also began largely deferring to Schumer in his final weeks in office.
<a>Schumer helped Senate Democrats</a> get their issue visibility in the press but didn’t force a shutdown fight. Throughout the drama, Reid mostly let his successor handle it.
<p>And for the first time Democrats asked themselves: What would Harry Reid have done?</p>

<b> </b>Mitchell ordered Liddy to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee, setting in motion the chain of events that came to be known simply as Watergate.
<b> </b>Liddy served more than four years in prison, but he enjoyed several second acts, each arguably more important in the development of modern conservatism than his outlandish role in the Nixon administration. He wrote a memoir,

<h1>What is redistricting, and why does it matter?</h1>
<div><p>Every 10 years, each state redraws its political lines. These processes take months to unfold in state capitals all around the country — and their results mold the balance of power in Congress for a decade.</p></div>

<p>That didn’t happen. And sometimes, that’s the nature of a bad prediction: At the time it’s made, it can seem not only totally rational, but obvious. It may have an element of wishcasting (in my case, it certainly did).</p>

<h3>Trump will be reinstated as president after the Supreme Court somehow overturns the 2020 election</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Mike Lindell, many times</p>
<p>March 26: “All the evidence I have — everything — is going to go before the Supreme Court, and the election of 2020 is going bye-bye. … Donald Trump will be back in office in August.”</p>
<p>March 30: “I said Donald Trump will be in [the White House] in August. And I fully believe that myself: he’ll be back in.”</p>
<p><a>May 25</a>: “Donald Trump … will be back in by the end of August.”</p>
<p><a>June 2</a>: “These are facts: We have a clear path to pull this election down. … [On the Supreme Court,] it’ll be 9-0 — down comes the election, and in August, here comes Donald Trump.”</p>
<p><a>June 5</a>: [On the August prediction] “I could be off by a month or so, I don’t know.”</p>
<p><a>July 4</a>: “By the morning of August 13, it’ll be the talk of the world, going ‘Hurry up! Let’s get this election pulled down. Let’s … get these communists out, you know, [who] have taken over.’”</p>

<p><a>Sept. 24</a>: “We’re giving everything — all the evidence I have — [to] the Supreme Court. That will be done before Thanksgiving. That’s in stone.”</p>
<p><a>Nov. 7</a>: “[The Supreme Court is] going to accept it 9-0. It will require a new election across the board. … [They’ll] declare the 2020 vote void and order new elections across the board.”</p>

<h3>“By Labor Day, Biden’s approval ratings will average [in the] low 60s.”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Tom Ricks, June 24</p>
<p>In his tweet, Ricks conceded that it was a “reckless” prediction, but at the time, maybe it didn’t seem too crazy. The economy was improving, the pandemic seemed to be receding.</p>
<p>By Labor Day, in <a>FiveThirtyEight’s average</a>, Biden’s approval sat at 46.1 percent; his disapproval was 48.3 percent. It was the end of the first full week of the Biden presidency where his approval was underwater. It’s been there ever since.</p>
<h3>“Pretty decent chance” Gavin Newsom loses the recall election</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Nate Silver, Aug. 23</p>
<p>Silver might take issue with our call that his odds-making counts as a wrong prediction, but the fact is, Newsom ultimately won handily. And his strategy paid off.</p>

<h3>“There’s no reason to worry about inflation in 2021”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Myles Udland, Dec. 16, 2020</p>

<h3>Republicans will win both Senate seats in Georgia</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Dana Perino, Jan. 4; Matt Grossmann, Nov. 9, 2020; et al</p>
<h3>Nancy Pelosi won’t have the votes to become Speaker in 2021</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Jason Chaffetz, Jan. 2</p>
<p>The result was entirely predictable: Pelosi had the votes. Of the 427 members of the House at the time, 216 supported her — a margin comfortable enough that a handful of House Democrats from swing seats were free to vote for someone other than her.</p>
<h3>“Withdrawing troops from Afghanistan will turn out to be the most popular action of Biden’s presidency”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: G. Elliott Morris, April 25</p>
<p>In fairness, this was not a bad prediction when it was made: Polls throughout the spring showed overwhelming support for Biden’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But by Biden’s Sept. 11 deadline, the chaotic U.S. pullout had destabilized his presidency, calling into question the core claims of competence that had long been Biden’s ballast.</p>
<p>It’s possible that over the long arc of history, Morris’ prediction will turn out to be correct. But at this point, the pullout was extraordinarily politically damaging for Biden’s presidency.</p>
<h3>If Dems win in Georgia, “it’s a guarantee of socialism,” amnesty for undocumented immigrants, statehood for Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., and so on</h3>

<h3>You shouldn’t be worried about what might happen Jan. 6 — it “will go nowhere” and “will be fun to watch”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Amy Siskind, Jan. 2 </p>
<p>Amy Siskind, who rose to online prominence in the early days of the Trump administration by recording and listing out the norms being broken on a weekly basis, was one of the relatively few major voices on #Resistance Twitter urging calm.</p>
<a>she tweeted on the night of Jan. 2</a>. “It’s nothing more than a seditious stunt that will go nowhere.”
<a>Then, a follow-up</a>: “If you live in DC, stay off the streets on Jan 6. Let the DC police take care of the white supremacists like they did in Oregon yesterday. I actually think it will be fun to watch lol.”
<h3>With Trump banned from the platform, “Twitter will disappear in one year”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: David Fegan (among others), Jan. 8 </p>
<h3>Trump will resign, and President Mike Pence will pardon him</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Duncan Ross (among others), Jan. 3</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Trump remained in office until Biden took the oath on Jan. 20.</p>
<h3>Joe Biden will “move to alter the U.S. Supreme Court”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Paul Strand, Feb. 17</p>
<p>Many progressives wish he would. But Biden has made no move to expand the court, and his blue-ribbon commission to study the issue did not endorse the idea.</p>
<h3>Nancy Pelosi will take a “farewell tour,” and her successor will be Linda Sánchez</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Fortune Magazine, Dec. 2020 </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the conversation about her successor has centered mostly on Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, rather than Sánchez — and though it certainly remains possible that Sánchez ends up eventually leading the Dems, it definitely didn’t happen in 2021.</p>
<h3>Trump will attend Biden’s inauguration</h3>
<p>Predicted by: Stephen L. Carter, Jan. 1</p>
<h3>JFK Jr. will return in Dallas (among other bullshit)</h3>
<p>Predicted by: hundreds of adherents to the QAnon conspiracy theory, ongoing</p>
<a>March 4 came and went</a>, and Trump was not magically reinaugurated as president. Ditto
<a>in the words of the Dallas Morning News</a>. JFK Jr. — who, again, has been dead for 22 years — did not show up at the site of his father’s assassination. Still, dozens QAnonists remained in Dallas for weeks,
<a>expecting him to show up</a>. (Some, I’m sure, are still there.) But if you already believe that a Satanic, cannibalistic cabal of pedophiles secretly governs the country, what exactly is a bridge too far?

<div> <header> <p> predictions</p> </header> <h2>The Worst Political Predictions of 2019</h2> <p>No one knows what the future holds, but these pundits and politicians knew even less than the rest. </p> </div>
<div><div><p> Matt Wuerker for POLITICO </p> <div> <div> <p> By ZACK STANTON </p> <p><time>12/30/2019 05:02 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div></div>
<p>If you took the sum of political knowledge available at the end of 2018 and projected the course of 2019, the resulting spaghetti models could go in millions of directions.</p>
<p>As a metaphor for political prognostication, you could do worse than the hurricane comparison—though, notably, pundits lack steady reliability, scientific methodology or real-life consequences for their forecasts.</p>
<a>annual</a> Worst Predictions list.
<h3>17. “By the end of 2019, the president of the United States will be Nancy Pelosi”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Stephen Kinzer</a>, <i>Boston Globe</i></p>
<h3>16. “The Syria withdrawal probably won’t happen in anything more than a cosmetic sense”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Damir Marusic</a>, <i>The American Interest</i></p>
<h3>15. Trump will “resign from office before he can be impeached, citing health reasons”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Jon Cooper</a></p>
<h3>14. “Beto O’Rourke will be the next president of the United States”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Lee Drutman</a> (<a>several</a> <a>times</a>) and a great many others</p>
<a>each predicted</a> that he would be leading the polls of Democratic presidential candidates at the end of this year. Less than eight months later, O’Rourke dropped out of the presidential race altogether.
<h3>13. Joe Biden won’t run for president</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Ari Fleischer</a></p>
<p>Joe Biden entered the Democratic primary in April, and he has consistently led national polls since.</p>
<h3>12. House Democrats and Senate Republicans will “secure a number of legislative victories … [and] meet on middle ground”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Orrin Hatch</a></p>
<a>legislation that passed</a> in the House to get held up in the Senate that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has dubbed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s chamber “the graveyard.” Bipartisan successes? There were very few.
<h3>11. Mueller will “exonerate Trump,” “implicate the Deep State” and “forever legitimize his presidency”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Bill Mitchell</a> (<a>here, too</a>)</p>
<p>Not only did special counsel Robert Mueller not exonerate Trump, he said, “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” </p>
<h3>10. Kamala Harris will win the Democratic presidential nomination</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Myra Adams</a>, <i>Real Clear Politics</i></p>
<p>This wasn’t implausible when it was predicted in January, during Harris’ highly regarded presidential campaign rollout, but the California senator didn’t even make it to the end of 2019 as a candidate, dropping out of the race on Dec. 3.</p>
<h3>9. “Buttigieg will drop [in the polls] soon, and many of his supporters will migrate to Warren”</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Noah Smith</a></p>
<p>Leading the fourth-largest city in Indiana hasn’t historically been a launching pad for the Oval Office, but in late December, Pete Buttigieg remains at or near the top of the Democratic pack in Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
<h3>8. Trump will nominate Jared Kushner for attorney general</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Carl P. Leubsdorf</a>, <i>Dallas Morning News</i></p>
<h3>7. House Democrats will not impeach Trump</h3>
<p>Predicted by (among others): <a>Peter Daou</a>, <a>Kai Ryssdal</a> and <a>Stephen L. Carter</a></p>
<h3>6. House Dems and the Senate GOP will work together to enact immigration reform</h3>
<p>Predicted by: <a>Fortune magazine</a></p>
