<p>Republicans are recruiting John James to run for Congress<b> </b>in Michigan in 2020. It’s just not clear which side of the Capitol will land him. </p>

<b> </b>running in a short general election after winning a competitive primary less than three months before Election Day.
<b> </b>Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens won the district last year by more than 6 percentage points after two-term Republican Rep. Dave Trott retired.
<p>However, a panel of federal judges recently tossed out Michigan’s congressional map, <a><u>throwing next year’s House elections into uncertainty</u></a> and complicating recruiting efforts for both parties there.</p>
<p>“He’s got both committees recruiting him hard for two different jobs,” said one GOP strategist, requesting anonymity to discuss internal party matters. “He’s been getting the full-court press.”</p>
<p>A representative for James declined to comment. </p>
<p>James proved a prolific fundraiser in the last election. He ended the first quarter of this year with nearly $500,000 left in his campaign account, a strong head start if he chooses to run again. </p>
<p>It’s possible James, 37, could pass entirely on running again in 2020 and wait for future opportunities, including potentially running for governor in 2022. </p>

<p>As Donald Trump and his allies squeezed then-Vice President Mike Pence to single-handedly stop Joe Biden’s presidency in the weeks ahead of Jan. 6, they used one particular tool that’s been largely ignored ever since.</p>
<a>sued Pence on Dec. 27</a>, just as Trump was ratcheting up his pressure campaign against his vice president. Backed by a squad of lawyers associated with Trump ally and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell, Gohmert argued Pence should assert

<h2>The one Republican Senate candidate willing to call out Donald Trump</h2>

<div> <div> <p> By ALEX ISENSTADT</p> <p><time>05/09/2020 07:00 AM EDT</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>05/09/2020 11:04 AM EDT</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Few Republicans are willing to say a negative word about President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>John James — a rising star in the GOP who last year was floated to be Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, and is now waging an uphill campaign for Senate in Michigan — is taking a different approach.</p>
<p>During a video conference with black community leaders last week, James was asked whether he disagreed with Trump on anything given the president’s support of his candidacy.</p>
<p>"And so yes, there's gonna be places that I disagree with the president and those are just a couple," he added.</p>
<p>(While James hasn't received funding from the education secretary, her family has <a>contributed heavily</a> to a super PAC supporting his candidacy.)</p>
<p>“I do recognize that it's human to disagree with people and like I've said millions of times, I can agree with the president without worshiping him. I can disagree without attacking him,” James said.</p>
<p>Trump, James said at one point, "has his own campaign to run."</p>
<p>James has made clear throughout the 2020 race that he’s willing to distinguish himself from Trump in certain areas and has stressed that he intends to run on local, not national issues.</p>
<p>Gail Gitcho, a James spokeswoman, said, “John James is willing to have these tough conversations with voters. John James is his own man, and he will point out when he agrees with the president and respectfully point out when he disagrees with him.”</p>
<p>Trump has heavily promoted James, <a>tweeting</a> last month that James “will be a GREAT Senator for Michigan!”</p>
<p>Trump also endorsed James in his unsuccessful 2018 Senate bid. At one point, he tweeted a <a>picture</a> of him with James in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>James has <a>publicly touted</a> his support from the White House and <a>recently said</a> that Trump has “done everything that he has thought was best” in his managing of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Democrats say they are<a> eager to paint James as a Trump puppet</a> and frequently highlight his comment during the 2018 race that he was "2,000 percent" with the president's agenda.</p>
<p>James responded that his access to Trump as a Republican senator would be an asset to African Americans in the state.</p>
<p>“Look, Donald Trump doesn’t need less black folks around him, he needs more,” said James.</p>
<p>He added: “Hopefully you’ll see through my actions that I am for you, that I am for black people, and that we share the same destiny. And hopefully as the result of that, you give me the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
<p>Trump aides, who are constantly on the lookout for signs of Republican dissent, are suspicious that James is trying to have it both ways. </p>
<p>They were rankled when James, after announcing his Senate bid in June, <a>tweeted</a>, “We are heading in the wrong direction as a country and our leaders in Washington are failing to lead us toward a better and brighter future.”</p>

<h2>Biden plans forceful push for voting rights. Aides are bearish on success.</h2>

<p>That sequencing has irked some of the president’s most fervent supporters, who fear he may get neither.</p>
<p>“An inaction at this point would lead to an inaction of Black voters. People are saying, ‘If they don’t do this, I’m not voting,’” the civil rights leader said. “People are saying they feel betrayed.”</p>

<p>Other aides believe a smaller commemoration is more appropriate, not wanting to elevate Trump’s lies or risk further inflaming partisan tensions over the 2020 election. </p>
<p>While the full scale of what the White House is planning remains unclear, Biden is expected to deliver a speech connecting the day to the defense of the ballot, aides said.</p>
<p>“The longer we wait the more mischief the states are performing,” said King. </p>

<p>President Joe Biden acknowledged Thursday that negotiations over his Build Back Better bill are poised to drag on into 2022 despite efforts and pledges by Democrats to get it done before Christmas. </p>
<p>With the holidays approaching and the Senate eager to leave town on Friday, however, a vote isn't likely until after New Year's Day.</p>
<p>“My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that work will continue next week,” he added.</p>

<h2>Putin urges West to act quickly to offer security guarantees</h2>
<p>The Russian leader welcomed talks with the U.S. that are set to start in Geneva next month, but warned the discussion focused on Moscow’s demand needs to produce quick results.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the West on Thursday to move quickly to meet Russia’s demand for security guarantees precluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and the deployment of the military alliance’s weapons there.</p>
<p>Speaking during a marathon annual news conference, the Russian leader welcomed talks with the U.S. that are set to start in Geneva next month, but warned the discussion focused on Moscow’s demand needs to produce quick results.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure our security,” Putin said. “We put it straight: there must be no further expansion of NATO eastward.”</p>
<p>Last week, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>During his annual news conference, Putin accused the West of trying to make Ukraine “anti-Russia, constantly beefed up with modern weapons and brainwashing the population.”</p>
<p>He said Russia can’t keep living in constant anticipation of looming security threats posed by possible deployment of Western weapons in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He argued that Western weapons could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to attempt to regain control over Russia-backed separatist regions by force and even try to reclaim Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>Putin has denied having plans to launch an attack but has described a NATO expansion and weapons deployment in Ukraine as a “red line.”</p>

<p>Let’s get to it. — Phelim</p>
<p>Next week’s Summit for Democracy is Biden’s latest effort at coalition building against threats to what he calls the “international rules-based order.”</p>
<a>China’s dismay</a>, Taiwan has been invited to join
<a>representatives of 111 democratic countries</a> (several with
<a>dubious democratic credentials</a>) convening at the Dec. 9-10 summit in a demonstration of international resolve. Though unstated, the Biden administration's aim is to counter diplomatic, economic and military dangers posed by a

<a>agreeing to provide</a> the central European state a $600 million export credit agreement with the U.S. Export-Import Bank as a proactive balm against likely Chinese economic reprisals.

<p>The president also accused the officials of knowing about election interference but not reporting it. “That’s a criminal offense,” Trump said. “And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk.”</p>
<p>Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) said: “It is the antithesis of what our democratic process is, and sounds like it could be illegal.”</p>
<p>According to the audio, Trump asked Raffensperger and his counsel Ryan Germany to find 11,780 votes, “which is one more than we have, because we won the state.”</p>
<p>The Biden camp rebuked Trump over the call.</p>
<p>Also on the call were Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, Justice Department official John Lott Jr. and Chapman University law professor John Eastman, according to a person familiar with the call.</p>
<p>They discussed efforts by both state legislators and members of Congress to try to overturn the certified results for Biden, the person said.</p>
<p>The call was organized by the group Got Freedom?, which says it’s fighting election fraud and is planning to conduct a similar briefing for members of Congress.</p>
<p>Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p>
<p>Navarro, who wrote a report on the election, mentioned the call with legislators on a Fox News appearance on Saturday night.</p>
<p>“We gave them the receipts,” he said. “We explained exactly how the Democrat Party as a matter of strategy stole this election from Donald J. Trump.”</p>

<p>Late Thursday, Republicans huddled with leadership and tax policy staff to work on a solution.<b> </b> </p>
<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who supports the current package, estimated that Republicans needed to find an additional $370 billion to $400 billion within their package to placate concerns about increased deficits.<b> </b></p>
<p>"What we're trying to do right now is get to the point where nobody's going to get exactly what they want but enough for us to get the bill passed," he told reporters. </p>

<h2>Manchin to Dems: Redo the whole thing, maybe I'll vote for it</h2>
<p>The West Virginia senator wants a new bill that goes through Senate committees and focuses on rolling back the 2017 Trump tax cuts.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p> By BURGESS EVERETT</p> <p><time>12/20/2021 12:08 PM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/20/2021 03:16 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Joe Manchin has some advice for fellow Democrats: rebuild Build Back Better and you might still get my vote.</p>
<p>He added: “Well, guess what? I'm from West Virginia. I'm not from where they're from, [where] they can just beat the living crap out of people and think they’ll be submissive.”</p>
<p>“I won't continue to go down everything you want to do, major policy changes and reconciliation. It needs to go through a process,” Manchin added. The House held committee hearings for the legislation, the Senate has not. </p>
<p>"We are going to vote on a revised version of the House-passed Build Back Better Act — and we will keep voting on it until we get something done," Schumer said Monday.</p>
<p>Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said Manchin called her Monday morning.</p>
<p>With Build Back Better stalled out, the Washington Democrat said she wanted the Biden administration to instead take executive action on climate change, among other issues. Others in the party, however, want to keep negotiating.</p>
<p>“We've been way far apart philosophically,” Manchin said. “The same bill I have in front of me right now that they kept putting in front of me, was the same $6 trillion bill from the beginning."</p>

<h2>Another eye-popping inflation reading is ahead. Next year could look very different.</h2>
<p>The prices felt most acutely by voters could be telling a better story for Democrats heading into the midterms.</p>
<div> <p> Florida Sen. Rick Scott speaks about inflation and the rising cost of goods in May. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</p> <div> <div> <p> By VICTORIA GUIDA</p> <p><time>12/09/2021 04:30 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Republicans have pounded Democrats for months over spiking gasoline and grocery costs, a phenomenon they’ve dubbed “Bidenflation.” By the time next year’s elections roll around, that line of attack may lose its punch.</p>
<p>“Gas prices are down somewhat,” White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain <a>tweeted on Wednesday</a>. “They are projected to come down more...”</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration this week <a>projected that gasoline prices will decline</a> to an average $2.88 per gallon next year, down from $3.39 in November.</p>
<p>Still, Americans are growing increasingly worried about inflation, with 56 percent saying it’s causing them a financial strain and more than half citing food and gas costs, according to a <a>Wall Street Journal poll</a> this week.</p>
<p>“Look at what inflation’s doing: It’s not hurting the rich, it’s hurting the poorest families when they’re struggling to fill up their cars, put food on the table, afford a house,” Scott said on Fox News this week.</p>
<p>The biggest factor that could prove Republicans right about overall inflation would be a renewed surge in energy prices next spring and summer that goes above the levels of recent months.</p>
<p>“We have all this supply coming online and demand seasonally gets weaker, and then we have Omicron on top of that,” Salazar said. “We’ll probably get some restrictions, in terms of travel, and that leads to a natural surplus.”</p>
<p>In the second half of next year, prices could come back up somewhat, but “I really don’t think you’ll have prices that are high” given how much supply there’s expected to be, including from U.S. oil producers, he added.</p>
<p>Crude oil was trading at about $72 a barrel midweek, down from its late October peak of $84, though still higher than the $59 price in December 2019 before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>Salazar said he expects that prices next year could hover in the low $70 to upper $60 range, which would ultimately translate to a drop in the cost of gas; prices at the pump lag those of crude by no more than a month or two.</p>
<p>“We had our strongest prices back in May, June, July of this year,” said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. “On the crop side, even as I look at the livestock side, we see prices easing there.”</p>
<p>But lower crop prices could prevent grocery prices from rising much next year compared to sharp increases this year, he said.</p>
<a>is expected to persist for years</a>. Meanwhile, central bank officials are also seeing businesses more emboldened to raise prices,
<a>reporting anecdotes</a> where “strong demand generally allowed firms to raise prices with little pushback.”
<p>Still, a decrease in commodity prices across the board — from steel to cotton — could help bring down overall inflation readings because they’re critical to so many goods.</p>
<p>Skanda Amarnath, executive director at the worker advocacy group Employ America, said the trend might also suggest other reasons to be optimistic about the outlook for prices, if it indicates that supply chain issues are beginning to get resolved.</p>

<p>In a reply Thursday afternoon, the House asked the Supreme Court to expedite consideration of the case. House Counsel Doug Letter said he’s prepared to file a full response on Dec. 30 and would seek the court’s consideration by Jan. 14.</p>
<p>“Delay would inflict serious injury on the Select Committee and on the public,” he wrote, saying the committee needed the documents as part of “securing the safety and soundness of our democratic processes and institutions.”</p>
<p>Trump also takes aim at the Jan. 6 committee itself, claiming it lacks a valid legislative purpose — an argument that the appeals court sharply rejected — and that it is instead pursuing a political vendetta.</p>

<p>Wood’s ruling instructed the Times “not to use the legal memoranda provided by Project Veritas’ counsel, Benjamin Barr, or information obtained from those documents in this action for any purposes whatsoever.”</p>

<p>The announcement follows the CDC’s move last week to shorten its isolation period for infected health care workers, assuming they are asymptomatic and later test negative.</p>
<p>Biden administration health officials have debated the policy shift in recent weeks, especially amid a surge in Omicron cases that has raised concerns about worker shortages and fueled calls to revisit the agency’s quarantine guidelines.</p>
<b> </b>for those who are unvaccinated or have yet to receive their booster shot.
<p>People who are fully vaccinated and have received a booster do not need to quarantine if exposed to Covid-19, but should wear a mask for 10 days, the CDC said. </p>
<p>Multiple airlines <a>canceled hundreds of flights</a> this past weekend due to staff shortages.</p>
<p>On a call Monday morning with governors, President Joe Biden expressed openness to slashing the quarantine timeline, Gov. Chris Sununu said afterward. </p>
<p>Sununu, a Republican, called the potential reduction “an important step in keeping our economy, supply chains and schools open and running.”</p>
<h2>Price tag to vaccinate the world: $7 billion. And the U.S. is already coming up short.</h2>

<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development is running out of money to pay for the Biden administration’s campaign to put millions of shots in arms across the world in 2022, according to two agency officials with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<b> </b>hundreds of millions of U.S.-made doses
<b> </b>to low- and middle-income countries by the middle of 2022. At the administration’s first Covid-19 summit with foreign representatives in September, U.S. officials
<a>noted</a> it would take at least $7 billion in 2022 to ensure shots are administered across the globe.
<p>“USAID is not taking our foot off the gas in this effort and we are assessing what will be required as we continue to collaborate with our international partners to build on this effort in 2022,” a spokesperson for USAID said.</p>
<p>In a press conference last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the administration believes it has the necessary funding to carry out its global vaccination efforts.</p>
<p>“There's always ... an open line of communication with members and leadership about what may be needed,” Psaki said. “We believe we have the resources to get people vaccinated.”</p>
<p>But those efforts will fall off if the aid agency does not obtain the necessary funds.</p>

<p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is pressing the White House to further accelerate production of rapid Covid-19 tests, telling President Joe Biden on Monday that testing availability has become “a real challenge” amid the Omicron-fueled surge in cases.</p>
<p>“The need is great to do more in terms of the rapid tests and the availability of [them],” he said, adding that rapid tests are particularly critical to ensuring children can safely attend school in person.</p>
<p>But he also cautioned that a new plan to buy and distribute 500 million free rapid tests could interfere with state-level efforts already underway to boost supply.</p>
<p>“Make sure that we do not let federal solutions stand in the way of state solutions,” Hutchinson said, calling the initiative “great, but obviously that drives up the supply chain for the solutions we might offer as governor.” </p>
<p>Biden, during his talk with the governors, acknowledged the shortages that hit several states ahead of the holidays, referencing "long lines" seen around the country and conceding that he had not done enough to prepare for the rising demand.</p>
<p>“It’s clearly not enough — if we’d have known, we would’ve gone harder, quicker,” Biden said. “We have to do better and we will.”</p>
<p>The meeting with governors came after a week that is expected to drive Covid-19 case counts sharply upward, fueled by the more transmissible Omicron variant and increased holiday travel.</p>
<a>slashed its recommended isolation timeline</a> for those who contract Covid-19 to five days, from the original 10 — a change that some health experts and state officials had called for in recent weeks.
<p>New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, in a statement called the shortened timeline "an important step in keeping our economy, supply chains, and schools open and running."</p>
<p>Biden during the call also offered an optimistic view of the next few months, telling governors that Omicron is a source of concern but not “panic” and that the federal government will be well-prepared to support states hit hard by the surge.</p>
<p>“This is not like March of 2020,” he said. “We’re prepared and we know what it takes to save lives, protect people and keep schools and businesses open. We just have to stay focused and continue to work together.”</p>

<p>“Better to get it right than be first!” Portland Public Schools Board Member Julia Brim-Edwards <a>tweeted</a> as she and other leaders delayed a vote in Oregon's largest district.</p>
<a>a judge blocked the requirement this month</a>.
<p>Los Angeles school officials defended their eleventh-hour delay as necessary given the absence of a plan for how to reassign teachers, consolidate classes and shift tens of thousands of students to remote instruction at once.</p>
<p>Still, health experts say it was a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>He doesn’t think Los Angeles’ decision to delay enforcement of its mandate for students will deter other districts from trying to implement mandates of their own. </p>
<p>Districts elsewhere have weighed which students are most likely to be unvaccinated if a mandate is enforced, and the drawbacks of having those students learn under remote instruction.</p>
<p>Mayor-elect Eric Adams, who takes office Jan. 1, said in May he opposed a vaccine mandate for New York City students. More recently, Adams said he would consider a mandate for students 12 and up when the FDA fully approves the shot. </p>
<p>In Portland, Ore., where unmasked protesters disrupted a November meeting held to discuss the possibility of a vaccine mandate for students, school board members punted the thorny issue and delayed a vote by six months.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Unified’s change in direction could empower those who are against Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>The Biden administration will lift the travel ban for eight African countries that were among the first to report the highly contagious and rapidly spreading the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz on Friday confirmed the restrictions will ease Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Last month, the Biden administration <a>banned travel</a> from South Africa, which first detected the virus, as well as nearby Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Administration officials at the time<b> </b>said the ban wouldn’t permanently keep the variant out of the U.S., but instead would buy time for health officials to learn more about Omicron.</p>
<p>“We put the travel ban on to see how much time we had before it hit here so we could begin to decide what we needed by looking at what’s happening in other countries,” Biden told reporters Tuesday. “But we’re past that now.”</p>
<p>The administration additionally imposed a tighter testing window last month for travelers inbound to the U.S., requiring a negative Covid test just one day prior to travel instead of three.</p>
<p>The CDC still recommends U.S. travelers avoid high-risk countries with surging Omicron cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the holiday travel season has not experienced a downturn despite surging Omicron variant cases across the country. TSA said its screeners saw nearly 2.2 million travelers Thursday. But Omicron has begun to take its toll on the airlines.</p>
<p>“To address the potential impact of the current isolation policy effectively, we propose an isolation period of no more than 5 days from symptom onset for those who experience a breakthrough infection,” A4A president and CEO Nicholas Calio said.</p>

<h2>Biden’s about to adopt a policy that could hurt Dems even more with rural voters</h2>
<p>About half of the $46.5 billion in federal rental aid made available during the pandemic is expected to be spent by the end of this year.</p>

<p>A Biden administration plan to claw back billions of dollars in unused rental aid has sparked an outcry from Democratic lawmakers and from housing groups who warn that struggling rural tenants will lose a lifeline just as the virus surges again.</p>
<a>Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies</a> found that 48 percent of renters living in rural areas and small towns had incomes below $25,000 in 2016.
<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, nonmetropolitan regions that depend on farming and manufacturing have faced the <a>highest Covid-19 case rates in the country</a>.</p>
<p>The most densely populated cities — such as New York — were slow in distributing rental aid at the beginning of the year. Rural areas are still scrambling to get the money out the door.</p>
<p>Rural counties and states in many cases lack infrastructure — in terms of both government agency staff and broadband access — to find tenants in need and enroll them in hastily built new assistance programs.</p>
<p>The difficulties connecting with rural residents who may benefit from the aid has made it harder to assess who needs help.</p>
<p>It’s also unclear based on available data the extent to which rural tenants have been affected by the Supreme Court’s decision in August to block the federal eviction ban.</p>
<p>“These are places that are not going to show up in our eviction statistics, but they need money badly,” Gershenson said.</p>
<p>“You won’t find that anywhere in rural America,” said Cleaver, who has been pressing Treasury on the issue.</p>
<p>The senior official said the department is aware that states with rural areas have had a harder time connecting with vulnerable tenants and that it can be difficult to accurately assess need as a result.</p>
<a>according to the state program’s website</a>. Treasury has encouraged program operators to rely on applicants' self-attestations of need and income.
<p>“It’s going to cost many Montana renters the roofs over their heads if these resources disappear due to the negligence of state government,” Tester said.</p>
<p>Gianforte’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>State programs in Nebraska, Idaho and Tennessee also appear to be at risk, but their unused funds could go to city programs within their borders that have high expenditure rates.</p>
<p>Gershenson said he was most concerned about rural Southeast counties with large Black populations that tend to have higher eviction rates.</p>

<h2>21 Masks That Capture the Politics of 2021</h2>
<p>When we look back on pictures of major events of the second year of the pandemic, it’s clear that masks have become more than a safety measure. They’re now a powerful messaging tool.</p>

<p>It’s been an eventful year to say the least. But when historians look back on images of all that’s happened, it’ll be easy to place 2021 in the Covid era if only for the ubiquity of one particular item of apparel.</p>
<p>POLITICO Magazine compiled a photo gallery of some of the most distinctive political masks across 2021. Together, these photos capture a remarkable year as new, high-stakes political fights collided with an ongoing, and still deadly, pandemic.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p>On Inauguration Day, PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor <a>tweeted</a> a picture of new White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain sporting a red and blue “Unity!” mask. “It’s the message of the day,” she wrote.</p></div> </div> </div>
<a>posted</a> the photo of himself wearing the mask on social media, writing: “The American people are furious at Joe Biden’s presidency, and rightfully so. I stand with them. … C’mon Brandon.”

<h2>Opinion | 70 Years Ago Black Activists Accused the U.S. of Genocide. They Should Have Been Taken Seriously.</h2>
<p>The charge, while provocative, offers a framework to reckon with systemic racial injustice — past and present.</p>

<p>The group was accusing the United States of genocide — specifically, genocide against Black people.</p>
<p>The word “genocide” was only seven years old. It had been coined during World War II in a book about Nazi atrocities, and adopted by the United Nations in 1948, though no nation had yet been formally convicted of perpetrating a genocide.</p>
<i>Washington Post</i> mentioned the petition in brief stories buried in the back pages. The
<i>Chicago Tribune</i> condemned it for “shameful lies.” Raphael Lemkin, the Polish jurist who had coined the term “genocide,” publicly disagreed with the whole basis of the petition, saying
