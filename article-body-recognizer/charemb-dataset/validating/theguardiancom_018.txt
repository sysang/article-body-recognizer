<p>There’s a reminder of a more peaceful past when the path takes you along the embankment of the former North Eastern Railways branch line, past the old station at Coanwood to Lambley Viaduct, a joyful piece of Victorian engineering.</p>
<p>Crossing the viaduct there is a detour to the tiny village of Lambley, where the only remnant of the Benedictine priory sacked by Wallace is the bell hanging in the village church (the ruins were swept away in a flood in the 1700s).</p>
<p>If you’re particularly lucky, you might see the iridescent blue streak of a kingfisher, or an otter may pop its head up and survey you before disappearing below the surface, leaving a necklace of bubbles.</p>

<p>The locals smile knowingly and one of them adds, “The November beer festival is fantastic … and New Year’s Mari Lwyd – that’s where we parade the skull of the grey mare, reciting Welsh poetry.”</p>
<p>His own favourite event, however, is the <a>Man Versus Horse race</a>, a 22-mile cross-country epic. “We’ve only ever had two runners win,” he says. “But that might be because it gets pretty wild in here the night before.”</p>

<a>Schloss Elmau</a>, host to the G7 summit in 2015 and also a cultural centre with regular literary and music events; at €700 a night, though, it’s not cheap. More humble yet still lovely is the

<a>Freustil</a> in Binz is one of the region’s top restaurants, with contemporary seasonal dishes served as multi-course menus.
<h2>Spreewald and the lakes, Brandenburg</h2>
<a>Schorfheide nature reserve</a> (see below) plus many more castles, manor houses and parks.
<a>Brandenburg</a> is mostly flat and fairly forested, but its watery charms are its greatest strength, with many of the 3,000 or so lakes offering all kinds of water sports and leisure boat rentals. The
<a>Ruppiner Seenland</a> in the north-west has charming towns like Rheinsberg, with its stately, art-filled
<a>palace</a> on the banks of the Grienericksee; Kremmen, with its picturesque half-timbered houses; and Oranienburg, a former royal town on the banks of the Havel (and home to Brandenburg’s oldest baroque palace). To the north-east is the
<a>Schorfheide</a> reserve, one of the largest closed forest areas in Germany, with plenty of hiking and cycling opportunities, the striking Chorin monastery and sparkling Werbellin lake. South of Berlin, the photogenic wetlands, forests and canals of the

<p>I’m one of a group of seven riders on the Haute Route, a week-long, 250km off-road adventure from Chamonix to Zermatt, in the charge of local guides Adrià and Vince.</p>
<p>A final ascent takes us to the Chalet des Alpes beneath Dent de Nendaz, and good news from Adrià: “The weather will be better tomorrow”.</p>
<p>After lunch another long climb ends the shortest day of the trip at a traditional Alpine auberge, which is also home to the region’s infamous “fighting cows” which lock horns to establish a hierarchy within the herd.</p>
<p>On day three we get our first views of the Matterhorn, thrusting up into a cobalt blue sky as we ride across sunny Alpine pastures to a shady forest descent with so many hairpins I lose count.</p>
<p>The tough climb takes us to Col de Torrent, followed by a dusty downhill past the improbably turquoise waters of Lac de Moiry to chocolate-box pretty Grimentz.</p>
<p>By now our group is a well-oiled machine, bikes, equipment and bodies working in relative harmony, so the following morning’s superlative descent through sun-dappled forest all the way to Sierre is a sheer joy.</p>
<p>After seven days on the bike, it will be strange not to be riding tomorrow – but then Adrià points out that we won’t be transferring back to Chamonix until the afternoon, so if we like we can hit the bike trails above Zermatt the following morning.</p>
<p>Why not? After all, we’re on e-bikes, it’ll be easy.</p>
<p>The wind sharpens, the rain hardens and a spiteful mist blows in from the Celtic Sea, coating Kilfarrasy strand in a cold, grey miasma.</p>
<a>Sea Gardener</a>, an authority on the subject who exudes infectious enthusiasm, it’s summer, so the rain is merely cold as opposed to freezing, and like many others in Ireland we seek a new appreciation of the sea.
<p>The growing popularity of year-round sea swimming predates Covid-19 but Ireland’s lockdowns – some of the <a>longest and strictest in Europe</a> – made it a boom.</p>
<a>beach to buoy</a>. The tourism agency
<a>Failte Ireland</a> is to install all-weather changing facilities at 22 locations around Ireland. Bathing spots once populated by a few solitary “hardies” teem with newbies, many sporting, oh the horror, fleece-lined hooded robes that
<a>polarise aesthetic opinion</a>.
<p>The term wild swimming is also divisive. I side with the eye-rollers who consider it pretentious. But recent forays to various spots around Ireland reminded me that open water can bring surprises.</p>
<a>Hotel Kilkenny</a>’s pool and shaded terrace offered respite, as did the stone cellars of Kilkenny Castle, but the best refuge was the Weir, a woodland swimming spot on the River Nore.
<a>Tower Hotel</a>, which has a heated pool, great restaurant and is a stone’s throw from shops and attractions.
<a>hub of wonderful museums</a> – devoted to Vikings, medieval and Georgian eras, silversmithing and timekeeping – during glorious sunshine and huddling on beaches, wondering why we didn’t bring extra fleeces, amid darkness at noon.
<a>Copper Coast</a>. We came prepared for rain. Wellies, aqua shoes, anoraks, a pencil for taking ink-free notes on seaweed foraging. We didn’t anticipate simultaneous horizontal, vertical and diagonal rain amid a billowing mist that turned the world grey.
<a> book</a> on foraging. Chefs are among the keenest pupils. There are more than 600 types of seaweed in Ireland and none are poisonous.
<p>“There are many edible varieties,” says Thomas, “but chanterelles are the best. With a bit of luck, we might find some – not here though. Let’s concentrate on filling Helena’s shopping list – did you find any juniper berries?”</p>
<p>Another hour of paddling and we reach the camp where Helena is already getting started on dinner. I help mix dough for flatbreads that we cook in a big skillet.</p>
<p>The days go by all too fast. I camp on an elevated patch of soft meadow with a fine view. At night there’s no artificial light and the only sound is the gentle slap of waves on the granite boulders below.</p>
<p>Getting thereIt’s a long rail journey from the UK, but thoroughly enjoyable. Booking well in advance keeps costs down. Head to Hamburg (from about £100 return) for an overnight stop, then head for Norrköpping via Copenhagen (from £50).</p>
<p>“Trust your shoes,” Emily said, as the track rollercoastered along. As a bog-standard road runner, I was more worried about a perilous slip into the valley below.</p>
<p>And with the Alpine air whooshing into my lungs, we hit the trail again. I got it now. I was converted.</p>

<p>Stella McCartney took a near £2.7m salary from her fashion company last year, up more than £220,000 on the year before, while the business claimed almost £850,000 in support from the government’s furlough scheme.</p>
<p>The accounts show McCartney’s label, in which she <a>sold a minority stake</a> to the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in 2019, said it was dependent on additional funds being provided by its new shareholder in order to remain a going concern.</p>
<p>LVMH, which owns a suite of high-end brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, had already provided additional loans of £26.3m last year, taking its total lending to the group to just over £66m.</p>
<p>LVMH bought into McCartney’s label in 2019 just over a year after she ended her 17-year business partnership with its rival conglomerate Kering, and <a>bought back its 50% stake</a> in her brand.</p>
<p>“In common with all companies within our sector, we are currently dealing with one of the most challenging periods faced by a generation, and are conducting a review in order to adapt our business to the changing economics of our industry.</p>

<a> skinny jeans</a>, the return of the 20-year-old staple made famous by Paris Hilton, Destiny’s Child and Britney Spears has given Twitter commentators cause for concern.
<p>“I think my biggest fear would probably have to be low-rise jeans coming back in style,” wrote<a> one</a>. While another tongue-in-cheek user<a> wrote</a>: “What’s Biden’s plan to stop low-rise jeans from coming back?”</p>
<p>Despite their popularity on <a>TikTok</a> – videos with the hashtag #lowrisejeans have been viewed 34m times on the app) – users are railing against the garment for how it excluded people in the Noughties.</p>
<a> Collin McCarthy </a>“(because when) low-rise pants were popular...your body was the fashion...you weren’t showing off what you were wearing, you were showing off your stomach.”
<p>While user<a> Jessica Blair</a> points out, the 2000s were not good for different body shapes. “Clothing options for plus-sized people in the early 2000s were virtually non-existent, thereby completely excluding fat people from fashion.”</p>
<p>The return of low-rise jeans is part of a Y2K fashion renaissance, which includes cutout tops, tank tops and oval sunglasses. The trend forecaster Giulia Ceriani calls it “future vintage”, underlining its ironic detachment from time.</p>
<p>“It’s a mix of fantasy, tech, art and gaming that looks like an attempt to defer when to deal with reality,” she says. “It’s grounded in the need to escape from any exact definition of the present.”</p>
<p>Geraldine Wharry, another trend forecaster, adds: “I think the Y2K trend points to a time pre-social media and pre-economic crisis that still bred a certain kind of innocence that feels a bit lost now.”</p>
<p>“Some people were not ready, but others were excited by the prospect of the low rise jean again,” he says. “In the end, I suppose, you let the wearer decide how high their rise should be.” </p>
<p>With stay-at-home restrictions on the rise and England heading into its second lockdown, there is a surprising renaissance taking place in fashion and culture: disco.</p>

<h2>Five last-minute bottles</h2>
<p>£4.99 Averys, Laithwaites.</p>
<p>One of the best alcohol-free fizzes I’ve ever tasted. Off-dry, but pleasantly so, and a bit like a sparkling riesling.</p>
<p>Chiroubles Beaujolais Cru 2019</p>
<p>£10 selected Co-ops, 13.5%.</p>
<p>Bright, fresh and deliciously fruity: perfect for the turkey sarnies.</p>
<p>A useful, very cheap and surprisingly drinkable red that you can cook with, mull or take to a party.</p>
<p>Winemaster’s Lot Vacqueyras Blanc 2020</p>
<p>A richly textured, savoury white that you could drink with the turkey or roast pork. Brilliant value, too, and a good bottle to gift.</p>
<p>Pillitteri Vidal Icewine 2018,</p>
<p>£13.99 a half-bottle Lidl, 10.5%.</p>
<p>Wonderfully lush, gloriously sweet Canadian ice wine that would make a great gift (it comes in a neat box, too). More for sipping on its own than with a dessert.</p>
<p>For the blood orange Campari250ml Campari 1 blood orange</p>
<p>For the drink15ml blood orange Campari (see above and method)125ml prosecco1 twist blood orange zest</p>
<p>Measure the Campari into a suitably sized jar or plastic box with a lid. Cut the blood orange, skin and all, into eight wedges, then immerse in the Campari, seal and put in the fridge overnight to infuse.</p>
<p>Next day, fine strain into a jug, then pour into a clean jar, seal and store in the fridge, where it will keep for at least three days.</p>
<p>To make the drink, pour a measure of blood orange Campari into a champagne flute, top with prosecco and stir gently. Garnish with a strip of blood orange zest, and serve.</p>

<a>Sainsbury’s</a>), or, even better, the apple-snow light fluffiness of the Languedoc’s Antech Blanquette de Limoux Méthode Ancestrale NV (£10,
<a>Marks Spencer’s</a> Cava Prestige Brut NV (£10) is a wine of real depth and character, while Jansz Premium Cuvée NV is a bright, toasty example of the pristine Tasmanian fizz style at a very good 20%-off price (£14.39 until 2 January,
<p>Most of the drinks I turn to as a calmer mood takes over from the jangly, tinselly brightness of Christmas Day have benefited from mastery of the mellowing effects of ageing alcohol, for various lengths of time, in oak barrels of various sizes.</p>
