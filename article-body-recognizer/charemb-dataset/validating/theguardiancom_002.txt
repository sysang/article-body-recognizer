<a>said</a> a petition filed in district court in Harris county, Texas, sued Scott, organiser ScoreMore and Live Nation for an alleged “motivation for profit at the expense of concertgoers’ health and safety” and the “encouragement of violence”.
<p>The injured concertgoer who filed the suit reportedly called the crush a “predictable and preventable tragedy”. Scott, ScoreMore and Live Nation did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Kylie Jenner, Scott’s partner, insisted in an Instagram post: “I want to make it clear we weren’t aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing.”</p>
<p>Lina Hildago, the Harris county judge, called for an “objective, independent” investigation and said: “When we read these ages – 14, 16, 21, 21, 23, 23, 27 – it just breaks your heart.”</p>
<p>Niaara Goods, 28, of New York, said the crowd surged as a timer clicked down to the start of Scott’s performance.</p>
<p>It was the highest number of accidental deaths at an official US concert venue since the Station nightclub fire, which killed 100 in Rhode Island in 2003.</p>
<p>In a statement, organisers said: “Our hearts are with the Astroworld festival family tonight, especially those we lost and their loved ones.”</p>

<p>Leading praise from the US and around the world, Joe Biden hailed “a dear friend and patriot of unmatched honor and dignity” on behalf of himself and the first lady, Jill Biden.</p>
<p>Biden went on to talk about Powell’s milestone as the first Black US secretary of state.</p>
<a>unexpected </a>death, from complications related to Covid-19, which he contracted while being treated for cancer.
<p>Blinken added that Powell had been beloved at the state department because he had trusted officials and empowered them.</p>
<p>“He didn’t bother with formalities or hierarchy, he wanted to hear from everyone,” he said.</p>
<p>“He believed that America could and should lead with confidence and humility. That the world was safer when the United States was engaged and its allies and partners united.”</p>
<p>Kamala Harris, <a>the first</a> female and first Black and south Asian US vice-president, said Powell was “an incredible American” who “served with dignity and grace”.</p>
<p>She praised Powell as an inspiration, as the first Black man in the US to rise to the high positions he achieved. She also said he was very supportive of Biden.</p>
<p>Austin’s comments echoed similar expressions of gratitude from Black politicians around the country.</p>
<p>Other public figures gave a more nuanced appreciation. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic voting rights activist in Georgia, commented that Powell had “led with integrity” and “defended democracy”.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a>he told the Guardian</a> that he wanted the CIA and Pentagon to explain why they had failed to alert him to the unreliability of one of the key Iraqi sources who gave rise to the flawed claims.</p>
<p>Colin Powell, the former US secretary of state who played a pivotal role in attempting to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has died from complications from Covid-19 aged 84, it was announced on Monday.</p>
<a>the first</a> female and first Black and south Asian US vice-president, said Powell was “an incredible American” who “served with dignity and grace” and she praised Powell as a trailblazing inspiration in “what he did and how he did it”.
<p>The invasion went ahead without UN authorisation. The following year the CIA’s own Iraq Study Group released a report that <a>concluded </a>that Hussein had destroyed the last of the country’s weapons of mass destruction a decade previously.</p>
<p>In a statement on Monday, Bush called Powell “a great public servant. He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom – twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad.”</p>
<p>In 2008, despite party rivalries, he <a>endorsed Barack Obama</a> for president and later became one of Donald Trump’s leading critics.</p>
<a>disgusted</a> by the insurrection of Trump supporters at the US Capitol that he no longer considered himself a Republican.
<a>told</a> the Washington Post. “He thought he was just not feeling quite right, and he went to the hospital.”
<p>Peggy Cifrino, Powell’s chief of staff, <a>told</a> CNN he also had Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>Freshman progressive Democratic New York congressman Jamaal Bowman tweeted that Powell was an inspiration to him “as a Black man just trying to figure out the world”.</p>

<p>Frequency: Famously rare.</p>
<p>Hey, I’m not unhappy! Maybe you have more in common with pandas than you thought. Researchers have posited that the notoriously low panda libido might be down to simple contentment.</p>
<p>Who can blame them? That sounds perfect. Well, the worry is that by staying in the same area, they aren’t going out to search for food or mates, which reduces their genetic diversity, which will eventually lead to their extinction.</p>
<p>So you’re saying that pandas prefer comfortable solitude to sex? Yes.</p>
<p>And it’s possible to be so comfortable that you might take down your entire species? Yes.</p>
<p>Am … am I a panda? If you are, I have to commend your ability to type so accurately with your great big paws.</p>
<p>Do scientists want to make pandas less comfortable? To some extent, yes. The researchers have found that the ideal level of comfort to keep the pandas alive is 80%.</p>
<p>Why 80%? Because then they are comfortable enough to thrive, but there’s still enough dissatisfaction to make them leave home, bump into a sexy panda stranger and get it on.</p>
<p>Great! Job sorted. Well, that’s only step one. Even if two pandas were to clap eyes on each other and instantly fall in love, it doesn’t mean that we would hear the pitter patter of tiny paws any time soon. Remember the story of Tian Tian?</p>
<p>Tian Tian? Yes, one of the UK’s only two giant pandas, leased to Edinburgh zoo a decade ago by the Bifengxia breeding centre in Sichuan, China. The lease runs out in December, and Tian Tian has failed to give birth.</p>
<p>God, that’s sad. Is it? Or is she just so happy that she has rejected sex as a concept?</p>
<p>There’s a moral here, isn’t there? Yes. It’s that it’s OK if personal contentment is more important to you than romantic love. And also that pandas are seemingly determined to make themselves extinct.</p>
<p>Do say: “Happy pandas don’t have sex.”</p>
<p>Don’t say: “Quick, someone invent Panda Instagram to make them all feel ugly and insecure.”</p>
<p>The ceremony at the Beauval zoo, south of Paris, was an important diplomatic moment, but the four-month-old male cub decided otherwise, making a growling sound and jumping towards Macron when she put her hand over a glass wall to pet the panda</p>

<p>Witnesses, meanwhile, said an explosion targeted a Taliban vehicle in the eastern provincial city of Jalalabad, and hospital officials said five people were killed in the second such deadly blast in as many days in the Islamic State stronghold.</p>
<p>On Friday the Taliban shut down the women’s affairs ministry, replacing it with a ministry for the “propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice” tasked with enforcing Islamic law.</p>
<p>On Sunday just over a dozen women staged a protest outside the ministry, holding up signs calling for the participation of women in public life. “A society in which women are not active is [sic] dead society,” one sign read.</p>
<p>“Why are they taking our rights?” said one of the protesters, 30-year-old Basira Tawana. “We are here for our rights and the rights of our daughters.”</p>
<p>“There are some areas that men can’t do it, we have to ask our female staff to fulfil their duties, there is no alternative for it,” he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, three explosions targeted Taliban vehicles in Jalalabad, killing three people and wounding 20, witnesses said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</p>

<a>The Church Forests of Ethiopia</a>.
<p> <time> Mon 8 Nov 2021 07.00 GMT </time> <time> Last modified on Tue 16 Nov 2021 10.11 GMT </time> </p>
<a>expansion of settlements and agriculture</a> is slowly thinning the forest edge by cattle and plough.
<p>Over the past century, 90% of Ethiopia’s forests have been lost. In Amhara province, the only remaining native forests are those that surround the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church buildings.</p>
<p>The symbol of the tree is at the heart of the Christian story, from the tree of life standing in the Garden of Eden in Genesis to its redemptive role in Revelation, bridging the river of life and bearing fruit for the healing of nations.</p>
<p>Yet, as unique as they are, these forest churches are not merely a localised cultural novelty: Ethiopia’s grassroots and spiritually motivated conservation efforts sit within a global context of efforts to resolve our ecological crises.</p>
<blockquote> <p>The <a>Church Forests of Ethiopia</a>, by Kieran Dodds, is available from 15 November.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In a remote corner of the rolling plains that stretch across eastern Colombia from the foothills of the Andes to the Venezuelan frontier, a cluster of grain silos juts up against the pristine blue sky.</p>
<p>The Mennonite diaspora began fleeing their homelands in northern Europe – across Holland, Switzerland and Germany – in the 16th century, to escape persecution from the Catholic church.</p>
<p>Many ended up in Russia, before migrating to the prairies of the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, there are Mennonite communities across Africa and the Americas which dwarf those that remained in Europe.</p>
<a>cartel gunmen murdered six children and three women from a Mormon community</a>, which like the Mennonites had settled in the country in the 19th century.
<p>Colombia’s 2016 peace process, which put an end to five decades of civil war, offered the Mennonites a way to carve out a new foothold in South America.</p>
<p>“The blessing of the lord makes you rich without effort,” reads an inscription in German on the wall of one of the colony’s several churches that also doubles as a school.</p>
<p>But the growth of the settlement has not come without hard work – and plenty of investment: the Mennonites have invested more than $20m through two newly incorporated local companies.</p>
<p>“Here you need to throw a lot of money at the land before you gain something,” said Abram Loewen, a rice farmer. Like other senior members of the community, he employs other Mennonites who have been unable to get their own crops going.</p>
<p>Liviney’s gleaming pickup trucks and air-conditioned homes contrast starkly with the poverty in surrounding region, which had long been neglected by the Colombian government.</p>
<p>And unlike the rough dirt trails in neighbouring villages, Liviney’s roads are paved with fine red gravel and flanked by brand-new electricity pylons and cables.</p>
<p>Abram Fehr, tall and with a pair of Arctic-blue eyes, is a pastor and also the proprietor the only hotel in town, which, before the pandemic, received Mennonite visitors from as far as Mexico, Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina looking to buy land.</p>
<p>Argentine Mennonites are currently the biggest buyers, said Fehr, as they are keen to escape what they see as government “meddling” in the upbringing of their children.</p>
<p>In recent decades, similar tensions caused a wave of Mennonite migrants to leave Canada – “practically a communist state”, scoffed Fehr.</p>
<p>The Mennonites have little contact with their neighbours, who refer to them as “the Germans” and comment on their “weird accents”.</p>
<p>Some locals complain about the Mennonites’ intensive farming practices, and the community’s rapid expansion has also brought them into conflict with the indigenous Sikuani people, after the Mennonites moved on to land claimed by the tribe.</p>
<p>Further friction has been caused by the settlers’ aggressive logging – a practice which for decades was banned by the Farc rebels.</p>
<p>“While the Mennonites get on well with the local population, buying products in nearby towns and visiting restaurants and boosting our economy, there are some environmental issues,” one local government official said diplomatically.</p>
<p>When asked about the climate crisis, which is heightened by worldwide deforestation, Ramon Dick, one of Liviney’s leaders, was fatalistic.</p>
<p>After a minute’s silence for Remembrance Day, the match kicks off. With just six minutes on the clock, Wolves keeper Shan Turner is beaten by a fantastic diving header from Megan Cann to give the home side the lead.</p>
<p>After going behind, Wolves step up a gear creating a number of chances but are kept at bay by the woodwork, quality keeping by Stacey Garnham and sterling work by the Sporting Khalsa defence.</p>
<p>The visitors break through with two goals in first-half stoppage time from Tammi George (below left) and Amber Hughes (below right) to go into the break 2-1 up.</p>
<p>Hughes continues to cause the Sporting Khalsa defence problems in the second half, scoring in the 56th minute and completing her hat-trick seven minutes later.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Stacey Garnham is voted Sporting Khalsa’s player of the match by the manager, Kelly Williams.</p>

<p>The celebrated woman of letters Joan Didion has died at the age of 87. The author and journalist made a profound mark on 20th and 21st century literature with her writing on culture, politics and the vagaries of human life.</p>
<p>Her debut essay collection, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, captured the hazy disorder of a changing US in the 60s, and became a touchstone in the emerging New Journalism movement.</p>
<p>Didion leaves behind a legacy that includes five novels, six screenplays and 14 works of nonfiction – one of which, The Year of Magical Thinking, she turned into a play.</p>
<p>Starting her career after winning an essay competition at Vogue, she was also feted as a style icon, a luminary of California cool.</p>
<p>A writer’s writer, a cult figure of fashion, an intellect gazing unflinchingly at what most interested and troubled her – what do Joan Didion and her work mean to you? We’d love you to tell us in the comments.</p>

<p>If the white Corvette drives people to finding those sentences, excellent. But I so hope they know that there’s much more to her than telling ourselves stories in order to live.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear that we tell ourselves stories in order to live, I wonder if the Cult of Joan is too many Barbaras, telling themselves stories.</p>
<ul> <li>The Last Love Song: A Biography of Joan Didion (St Martin’s Press) is published on 25 August </li> </ul>
<p>The cause of death was Parkinson’s disease, according to Paul Bogaards, an executive at Didion’s publisher Knopf.</p>
<p>Known for her pioneering blend of the personal and the political in her journalism and essays, <a>Didion became a household name</a> with her writing on US society.</p>
<p>Didion spent her later years in New York, but she was shaped by her native state of California, which she called “a hologram that dematerialises as I drive through it”.</p>
<p>Author <a>Susan Orlean</a> <a>called</a> Didion “my idol and inspiration”.</p>
<p>“Didion was one of the country’s most trenchant writers and astute observers,” Penguin Random House and its imprint Knopf said in a statement.</p>
<a>Dan Wakefield called Didion</a> “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation”.
<a>revered as a symbol of cool</a>; at the age of 80, she became the face of French fashion house Céline.

<p>The smells of damp wood, sea air, tobacco and maybe just a soupçon of human sweat will waft through a gallery for an exhibition telling the hidden stories of what was <a>once the world’s busiest port</a>.</p>
<p>Details have been announced for a show that draws on the enormous, largely unknown archive of the <a>Port of London authority</a> (PLA).</p>
<p>The curator, Claire Dobbin, also wants visitors to experience the smells workers would have inhaled day in, day out – as she herself has been doing.</p>
<p>“Sizewise it is quite vast,” said Dobbin. “The problem has been where to start and then … at some point you need to stop. I think we have done more than scratch the surface and we have found lots of exciting stories to tell.”</p>
<p>Objects going on display include sandals seized in the 1870s, which have hollowed out soles to smuggle opium, and a 1950s diver’s helmet and air pump used by someone clearing riverbeds.</p>
<a>it removed the statue of Robert Milligan</a>, a prominent British slave trader, which had “stood uncomfortably” outside the museum for a long time.
<p>In the port of London show it will exhibit a document commemorating the unveiling of the statue to serve “as a reminder of the full truth behind the economic prosperity that made the building of West India Docks possible”.</p>
<p>London remains the UK’s busiest port and the exhibition will tell its story from the end of the 18th century to the creation of the London Gateway “mega port” at Thurrock in the Thames Estuary.</p>
<p>Dobbin said it had been a thrill to go through the archive. “It has been a lot of fun and a real privilege to have access to such a meticulous and eclectic collection.”</p>
<p>One aim of the exhibition was to give “a behind-the-scenes view of things which, actually, many people don’t know much about.”</p>
<p>It will also include examples of the countless samples which were taken of goods coming in to London. One is a pot of dehydrated meat from the 1940s: “We haven’t opened it,” said Dobbin.</p>
<p>Another is a pot of ambergris, which was highly prized and used in perfumes. Dobbin explained: “It is essentially whale poop.”</p>
<p>Port City is at the <a>Museum of London Docklands</a>, 22 October-8 May.</p>

<p>People often get radical haircuts in response to life-changing events, such as a breakup or the loss of a loved one. I got mine because I wanted to embrace how I felt as a butch lesbian.</p>
<p>I’ve been gender non-conforming for as long as I can remember. Around the age of four, I staged a protest against wearing a dress at Christmas. I was horrified, one birthday, to be given a Barbie.</p>
<p>I realised I liked girls by the time I was 13. For the next few years, I hated myself. I felt sordid, ashamed and wrong: I had been told that people like me were wrong. I tried praying and dating boys. But I couldn’t change who I was.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2011, when I was 17, I gathered up the courage to come out as a lesbian by having my hair cut: a fierce short back and sides with a quiff on top. </p>
<p>I felt completely alone, trapped in a nightmare from which I couldn’t wake up. </p>
<p>I actually came out about a year later: I was with my first girlfriend and couldn’t hide our relationship. My friends and most of my family got behind me. It took time, but my mum is now one of my biggest supporters.</p>
<a>2012 pompadour of Alex Turner</a>, lead singer of the Arctic Monkeys.
<a>Pokémon</a> – in that I had evolved into my final form. (I fall into the “soft butch” sub-category: ie, I’m mostly “masculine”, but sometimes buy from the women’s section and will consider the odd spa day.)
<p>Pressuring people who don’t want to conform to gender stereotypes doesn’t change them. It damages them. My haircut helped to liberate me. I just wish I had felt able to do it years ago.</p>
<p>Then a month or two later, I got very sick. I caught german measles (rubella) and almost died. I ended up packed in an ice bed in an isolation ward in the local hospital. And when I came home, my hair went pretty thin.</p>
<p>Some have called me the UK’s longest-serving barber, but I’m sure there’s somebody older who has done the job for longer. I’d say I’m one of the oldest barbers in Worcestershire.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m going to change much in retirement, and I certainly don’t plan on getting a haircut. It’ll probably fall out in the next few years anyway. </p>

<p>It may be that, as philosophy and politics falter, it will again be up to hairdressers to provide clues to what women often know and men less easily grasp: that among exterior clues to the interior life, hair can be the most instructive.</p>
<p>The images in the book document hairstyles in profile and without makeup, taken on an iPhone, and later posted online. They are an impression, in a sense, of what was – and still is – happening, in a vulnerable time.</p>
<a>less gendered</a>. “Masculine and feminine seem kind of old now, so I try to look at their profile, see what fits. It’s more fluid. I’ve always been interested in an ambiguous kind of sexuality, and always wanted hair to be slightly questionable.”
<p>Fashion, of course, has taken its share of recent criticism for lapses in approach and sensitivity to issues of social justice. “There’s a new awareness to how people feel or have felt in the past, and rightfully so,” he says.</p>
<p>Instagram is affecting the changes, in part because visual information is being posted and absorbed, as Palau says, all day long. “Beauty trends are coming into our home, or into our hand, all the time.”</p>
<p>It’s more like a bad hair month, actually, ever since I washed my new wig. I have alopecia and one major advantage of the condition is that I have dodged hair styling for 20 years. Once cut, my wig goes on my head every morning and just behaves.</p>

<p>“We’re talking about suicide here, not spots or whether someone should dye their hair blonde,” he says. “How could we possibly suggest we’re a caring business if we look at that and don’t care?”</p>
<a>internal documents</a> were leaked by
<a>Frances Haugen</a>, a former product manager at the social media company. Among the most damaging was the allegation that it knew
<a>its products were damaging teenagers’ mental health</a>. The company has mounted a vigorous defence, stating: “To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.”
<p>If that is the case shouldn’t Lush stay social and provide a positive voice for young fans who get an ego boost from environmentally friendly shampoos and makeup? “Yes, but I’m not willing to do it at the risk of someone’s life,” he says.</p>
<p>That studio did not do much for her, giving her a walk-on in Life With Father (1947) and casting her as the sweet wife of the composer Dennis Morgan in the soppy biopic My Wild Irish Rose (1947), so she soon moved over to MGM.</p>
<p>There she was given roles as straight woman to another redhead, the slapstick comic Red Skelton, in two comedies, A Southern Yankee (1948) and Watch the Birdie (1950), that were both reworkings of better Buster Keaton material.</p>

<p>The celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury’s company has repaid £3.2m in furlough money after sales soared during the pandemic as shoppers switched to buying online.</p>
<p>Accounts filed at Companies House also reveal that Tilbury <a>sold her business</a> for £1.3bn – considerably more than the up to £1bn previously thought – to the Spanish cosmetics and fragrance group Puig last year.</p>
<p>The scale of the deal means that Tilbury, who personally held a controlling stake in the business of between 50% and 75%, is likely to have received hundreds of millions from the takeover of the company in which she remains a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>The London-born makeup artist, who grew up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, also received a consultancy fee of £1.55m from one of the group’s parent companies, Islestarr Holdings, last year, according to Companies House filings.</p>
<p>Global sales for Charlotte Tilbury Limited Group rose 11.3% to £258.5m in the year to 31 December 2020, according to figures released by the company, driven by strong performances in key markets including the UK, mainland Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Alongside Tilbury’s business, Barcelona-based Puig owns brands including Paco Rabanne, Jean Paul Gaultier and Nina Ricci.</p>

<p>The hackA natural powder made from household items to reduce friction, absorb perspiration and prevent chafing on the body.</p>
<a>dusting powders</a> or sweat-wicking creams, which draw moisture away from the body, and look instead in our kitchen cupboards.
<a>Studies suggest overwhelmingly that collagen is safe</a>, and the punt paid off with antioxidant skincare – now broadly endorsed by cosmetic dermatologists – after all.
<a>clinically proven to inhibit collagen’s breakdown</a> and to stimulate its further production.
<p>So if you’re playing the long game with oral collagen, my advice is to avoid the big-ticket supplements. Price is no indicator of quality and gambling is only harmless if losing won’t hurt.</p>
<p>The hackWith its bacteria-killing properties, can plain old saltwater really get rid of spots?</p>
<p>The verdict I know first-hand that chronic skin conditions can feel desperate, and you’ll try anything to fix them. But my advice? Speak to your doctor first. And for occasional spots? Drying lotions are still my go-to.</p>
<p>The hack<a>Using frozen cucumber</a> to reduce dark circles, brighten skin and fight blemishes.</p>
<p>The promisePlacing cucumber slices on your eyes is <a>an old trick to reduce puffiness,</a> but the newest craze involves rubbing large hunks of frozen cucumber into your skin to get the same results as skincare and facial massagers.</p>
<a>a facial roller by Nurse Jamie</a>). The cold feels invigorating and it’s certainly depuffing, but any cool compress can help shrink blood vessels, which can cause dark circles.
<p>A <a>homemade deodorant </a>using ingredients you might have in the house – and which works. </p>
<p><a>Statistics</a> say we’re wearing less deodorant – thanks partly to lockdown and partly to more <a>pared-back beauty routines</a>. Is a DIY deodorant the next logical step? </p>
<a>arrowroot</a>, to soak up moisture, and
<p>I didn’t expect miracles. But if I can be smelled in a field of punks, something has gone awry.</p>
<p>The hackUsing <a>coffee grounds to make a face scrub</a> that gives you baby-soft skin – and eco brownie points.</p>
<p>The promiseIn theory, the grounds lift dead cells from the skin to brighten it, while the <a>caffeine boosts the circulation</a>. But does turning household waste into a skin-blitzing scrub actually work?</p>
<a>a “mechanical” exfoliator</a> to slough off dead skin cells. But the downsides are multiple: 1) the grounds have jagged edges that
<a>can create micro tears in the skin</a> and cause irritation; 2)
<a>coffee grounds can clog water pipes</a>; and 3) it’s beyond messy.
<a>One recipe suggests mixing the coffee with honey</a> (
<a>for its antibacterial properties</a>) into a thick exfoliating paste. I applied the gloop to my face and worked it in, which was harder than you’d think. My skin was smoother but it also felt super dry.
<p>The verdictFace scrubs have a certain teen nostalgia, granted, but save the coffee scrub for the thicker skin on your body – the skin on our faces is way too delicate. And be sure to consider your plumbing first.</p>
<a>targeting of activists by undercover police officers</a> to preventing the extinction of hen harriers.
<p>“When it gets to a point that our customers’ wellbeing is being put in jeopardy because of the channels on which we are trying to connect with them, then something doesn’t sit right for us,” Constantine said.</p>
<a>faced heavy criticism </a>for its stance on trans issues, with critics accusing it of seeking to limit trans people’s rights. The retailer ended up issuing a grovelling
<a>ethical supply chain</a>, also came under fire for poor working conditions in the chain’s
<a>underpaid workers</a> for nearly a decade.
<p>Lush said it hoped the platforms would introduce strong best practice guidelines, and that <a>new laws </a>would be passed to protect users.</p>
<p>Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, leaked <a>tens of thousands of internal company documents</a> after becoming frustrated that it was not publicly acknowledging the harm its platforms could cause.</p>
<a>knew its products were damaging teenagers’ mental health</a>, were fomenting ethnic violence in countries such as Ethiopia and were failing to curb misinformation before the 6 January Washington riots.
<a>Facebook</a> said it continued to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content, adding: “To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.”
<a>a blogpost by its head of public policy, Karina Newton</a>, that said the report had “focused on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light”.
<p>The hack Using <a>banana peel</a> to relieve that most persistent beauty bugbear: dark circles (or periorbital dark circles, if we’re being fancy) under the eyes.</p>
<p>The promise An old trick revivied on <a>TikTok</a> makes an under-eye mask from banana peel.</p>
<a>salicylic acid in the banana skin</a> could lighten my dark circles, after a week, and three tries, I can see no difference at all. I try using just the peel itself, cut into strips and placed directly under my eyes. Instead, I end up with a
<a>“phloem bundle”</a> (a banana string) stuck in my eyelashes.
<p>The verdict If you have a banana skin handy, why not? But realistically, using a retinol-based eye cream and a concealer such as <a>Monica Blunder’s Beauty Blunder Cover</a> (£45) – and seeing a specialist if you’re concerned – is the way to go.</p>
<p>The hackLess a TikTok trend and more a spot of DIY Christmas cheer – but how easy is it to make a bath bomb at home?</p>
