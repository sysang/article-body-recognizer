<p>Garner has expressed a desire to step down as chief executive but on Friday said there was no update on succession plans.</p>
<p>“I remain entirely focused on leading Nationwide and will until the very last second,” he said.</p>
<p>House sales tumbled by more than half during the first few weeks after the end of the extended stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, leading to the quietest October property market for almost a decade.</p>
<p>HM Revenue and Customs, <a>which published the new data</a>, said UK house sales in October were also 28% lower than in the same month last year.</p>
<p>While last month was the slowest October since 2012, according to HMRC, other measures of the market – in particular, the various house price surveys – depict a market continuing to fire on all cylinders.</p>
<a>rose for a fourth month running</a> in October, adding 0.9% to the average cost of a home and taking the typical figure above £270,000 for the first time on its measure. The rival lender Nationwide said property values
<a>increased by 0.7% in October</a>, which meant the price of the average property had gone up by more than £30,000 since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020.
<p>The figures prompted many commentators to predict that the market was heading for a winter “hibernation”.</p>
<a>the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said</a> that “a lack of new properties being listed for sale continues to drive house prices up”.
<p>It added that despite a rise in the number of new buyer inquiries, estate agents currently only had 37 properties on their books on average.</p>
<p>The property website Zoopla also said the annual rate of UK house price growth was running at 6.9% – up from 3.5% in the same month last year – and that the average cost of a home had risen by £15,500 over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The website’s UK data for October comes days after official figures showed that house sales <a>tumbled by more than half</a> in the weeks immediately after the end of the stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Zoopla said: “2021’s property market will be defined by the pandemic-led re-evaluation of the home, with many households compelled to make a move.”</p>
<a>rose for a fourth month running</a> in October, adding 0.9% to the average cost of a home. The rival lender Nationwide said property values
<a>increased by 0.7% in October</a>.
<p>However, interest rate rises – the first is expected next month – and rising inflation could put a brake on the market.</p>
<p>House prices in the UK continued their upwards climb in November, reaching double-digit growth again as demand remained strong after the end of the stamp duty holiday and the furlough job support scheme.</p>
<p>House prices have risen to almost 15% above levels seen in March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic first struck the UK, Nationwide said.</p>
<a>quietest for almost a decade</a>, according to data from
<a>HM Revenue and Customs</a>, as house sales were 28% lower in October than a year earlier after a record surge in activity earlier in 2021.
<p>Recent figures from the <a>Bank of England</a> showed the number of mortgages approved for UK house purchases fell in October to the <a>lowest level in 16 months</a>.</p>
<p>However, the outlook remained uncertain, he said. “It is unclear what impact the new Omicron variant will have on the wider economy.”</p>
<p>Gardner added that the increase in the cost of living was having an impact on consumer sentiment, while the housing market might be cooled further by the prospect of a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>“Admittedly, the link between variations in mortgage rates and changes in house prices isn’t stable.” </p>
<p>The Omicron variant could also cool the property market, by making some homeowners decide to wait before putting their property up for sale.</p>
<p>“The number of homes for sale coming on to the market is slowing, which is nudging prices steadily upwards,” said Jonathan Hopper, the chief executive of Garrington <a>Property</a> Finders.</p>

<li>Latest: FTSE 100 reshuffle sees Darktrace and Johnson Matthey drop out</li>
<h2>Darktrace and Johnson Matthey to leave FTSE 100 in reshuffle</h2>
<p>Cyber-security firm Darktrace and science and chemicals company Johnson Matthey are being relegated out of the FTSE 100 index of leading shares.</p>
<p>Darktrace and Johnson Matthey are being shuffled into the FTSE 250 index of smaller companies, in a rebalancing based on last night’s closing share prices.</p>
<p>Johnson Matthey’s value tumbled after it announced last month it was <a>pulling out of the electric vehicle battery business</a>.</p>
<p>Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explained that Darktace could yet return to the FTSE 100.</p>
<p>While for Johnson Matthey, investors are clearly worried about its strategy for the future, she explained.</p>
<p>Although catalytic converters won’t be rendered obsolete immediately, the clock is ticking and as the transition to electric vehicles speeds up, Johnson Matthey will need to quickly find a new sense of direction.’’</p>
<p>Among smaller companies, online electricals retailer AO World and Wagamama’s owner Restaurant Group are dropping out of the FTSE 250.</p>
<h2>FTSE 100 posts biggest one-day jump since July</h2>
<p>With risk appetite returning to the City, the FTSE 100 index has closed 109 points higher at 7169 points.</p>
<p>That’s a surge of 1.5% today, its biggest one-day rise since 21st July as worries about the Omicron variant recede.</p>
<p>Gains in banks, oil and mining stocks led the index higher, along with travel companies such as IAG (+3.4%).</p>
<a>invest billions more in biomass</a>.
<p>A strong start to December, but it still leaves the FTSE 100 index around 140 points, or 2%, below its levels last Thursday - ahead of Friday’s heavy selloff.</p>
<p>Other European stock markets also had a strong day, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 rising 1.7%, and Germany and France up around 2.4% each.</p>
<p>Danni Hewson AJ Bell financial analyst, explains that investors are hopeful that the Omicron variant won’t undermine the recovery. </p>
<p>Craig Erlam of OANDA points out that there is still significant uncertainty about Omicron, and the risk that America’s central bank ends its stimulus measures sooner. </p>
<h2>Travel stocks lead markets higher</h2>
<p>In London, British Airways parent company IAG is up 3% in late afternoon trading, with budget airlines easyJet up 5.4% and Wizz Air gaining nearly 7%.</p>
<p>Cruise operator Carnival are 4% higher, while hotel operator Whitbread have gained nearly 3%.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is ending the day strongly, up 91 points or 1.3% at 7151 points. </p>
<p>Industrial metals, such as copper, are also rebounding.</p>
<p>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says investors are hoping that Omicron will be more benign than initially feared:</p>
<p>The lack of appetite for co-ordinated travel restrictions amongst EU leaders may well also be helping on the margins with easyJet and Wizz Air also showing strong gains.</p>
<h2>Bank of England governor says Covid's economic impact still strong</h2>
<p>The economic impact from COVID-19 has faded since the start of the pandemic but still remains strong, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said today.</p>
<p>Asked how to assess news of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Bailey explained:</p>
<p>He was speaking at a question and answer session hosted by Britain’s Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which focused mostly on insurance regulation, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The owner of the Drax power station is expected to profit from Britain’s energy crisis until 2023 and will plough billions into doubling its production of wood pellets for burning by 2030 despite mounting opposition from environmentalists.</p>
<p>Drax will fund the expansion plans using its own cash as it <a>prepares to profit from record high energy market prices</a> in its long-term contracts over the next two years.</p>
<p>The Institute of Supply Management’s survey of US factories is also out, and it shows that the sector grew at a faster rate last month.</p>
<p>It also found that supply chain problems are constraining growth, as Markit’s PMI report a few minutes ago also showed.</p>
<p>The ISM reports that economic activity in the manufacturing sector grew in November, with the overall economy achieving an 18th consecutive month of growth. </p>
<p>Its manufacturing PMI rose to 61.1%, from 60.8% in October, with:</p>
<li>New Orders, Production and Employment Growing</li>
<li>Supplier Deliveries Slowing at a Slower Rate; Backlog Growing</li>
<li>Manufacturing Inventories Growing; Customers’ Inventories Too Low</li>
<li>Prices Increasing; Exports and Imports Growing </li>
<p>The ISM’s Timothy R. Fiore says:</p>
<p>The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment, with some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement. </p>
<p>All segments of the manufacturing economy are impacted by record-long raw materials and capital equipment lead times, continued shortages of critical lowest-tier materials, high commodity prices and difficulties in transporting products </p>
<p>It also found that almost all commodities became pricier last month....</p>
<h2>Supply chain bottlenecks hit US factories.</h2>
<p>It’s US manufacturing PMI has dropped to an 11-month low for November, with firms reporting that:</p>
<ul> <li>Output growth was subdued amid softer rise in new sales and supply shortages </li> <li>Job creation slowed due to reports of labor shortages </li> <li>Input costs rose att he fastest pace on record </li> </ul>
<p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said supply chain problems are hurting US factories, who are also seeing a slowdown in new orders.</p>
<p>While average selling price inflation eased as firms sought to win customers, the rate of input cost inflation hit a new high, hinting at a squeeze on margins </p>
<p>Reassuring words about vaccine efficacy, and a decent US jobs report, have lifted the market today, explains Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.</p>
<p>US stocks are rebounding on Wednesday after another steep selloff in the previous session. Omicron concerns and a surprisingly hawkish turn from the Fed sent stocks tumbling with the SP 500 closing 1.9% lower.</p>
<p>Today, the mood in the market has improved amid encouraging comments from the Israeli health minister and BioNTech who see the Pfizer vaccine offering protection against Omicron.</p>
<p><a>US ADP payrolls were also encouraging</a>, showing the continued recovery in the labour market. ADP private payrolls rose 534k, ahead of the 520k forecast but below October’s 571k.</p>
<h2>Wall Street opens higher</h2>
<p>Stocks in New York have opened higher, a day after worries about Omicron contributed to a sharp selloff.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies has jumped by 240 points, or 0.7%, at the open to 34,725 points.</p>
<p>The broader SP 500 index has risen by 1.1%, or 50 points, to 4,617, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index is nearly 1.2% higher.</p>
<p>Every sector is green, led by energy, materials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks.</p>
<p>Entertainment group Walt Disney (+2.2%) is leading the Dow risers, along with healthcare insurance firm UnitedHealth (+2%), American Express (+1.9%), construction equipment maker Caterpillar (+1.7%) and investment bank Goldman Sachs (+1.7%).</p>
<p>Turkey’s central bank staged an intervention to prop up the ailing lira today, after a series of controversial interest rate cuts sent the currency reeling to record lows.</p>
<p>Reuters has the details:</p>
<p>The volatile trade in low liquidity came after the emerging market currency logged its second-worst month ever in November, hammered by Erdogan’s endorsement of sharp monetary easing despite soaring inflation and widespread criticism.</p>
<p>The lira , which had earlier weakened as far as 13.87 to the U.S. currency, rebounded as far as 12.42 - a rally of more than 8% on the day. However, by 1256 GMT, it was just 0.5% firmer at 13.35.</p>
<p>“We have no doubt that [central bank] intervention will fail if the intention is to stabilize the currency, though it could provide some more two-way risk in the near term. In fact, the move worries us even more,” said Brown Brothers Harriman.</p>
<p>“Spending precious FX reserves suggests that the government is still holding the line in its economic policies, making the adjustment even more painful,” it said.</p>
<p>Turkey expert Paul McNamara, of asset manager GAM, shows how the lira initially rallied against the dollar, before dropping back:</p>
<h2>Strike at Clarks’ Somerset site ends after deal is reached</h2>
<p>Back in the UK, footwear company Clarks has reached an agreement with about 100 workers to end a two-month strike at its distribution centre in Somerset.</p>
<p>The deal with the Community union, which follows mediation with Acas, is understood to protect hourly pay for established workers and increase pay for new staff at the site.</p>
<p>Staff at the warehouse have been on strike since 4 October, saying the shoemaker had been seeking to cut their wages by almost 15% to £9.50 an hour by using controversial fire and rehire tactics.</p>
<p>The changes were implemented after Clarks <a>was taken over </a>by a Hong Kong-based private equity firm, LionRock Capital, and the billionaire former Chinese Olympian Li Ning in March.</p>
<p>The <a>deal pumped £100m in new cash</a> into the near 200-year-old British footwear company, which is still co-owned by the descendants of its founders – Cyrus and James Clark.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Community and Clarks said: </p>
<p>“We are pleased that a resolution has been reached that works in everybody’s interests, protects Community members’ livelihoods, and recognises their loyalty to Clarks.</p>
<p>“Following an indicative ballot of Community members it is confirmed that normal working has now resumed.”</p>
<p>The 536,000 increase in US private payrolls last month supports Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s comment yesterday that the Fed might wrap up its QE scheme earlier than planned, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.</p>
<p>But, he predicts jobs growth will ease back soon, as rising Delta infection rates in the Northeast and Midwest begin to weigh on demand a little. </p>
<h2>US company payrolls rise 534,000 in November</h2>
<p>American companies added over half a million more employees to their payrolls last month, as the labor market continued to recover.</p>
<p>Payroll operator ADP reports that private payrolls increased by 534,000 for November, ahead of estimates, but down on the 570,000 added in October.</p>
<p>Services firms added 424,000 jobs, including 136,000 at leisure and hospitality companies, 110,000 at professional/business services firms and 78,000 across trade, transportation and utilities.</p>
<p>Goods-producing sectors hired 110,000 staff, including 52,000 in construction and 50,000 in manufacturing.</p>
<p>It suggests the US jobs market was solid last month, in the face of rising inflation, supply problems, and fears that the pandemic could slow growth into the winter months if infections rise.</p>
<p>The official US government measure of employment, the Non-Farm Payroll report, is due on Friday, and expected to show around 550,000 jobs were created last month.</p>
<p>In the US, applications for a new mortgage fell sharply last week, as a jump in borrowing costs deterred people from refinancing.</p>
<p>Mortgage applications fell 7.2% week-on-week, driven by a 15% tumble in refinancing requests following a pick-up in mortgage rates.</p>
<p>Joel Kan, Mortgage Bankers Association’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, says:</p>
<blockquote> <div> <p>“Mortgage rates rose for the third week in a row, reducing the refinance incentive for many borrowers. Over the past three weeks, rates are up 15 basis points and refinance activity has declined over 18%.”</p> </div> </blockquote>
<p>Applications for a mortgage to buy a new property rose around 5%, though:</p>
<h2>Full story: UK house prices return to double-digit growth</h2>
<p>House prices in the UK continued their upwards climb in November, reaching double-digit growth again as demand remained strong after the end of the stamp duty holiday and the furlough job support scheme.</p>
<p>House prices have risen to almost 15% above levels seen in March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic first struck the UK, Nationwide said.</p>
<p>The continuing rising prices appear to be in part down to a reduction in the supply of houses available to buyers.</p>
<p>The October property market was the quietest for almost a decade, according to data from <a>HM Revenue and Customs</a>, as house sales were 28% lower in October than a year earlier after a record surge in activity earlier in 2021.</p>
<p>House prices rose for a fifth month by 1% in November and were 8.2% higher than the same time last year, when the average property cost 252,235. Both the monthly gain and the annual growth rate were the same increases as in October.</p>
<p>In London, annual house price inflation lagged at 1.1% last month, up slightly from October, but the average price of £521,129 is still much higher than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>The overall number of house sales has fallen back since the end of the stamp duty holiday and <a>reached a nine-year low in October</a>, according to data from HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, there is now greater uncertainty than has been the case for quite some time, with interest rates expected to rise to guard against further increases in inflation,” Galley said.</p>
<a>Bank of England</a>’s monetary policy chief, Ben Broadbent, has said
<a>inflation is likely to soar “comfortably” above 5% next spring</a> when the energy regulator, Ofgem, raises a price cap affecting millions of households.
<p>The “race for space” that became characteristic of the property market during the Covid pandemic could be starting to slow, according to Halifax.</p>
<p>As people shunned city centre work and life during lockdowns, and the government introduced a stamp duty holiday, demand for country living – or at least a spare room – grew.</p>
<p>In November, flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more.</p>
<a>England and Northern Ireland</a>, until the end of June homes costing up to £500,000 could change hands with no tax to be paid.
<p>Buyers paying more than that for a property could save £15,000 in duty – enough to persuade many to bring forward purchases, or to look in a slightly higher price bracket than they might have otherwise.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the stamp duty break, which was phased out over the summer and ended on 30 September, plus the reopening of some city centre offices, could have tipped demand towards flats.</p>
<p>There is evidence of an increase in demand from buyers. According to the property website Rightmove, in November last year detached homes were the most searched for, but last month flats took over.</p>
<p>“Flats are making a bit of a comeback now that post-furlough working and commuting patterns have been formalised for many, at least in the medium-term,” he said.</p>
<p>Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the market in flats may not purely be driven by those taking early steps on the housing ladder.</p>
<p>The £3tn windfall from soaring house prices in the past 20 years should be subject to a capital gains levy so that poorer households can be spared paying more in tax, a thinktank has urged.</p>
<a>increases in the value of main residences</a> in the UK as well as to sales of second homes, instead of increasing tax on income and profits.
<p>The thinktank admitted it would be a hard sell but said house prices had risen by 86% more than inflation in the past two decades and the gains had been “unearned, unequal and untaxed”.</p>
<p>Other capital gains attract tax rates of between 10% and 28%, and the benefits of the property boom had been disproportionately enjoyed by the better off, older people and those living in London, it added.</p>
<p>Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the £3tn capital gains on main residences represented one-fifth of all wealth in the UK.</p>
<p>None of the main political parties has indicated it would be willing to take the risk of angering homeowners, but Labour has been exploring the possibility of <a>wealth taxes on shareholders</a>.</p>
<a>£12bn the Treasury will get</a> from increasing national insurance contributions next April. Under the plan, property owners would be required to pay nothing until they exited home ownership or died.
<p>It said one sign of a return to more traditional conditions was its finding that the market had experienced its usual “December dip”, with the average asking price of a home falling by 0.7% – or £2,234 – over the past month.</p>
<p>Separately, UK Finance, the bank trade body, said a strong year for sales would make 2021 a record year for mortgage lending.</p>
<a>the Halifax issued figures</a> showing that average UK house prices rose by 3.4% in the three months to the end of November, the highest quarterly rate since late 2006. Rival lender Nationwide said prices
<a>continued to climb in November</a> and were now 10% higher than a year earlier.
<p>It added that buyer demand and market momentum “remain strong going into 2022”, with November’s data showing buyer numbers up by 41% on 2019, and 3% up on 2020.</p>
<p>The stamp duty holiday <a>announced by the government</a> in July 2020 has been credited with fuelling a boom in the property market and pushing up prices.</p>
<p>Rightmove said the average asking price of a UK home was now £340,167 compared with £342,401 a month ago, with the annual rate of price growth unchanged at 6.3%.</p>
<p>Australians using superannuation savings to buy a home would also be worse off in retirement, report says</p>
<p>Allowing Australians to use their superannuation to buy a home would cause another “price explosion”, property economists have warned.</p>
<p>The $3.3tn savings pool is an attractive target for politicians wanting to boost home ownership, fund infrastructure or wean people off government pensions in the decades ahead.</p>
<p>A McKell Institute report released on Wednesday models the effect on the housing market should Australians be given access to super for a home deposit, as advocated by federal government MPs such as assistant minister Tim Wilson.</p>
<p>Housing prices have increased significantly during the pandemic, helped by record low interest rates. Rental costs have also risen.</p>
<p>A standard 20% deposit for a house in Sydney – where one-fifth of Australia’s population lives – is now around $300,000, or close to five times the median annual earnings for an individual.</p>
<p>Housing affordability is an enormous challenge but the use of super won’t help, McKell Institute executive director Michael Buckland said.</p>
<p>Allowing access to $60,000 or more in superannuation savings would see more prospective buyers transition to home ownership, but would inflate house prices in the major cities, the report found.</p>
<p>The proposal would add nearly $69,000 to the price of the average house in Sydney, $108,000 in Melbourne, and $159,000 in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Australians who opt for a house deposit instead of keeping their money invested in super would retire worse off, because cash invested in super offered more sustainable long-term returns than housing.</p>
<p>“Subsequent rounds of prospective homebuyers would therefore face higher levels of prices still, and demands on their super would need to be higher again to compensate,” the report said.</p>
<p>Buckland said the Mortgaging Our Future report was a sobering reminder of what was at stake.</p>
<p>“Young Australians need their retirement savings quarantined and compounding. Using these savings to fuel yet another housing market feeding frenzy would be policy madness,” he said.</p>
<p>It is already possible for individuals to save up to $30,000 within their super account through additional voluntary contributions, for the purpose of adding to a home loan deposit.</p>
<p>The report found allowing prospective buyers to access between $10,000 to 30,000 towards a house deposit would have no material impact on the overall rate of home ownership.</p>
<p>The boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched, according to Halifax.</p>
<a>raised interest rates</a> on Thursday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, from 0.1% to 0.25%, and signalled further increases in the months ahead, potentially dampening appetite for spending as budgets come under strain.
<p>The Bank made its move after the Office for National Statistics said that UK inflation jumped to a 10-year high of 5.1% in November, as the price of petrol reached a record high and the global chip shortage pushed up car prices. </p>
<p>Halifax expects <a>strong housing price levels</a> to be maintained – the average UK house price is £272,992, almost £34,000 higher than at the start of the pandemic – but that growth in 2022 would be between flat and 2%.</p>
<p>With the pandemic-fuelled shift to flexible, remote and home working, homebuyers have rushed to buy larger properties in picturesque and rural locations outside urban centres.</p>
<p>However, with soaring inflation and further rate rises expected in 2022, the cheap mortgage deals that have boosted the housing market in 2021 are likely to be more difficult to find.</p>
<p>Despite the potential cooling of two years of house price growth, there are fears first-time buyers will continue to be priced out of the UK market.</p>

<p>Adam Watts was killed at the Juniper kennels and cattery he ran in Kirkton of Auchterhouse, near <a>Dundee</a>, on Wednesday, by a dog it is understood police had previously seized and brought to him for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Watts, 55, was pronounced dead at the scene after the attack, which was believed to have involved a large bulldog-type animal.</p>
<p>Police have said there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.</p>
<p>“Adam died doing what he loved. He leaves behind five boys who he was the sole parent to. He talked of them often and was so proud of the older boys helping him with the dogs.”</p>
<p>Juniper Kennels advertised itself as having 22 kennels of varying sizes, and eight catteries, with an enclosed exercise area to the rear where dogs could have a secure free run. It also offered leaded walks, one dog at a time.</p>

<p>Another time, a stranger invited me for coffee and at the end said we must do it again. “Yes,” I said, but just as he was leaving he added, “next time I’ll bring my Afghan hounds.”</p>

<p>Authorities in the south of <a>France</a> have temporarily shut down a zoo after a pack of nine wolves escaped from an enclosure during visiting hours, officials have said.</p>
<p>“Not many people were in the zoo at the time and at no time was the public in immediate danger,” said Chollet. However, the security problem meant the zoo needed to close until the issues were rectified, he added.</p>
<p>The park’s owner, Sauveur Ferrara, said the wolves, which were recent arrivals to the attraction, escaped after destroying security installations but never left the zoo itself.</p>
<p>“Due to the abnormal and dangerous behaviour of some of them, four wolves were sadly killed by the park personnel,” he said, emphasising that members of the public had been evacuated immediately from the park.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the zoo was ordered to close because of security measures but the closure order was later lifted by a court. The park’s social media page said it plans to reopen in mid-January.</p>

<p>California authorities have closed some beaches in San Luis Obispo county after a 31-year-old man was pronounced dead following an encounter with a shark on Friday.</p>
<p>The fatality marked the first death in a shark attack in 18 years in the area, which lies roughly midway between Los Angeles and Jan Jose.</p>
<p>On Saturday, county officials were still in the process of contacting next of kin before they release the man’s identity, said Eric Endersby, the Morro Bay harbor patrol director.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible accident,” Endersby <a>told CNN.</a> “Fortunately, the weather and wind has ruined the surf, so there are not many surfers, but we’ve closed the waters for safety.”</p>
<p>Bad weather in the area had meant that there were fewer people in the water than usual. “Mother Nature was on our side because we could have had more people out for sure,” Endersby <a>told the LA Times.</a></p>
<p>The patrol director said it was not clear whether anyone witnessed the attack, but that the man appeared to be a bodyboarder . He was declared dead when paramedics reached the scene.</p>
<a>Nick Wapner</a> was bitten by a Great White shark off Montaña de Oro state park. Another attack took place at the same beach four years earlier when a man was hit by a shark, believed to be an 8- to 10-foot juvenile.
<p>The last fatal encounter came in August 2003 when a <a>50-year-old woman </a>was attacked as she swam with seals, a favorite prey of the Great White.</p>
<p>Enderby told the newspaper that the presence of seals should be a warning to the presence of sharks.</p>
<p>“If you see a lot of bird or seal activity in the water, that’s a sign that people should be looking to get out of the water,” he said. “Human attacks are largely a case of mistaken identity.”</p>
<p>Labour has demanded the outlawing of trail hunting on public land, as Boxing Day meets prepare to go ahead.</p>
<p>Several licences have been granted by the government for the meetings, despite a growing movement among public bodies to refuse permission for them to take place on their property.</p>
<a>National Trust suspended licences</a> to trail hunt on its land after a video emerged of a huntsman explaining how to use them as a way of holding an illegal foxhunt.
<p>It follows <a>the case of Mark Hankinson</a>, the director of the Masters of the Foxhounds Association, who was convicted in October of encouraging others to hide the illegal hunting of live foxes behind a “smokescreen” of trail hunting.</p>
<p>Hankinson was convicted of encouraging or assisting others to commit an offence over comments in two web seminars. “We need to have clear, visible, plausible trail laying being done throughout the day,” he was recorded saying.</p>
<p>He added: “It’s a lot easier to create a smokescreen if you’ve got more than one trail layer operating, and that is what it’s all about – trying to portray to the people watching that you’re going about your legitimate business.”</p>
<p>Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said allowing trail hunts to go ahead on public land was “completely irresponsible”.</p>

<a>withdrew from</a> the International Whaling Commission (IWC) – the body that had effectively banned whaling in the late 1980s – Wada rejoiced at the prospect of a
<a>return to commercial hunting</a> and at a popular reconnection with a source of food that had sustained coastal communities for 400 years.
<p>But here and in other whaling towns in <a>Japan</a>, the resumption of killing whales for profit for the first time in more than three decades has offered little cause for celebration.</p>
<p>While Japan skirted the IWC ban by conducting limited <a>“scientific” hunts</a> in the Antarctic, it had long argued that only a return to commercial whaling would guarantee a stable supply of affordable meat and ignite a revival in consumption.</p>
<p>Japan’s commercial whaling industry would grind to a halt without government subsidies of ¥5.1bn (£.033bn) a year, says Junko Sakuma, a freelance journalist and expert on Japan’s whaling economy.</p>
<a>whales</a> as they needed to sustain the industry, but in fact it has shrunk. Japanese whaling will continue, but in a much smaller form.”
<a>Sea Shepherd</a> may be hastening whaling’s decline. “In the past, Japanese people were defensive because they didn’t like white people telling them not to eat whale meat,” Sakuma says. “But whaling is barely mentioned these days by
<a>anti-whaling countries</a> like Australia, Britain and the US. Now Japanese people have nothing to rebel against, so they could end up just forgetting about whale meat.”
<p>An animal shelter in <a>Michigan</a> has been inundated with hundreds of parakeets.</p>
<p>The Detroit Animal Welfare Group in Romeo said in a Facebook post that the small, colorful birds were dropped off on Thursday night, the Detroit News reported.</p>
<p>“We were in shock also but could not turn them away as they were all crammed in seven cages and smothering each other and needed immediate help,” the shelter said in the post.</p>
<p>“His son said that he just wanted to breed a few of them and it got out of control,” LeBonty said. “The problem is birds breed easily. And then you just have more babies and more babies and more babies if you don’t control the situation.”</p>
<p>Shelter officials said they reached out to bird rescue organizations for help. Temporary housing for the parakeets was found and food was donated for the birds.</p>
<p>The birds have to quarantine for 30 days. Adoptions were expected to begin on 23 January, the Detroit News reported.</p>

<p>A dog has undergone life-saving surgery after scoffing six packets of potentially deadly Christmas chocolate coins.</p>
<p>Hugo, a six-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, helped himself to the chocolate treats – poisonous to dogs – when owner Amie popped to the shops.</p>
<p>She returned to her home in Plymouth, Devon, to find the coins gone and wrappers strewn across the floor, before rushing Hugo to a nearby PDSA pet hospital.</p>
<p>“I’d only been to the shops briefly and came back to find torn-up packets and bits of foil all over the floor, with the chocolate gone,” she said.</p>
<p>“At first Hugo seemed fine, but I felt sick with worry when he began vomiting blood. He then had a seizure, which was terrifying, so I called PDSA immediately.”</p>
<p>“He was very lucky, and could have died if he had not been treated in time. While he’s not completely out of the woods yet, thankfully Hugo is now at home on strict rest, and on the road to recovery.”</p>
<p>“Foods including chocolate, mince pies, onions, raisins, grapes, some nuts, sage-and-onion stuffing and Christmas cake can all be harmful and should be kept safely out of paws’ reach.”</p>
<p>Amie added: “I don’t know what I would have done without the incredibly kind and caring staff at PDSA – they were amazing. I honestly don’t think Hugo would be here without them.</p>
<p>“They went above and beyond for him and I will be forever grateful. There were a number of times I thought we were going to lose him, so to have him home for Christmas is a miracle.”</p>
<p>A PDSA spokesperson said: “If you think your pet might have eaten something they shouldn’t, call your vet immediately as they might need urgent treatment.”</p>
<p>He even ventured into fiction in 2010 with Anthill, a coming-of-age novel about an Alabama boy trying to save marshlands.</p>
<p>Among Wilson’s most controversial works was Sociobiology: the New Synthesis, from 1975, in which he wrote that all human behavior was a product of genetic predetermination, not learned experiences.</p>
<p>One protester threw water on Wilson while he was speaking at a conference as others chanted, “Wilson, you’re all wet”. It was, Wilson said later, a matter of pride for him that he was willing to pursue scientific truth despite such attacks.</p>
<p>He managed to tie science and religion together in a 2006 book, The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth, a series of letters written to an imaginary Baptist preacher in pursuit of an ecological alliance to save the Earth.</p>
<p>In a 2011 commencement address at the University of North Carolina, Wilson argued that humanity needed to make changes in how it managed the planet.</p>
<p>“We have stone age emotions, medieval institutions and god-like technology,” he said.</p>
<p>Wilson once said destroying a rainforest for economic gain was like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal.</p>
<p>He won the National Medal of Science, the highest US science honor, and dozens of other awards. In 1995, Time magazine listed him among the 25 most influential Americans.</p>
<p>Wilson graduated from the University of Alabama and earned a doctorate at Harvard, where he taught for several decades.</p>

<p>Clashes have reportedly broken out between hunters and protesters during a tense Boxing Day meet in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>Video footage shared on social media appeared to show punches being thrown from both sides as mounted riders moved through Lacock village, near Chippenham, for the annual Avon Vale Boxing Day hunt.</p>
<p>The Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) has accused hunters of resorting to violence on one of the biggest days in the hunting industry’s calendar.</p>
<p>It is not clear how the fighting broke out or who was involved. Footage showed anti-hunt protesters shouting “shame on you” at a group of riders and in another video, a woman holding a sign is pushed to the ground.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank the many hundreds of people who peacefully attended today in support of our hounds.”</p>
<a>Critics are demanding the prohibition on public land</a> of a sport they believe is often merely a front for illegal foxhunting. The Scottish Greens renewed their call for an outright ban on foxhunting in Scotland.
<p>An HSA spokesperson said: “Foxhunters’ backs are against the wall and they’re increasingly resorting to violence as the pressure increases.”</p>

<p>Ministers could meet as soon as Monday to determine whether new restrictions are needed in <a>England</a> over the new year amid growing concerns that soaring Covid cases could hit public services.</p>
<p>They will be expected to assess new modelling from the University of Warwick, given to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in documents published on Thursday.</p>
<a>effects of a potential return to step 2 restrictions</a> from 28 December or 1 January, lasting either two weeks, four weeks or three months until 28 March. No 10 said the data had not yet been considered by ministers.
<p>Step 2 – part of last year’s roadmap – includes a ban on indoor social mixing, a return of the rule of six, and bars and restaurants only able to serve outdoors.</p>
<a>reduce the isolation days</a> [from 10 to seven] but a decision will have to be taken in the round, taking in hospitalisations and severe illness, which should be clearer over the weekend.”
<p>A Whitehall source said any restrictions based on workplace concerns would probably be targeted at sectors rather than being broadbrush but ministers had not ruled out legal guidance coming in next week.</p>
<p>The government’s Covid-O committee, which has been focused on the functioning of services and workplace absences, is expected to review the situation again after the Christmas weekend.</p>
<p>Pat Cullen, head of the Royal College of Nursing, told the BBC there was a “very, very depleted workforce” due to the number of staff forced into isolation.</p>
<a>Health</a> Security Agency, said there were a number of factors as well as the variant’s severity, that would be taken into account when ministers convene after the Christmas weekend to discuss further restrictions for England.
<a>according to the first UK government study</a> of its kind.
<p>Harries said ministers would need to take a holistic approach about how widespread the impact of case rates was on essential services – as well as numbers being hospitalised.</p>
<p>“Ministers will look at all of the data that we have available – and that isn’t simply what the epidemiology is saying, it’s how it’s impacting society,” she told the BBC.</p>
<p>“So, for example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick – we know that particularly in London, around one in 35 have currently got Omicron. Now that’s having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates.”</p>
<p>The growing wave of Omicron cases has helped drive Covid rates to <a>record highs</a> in England, with one in 35 people now infected across the country and one in 20 infected in London, official figures have shown.</p>
<p>Rates of Covid were highest in London in the week studied, and lowest in the north-east where the rate was one in 55 people, according to the <a>ONS infection survey</a> released on Friday,</p>
<p>While <a>London</a> remains the centre of the omicron wave, the ONS said swab results compatible with infections of the new variant rose in all regions of England, and in all nations of the UK, compared with last week’s survey.</p>
<p>Esther Sutherland, a senior statistician on the Covid-19 infection survey, said the rise in infections was across almost all age groups, with the figures suggesting the rapid spread of omicron was “a significant factor in recent trends”.</p>
<a>Covid booster or third dose of the vaccine</a>, which provides substantial extra protection against omicron.
<p>“What we know now of course is that the patients, people who are becoming seriously ill, who are being hospitalised, are those who have not been vaccinated and those who have not had their boosters,” he added.</p>
<p>According to the <a>minutes of a Sage meeting</a> held on Thursday, scientists were unclear whether an apparent fall in the growth rate in omicron infections was a genuine slowing down in the spread of the virus.</p>

<a>March 2020 budget</a>. Published before the full implications of Covid were known, it assumed the economy would grow by about 1% last year. In the end, it contracted by almost 10%.
<p>The OBR, like forecasters, also underestimated how adaptable the economy would be to pandemic conditions, with the result that each lockdown has caused less economic damage than the last.</p>

<p>Allowing women to give birth in hospital with their pet dog by their side could ease their anxiety, one of the first women to use a “birth dog” has said.</p>
<p>Charlotte Beard, 24, who suffers from non-epileptic seizures, was supported through her 50-hour labour by her aid pet Flump, who is trained to detect seizures before they happen.</p>
<p>The fluffy-haired Maltese was prepared for the birth by being played audio tracks of babies crying at home and being introduced to staff at the maternity ward in Poole hospital.</p>
<p>Flump, two, attended every scan and every appointment alongside Beard.</p>
<p>“It would have caused high levels of anxiety if Flump was not there,” she said. “I would have certainly been more concerned about my safety.</p>
<p>Beard gave birth to her son Alfie, weighing 6lb 10oz, after two days with Flump. Her partner and full-time carer, Ash Phoenix, 29, was present.</p>
<p>“We would regularly hear quite distressing noises and he was absolutely fantastic,” she said. “He slept through [a] lot of other people’s labours.”</p>
<p>Beard got Flump at 10 weeks and has trained him since then. “From a human standpoint I cannot help but think how lovely it is that Flump was there. He was one of the first to see Alfie,” Beard said.</p>
<p>So, as an adult, it seemed incredibly natural to me that witchcraft would be the safe haven I returned to in order to recover my mental health after a workplace ordeal left me suffering from depression.</p>
<p>On top of the physical symptoms of anxiety, I noticed that as the job grew more stressful, my mood tumbled downwards until I was in a state of depression for months at a time.</p>
<p>And so, in the winter of 2018, after realising how disconnected I had become from myself and the nature-loving woman I had once been, I knew something had to change. I decided to break away – I quit.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be better if we took a pause before we got to the point of a panic attack?</p>
<p>As we continue to reach dizzying heights in the technological age, witchcraft can help us see the magic of the everyday and bring us back down to earth where we can plant two outstretched hands in the moss. </p>

<p>On one level it is an absurdly large swirl of whipped cream with a cherry, a fly and a drone on top. On another it is the end of everything as we know it.</p>
<p>Visitors to Trafalgar Square in central London have until spring 2022 to come to their own conclusions about the vast new artwork by <a>Heather Phillipson, the 13th contemporary art commission to fill the fourth plinth</a>.</p>
<p>Titled The End, it was unveiled on Thursday morning, four months later than originally planned. The reason for the postponement was coronavirus, something that now gives the dystopian nature of the work an extra edge.</p>
<p>Phillipson said she came up with the idea for it in 2016, the year of the EU referendum and Donald Trump winning the US presidential election.</p>
<p>The work gives a sense of something being on the verge of collapse. The cream is melting round the base of the plinth, the fly makes it look unappetising.</p>
<p>“The pandemic just brings different resonances,” Phillipson said. “It attunes them to a slightly higher frequency.”</p>
<p>Its stark title may not be as bleak as it seemed, she said. “In the end there is the possibility of something else forming. There’s the chance of radical change inside any ending … there is potentially hope for something else.”</p>
<p>The work, at 9.4 metres, is the tallest plinth commission to date. It is also the first to be fully accessible, with a braille panel on the plaque and an online audio description.</p>
<p>The steel and polystyrene sculpture , which weighs 9 tonnes, arrived in the square on Sunday night to begin installation.</p>
<a>giant thumb’s up</a> and its wide-eyed optimism in 2016; Katharina Fritsch’s
<a>enormous blue cock</a> poking fun at the square’s male posturing in 2013; and Antony Gormley’s celebration of human unpredictability,
<a>One Other</a>, in 2009. The first was Mark Wallinger’s
<p>Justine Simons, London’s deputy mayor for culture, said it had been a joy to witness the diversity of ideas for the plinth over two decades.</p>
<p>Phillipson said she had mixed emotions about unveiling The End. “It is a strange time to be doing anything right now. But it also it felt like it was never going to be the right time, so maybe it was the right time to just let it happen.”</p>
