<a>Lee Jae-myung</a>, the candidate of his left-leaning Minju, or Democratic Party. Lee had been faltering in the polls. By freeing Park, Moon deflated a rightist campaign of sympathy for her as a woman caught up in a scandal not of her making. Now Lee is
<a>falling behind</a> Lee after having commanded a wide lead a few weeks ago. Sentiment among undecided voters appears to be shifting back to Lee, despite questions about his role in a real estate scandal while he was mayor of Seongnam, a city near Seoul.

<div> <h1>These 3 issues will clobber Democrats in 2022 </h1> <div> By Liz Peek, Opinion Contributor — 12/31/21 08:00 AM EST <div> The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill </div> </div> </div>
<a>Ipsos survey</a>, respondents listed the economy, health and crime as the country’s most urgent problems. Bad news for Democrats: Republicans win on all three, hands down.
<p>In his August speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president, Biden claimed, “After all this time, [Trump] still does not have a plan. Well, I do.” </p>
<p>The CDC in particular is under fire for mismanaging COVID tests and failing to track important data, like the number of people who have been vaccinated and the prevalence of breakthrough cases.</p>
<p>The authorities dictate widespread use of testing but have failed to provide necessary tests and seem unsure whether the tests we have are accurate.</p>
<a>thousands</a> out of work; the CDC unhelpfully
<a>changes guidance</a> about isolation requirements that appear drawn from thin air to alleviate labor shortages. The agency also
<a>presents estimates</a> of omicron cases that seem ludicrously wrong.
<p>Further, the authorities demand proof of vaccination even as the fully vaccinated and boosted appear quite capable of spreading the infection.</p>
<p>Confusion reigns; Biden’s approval on COVID management has plummeted and is now upside down. </p>
<a>Republican-led states</a> have led the country
<a>in terms of economic recovery</a>. Voters who suffered sizable hits to income and who saw their children lose out on schooling wonder whether the onerous blue-state lockdowns and mandates made sense.
<p>Number two is inflation. Prices will not stand still. Supply chains may normalize, relieving some of the pressure on transportation costs or prices on certain scarce goods, but that’s only one part of the problem.</p>
<a>Kellogg and Deere</a>), while both service and white-collar workers are able and eager to demand more pay. In addition, nearly half of states are
<a>poised</a> to raise their minimum wage next year.
<p>All of this will drive wages higher, creating more cost pressures and encouraging companies to raise prices. Already, many big corporations, such as Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup, <a>have announced</a> plans to do so. </p>
<a>more than doubled</a>, expanding by $5 trillion to nearly $9 trillion today. Looked at another way, the Fed’s balance sheet has grown from 20 percent of GDP to almost 40 percent.
<a>as many as three rate hikes</a> next year.
<p>Number three is crime. In a <a>recent Ipsos survey</a>, Americans said that crime was the country’s third most pressing problem. No wonder: Our streets are unsafe, and looting has become widespread.</p>
<a>Crime is up</a>, especially in large Democrat-run cities such as Chicago and Philadelphia. Republicans have historically been viewed as tough on crime; when public safety becomes an issue, as it is today, they win.
<p>Democrats have not just paved a pathway for a Republican sweep; they have provided a superhighway.</p>
<p>Nine months is a long time in politics; things could change. But if the elections were held today, Democrats would indeed be clobbered.</p>

<div> <h1>Five takeaways from the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict</h1> <div> By Sarakshi Rai - 12/30/21 02:37 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on five of six counts by a Manhattan jury Wednesday for crimes related to the grooming and trafficking of underage girls for financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>The British heiress could face up to 65 years in prison, but her defense team argued that Maxwell has been made a "scapegoat" for the crimes committed by her former partner, Epstein.</p>
<p>Here are the five main takeaways from the verdict.</p>
<p>Maxwell was convicted on some of the most serious charges </p>
<p>Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of sex trafficking of minors, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and three conspiracy charges. </p>
<p>She was found not guilty on the charge of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.</p>
<p>The trafficking charge carries a sentence of 40 years and, coupled with the other charges, Maxwell is facing decades behind bars. She will remain imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn while she waits for a sentencing date. </p>
<p>The testimony from the victims was critical </p>
<p>Four victims took the stand to share detailed testimonies about the alleged abuse they suffered, including details of interactions with Maxwell and Epstein. </p>
<p>Mitchell Epner, a former prosecutor who currently serves as counsel at Rottenberg Lipman Rich, told The Hill that the testimony of these witnesses was crucial because their statements established a “pattern of abuse.” </p>
<p>“They each testified to a signature pattern of abuse, they acknowledged that some details of their accounts had changed over time, but the core had remained constant.”</p>
<p>The accusers testified that Maxwell approached them, often showering them with expensive gifts or shopping trips to build trust. </p>
<p>Three of the four accusers who testified used pseudonyms to protect their identities. </p>
<p>Epner stated that the victims' testimony had been corroborated and was convincing for the jury, which ultimately led to Maxwell’s conviction. </p>
<p>“Once these witnesses were believed by the jury, convictions were inevitable," Epner said.</p>
<p>Maxwell is facing another trial for two perjury charges</p>
<p>Maxwell will face another trial next year on charges that she lied under oath about Epstein's abuse of underage girls.</p>
<p>In the deposition transcript obtained by Bloomberg, Maxwell told prosecutors they were "asking me to speculate and I won’t speculate," when asked if Epstein sexually abused minors.</p>
<p>The two perjury counts each carry a maximum prison sentence of five years, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>The trial brought Epstein's friendship with the rich and powerful back in the spotlight</p>
<p>Years back, when allegations against Epstein were first brought to light, media reports uncovered that he had maintained a social circle that included former presidents, British royalty, businessmen and celebrities. </p>
<p>As the trial progressed in 2021, the rich and the powerful were dragged back into the spotlight. </p>
<p>In particular, Maxwell’s case has turned up the heat on Andrew and his alleged dealings with Guiffre, who has brought a lawsuit against the Duke of York, claiming that he sexually abused her when she was underage. </p>
<p>Images of Andrew with his arm around Guiffre have been released. The prince has denied allegations and maintained that the photos were manipulated. </p>
<p>Most recently, lawyers for the British senior royal claimed that a U.S. court does not have jurisdiction over Guiffre’s claims because she has lived in Australia for many years.</p>
<p>An appeal or cooperation? What’s next for Maxwell </p>
<p>Maxwell's lawyers are working on an appeal, attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim said after the verdict was announced on Wednesday. </p>
<p>"We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. Obviously, we are very disappointed with the verdict," Sternheim said.</p>
<p>However, to appeal Maxwell's conviction, her lawyers will need to prove that Judge Alison Nathan violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion and that it impacted the verdict. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported that it might be in Maxwell’s interest to cooperate with authorities to lessen her sentence.</p>
<p>However, he said that prosecutors will have to tread lightly for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>“Now that she is a convicted felon and facing decades in federal prison, Maxwell may be motivated to say anything to save herself. Prosecutors would have to independently verify the names of additional abusers Maxwell provides,” he added.</p>
<p>According to Rahmani, Maxwell’s defense team will most likely appeal the jury’s decision, but it will have little chance of success. </p>

<div> <h1>Colorado governor cuts 100 years off sentence for truck driver in fatal crash</h1> <div> By Joseph Choi - 12/30/21 08:22 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Aguilera-Mederos was sentenced to 110 years in prison due to mandatory minimum sentencing laws in Colorado. The sentence drew international outcry for its severity, with fellow truck drivers boycotting Colorado in protest.</p>
<p>As KDVR reported, Aguilera-Mederos applied for clemency from Polis, which the Colorado governor granted on Thursday, cutting his sentence down to 10 years.</p>
<p>Polis stressed that the crimes Aguilera-Mederos was convicted of are "serious," but said he was "encouraged" by the "personal reflection" the defendant had done as well as "the commercial vehicle safety changes" that were made in light of the crash.</p>

<h2>How to work out more in 2022</h2>
<p>Is exercising more one of your New Year’s resolutions? There’s no need to wait until 2022 to start a new fitness journey. If you invest in exercise gear now, you can hit the ground running by January 1, perhaps in more than one way.</p>
<h2>How to exercise more in 2022</h2>
<h3>Why you should exercise more</h3>
<p>There are countless benefits of being more active, and it’s not just a matter of losing weight or bulking up.</p>
<h3>Tips for getting more active</h3>
<p>If you’d like to exercise more but aren’t sure where to begin, there are a few ways you can get moving.</p>
<li>Many people embark on their fitness journeys in gyms. Besides full access to a broad range of weights, machines and equipment, some gyms now offer in-person and virtual group fitness classes. </li>
<li>Adults ages 65 and over may be eligible for <a>SilverSneakers</a>, a nationwide program that offers free access to gyms, fitness centers and classes. </li>
<li>Staying active and sticking to fitness goals often boils down to finding exercises or activities you like. Some people love the high intensity of kickboxing or Zumba classes, whereas others prefer low-impact cardio like Pilates, golf or Tai Chi. </li>
<li>Those with sedentary jobs can benefit from using standing, treadmill or cycling desks. Some professionals cycle or walk to work when possible, while others use their lunch breaks to take short walks. </li>
<li>Besides researching fitness and exercise, brush up on nutritional basics and healthy recipes. Depending on the new activities, you may need to increase calories and adjust macronutrients to support higher activity levels. </li>
<li>A large part of getting more active is making time for exercise. Streamline your weekly schedule and block time for workouts, whether it’s 20 minutes of weightlifting or a 45-minute jog. </li>
<li>Quality <a>sneakers</a> are an essential investment for anyone getting more active. Not only are they comfortable and supportive, but the right pair of sneakers may also minimize the potential for foot and ankle injuries. </li>
<h3>Do I need to spend a lot of money to get active?</h3>
<p>While you can easily spend thousands of dollars on high-priced exercise machines, personal trainers and expensive gym memberships, it’s unnecessary to be active. It doesn’t cost anything to walk, jog or do bodyweight exercises at home. </p>

<div> <h1>Pope cancels New Year's Eve Nativity visit to discourage large crowds</h1> <div> By Brad Dress - 12/31/21 09:44 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>The Pope, who has been a vocal advocate for the use of vaccines, will instead hold his traditional vespers service at the St. Peter's Basilica on New Year's Eve and a small, private mass on New Year's Day, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>Italy is combating a historic surge of confirmed coronavirus cases, with its highest total yet reported on the week ending Dec. 20,<a> according to the World Health Organization.</a></p>
<p>The news follows mass cancelations of events elsewhere in the world, including firework displays in Paris and the peach drop in Georgia.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to send a message to the world. New York City is open,” he said, <a>according to NBC 4 New York.</a></p>
<p>The surge of the omicron variant, first discovered in South Africa, has stymied holiday plans and resulted in the cancelation of thousands of flights during the holiday season. </p>
<p>JetBlue said Thursday that the company was canceling more than 1,200 flights until mid-January amid a spike in coronavirus cases that have prompted staffing shortages. </p>

<div> <h1>Pelosi announces series of events to mark Jan. 6 anniversary</h1> <div> By Caroline Vakil - 12/30/21 08:01 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Historians Jon Meacham and Doris Kearns Goodwin are slated to participate in one of the events organized at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to mark the one-year anniversary of the deadly riot.</p>
<p>Meacham endorsed former President Biden in the 2020 election and spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year. </p>
<p>Other events scheduled for next Thursday include a moment of silence, time for lawmakers to share their testimonials regarding the Jan. 6 riot and a prayer vigil. The House will be holding a pro forma session that day.</p>
<p>Democrats have sought to keep attention on the events of Jan. 6, with a special committee set up to probe the riot issuing a series of subpoenas and document requests in recent months to former Trump administration officials.</p>
<p>Pelosi announced earlier this month that her office was planning a series of events for the first week of January as part of a "solemn observance" of the riot. </p>
<p>Lawmakers, aides and reporters ducked for cover or hid inside offices as the mob breached the Capitol. The insurrection has only deepened political divisions among Democrats and Republicans, but it also wedged a divide among Republicans.</p>
<div> <h1>Cook Report projects GOP as clear favorite to win House majority</h1> <div> By Max Greenwood - 12/30/21 12:38 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Ratings released by The Cook Political Report on Thursday show the GOP with a clear edge in the 2022 battle for control of the House. </p>
<p>The new batch of ratings from the nonpartisan election handicapper shows Democrats defending eight so-called toss-up districts across seven states. By comparison, Republicans are defending six toss-up seats in four states at this point. </p>
<p>Only one Republican-held district, Illinois’s 13th, currently leans toward Democrats, according to the latest ratings. </p>
<p>The Cook Political Report is issuing the ratings on a rolling basis given ongoing redistricting efforts across the country that will further reshape the nation’s political lines in the coming months.</p>
<p>Still, the latest race ratings from the election handicapper paint a difficult picture for Democrats, who are facing an uphill battle to hold on to their narrow House majority next year. </p>
<p>Republicans need to net just five seats in 2022 to recapture control of the lower chamber, a goal that appears well within reach, especially given the fact that the party of a new president tends to lose ground in Congress in midterm election years.</p>
<p>The ratings released by The Cook Political Report on Thursday account for only a portion of the races that could decide the House majority next year. </p>
<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee says it is targeting 70 Democratic-held districts in 2022 after expanding its list last month. Democrats, meanwhile, are going after a more limited slate of 22 GOP-held districts.</p>

<p>Some in the party have also warned that pursuing liberal policy priorities could lead to a backlash next year in the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats will have to defend their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate.</p>

<div> <h1>US returns $11M worth of illegally trafficked stolen Italian antiquities</h1> <div> By Cameron Jenkins - 12/31/21 09:52 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>Italy on Thursday welcomed the return of antiques worth nearly $11 million that were illegally trafficked and sold to U.S. museums and galleries.</p>
<p>U.S. officials returned 201 artifacts earlier this month. Of those, 40 are currently on exhibit at the Italian Consulate General and 161 have been resettled in Italy, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>“These artworks will not end up, as has happened many times in the past, all in one big museum,” Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, said, according to the news outlet.</p>
<p>He detailed that the works will be returned to where they were stolen from and will be preserved and displayed in museums in those areas, AP noted.</p>
<p>“This too is a great homecoming operation that will add value to our extraordinary country as a vast museum. They are artworks of absolute importance that will attract people to those places and territories,” Franceschini said.</p>
<p>Ancient pottery, Roman art, a terracotta statue dating from the 4th century BC, and 96 pieces that were included in the collection of the Fordham Museum of Greek were all reportedly among artwork that was returned to Italy by the U.S.</p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney's office told The Associated Press that Almagia still remains at large in Italy.</p>

<div> <h1>Airlines file emergency request asking FCC to delay 5G rollout</h1> <div> By Cameron Jenkins - 12/31/21 08:20 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>A top airlines trade group on Thursday filed an emergency request for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to delay the rollout of 5G wireless service, citing concerns that the technology could cause disruptions for flights.</p>
<a>pushed back on the agreement</a>, noting that 5G could cause potential flight diversions and delays.
<p>On Thursday, Airlines for America said that the FCC “has never provided a reasoned analysis of why it has rejected the evidence submitted by the aviation interests,” Bloomberg News reported.</p>
<p>Wireless companies agreed to roll out the 5G service at reduced power for a temporary amount of time in order to compromise with airline groups, but Airlines for America said that would not be enough, the news outlet noted.</p>
<div> <h1>Two Colorado cities evacuated as wildfires burn hundreds of homes</h1> <div> By Joseph Choi - 12/30/21 05:24 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Two northern Colorado cities on Thursday were ordered to evacuate due to quickly spreading wildfires fueled by 100-mph winds that burned down hundreds of homes in the Denver area.</p>
<p>Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said in a press briefing that an entire subdivision of 370 homes in Superior had been burned, NBC News reported. An additional 210 homes in the city's old town neighborhood were also destroyed.</p>
<p>Apart from homes, a hotel and shopping center were also incinerated and the fire came close to a hospital.</p>
<p>"This was a horrific event.” said Pelle. According to the sheriff, no deaths had reported as of Thursday night, but he said he would not be surprised to find casualties. One officer was injured by flying debris.</p>
<p>“This is the kind of fire we can’t fight head on,” Pelle added. “We actually had deputy sheriffs and firefighters in areas that had to pull out because they just got overrun."</p>
<p>Kelli Christensen, spokesperson for UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, told The Associated Press that six people injured in the fire are being treated at the hospital.</p>
<p>The Boulder County Office of Emergency Management issued evacuation orders for both Louisville and Superior.</p>
<p>The town's Twitter account stated that Superior's evacuation point is the South Boulder Recreation Center. The local Superior Community Center is not an evacuation point.</p>
<p>Fire Command has issued an order of evacuation for the City of Louisville. If you are in the area, please leave quickly. Please evacuate to the east if possible.</p>— Louisville CO Police Department (@LouisvilleCOPD)
<a>The Associated Press reported</a>. A fire has also shut down a portion of U.S. Highway 36 near the area.

<div> <h1>State Dept warns Americans traveling abroad to 'make contingency plans' </h1> <div> By Caroline Vakil - 12/30/21 10:38 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The State Department warned on Thursday that Americans who are traveling abroad “should make contingency plans” as countries around the globe grapple with rising numbers of COVID-19 cases spurred by the omicron variant.</p>
<p>"U.S. citizens who do choose to travel internationally should make contingency plans, as they may have to remain in a foreign country longer than originally planned, which will be at their own expense," the department said in a media note. </p>
<p>"The Department recommends international travel insurance with coverage for COVID-related trip cancellation and medical benefits," it added. </p>
<p>Other foreign governments may also have additional COVID-19 guidance for visitors upon entering the country, the State Department added.</p>
<p>The guidance underscores the seriousness with which officials are approaching the new omicron variant, the spread of which has already caused staff shortages and reductions in certain services in the United States. </p>
<p>Health officials say the variant, first discovered only a month ago in South Africa, is highly transmissible, but early data also suggests it may not be as severe as delta for people who are vaccinated.</p>
<p>A South African study that analyzed a hospital system in the "epicenter" of the new variant said omicron appeared to have already had its peak and did not seem to cause a corresponding spike in hospitalization and deaths. </p>

<div> <h1>Trump fires up vaccine tensions</h1> <div> By Tal Axelrod and Max Greenwood - 12/30/21 06:01 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>Polls suggest a majority of Republicans back vaccines and are vaccinated, but it’s not a large majority.</p>
<p>A Kaiser Family Foundation report in September found that 58 percent of respondents identifying as Republicans had been vaccinated, compared to 90 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll in September found 56 percent of Republicans had been vaccinated, compared to 92 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents.</p>
<p>A number of Republican officeholders have also cast doubt on the vaccines, noting that people who are vaccinated still get COVID-19.</p>
<p>Trump remains the leader of the Republican Party and would be the odds-on favorite to win the GOP presidential nomination in 2024 if he chooses to run, as he is actively flirting with doing.</p>
<p>That’s something that hasn’t been changed by the pandemic or a host of other issues, including the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that led to Trump’s second impeachment. </p>
<p>Trump’s vocal support of vaccines likewise is not expected to change his support within the GOP, but it does raise questions about how the debate over vaccines will shake out if the former president continues to beat the drum.</p>
<p>“On the surface it’s surprising. But when you think about it, it’s a sensible thing,” he said. “It’s a sign that he is running. I think he knows he can’t just be part of that extremist side, he’s got to branch out.” </p>
<p>Days before the Owens interview, Trump was booed by some in the crowd when he told conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly that he had received a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot.</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Because what you had is just a crescendo of misinformation from the small but loud anti-vaccine voice,” one Trump ally said when asked if the remarks could lead to more Republicans getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>“For the past year, some of these fringe voices were allowed to speak, and then he didn't respond to it. Now he spoke, and now these fringe voices just realize how small their voices are compared to the former president of the United States.”</p>
<p>GOP pollster Robert Blizzard said if Trump does run, he needs to expand his base, as does his party. He and other sources suggested the recent messaging offered some potential for doing so.</p>
<p>Trump, like most Republicans, has opposed vaccine mandates, and it’s a certainty that this will be a battle line in elections going forward.</p>
<div> <h1>Nearly three-quarters of GOP doubt legitimacy of Biden's win: poll</h1> <div> By Max Greenwood - 12/30/21 10:14 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>Twenty-five percent of Republicans said Biden's win was “probably not legitimate,” while 46 percent said it was “definitely not legitimate,” according to the poll. </p>
<p>Only 6 percent of Republicans said that Biden is definitely the rightful winner, while another 15 percent said he “probably” is.</p>
<p>Most Americans — 58 percent — believe that Biden’s election was legitimate. That includes 91 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents.</p>
<p>The UMass Amherst poll was conducted by YouGov from Dec. 14-20 and is based on responses from 1,000 people nationwide. It has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.</p>
<div> <h1>Biden tells Putin US will respond 'decisively' if Russia invades Ukraine</h1> <div> By Jordan Williams - 12/30/21 06:43 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Biden “made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” the White House spokeswoman said, referring to Russia's invasion of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p>
<p>The U.S. president “reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,” Psaki added.</p>
<p>A senior administration official told reporters that the primary purpose of the 50-minute call was to “set the tone and tenor” for upcoming security negations in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Kremlin released its demands earlier this month, as Russia’s buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border sparked fears that Moscow may be planning to invade Ukraine again.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, and among other things is demanding that NATO not expand eastward and also roll back military deployments.</p>
<p>Russia is also calling for all sides to agree not to deploy land-based intermediate- and short-range missiles in areas that allow them to reach other parties.</p>
<p>During their previous call on Dec. 7, Biden also warned Putin of high economic consequences if Russia were to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thursday’s call began at 3:35 p.m. ET and ended at 4:25 p.m. The tone between the two leaders was “serious and substantive,” the administration official said, and they agreed to the sequence of the upcoming talks.</p>
<p>The two leaders also acknowledged that there would be areas where meaningful progress could be made, and that agreeing on other areas may be impossible.</p>
<p>“They both discuss the importance of pragmatic, results-oriented diplomacy, and I think President Biden very much saw this call as seeking to set the conditions for that,” the official said.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the U.S. will take the next week to continue its “intensive period” of consultations with allies and the Ukrainian government, the official said, which would include briefing allies on the call.</p>

<div> <h1>FDA expected to authorize Pfizer boosters for ages 12 to 15: report</h1> <div> By Monique Beals - 12/30/21 12:18 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to approve booster shots of Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds on Monday, people familiar with the agency's plan told The New York Times.</p>
<p>The change in policy comes as the U.S. and the world endure soaring COVID-19 case rates fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant, discovered last month in South Africa. </p>
<p>At present, over 73 percent of the U.S. population 12 years and older is vaccinated, according to the CDC. </p>
<p>While younger groups are less likely to suffer severe illness from COVID-19 infections, medical experts have continued to urge vaccination for all eligible people, including children.</p>
<a>said Thursday</a> in an appearance on NewsNation's “Morning in America.”
<p>"That is avoidable," he added.</p>

<div> <h1>Biden urges Supreme Court to maintain workplace vaccine mandate</h1> <div> By John Kruzel - 12/30/21 05:31 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The Biden administration on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to leave intact a workplace vaccine-or-test mandate as public health officials contend with the surging COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The administration’s brief, filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ), comes in response to a legal challenge brought by interest groups and employers across the country who allege the health measure is an unlawful exercise of government power.</p>
<p>The central question in the case is whether Congress gave the executive branch the broad authority to impose such a sweeping workplace regulation, which applies to businesses with 100 or more workers.</p>
<p>DOJ lawyers argued that the 1970 law that established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) makes plain that the policy “falls squarely within OSHA’s statutory authority.”</p>
<p>OSHA estimates the policy will save the lives of more than 6,500 workers and prevent some 250,000 hospitalizations over the course of six months, according to the DOJ court filing.</p>
<p>To date, more than 820,000 people have died in the U.S. as a result of the global pandemic. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show unvaccinated people are 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Challengers to the mandate have asked the justices to block the policy while the case proceeds through the lower courts, or take up a formal appeal of a federal appeals court ruling that preliminarily sustained the mandate.</p>

<div> <h1>Omicron puts pinch on Biden vaccine mandate efforts</h1> <div> By Nathaniel Weixel - 12/30/21 05:56 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The rapidly spreading omicron variant poses a problem for the White House as officials try to convince a skeptical public that vaccine mandates are necessary. </p>
<p>Opponents of mandates are seizing on early evidence that shows vaccines are not as effective at stopping transmission of the new strain, which they say undermines the administration's key arguments for championing them. </p>
<p>This week, airlines were forced to cancel thousands of flights as COVID-19 swept through its flight crews and other employees.</p>
<p>Administration officials have cast vaccine mandates for health workers, and mandate-or-test requirements for large employers, as essential tools to get more people vaccinated. </p>
<p>More than 85 percent of U.S. adults over the age of 18 have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but overall close to 40 percent of all Americans remain unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Fauci has since attempted to clean up his remarks, suggesting that the administration isn’t going to implement anything to get more people vaccinated.</p>
<p>A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found nearly 90 percent of unvaccinated adults said they remain unmoved to get a shot regardless of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Mandates might be the best way to convince some of those people to get vaccinated, and public health experts say vaccinations remain the best way to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>Gostin acknowledged that vaccines don't totally prevent transmission of the omicron variant, but he said that doesn’t reduce the ethical justification for requiring somebody to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has scheduled an expedited hearing for Jan. 7 on the health worker mandate and the large employer mandate.</p>
<p>Despite the federal uncertainty, some major metropolitan cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York have either already implemented or announced plans to implement mandates on both workers and customers.</p>
<p>Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said it makes sense that larger cities are more likely to put mandates in place than some of the smaller, more rural jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Still, Freeman said she wouldn't be surprised if some locations decided vaccine mandates were not worth it.</p>
<p>“The idea of vaccine mandates, you know, along with everything else that we look at during this pandemic, it shifts as we learn more about the disease or learn more about how it's mutating or evolving,” Freeman said. </p>
<p>Freeman said it would help if the Biden administration had more consistent messaging. For example, the new guidance on isolation time for asymptomatic cases treats vaccinated and unvaccinated people the same.</p>
<p>“It makes it harder to sell the benefits of getting that vaccine, certainly makes it difficult to sell a vaccine mandate, if you're telling people ... you really don't have to do anything [if you can't quarantine or isolate], just wear a mask.”</p>
