<i>is </i>clear about his concerns for Illinois.
<p><b>A source who spoke to Playbook about Mike Z,</b> also said Griffin has committed $150 million to the campaign, which would match what Pritzker spent in his first run for governor.</p>
<p><b>Other media reports have attributed “multiple sources”</b> as saying Griffin is willing to spend as much as $300 million in next year’s election.</p>
<p><b>Those numbers are all speculation,</b> according to a source close to Griffin. “The field for next year's election hasn't fully formed yet and Ken hasn't made a decision. …There is also no spending number as there is no candidate."</p>
<p><b>Still pining for Griffin's support </b>are the current field of candidates:<b> </b>state Sen. <b>Darren Bailey</b> of Xenia, former state Sen. <b>Paul Schimpf</b> of Waterloo, and businessmen <b>Gary Rabine</b> and <b>Jesse Sullivan.</b></p>

<p><b>Covid, climate change, and corruption aside,</b> 2021 was a hopeful year in Illinois. Cheers to the playbookers who made it all happen and a few "gifts"/jokes to make you smile:</p>
<p><b>For Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot: </b>Not that we condone name-calling, but a purple leather suit she can don when she’s in the mood to write some spicy emails. She could sign them: "Lori Lightfoot Raw."</p>
<p><b>For House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch: </b>A copy of Michael Madigan’s little black book (on how to raise money for the caucus) — just for emergencies.</p>
<p><b>For Senate President Don Harmon: </b>This <u><a>T-shirt that reads</a></u> “I might look like I'm listening to you but in my head I’m playing guitar.”</p>
<p><b>For Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle: </b>A Greek language book (I have a few) to help keep her ahead on the next few variants as Covid persists and she's still passing out masks and promoting vaccines.</p>
<b>For state Democratic Party Chair and Congresswoman Robin Kelly: </b>Stationery for all the thank you notes she’ll be writing to those doing the fundraising for the state party — and for the FEC for freeing her from all those chicken dinner events.
<p><b>For House Minority Leader Jim Durkin: </b>A Michael Madigan-o-meter, so he can more easily rate how much the new speaker reminds him of his predecessor. </p>
<p><b>For Senate Minority Leader Dan McConchie: </b>Group meditation sessions to help prepare his caucus for weathering their positions on Donald Trump in an election year.</p>
<p><b>For Sen. Dick Durbin:</b> A personal Illinois Playbook hotline to make sure he calls us before he blows up someone’s political career on local television. (OK, that’s really a present for us.)</p>
<p><b>For Sen. Tammy Duckworth: </b>A nautical hat because it looks like it’s smooth sailing for her in 2022.</p>
<p><b>For Rep. Adam Kinzinger:</b> A new suit for possible cable TV gigs, and a subscription to LinkedIn Premium.</p>
<p><b>For Rep. Marie Newman: </b>If she gets reelected, a do-over on the congressional office lottery where <a><u>she gets to pick her neighbors</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>For the Chicago Black and Latino caucuses:</b> A few white wards they can use to divvy up the city, wrap up the remap and call it a day.</p>
<p><b>For Ald. Marty “The General” Quinn: </b>Artillery to <a>fight against his <u>opponents</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>For Ken Griffin: </b>Another billionaire who will spend big on Illinois politics. That way, if the GOP challenger to Pritzker doesn’t win, the blame gets spread around. </p>
<p><b>For Frank Calabrese: </b>An all-access pass to his own “map room” so he can endlessly play with census data and district lines. </p>
<p><b>For Michael Madigan: </b>A mug that reads “Political Job Creator” now that the roles he had for decades — 22nd District state rep, House speaker, and state party chair — are all held by different people.</p>
<p><b>State Reps. Marcus Evans and Ann Williams:</b> A guide for installing solar panels, to help them keep selling their success in championing the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.</p>
<p><b>For the Obama Foundation:</b> A donor who funds a meeting space for Protect Our Parks on the presidential center grounds as a peace offering to those who oppose the center’s location. That seems very Obama, right?</p>
<p><b>Sports team owners Jerry Reinsdorf, Rocky Wirtz and Tom Ricketts:</b> A copy of “It’s a Wonderful Life” featuring <b>Neil Bluhm</b> playing the role of Mr. Potter.</p>
<p><b>And for the first responders, nurses and doctors:</b> Free massages to relax those weary heads and face muscles from all the eye rolling they’ve done when learning yet another patient is being hospitalized after refusing the vaccine.</p>

<b>Alan Lowenthal</b> became the fourth California House incumbent to reveal he will not be running in 2022. In a preview of inevitable member-on-member conflict, we could see three state lawmakers vying for the same L.A. supervisor seat: State Sen.

<div> <div> <header> <h1> Reid rejects Obama's trade push </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>President Barack Obama’s push for the two largest free trade deals in U.S. history has hit a major roadblock: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. </p>
<p> ( <a>PHOTOS: Max Baucus’s career</a>) </p>
<p> “Everyone knows how I feel about this,” Reid said just off the Senate floor. “Sen. Baucus knows. Sen. Wyden knows. The White House knows. Everyone would be well-advised to not push this right now.” </p>
<p> A White House official said Reid’s opposition to the trade bill didn’t come as a surprise. </p>
<p> But it’s certain to anger Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), both of whom have blasted Obama for doing too little to rally Democratic backing for the bill. </p>
<p> ( <a>PHOTOS: Harry Reid’s career</a>) </p>
<p> It also marks yet another item off the already-short list of issues on which Congress could act this year – even though, in this case, Obama and House Republicans agreed. </p>
<p> The president gave it a mention – albeit briefly – in Tuesday night’s State of the Union address. </p>
<p> ( <a>WATCH: Obama’s 2014 State of the Union speech by topic</a>) </p>
<p> Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said the president’s push for a fast-track bill is out of sync with the party’s election-year priorities. </p>
<p> Republicans, too, said they were frustrated with Obama on the issue – but their beef was that he didn’t spend more time pushing it during the State of the Union. </p>
<p> Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who introduced the legislation the bill along with Baucus and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), blasted Obama at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event Wednesday. </p>
<p> “So far I’ve been underwhelmed by the administration’s support of our bill and extremely disappointed with the efforts they’ve made to get Democrats in Congress on board,” he said. </p>
<p> Obama’s administration initially aimed to seal that deal by the end of 2013. Once that target was missed, Froman said he hopes to finish it early this year. </p>
<p> “Refusing to move forward with TPA only guarantees that foreign barriers against American goods stay in place,” Murphy said. </p>
<p> A spokeswoman for Froman, the United States’ top trade negotiator, did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p>Harry Reid stuck to his hard-nose style in public Thursday, unrepentant about losing the majority and blaming Republicans for the gridlock in the Senate. </p>
<p> But in private, the incoming minority leader has known there were a handful of Democrats ready to boot him from his job — and he moved swiftly to keep that number from growing. </p>
<p> Since last week’s elections, Reid spoke privately with many unnerved Democrats, promising to open up messaging and policy strategy to include more of them – an under-the-radar effort to keep control of the caucus. </p>
<p> ( <a>Also on POLITICO: Warren to the rescue</a>) </p>
<p> “If you would like to vote against me as leader then you will have that opportunity. I respect the will of the caucus,” Reid said, according to a person who transcribed his remarks. </p>
<p> “His overall message is, ‘We need to explore new paths to achieving results. We have to have new approaches, new ideas, new leadership,” said Sen. Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.), recounting Reid’s pitch in their private talks. </p>
<p> ( <a>Also on POLITICO: McCain preps for Senate run</a>) </p>
<p> The caucus debated for nearly four hours Thursday. </p>
<p> “The main reason for his support,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said, is that “he really listens to all the members.” </p>
<p> ( <a>Also on POLITICO: Reid's red-state defectors</a>) </p>
<p> After the 2016 elections, if he survives his own race, things could get worse for Reid if his party endures another bad day at the polls or if the caucus believes he’s to blame for a gridlocked Senate, several Democrats privately said. </p>
<p> Asked if his leadership style contributed to the Senate losses, Reid told POLITICO: “Does anybody in Nebraska know me? Or Kansas? I don’t think it had much to do with me. I don’t think most people know who I am.” </p>
<p> ( <a>Also on POLITICO: Reid taps Warren as envoy to liberals</a>) </p>
<p> Manchin, who convened a private conference call Tuesday with his fellow Democratic detractors, pushed to delay the proceedings by a week. </p>
<p> “What we asked for was to give us a week,” Manchin said. “This type of election, this type of monumental switch needs time. … We could evaluate what went wrong, what we think went wrong. These are all very legitimate questions.” </p>
<p> “I think basically whatever the game plan was, it didn’t work,” Manchin said of his party leadership’s political strategy. </p>
<p> Reid argued against a delay, saying there should be a vote at the end of the debate. “One way or the other,” he said to Democrats, “it is unquestionably the best thing for this caucus to walk out here united.” </p>
<p> “It was a lot of consternation,” McCaskill said. “People came up to me after the meeting, and said, ‘I’m glad you said some things that needed to be said.’” </p>
<p> “It’s about the perception that we need to change things, it’s just that simple. It’s just simple common sense,” McCaskill said Thursday. </p>
<p> “No,” Heitkamp said when asked about supporting Reid. “That’s all I’m going to say.” </p>
<p> Asked why she ultimately backed Reid Thursday, Shaheen said: “There wasn’t anyone else running.” </p>
<p> “I think allowing votes is important to show differences between individuals [with the] party and/or the president — or what you’re for,” Begich said in an interview. “That has not been done enough.” </p>
<p> To alleviate those concerns, Reid has privately made clear to Democrats that he will work with the incoming Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to allow scores of votes next Congress. </p>
<p> But speaking to reporters after the caucus meeting, Reid said it wasn’t his fault that the Senate didn’t do much in this election year, blaming a lack of action on Republicans who “refused to let us have a vote.” </p>
<p> “That’s the story,” Reid said, with his newly reelected leadership team standing behind him. “So anyone thinking that I stopped votes from occurring is simply not valid.” </p>
<p> It’s that warrior image that many liberal Democrats want Reid to preserve as the party enters the minority in the final two years of Obama’s presidency. </p>
<p> A more moderate Democrat, Tom Carper of Delaware, said that the voters “want us to get things done.” </p>
<p> To bridge the ideological gap in the caucus, Democratic leaders said, they enlisted the arch-liberal Warren and moderate Montana Sen. Jon Tester onto their leadership team as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. </p>
<p> “It’s good to have both wings of the party’s input strongly represented,” said Schumer, speaking publicly after staying mum in the four-hour venting session. “And that’s what we’re doing here.” </p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> Manchin slams Reid on Trump comments: 'An absolute embarrassment' </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<a>voted</a> against Reid as party leader in 2014, Manchin's criticisms of Reid were usually more mild than Friday's remarks.
<div> <div> <header> <h1> Senate goes for 'nuclear option' </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>The Senate approved a historic rules change on Thursday by eliminating the use of the filibuster on all presidential nominees except those to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p> Invoking the long-threatened “nuclear option” means that most of President Barack Obama’s judicial and executive branch nominees no longer need to clear a 60-vote threshold to reach the Senate floor and get an up-or-down vote. </p>
<p> Speaking at the White House, Obama praised the Senate action, accusing Republicans of attempting to block his nominees based on politics alone, not on the merits of the nominee. </p>
<p> “This isn’t obstruction on substance, on qualifications. It’s just to gum up the works,” he said. </p>
<p> ( <a>PHOTOS: Harry Reid’s career</a>) </p>
<p> “It’s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete,” Reid said in a lengthy floor speech on Thursday morning. </p>
<p> ( <a>Also on POLITICO: Reid: GOP playing with fire on judges</a>) </p>
<p> The blockade of three consecutive nominees to a powerful appellate court was too much for Democrats to handle — and Reid felt compelled to pull the trigger, explaining that “this is the way it has to be.” </p>
<p> “They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then reelected,” he said. “I have a right to change how I feel about things.” </p>
<p> ( <a>Earlier on POLITICO: </a> <a>Court nominees: Battleground for partisan politics</a>) </p>
<p> In his speech, Obama noted that in the few decades before he took office, about 20 nominees were filibustered. Since he took office, close to 30 judicial and political nominees have had their nominations blocked. </p>
<p> Obama also cited the filibuster of a gun control bill earlier this year, although Thursday’s rule change would preserve the filibuster for Supreme Court picks and legislation. </p>
<p> Underscoring the historic nature of Reid’s action, nearly all 100 senators were seated at their desks in the chamber — a rare sight, particularly when the Senate opens in the morning for business. </p>
<p> “You’ll regret this and you might regret it even sooner than you might think,” McConnell warned. </p>
<p> And on the other end of the Capitol, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) charged that Reid is trying to distract the public away from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p> “Sounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject,” he told reporters at his weekly news conference.“If I were taking all the incoming fire that he’s taken over Obamacare, I’d try to change the subject, too.” </p>
<p> Republicans are publicly warning that the change would simply be a path to eliminating the filibuster on everything, even on legislation — which would mean when the GOP takes the majority, Democrats will regret pushing the nuke button. </p>
<p> “You always have to take it seriously. I just think it would be incredibly short-sighted,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip. “It just seems to be something they keep coming back to when [Democrats] don’t get their way.” </p>
<p> Facing a difficult reelection bid next year, Pryor voted against the sweeping change on Thursday and quickly sought to distance himself from his party. </p>
<p> “Today’s use of the ‘nuclear option’ could permanently damage the Senate and have negative ramifications for the American people,” Pryor said. “This institution was designed to protect — not stamp out — the voices of the minority.” </p>
<p> In addition to Wilkins, Pillard and Millett, Republicans also blocked the elevation of Watt and a fourth D.C. Circuit nominee in March, Caitlin Halligan. A fifth nominee, Sri Srinivasan, was confirmed to the court unanimously in May. </p>

<div> <header> <p> Congress</p> <h1> Bad blood: Reid-McConnell relationship hits new low </h1> <p> The Senate leaders met for a rare one-on-one meeting in late November, and it couldn't have gone much worse.</p> </header> </div>
<p>Then it was McConnell’s turn to vent: Not only did he deny Reid’s charges publicly, but nearly a week later, McConnell (R-Ky.) was still privately grousing that Reid used the closed-door meeting to attack McConnell politically, sources said.</p>
<p>Often, the two leaders just talk past each other in their daily floor speeches, but on this day Reid had had enough. McConnell’s Senate, the minority leader declared, has been “the most unproductive Senate in the history of the country.”</p>
<p>“By any objective standard, this has been a very successful first year. [The Post] gave Harry three Pinocchios,” McConnell said in an interview, flashing a rare grin.</p>
<p>To McConnell and the retiring Reid, the story of which leader is to blame for turning the Senate into a gridlocked legislative wasteland most of the time often seems as important as the next accomplishment.</p>
<p>But a year after being demoted from the majority, Reid still can’t get over what he views as McConnell’s obstruction during the preceding Congress.</p>
<p>“How many filibusters has he had to overcome? I had hundreds of them,” Reid said as he ambled to his SUV on Tuesday night. “The reason he’s done well is we’ve helped him.”</p>
<p>“I probably don’t want this in print, but I’ll say it anyway. I don’t listen to much of their opening remarks,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “It’s kind of wasted energy. We’ve got work to do here.”</p>
<p>Even their harshest critics concede that Reid and McConnell both know how to seal a deal.</p>
<p>Each blames the other for the escalation of the nomination wars: Republicans say Reid started it with George W. Bush’s picks, while McConnell rarely let a nominee slip by last year without a procedural vote.</p>
<p>But their meeting on Nov. 30, marked a new nadir. Reid allies say McConnell had left the Democratic leader with the impression that his priorities were safe, only to pull them out from under Reid after it was too late to save them.</p>
<p>“That was something that Harry just couldn’t understand,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said there’s another factor souring their relationship: Reid’s brutal injury in January that occurred when an exercise band snapped and sent him flying, leaving him mostly blind in one eye.</p>
<p>Among Republicans, Reid’s name spells Senate dysfunction. Last year, the GOP, with some success, built their campaign to retake the Senate around the slogan, “Fire Harry Reid.”</p>
<p>Republicans are hoping that Reid’s heir apparent, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, will help heal the scars left by nine years of battles between McConnell and Reid.</p>
<p>“I actually think things will improve,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “Sen. Schumer is certainly capable of spinning himself up and being a tough partisan. But I think there’s also a practical side to him, too.”</p>
<p>Schumer declined to comment for this story, other than to take Reid’s side.</p>
<p>“Sen. McConnell wants to see the Senate work,” Schumer said. “But the good news for us is, to make it work, he has to do basically our agenda.”</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid don’t want you to believe everything you read: The two took to the Senate floor Thursday to complain about a POLITICO <a>story</a> about their icy relationship and insist they actually like each other. Really. </p>
<p>“I really brush aside most press. I don’t let it bother me. But once in awhile something comes along that does,” Reid said. “I just want the record to be spread that the Reid-McConnell relationship hasn’t hit a new low.”</p>
<p>“People can write all these things they want to write. But Mitch McConnell and I are friends,” Reid said. “I want the record to reflect that I have admiration for Mitch McConnell and the work he has to do.” </p>
<p>Reid then settled into his prepared remarks, blasting Republicans for not working with him to solve Puerto Rico’s financial crisis.</p>

<h2>You can draw your own congressional district</h2>
<p>Redistricting is already inherently self-interested, with lawmakers routinely drawing maps for the benefit of their party. But, in some cases, politicians are working in their literal self-interest.</p>

<p>Andrea Salinas helped Oregon Democrats muscle through a favorable new congressional map<b> </b>this fall as the chair of her state House's redistricting committee.</p>
<p>Then, just weeks later, she declared a run for one of the new seats she helped create — a maneuver that did not go unnoticed.<b> </b></p>

<p>"That's the kind of conflict of interest we all have to be aware of," said Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.). "We cannot self-deal by way of a map."</p>
<p>"We cannot be involved in that," she said. "That's not who we should be as a party that believes in good governance."</p>
<b>, </b>with Salinas getting her chance to run in the new, heavily Democratic district she helped created.
<p>Salinas’ campaign initially agreed to make the candidate available for an interview with POLITICO but declined after learning the focus of the story, citing a scheduling conflict. Shannon Geison, a campaign spokesperson, later sent a statement.</p>
<p>As a sitting state representative, Salinas is the likely front-runner in the race, though neither she nor Smith live in the district for which they are running.</p>
<b> </b>Theresa Gavarone, a leading candidate to take on Kaptur, is the chair of the state Senate's elections committee, which oversees redistricting. Kaptur wasted no time accusing her of crafting her own launching
<b> </b>and says she plans to raise the point throughout the campaign.
<p>"I will certainly do it. But I think it's important to track her participation in those Statehouse deliberations and in the national people that they listen to," she said, adding: "This is very calculated."</p>
<p>In an interview, Gavarone said she did not work on the map that GOP legislators <a>quickly rushed through</a> both chambers, outside of collecting the public's input. (She also lives outside the borders of the 9th District, where she is running.)</p>
<b> </b>map was introduced by GOP state Sen. Rob McColley, and Gavarone said she did not work with him on it and saw it only shortly before it came to her committee for a vote to be referred to the full state
<b> </b>Senate. She did not consider recusing herself from that vote ahead of a potential congressional run.
<p>"It's part of my obligation to vote on legislation that goes through the Senate," she said.</p>
<p>"He is vice chair of our statewide party," Dean said of Street. "I thought it was inappropriate for him to have drawn maps that are, a, gerrymandered and, b, self-dealing."<b> </b></p>
<p>Yet with a GOP legislature and a Democratic governor, Pennsylvania is likely to see courts draw its maps.</p>
<p>North Carolina's maps are also once again tangled in a web of litigation. But the Republican legislature approved a map that had perhaps the most obvious example of inside gamesmanship.</p>

<p>And there were other near-misses.</p>
<p>There was some chatter that Illinois Democrats managed to create a new Latino opportunity district at the 11th-hour, because, in part, the redistricting chair, state Sen. Omar Aquino, was eyeing it. (He ultimately decided not to run.)</p>

<p>TRENTON, N.J. — New Jersey Democrats prevailed Wednesday in the state’s congressional redistricting process, convincing a tiebreaker to side with their proposed map over the one submitted by Republicans.</p>
<a>the new map</a>. That’s because the state’s 7th District, represented by Rep. Tom Malinowski, will shed Democratic areas to the benefit of three other previously-vulnerable Democratic incumbents.
<p>Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., who fell just 1 point short of unseating Malinowski in 2020, now stands to be more successful in the 2022 midterms. Kean has already announced he’ll challenge Malinowski again.</p>
<p>New Jersey redistricts through a commission that includes six Democratic appointees, six Republican appointees and a tie-breaker who is selected by the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The only advantage the Democrats’ map had, Wallace said, was “partisan fairness.” However, Wallace said he didn’t base his decision on that factor.</p>
<p>Wallace was one of several Democratic recommendations to the state Supreme Court, which selected him after Chief Justice Stuart Rabner failed to get the two parties to agree on a tie-breaker.</p>
<p>Steinhardt pointed to a <a>2018 tweet</a> in which Wang said “it seems likely that between one-third and one-half of current Trump supporters meet a reasonable definition of racist” and that “the rest are okay with racists in their coalition.”</p>
<p>Janice Fuller, chair of the Democrats’ redistricting team, called Steinhardt’s comments an “unfortunate recharacterization of what happened.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you from our perspective as Democrats, Justice Wallace and his team were fair, unbiased, were challenging in terms of what they were asking for, set out clear standards and held to them,” she said.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s longest-serving member of Congress, Republican Rep. Chris Smith, would see his hometown of Hamilton placed in Kim’s Democrat-leaning district, while the remainder of Smith’s old 4th District would become even more solidly Republican.</p>
<p>Smith, who’s lived primarily in suburban Virginia for much of his 40-year tenure, <a>told New Jersey Globe</a> he would run in the reconstituted 4th District.</p>
<p>Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat-turned-Republican who became a loyalist to former President Donald Trump after he hemorrhaged Democratic support for refusing to vote to impeach him, gets a safer Republican district in South Jersey.</p>
<p>Malinowski’s redrawn 7th District could pave the way for Kean Jr. — son of the popular former New Jersey governor and scion of a centuries-old political dynasty — to enter Congress.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Malinowski did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p>

<p>Arizona, one of the most bitterly divided swing states, finalized a new congressional map that could hand the GOP six of its nine congressional districts in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the unanimous vote, the two Democratic members claimed the final product favored the GOP and was not representative of a state that is trending blue.</p>
<p>And the penultimate session was especially heated between the commissioners.</p>
<p>The partisan bickering ultimately resulted in changes that left the Schweikert and open Tucson seats more competitive. And the two Democratic commissioners, two Republicans commissioners and the chair all voted for it.</p>
<p>Those two seats are on track to host some of the most competitive races in the country next fall. Biden would have carried the new Tucson district by less than 1 point in 2020 (compared to his 11-point margin under the old lines).</p>
<p>The seat is open because Kirkpatrick is retiring in 2022. National Republicans are most excited about Juan Ciscomani, a former senior adviser to GOP Gov. Doug Ducey who raised over $600,000 last quarter.</p>
<p>Top Democratic candidates include state Sen. Kristen Engel and state Rep. Daniel Hernandez Jr., who was present in 2011 during the Tucson shooting as an intern for then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).</p>
<p>Democratic candidates include Jevin Hodge, a community leader, and Adam Metzendorf, a former executive for the Phoenix Suns, though more could enter the race.</p>
<b> </b>decided against splitting Yavapai County — though the current map does divide the county between two districts. O’Halleran’s massive seat, which spans much of the northeast portion of the state and includes the Navajo and Hopi nations,
<b> </b>will take in all of Yavapai, transforming it from a seat Biden won by 2 points to one Trump would have carried by 8 points.
<p>O’Halleran is no stranger to tough races and has fared well against baggage-laden opponents — his 2016 victory was against Paul Babeu, a county<b> </b>sheriff with a slew of legal troubles.</p>
<p>“Literally, it's one of the craziest assemblages of right-wing kookery that I've ever seen between the three of them,” said one Democratic strategist working on federal races in the state.</p>

<p>That includes a group of Democrats who might otherwise be among his fiercest critics: the Hispanic Caucus, whose members have condemned the kinds of “stop and frisk” policies Bloomberg helped promote in New York.</p>
<p>“He came across as sincere and knowledgeable about immigration and the need to get that done and make it a priority,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p>The visit comes amid a growing Washington buzz about the former New York mayor, whose campaign staff has<a> exploded in numbers</a> in recent weeks, including some former Hill aides drawn to Bloomberg’s message as well as the significant pay bump.</p>
<b> </b>But he also sought to distinguish himself with efforts in must-win states like Michigan by pointing out his massive ground game in both urban centers and smaller cities that were virtually ignored in 2016.
<p>He also nabbed his <a>first congressional endorsement</a> this week from Rep. Max Rose, a freshman Democrat from Staten Island who backed Bloomberg despite Bloomberg’s donations to his GOP opponent, former Rep. Dan Donovan, in 2018.</p>
<p>Some of Bloomberg’s staff have been quietly reaching out to more congressional offices, including Democrats who had previously endorsed Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who pulled out of the presidential race earlier this week.</p>
<p>One Democrat, who declined to be identified, described Bloomberg as “one of the biggest vultures” among the 2020 contenders — but then acknowledged the candidate's strength in the field.</p>
<p>Top Bloomberg aides also met with a group of Democratic chiefs of staff.</p>
<p>As he looks to make inroads on Capitol Hill, Bloomberg is going up against Hill heavyweights like Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who have steadily amassed far more endorsements over the past year.</p>
<p>Still, both Hispanic and black House members said Bloomberg came off as contrite for <a>his history</a> on New York City’s “stop and frisk” policy and again called it a “mistake.” </p>
<p>Bloomberg’s message, according to people in the room, was essentially: “I know I’m not the smartest guy on everything, but I know how to attract good people, talented people and I know how to delegate.”</p>
<p>At one point in the meeting, Bloomberg began speaking Spanish, a language he's been practicing for years, including with a tutor, according to attendees.</p>
<p>Sanchez, who hasn’t endorsed anyone and is uncertain whether she will before the March 3 California primary, credited Bloomberg for engaging Latino voters early. </p>
<p>“He’s the first candidate that’s not thinking about the Latino community as an afterthought or as icing on top of the cake, but as a primary bloc of voters that needs to be engaged early and continuously,” Sanchez said. </p>
<p>A majority of the Democratic Caucus has not publicly backed a candidate, and several say Bloomberg’s centrist views — and his promise to use his personal fortune to spend unprecedented sums in battleground states — have piqued their interest.</p>
<p>Many swing-seat Democrats have generally <a>gravitated toward moderate candidates</a> in the presidential primary, for fear that the liberals will imperil their reelection in red-leaning territory.</p>
<p>Asked whether he planned to make an endorsement in the Democratic presidential primary, he said: “Stay tuned.”</p>
<p>Unlike most in the 2020 field, Bloomberg has never held public office as a Democrat, let alone worked in Washington, though he holds extensive ties to the nation’s political establishment. </p>
<p>“I think that this fight will go to the floor of the convention and I think anything can happen,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.).</p>

<p>For days, then weeks, then months, so many people in a town of 2,500 were swept up in the unrest, with one particularly notable exception — the area’s most prominent Black resident, almost certainly its most prominent citizen, period.</p>

<a>never really liked,” he wrote</a> in his
<a>memoir in 2009</a>, “the idea that I was to represent my people. My parents raised me to believe that I represented humanity — people — and not black people, white people, yellow people, or any other color …”
<a>Walker said in a post on his Instagram</a> in the midst of the coast-to-coast furor in the aftermath of the police killing of Floyd. “It’s about justice.” Earlier this year
<a>he argued in congressional testimony</a> against reparations for slavery. “Slavery,” he said, “ended over 130 years ago.” And this fall he made his
<a>documented history of erratic behavior</a> and alleged threats of violence against women that he’s partly chalked up to a
<a>rare mental health condition</a> about which he
<a>announcing his candidacy in late August</a> mostly has kept a
<a>sparse public schedule</a> and granted
<a>friendly, limited interviews</a> to
<a>right-wing outlets</a>, declined to comment for this story. Talking recently, though, with one of Walker’s favorite teachers and his Beta Club adviser, I suggested that Walker at the very least would do quite well with voters in Wrightsville.
<p>Not necessarily, Jeanette Caneega told me.</p>
<p>“Probably the vast majority of whites will vote for him. He has some, some Black enemies here, going back to him becoming” — she paused to think about how she wanted to put it — “a white person.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Him not taking a stand,” she said. “You know, memories, memories — people remember things. And there’s still some resentment from even some of his classmates — Black classmates, I will say.”</p>
<p>The Black leaders of the protests and other Black luminaries wanted Walker to do something or say something because he was famous. He was famous because of football.</p>

<a>“Racial tensions,” Walker wrote in his memoir nearly 30 years on, “were always present.”</a>
<p>When he was a junior he got one of his first lessons in what would be asked of him.</p>

<a>Phillips once said in a kind of odd but spot-on koan</a>. And for all of his accomplishment and activity, Walker often retreated, seeking refuge and counsel in the homes and classrooms of his favorite coaches and teachers — the majority of them white.
