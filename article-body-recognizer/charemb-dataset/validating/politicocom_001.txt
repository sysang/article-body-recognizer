<h2>White House not budging on Feb. 1 end to student loans forgiveness</h2>
<p>At a meeting with Biden officials Wednesday, advocates tried to "sound the alarm to them about what we believe to be a very serious political mistake that they’re about to be making."</p>

<p>The White House has been pretty clear in recent days: Federal student loan payments will resume Feb. 1 as President Joe Biden lifts the nearly two-year pandemic-era pause despite pressure from many in his own party to extend it.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, that political reality has led the Biden administration to conduct Zoom meetings with allies in the student loan forgiveness space in an effort to make the resumption of loan repayments as smooth as possible. </p>
<p>But despite their no-drama intent, the confabs have not always been smooth sailing.</p>
<p>Biden's team was not moved. </p>
<p>“The Department of Education is taking a number of steps to ensure that it’s not just some sort of cold turkey” situation, the official said. “We are trying to take every step possible to do right by the borrowers.”</p>

<p>The Biden administration is considering extending the freeze on federal student loan payments amid the surge of Covid cases and pushback from Democrats who objected to sending student loan bills to tens of millions of Americans in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Education Department officials have for months publicly insisted that student loan payments would begin on Feb. 1 when the existing pandemic relief — which was extended several times by both the Trump and Biden administrations — is set to expire.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, an Education Department official indicated that the restart of student loan payments could again be postponed.</p>
<p>“Later this week, we will be announcing whether to extend the pause further,” an Education Department spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO.</p>
<p>The shift in the administration's thinking on the fast-approaching Feb. 1 deadline for restarting payments comes as the White House faced a torrent of pressure from Democrats seeking another extension of relief.</p>
<p>The White House had <a>previously said</a> it was evaluating the impact of the Omicron variant but said it was still preparing to restart the collection of monthly payments on Feb. 1.</p>
<p>Democrats on Capitol Hill had been pressuring the Biden administration to extend the relief.</p>
<p>A slew of other Democrats have also urged the Biden administration to extend the relief.</p>
<p>Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chair of the House education committee, also supports continuing the pause on student loan interest, a committee aide confirmed to POLITICO on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A coalition of labor and student and consumer advocacy groups <a>have also called</a> for an extension of the relief — as have <a>several think tanks</a> aligned with the Biden Education Department.</p>
<p>Most recently, in August, the Biden administration <a>enacted what it called a “final” extension of the relief</a>, which is set to expire at the end of January.</p>
<p>Last week, Education Department officials announced that they would allow borrowers to more easily participate in income-based repayment plans by accepting self-certification of their income, rather than requiring them to submit tax documents.</p>
<p>Department officials urged outside groups to help them get the message out about the looming restart of payments on Feb. 1 during a webinar last week.</p>
<p>Rich Cordray, the head of the Office of Federal Student Aid, who is overseeing the restart of student loan payments, said during the webinar that a smooth transition for borrowers was his “top priority” in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“It has many moving parts we’re carefully thinking through, and there are new developments almost every day, so please stay tuned.” Cordray said.</p>

<h2>White House extends student loan payment freeze</h2>
<p>The move comes as the deadline neared for the end of the current moratorium and as another wave of Covid threatens a strong, but fragile, economic recovery. </p>

<p>The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it would extend the pause on federal student loan payments through May 1 amid a surge in Covid cases fueled by the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Biden also asked borrowers to “do their part as well” and use Education Department resources to get back on track before payments resume next year. </p>
<p>Some progressives had warned that restarting student loan payments early next year would spell political disaster for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections. </p>
<p>But in recent days, the White House said they were reassessing the matter. </p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement that his agency would be focused on “ensuring a smooth return to repayment” for borrowers in May. </p>
<a><u> sent a letter to Biden earlier on Wednesday</u></a> seeking an extension of the relief, including two lawmakers—Reps. Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright—who are in vulnerable seats. The state’s Democratic senator, Bob Casey,
<a><u> told McClatchy last week</u></a> that he was also in favor of extending the relief.
<p>Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chair of the House education committee, who has not pushed for the same widespread debt cancellation as others in the Democratic caucus, also applauded the extension of the student loan relief.</p>

<p>Iowa is fine, and New Hampshire certainly has its charms.</p>
<p>“Rachel has a [direct] line to the base,” said a Democratic consultant involved in a 2020 campaign. Her viewers are older, the consultant said, “but it’s the lowest hanging fruit.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody is trying to make sure everybody gets a chance,” the person said, adding that there would be no mandates to Maddow from network brass. “Only Rachel speaks for Rachel, and that’s the beauty of that show.”</p>

<p>“Theoretically, we’d find airtime,” the producer said, “but if it’s so many, some may not get the times they’d prefer.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it a primary so much as I’d call it a caucus,” Jamieson said. “The key thing is going to be how much do you see a person, not do you see them.”</p>

<p>“As a political analyst, I feel like you have exactly the right profile of somebody who ought to run for president, with an expectation that you would do very well both in the primary and in the general election,” Maddow told the Minnesota senator.</p>
<p>And when the candidates make it on, they take pains to ingratiate themselves with the host. Klobuchar told Maddow last year, “I think I was on your show early on — I would go on every Halloween, when no one else maybe did.” </p>
<p>And in September, amid the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Harris tweeted a photograph of herself on the phone in a utility closet, apparently with Maddow on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>"Always good to talk to @maddow, even from a utility closet,” the senator wrote.</p>

<p><b>A NEW COVID TREATMENT ENTERS THE CHAT — </b>The Biden administration will begin 2022 with a new Covid-19 treatment in its arsenal after the FDA delivered its long-awaited authorization of Pfizer’s antiviral pill.</p>
<p><b>The authorization is well-timed, </b>with Omicron expected to drive a steep rise in cases this winter that officials worry could strain the health system. </p>
<p>Pfizer’s antiviral pill slashed the risk of ending up in the hospital or dying by 89 percent in clinical trials when taken three days after the start of symptoms.</p>
<p>The agency has also held off so far on authorizing a separate antiviral pill from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics that’s less effective but more readily available in the near term — further reducing the government’s anticipated stockpile.</p>
<p><b>MORE PROMISING SIGNS ON OMICRON’S SEVERITY — </b>Two new studies suggest Omicron infections may result in less severe disease than previous variants, POLITICO Europe’s Helen Collis reports.</p>
<p>During a White House Covid-19 briefing Wednesday, Anthony Fauci warned that even if the studies are right about Omicron being less severe, the sheer number of infections means many more people could end up in the hospital overall.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to count on anything when you’re dealing with a virus that has fooled us so many times before,” he said.</p>
<b>TESTING PREP FELL SHORT — </b>President Joe Biden on Wednesday acknowledged his administration could have better prepared for the spike in demand for Covid-19 tests, telling ABC News’ David Muir that “nothing’s been good enough.”
<p>Biden earlier this week announced plans to purchase 500 million at-home tests that the government would make available free on demand. But he said he “wished” he would have thought about ordering them two months ago, before Omicron emerged.</p>
<p><span><b>SCOTUS</b></span><b> TO HEAR VAX MANDATE CASE — </b>The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Jan. 7 over the administration’s vaccine-or-test requirement for large employers and its vaccine requirement for health workers.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after an appellate panel ruled that the new rules for companies could take effect and sets up a final decision on policies central to Biden’s pandemic response.</p>
<p>Several GOP-led states and other groups have challenged the rules, arguing the government doesn’t have the authority to impose such requirements.</p>
<b>DC PLANS WIDESPREAD VAX MANDATE — </b>The district will require proof of vaccination to enter many businesses, including restaurants, bars and gyms beginning in mid-January, making it the latest major city to take a hard line on Covid-19 vaccinations.
<p>Grocery stores, pharmacies, religious congregations and other retail shops will be exempt from the mandate. And even in the places where customers must be vaccinated, staff won’t be held to the same standard.</p>
<p><b>NYC TO BIDEN: HELP IS NEEDED — </b>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is appealing to the White House for more aid in fighting Omicron as cases skyrocket across the city’s five boroughs, POLITICO’s Deanna Garcia reports.</p>
<p>De Blasio on Wednesday called for the administration to accelerate manufacturing of at-home tests and monoclonal antibody treatments through the use of the Defense Production Act, saying there’s a “need to act urgently.”</p>
<p>New York City is also running its own $10 million campaign to encourage vaccination, and plans to open new testing sites to alleviate the demand crunch that’s hit as thousands of new Covid-19 cases crop up each day.</p>

<p><b>A NEW COVID TREATMENT ENTERS THE CHAT — </b>The Biden administration will begin 2022 with a new Covid-19 treatment in its arsenal after the FDA delivered its long-awaited authorization of Pfizer’s antiviral pill.</p>
<p><b>The authorization is well-timed, </b>with Omicron expected to drive a steep rise in cases this winter that officials worry could strain the health system. </p>
<p>Pfizer’s antiviral pill slashed the risk of ending up in the hospital or dying by 89 percent in clinical trials when taken three days after the start of symptoms.</p>
<p>The agency has also held off so far on authorizing a separate antiviral pill from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics that’s less effective but more readily available in the near term — further reducing the government’s anticipated stockpile.</p>
<p><b>MORE PROMISING SIGNS ON OMICRON’S SEVERITY — </b>Two new studies suggest Omicron infections may result in less severe disease than previous variants, POLITICO Europe’s Helen Collis reports.</p>
<p>During a White House Covid-19 briefing Wednesday, Anthony Fauci warned that even if the studies are right about Omicron being less severe, the sheer number of infections means many more people could end up in the hospital overall.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to count on anything when you’re dealing with a virus that has fooled us so many times before,” he said.</p>
<b>TESTING PREP FELL SHORT — </b>President Joe Biden on Wednesday acknowledged his administration could have better prepared for the spike in demand for Covid-19 tests, telling ABC News’ David Muir that “nothing’s been good enough.”
<p>Biden earlier this week announced plans to purchase 500 million at-home tests that the government would make available free on demand. But he said he “wished” he would have thought about ordering them two months ago, before Omicron emerged.</p>
<p><span><b>SCOTUS</b></span><b> TO HEAR VAX MANDATE CASE — </b>The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Jan. 7 over the administration’s vaccine-or-test requirement for large employers and its vaccine requirement for health workers.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after an appellate panel ruled that the new rules for companies could take effect and sets up a final decision on policies central to Biden’s pandemic response.</p>
<p>Several GOP-led states and other groups have challenged the rules, arguing the government doesn’t have the authority to impose such requirements.</p>
<b>DC PLANS WIDESPREAD VAX MANDATE — </b>The district will require proof of vaccination to enter many businesses, including restaurants, bars and gyms beginning in mid-January, making it the latest major city to take a hard line on Covid-19 vaccinations.
<p>Grocery stores, pharmacies, religious congregations and other retail shops will be exempt from the mandate. And even in the places where customers must be vaccinated, staff won’t be held to the same standard.</p>
<p><b>NYC TO BIDEN: HELP IS NEEDED — </b>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is appealing to the White House for more aid in fighting Omicron as cases skyrocket across the city’s five boroughs, POLITICO’s Deanna Garcia reports.</p>
<p>De Blasio on Wednesday called for the administration to accelerate manufacturing of at-home tests and monoclonal antibody treatments through the use of the Defense Production Act, saying there’s a “need to act urgently.”</p>
<p>New York City is also running its own $10 million campaign to encourage vaccination, and plans to open new testing sites to alleviate the demand crunch that’s hit as thousands of new Covid-19 cases crop up each day.</p>
<p>Amid last winter’s Covid-19 surge, ProPublica’s David Armstrong and Marshall Allen zoomed in on Los Angeles County to detail <a>the life-or-death decisions</a> overwhelmed frontline doctors were forced to make every day.</p>
<p>Covid-19 <a>defied the “droplet rule,”</a> spreading through aerosol despite decades of science saying it shouldn’t have been able to. The Wired’s Megan Molteni wrote about how mistaken notions guided early Covid rules.</p>
<p>Stat News’ Adam Feuerstein, Matthew Herper and Damian Garde in June delved into <a>Biogen’s “Project Onyx,”</a> an effort to backchannel with the FDA on the now-approved, pricey Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm — the cost of which Biogen halved this week.</p>

<b>MANCHIN WATCH: </b>There’s still some procedural work to do in the Senate before President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill,
<a>Joe Manchin</a> (D-W.V.). Manchin vocally opposes certain portions of the bill, including certain climate provisions and a tax credit for union-made American electric vehicles, and

<b>U.S. IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA BACK NEAR PRE-INVASION LEVELS: </b>The United States, the EU and G-7 countries imposed a
<a>number of sanctions</a> on Moscow in the aftermath of the 2014 invasion of Crimea and evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.
<p><b>Stepping it up:</b> President Joe Biden recently warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States would take even tougher action than it did seven years ago if Russian troops again cross into Ukraine. </p>
<b>G7 foreign ministers statement: </b>In another sign of Western resolve, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other G-7 foreign ministers issued
<a>a joint statement</a> on Sunday condemning “Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.”
<p>The foreign ministers also warned Putin that “further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response.”</p>
<a>The New York Times reported last week</a>. However, one study estimated that sanctions imposed by the United States and other western powers
<a>have cost Russian corporations almost $100 billion</a> since 2014. Those sanctions have also hurt U.S. companies, such as credit card firms.
<p>A sharp increase in energy prices has driven a rebound in the value of Russia’s exports in 2021, following a collapse in fuel demand because of the pandemic. </p>
<p>In an <a>interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,”</a> Blinken said one likely consequence of Russian military action in Ukraine would be a decision by Germany not to allow the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to become operational. </p>
<a>the membership of the U.S.-Russia Business Council</a> includes many well-known U.S. companies who could be affected by new sanctions. Those include Abbott, Boeing, Cargill, Pfizer, Google, ExxonMobil, Procter Gamble and others.
<b>CANADA ISSUES STRONGEST WARNING YET ON EV TAX CREDIT:</b>
<p>“We want to be clear that if there is no satisfactory resolution to this matter, Canada will defend its national interests, as we did when we were faced with unjustified tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum,” the Canadian officials said. </p>
<a>Chuck Schumer</a>, who is pushing to finish work on a nearly $2 trillion social spending bill that union groups hope will contain the tax credit, as well as Sen.
<a>Joe Manchin</a> (D-W.Va.) who has urged it be dropped as part of his demands to support the legislation.

<p>The Biden administration hopes all three will be confirmed before the Senate wraps up its business for the year. The nomination of Alan Estevez to be under secretary of Commerce for industry and security is also still awaiting a Senate vote. </p>
<a>Mexico</a> also challenged Trump’s action at the WTO in 2018, but suspended litigation after reaching deals with the United States.
<p>The WTO panel reviewing the cases was formed in January 2019. Under the most optimistic scenario, it should have reached a decision in six months. However, in September 2019, it informed members a decision would come “no earlier than Autumn 2020.”</p>
<p>After it blew past that date, it said it expected to release the ruling “no earlier than the second half of 2021.” In its new set of notices last week, it blamed the continuing delay on the complexity of the case and the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<a>stringent safeguards</a> to protect air travel, expressing worries that 5G could cause safety risks and schedule disruptions, although wireless trade group CTIA has called such steps unnecessary and
<a>disputed the risk</a>. Without a resolution of that fight, the FAA could end up grounding flights.
<b>— Sign of progress: </b>Airlines for America, the Aerospace Industries Association and CTIA announced Wednesday that they’ll share technical information with each other to try to resolve the aviation industry’s concerns, John and Oriana
<a>reported for Pros</a>. The FAA called this sharing agreement — which would also include the signing of nondisclosure agreements about planned 5G service — “encouraging” and said it would work on 5G testing with both sides of the dispute.
<b>— One sidenote:</b> Buttigieg has asked the FCC to consider a more restrictive set of 5G safeguards proposed by the aviation industry,
<a>according to The Wall Street Journal</a>. Those go beyond the wireless industry’s own 5G mitigation plans, which Rosenworcel has supported.
<b>— Not new to this: </b>As a 2020 presidential contender, Buttigieg took the rare move of invoking the C-band airwaves as part of his campaign — a decidedly wonky issue that none of his rivals were touching. His

<p><b>HAVE YOU HEARD THIS BEFORE? </b>It’s shaping up to be a crucial week for President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. </p>
<p>There are now less than two weeks until Christmas, which Senate Majority Leader <a>Chuck Schumer</a> has set as the goal for passing the Democrats’ large social spending package. </p>
<a>Ron Wyden</a> (D-Ore.) released revised tax language over the weekend, and the Senate parliamentarian should offer more details about what provisions can’t be passed under budget reconciliation.
<a>Joe Manchin</a> (D-W.Va.), the key holdout as Democrats try to get the climate and safety net measure across the finish line in the Senate.
<a>Kyrsten Sinema</a> (D-Ariz.) and other Democrats on the tax section late last week, our Burgess Everett reports — as he tries to make good “
<a>on his repeated vows</a> to finish work on the climate and social policy legislation in the next two weeks.”
<p>And on a related note: Democrats are <a>really hanging their hopes</a> on the year-end expiration of the expanded Child Tax Credit spurring some action, as Sarah Ferris and Marianne LeVine noted. </p>
<p>The big question there: Lawmakers do love a deadline to force them to act. But Manchin has sounded at times ambivalent about the monthly payments of up to $300 per child, so will that be enough to get him on board this month?</p>
<p><b>MORE ON THAT IN A BIT, </b>but first thanks for joining the “this is all for 2021 version” of Morning Tax. </p>
<a>an unsavory reputation</a>.”)
<p>You have our permission to spoil this newsletter with scoops.</p>
<p><b>BACK TO MANCHIN: </b>It’s not as if there’s been any shortage of focus on the West Virginia Democrat throughout this whole process. But if possible, that might have only intensified in recent days. </p>
<p>And in fact, the Republican who requested the CBO report, Sen. <a>Lindsey Graham</a> of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that Manchin suggested that he ask for the estimate. </p>
<p>Not only that: Graham used his time on the show to openly lobby Manchin to oppose the bill. “Joe Manchin, if you're watching, you were right, Joe. You got this right. It is a lie,” he said.</p>
<p><b>THE LATEST FROM FINANCE: </b>Wyden <a>dropped some tweaks</a> to the social spending measure’s tax provisions on Saturday — the biggest probably being a carveout for pensions in the proposed corporate minimum tax.</p>
<p>Any income increases that big corporations get from the growing value of the pension plans they offer would essentially be exempt from the corporate book tax, under the Democrats’ latest proposal.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats have been trying to limit the amount of changes they make to the tax section of the BBB, even though the measure was always bound to need another vote in the House if and when it passes the Senate. </p>
<p>Some clean energy advocates also lobbied to ensure that their projects weren’t hurt by the book tax’s limits on quicker write-offs for investments, but Wyden — a champion for clean energy incentives — has so far brushed aside those efforts.</p>
<p>Among the other changes over the weekend, via Pro Tax’s Brian Faler: Wyden loosened proposed restrictions on writing off business interest, in exchange for expanding the reach of anti-inversion rules. </p>
<p>Tax provisions aren’t supposed to be among the most hot-button issues before the parliamentarian this week — think matters like immigration there. But we have some ideas about proposals that could be in the crosshairs. </p>
<p>The big question on both of those would seem to be whether the proposals’ budgetary impact is, in Senate parlance, a “merely incidental” part of the provision. </p>
<p><b>As we were saying: </b>“Canada <a>threatens U.S. with retaliatory tariffs</a> in EV tax credit dispute,” via our Zi-Ann Lum.</p>
<p><a>That was the case</a> that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made to Democrats late last week, as our Laura Barron-Lopez reported. </p>
<p>But with that in mind, it can be useful to know just how much in offsets Democrats would need to find to keep extending the benefits in the Build Back Better measure. </p>
<p>To put that another way: Who knows what the composition of future Congresses will look like, but let’s not forget how difficult it has been for Democrats to cobble together tax increases this year.</p>
<p>Sen. <a>Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minn.) got into that issue on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, in the process bringing up one of the tax hikes that ended up getting vetoed by Sinema — increasing the corporate rate from 21 percent to 25 percent.</p>
<p>“Every point you bring it up, if you brought it up to, say, 25 percent, that's $400 billion,” Klobuchar said. “That's still on the table. So, why do I bring that up, is that there are still ways to pay for things going forward.”</p>
