<a>films</a> on seed production.
<p>Seed saving is more than just growing; it is about our past and our future, about all the diversity we’ve inherited from those before us and what we choose to send into the future.</p>
<p>The old year’s gardening has nearly ended. The new one’s waiting in the pots. Tulip and narcissi bulbs planted in lasagne style, semi-sleeping under the soil.</p>
<p>The yellow roses are pruned, the last few flowers in a vase. I will leave the ‘Bengal Crimson’ rose to bush. The stellata has lost its leaf. Autumn is now all swept away. Furry magnolia buds in numbers like never before carry our wishes.</p>
<p>There are new hellebores: four of these Christmas roses, from deep purple to tinted red, and a white. An early-morning impulse buy to soften the austere late year.</p>
<p>The drive home with the bird in the car and tree in the trailer is the true start to our holiday. Merry Christmas everyone.</p>
<p>Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now. Order it for £8.49 from guardianbookshop.com</p>
<p>So how was it for you? 2021? It was an odd year at the plot. Old winter crops left to flower into summer. Brassicas towering. Gastropods feasting. Almost a glimpse into a post-apocalyptic gardening world.</p>
<p>Howard and Rose grew a memorial plot to Rose’s grandmother. A shaded spot. Making a virtue out of austerity. Highlight for me there, the overwintered chicory flowering sky-blue deep into autumn.</p>
<p>Purest tagetes Ildkongen, too, refreshed with new stock from Signe (copenhagenseeds.dk). Sprawling scarlet bushes, tall and confident. Self-seeding amaranth (Hopi Red Dye) and orache spread and added extra height.</p>
<p>As the year shudders to a stop, from Howard and Rose, Mary and me, wishing you all a happy, healthy 2022.</p>

<p>1 Short-term solutionsHow long do you anticipate staying in your home? Whether you rent or own, if you think you might end up moving within the next year or so then you probably don’t want to splash out on a big-ticket item such as a sofa.</p>
<p>Renting can help you bypass these dilemmas. You get what works for your present circumstances without having to worry about long-term commitment or van sizes.</p>
<p>2 SpeedAnyone who has ever bought a sofa – especially during the lockdowns – will know that some places can take more than three months to deliver your new purchase.</p>
<p>When you’re not trying to figure out if you’ll still love that distinctive fabric in 10 years’ time, decision-making becomes much more straightforward.</p>
<p>So do your bit to protect our planet, and don’t let your next sofa go to waste.</p>
<p>For more information about Sofology’s sofa rental service click <a>here</a></p>
<p>Stylish shapes, attractive colours and cool modular features – how a sofa looks is important, yet it needs to be comfortable, sustainable and stand up to modern life, too. After all, we sit on our sofas every day.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t end there. Conscious and clever innovations have resulted in a host of beautiful upholstery fabrics spun with yarns made from recycled plastics.</p>
<p>One company making the shift is Sofology, with the introduction of its Sustainable Edit, an eco-friendly collection that includes four modern sofa styles available in a wide choice of colours and configurations.</p>
<sup>®</sup> Blue (a soft fibre made with 50% recycled plastic from the Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that aims to reduce ocean plastic waste).
<p>Its selection of upholstery fabrics span a palette of pale neutrals, muted tones and bold brights. Made with (or including) recycled polyester, these fabrics are repeatedly recyclable, supporting the circular economy.</p>
<p>A good way to go green is to ditch throwaway culture and choose products that will last, so look for sofas with at least a 20-year guarantee.</p>
<p>The unwanted furniture goes to one of 600 waste disposal centres, where any metals, wood and textiles are recycled or repurposed.</p>
<p>Short-term solutionNot everyone is looking for longevity in their interiors, so it’s refreshing to see brands offering furniture rental.</p>
<p>Hiring your sofa solves the conundrum of what to buy if you’re renting a property, or will be moving on after a short time. It’s a much more sustainable choice than short-term shopping.</p>

<p>The dining chair can do one. The swivel chair? It can go swivel. The best seat in my house, hands down, is the sofa.</p>
<p>It’s my happy place. Relaxing with a blanket and a biscuit is my favourite thing to do. And when I fish around between the cushions I often find a pound or two – the sofa is the seat that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Where do you go after a long day? The morning after a hard night? Where do I send my partner to sleep when he’s not filled the dishwasher properly? The sofa, obviously. It’s one hundred and one things in one, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>It’s where I hide myself behind cushions. It was my first proper grown-up purchase. It’s where my dog farts and wakes himself up.</p>
<p>My sofa is the best babysitter an uncle could ask for. The kids spend hours making dens, assault courses, even a trampoline when they think I’m not looking.</p>
<p>Sofology’s Sustainable Edit range includes sofas that save water and plastic and, thanks to its green credentials, saves me from feeling guilty for sitting on the sofa all day in my pants.</p>
<a>Loop</a> lets you have your rented sofa for as long as you want, and it’s completely sustainable. When you’re done, nothing goes to landfill. Every little bit – from the back and the feet, to the arms and the sides – can be recycled and repurposed.
<p>Sofa, what would I do without you?</p>
<a>Don’t be judge-rental: five reasons why you should rent your next sofa</a>
<section> <div> Topics <div> <ul> <li> <a> Are you sitting consciously? </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </section>
<p>Light or shade? It loves bright, direct full sunlight.</p>
<p>Where should I put it? On a south-facing windowsill in a room with dry air. It’s best to avoid damp bathrooms or kitchens.</p>
<p>Did you know…Opuntia is named after the ancient Greek region of Opuntian Locris, the capital city of which was Opus. </p>
<p>Perched 550 metres above sea level in the Swiss resort village of Arosa is a three-bedroom ski chalet that proves that a small space can feel expansive – and that, sometimes, a dated interior doesn’t need ripping out.</p>
<p>“We wanted to adopt its 70s spirit and not force a wooden ‘mountain chic’ look on to it,” she says. “To freshen it up without erasing its identity, which had been what attracted us in the first place.”</p>
<p>Another major job was changing the outdated 70s windows for higher-performance ones. Silberschmidt kept their arched shape, but opted for darker frames to better highlight the landscape outside. </p>
<p>The show will also see Anu perform songs from that 2014 Christmas album and share stories from her own childhood, which was spent between Cairns and the Torres Strait.</p>
<p>Here, she tells us why that misplaced gift holds such significance to her, as well as the story of two other important belongings.</p>
<h2>What I’d save from my house in a fire</h2>
<p>For me, the locks are something irreplaceable – more so than an item of baby clothing or a toy from that time.</p>
<p>I would have to say my “pen” for an iPad/iPhone, which has a rubber tip similar to a stylus.</p>
<p>I find myself constantly using it with my phone. Because it’s fine-pointed it makes anything I am doing a lot quicker as I don’t type with two hands. It’s also helpful in swiping on the surface of my phone or tablet.</p>
<h2>The item I most regret losing</h2>
<p>The item is something I think about often: a greenstone carving necklace that was given to me and carved by New Zealand artist George Nuku.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Christmas in Australia airs at 8.30pm on Tuesday 21 December on ABC TV</p></li> </ul>
<p>With the <a>Christmas</a> decorations, mum rules with a rod of iron – and takes away all the fun</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember we’ve called my mum “Mrs Claus”, because she really gets into the spirit of Christmas. Her mother was the same – it’s traditional. But the decorating process is never without tension.</p>
<p>My children should be grateful I make the effort to decorate the house, and respect my feelings</p>
<p>When Ciara smashed a bauble that was precious to me, she was like, “Oh, well.” But it had been in the family for years. I don’t think I reacted too badly – she’s exaggerating. But Ciara doesn’t realise that decorations have sentimental value.</p>
<h2>The jury of Guardian readers</h2>
<p>Should Aileen stop being a Christmas decoration tyrant?</p>
<p>I side with the prosecution. Christmas baubles are delicate, and breakages are inevitable. Aileen also upsets her family when she rearranges the decorations, creating tension.Jan, 69</p>
<p>So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Aileen stop being so picky about the Christmas decorations?</p>
<p>We’ll share the results on the next You be the judge, in two weeks’ time.</p>
<p>The poll closes on Thursday 23rd December, 9AM GMT</p>
<p>26% of you said no – Jay is innocent 74% of you said yes – Jay is guilty</p>

<p>Light or shade? As a variegated plant, it requires light – but opt for bright indirect sunlight. The reduced amount of chlorophyll means it will be easier to scorch some of the near-white leaves.</p>
<p>Did you know … A mutation in the plant’s chlorophyll formation give it that unique marbled or half-moon appearance.</p>

<p>But The Fairytale also looks at ruthless competitions of a different kind: reality TV, or “the fairytale that we can all win Masterchef”.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what: write a book, start publicising a book, start reading a book for an audio book, then start answering questions you’ve never thought about, like, ‘what’s the thing you most regret losing?’ I consider myself flat out at work.”</p>
<h2>What I’d save from my house in a fire</h2>
<p>So we guard against the fear every day that a wisp of smoke will curl above Rooting King Lodge and we’ll have to make a dash to rescue the King. It’s a very big and concerning issue, because it would be un-Australian to let the King go.</p>
<h2>The item I most regret losing</h2>
<p>In 2005, there was a very bad earthquake in the north of Pakistan. Now, the Australian Defence Force sent a medical team to help with the rescue operations and as luck would have it, the PM John Howard was at a loose end and went along.</p>
<p>A gloriously grotesque concrete bird bath in the shape of three cats sitting on top of each other, with one holding the dish part.</p>
<p>My hot glue gun, because making ridiculous headdresses with it kept me sane over lockdown. Plus, in a pinch, you can use it to hem a skirt. I will take no further questions.</p>
<p>Also, I regret losing the ability to stand up from a sitting position without making a “hgnnnnnrrgh” noise.</p>

<p>The Cumbre Vieja volcano on the island of La Palma started erupting almost two months ago. The lava has caused widespread damage as it has poured into the ocean and solidified. </p>

<p>The end of December will mark two years since the world discovered an outbreak of a new virus in Wuhan, China. What followed was a difficult time for countries across the globe and many lives have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Laali was alone at home when she realised her legs were drenched in blood. The bleeding did not stop for eight hours. As she fell unconscious, the 25-year-old thought she would die alongside the foetus she was losing.</p>
<p>She had been three months pregnant when she was taken for prenatal sex determination. “When I learned it was a girl, I started feeling as though I was suffocating,” she says. </p>
<p>An abortion pill was forced down her throat, without a doctor’s supervision, and subsequent complications led to hospitalisation. The night she was released, Laali cried herself to sleep – and in the morning returned to her work in the fields.</p>
<p>Prenatal sex determination was criminalised in 1994, but it is a widely flouted law. The practice has thrived with medical advancements, spread to more regions, and is still easily accessible in privately run clinics.</p>
<p>Surrounded by vast sugar cane fields, Laali’s village is 40 miles from Delhi. Social health activists who run an unregistered support group for women here estimate that “every third house in the village” has aborted a foetus because of the sex.</p>
<p>“Families want a son at any cost. Any cost!” Laali says. “If I die, my husband will remarry tomorrow morning, hoping the next woman will give birth to a son.”</p>
<p>Laali was 19 when her marriage was arranged with a farmer in 2009. In the next three years, she gave birth to two daughters. During her second pregnancy, she was regularly drugged by traditional and faith healers in order to “make” a boy.</p>
<p> Every night, as she sat down for dinner after a day of labour in the field, someone would toss in a taunt. “When anyone had a son in the village, it was a nightmare for me,” she recalls. “My family abused me in front of my girls.”</p>
<p>Dr Prabhat Jha of the University of Toronto, who led India’s <a>Million Death Study</a>, agrees: “The UN <a>Population Division</a>, the most careful demographic work, estimates the number of ‘excess men’ in India is growing.” </p>
<p>India’s own registrar general’s estimate suggests a similar trend.</p>
<a>forced to abort eight times</a> to satisfy the family’s desire for a son. She was given more than 1,500 hormonal and steroid injections before she lodged a police complaint. Last year, in southern India’s Karnataka, a 28-year-old woman
<a>died after complications</a> during a third forced abortion.
<a>Women</a> like Meenakshi are fighting for acceptability in the family. Meenakshi’s parents raised her to expect freedom after marriage. But everything is worse, she says, sobbing.
<p>For Laali, harassment is part of her daily life. By the time she was 15, her mother had aborted two female foetuses, and her younger sister has aborted at least three.</p>

<p>It comes as Gibraltar struggles to shake off a reputation as a global tax haven, with the government having sued a <a>Spanish newspaper</a> in an attempt to restore its global standing.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to do naughty things in crypto, you wouldn’t be in Gibraltar, because the firms are licensed and regulated, and they aren’t anywhere else in the world,” Isola says.</p>
<p>Poulden is the chairman of Valereum, which is based in Gibraltar and focuses on providing technology for linking mainstream conventional currencies such as the pound and the dollar with crypto assets.</p>

<p>He stresses that the country’s regulator has approved applications for only 14 firms over three years, a number that he claims speaks to the rigours of the licensing scheme. “It’s hardly a gold rush,” he says.</p>
<p>The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission declined to comment on the Valereum deal.</p>
<p>Gender differences exist in trauma exposure. PTSD is twice as common in women than in men, according to a study conducted by Kathryn Magruder at the University of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Yet they face additional obstacles when seeking support after their deployment.</p>
<p>However, on 6 December, House and Senate armed service committee leaders tried to block the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, which would enable veterans to report sexual assault to a neutral third party.</p>
<p>She couldn’t do anything to help. Eleven years later, she still feels that guilt and hears those sounds.</p>
<p>Post-military support at the time, she maintains, was significantly lacking.</p>
<p>Felicia wishes she had access to these sorts of resources when she came home. Instead, during a 10-minute evaluation, it was determined she did not have PTSD, and that her grief stemmed only from her mother’s death.</p>
<p>She was furious and felt unheard.</p>
<p>Looking back, she believes that better healthcare policies for female veterans would have encouraged her to open up about her experiences and struggles sooner. Instead, she dealt with her feelings alone until she needed life-saving help.</p>
<p>She could not, however, turn off the memories of the trauma hospital. As the mother of two young daughters, it tugged at every maternal instinct she had.</p>
<p>American male service members were not permitted to work at the hospitals. Only because she was female could she see what she now can’t forget.</p>
<p>The waiting room that November day was bustling with uncles, fathers, cousins and brothers.</p>
<p>Now, Medina revisits Liz’s thoughts back in Virginia. She appears in flashbacks when Liz looks at baby photographs of her youngest daughter. She comes to mind when Veterans Day is celebrated on national television.</p>
<p>Was the girl still alive? Could Liz have done more to help her? Was she attending school amid the Taliban’s ever-increasing restrictions on women’s freedom?</p>
<p>Liz had flown to Afghanistan fearless and determined in 2010 but returned to the US four months later, injured and traumatized.</p>
<p>In the weeks after her deployment, Liz felt as if she were watching someone else’s life in a movie. Physically, she was home, but mentally, she was in Kandahar.</p>
<p>Jen, like Liz, was working in Afghani hospitals because she was a woman. She, too, was haunted by a girl who had lost a foot. But, more, she was haunted by the long-term impacts of sexism and abuse in the military.</p>
<p>Jen was sexually assaulted by her supervisor at a US military base, months before she was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010.</p>
<p>She was made to report it through her chain of command, but was quickly stopped in her tracks. Everyone loved the man she was accusing.</p>
<p>“We’re so glad to have him back,” said the male officer who handled her complaint.</p>
<p>Jen wanted to deploy abroad. She knew no one would believe her. So she stopped, fearing that as a victim, she would be isolated.</p>
<p>Serving at Buckley Space Force Base in Denver, Colorado, when she returned stateside from August 2011 to 2014, things got worse.</p>
<p>Jen started to go through some of the lowest moments of her life.</p>
<p>No one wanted to hear her story.</p>
<p>Although women are the fastest-growing veteran demographic, she believes that some men still don’t think of women serving in roles of high stress or exposure.</p>
<p>Currently, the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act is being blocked. If the act had been passed when Jen was on active service, she would have reported her sexual assault.</p>
<p>Workers at the American Red Cross charity are speaking out about what they say is low pay, chronic understaffing, poor working conditions throughout the pandemic and proposed cuts to their healthcare.</p>
<p>He described Red Cross’ response to the pandemic as business as usual, as the non-profit ramped up blood drives anywhere they were able to hold them, since many typical blood drive sites closed when the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>Ford also criticized the American Red Cross for doing little to nothing to clarify to the public that the blood donation drives were just testing for Covid-19 antibodies, not performing Covid-19 testing and providing inadequate PPE to workers.</p>
<p>“People are quitting,” added Ford. “It’s a slap in the face to the employees for management to say ‘we’re going to cut your healthcare and not pay you anything, while we’re going to work from home and be safe.’”</p>
<p>The unions are pushing for wage increases, to preserve existing healthcare plans and for solutions to address chronic staffing shortages around the US.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross reported a revenue of more than $2.8bn in the 2020 fiscal year and the CEO of the non-profit received a salary of more than $700,000.</p>
<a>about 40%</a> of the nation’s blood supply.
<p>Workers who collect and manage blood donations for the non-profit continued working throughout the Covid-19 pandemic as essential workers.</p>
<p>She said the low pay and forced overtime led to worsening understaffing through the pandemic, with management rushing new hires through training and blaming existing staff when errors were made as a result.</p>
<p>“Staff are being sent home for 10 to 14 days at a time, unpaid,” added Terrell. “We’re on the frontlines doing the job for them of collecting these life-saving products and basically they’re telling us that it’s at our own risk.”</p>
<p>They noted employees were provided with pay to quarantine in Spring 2020 and from 21 November 2020 to 2 April 2021.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added: “Our intention is to reach a fair and amicable agreement with the Coalition of Red Cross Unions and all of our local unions.”</p>
<p>At the entrance of Kibagare, a slum in Nairobi’s outskirts, boots of dead gangsters dangle from electricity wires that hover over ramshackle homes of wood and iron sheets.</p>
<p>With little state protection from crime, angry local people will often take the law into their own hands and beat an offender who is caught in the act, sometimes to death.</p>
<p>Throughout a decade of crime and drug abuse, Peter Wainaina, 32, narrowly escaped death on several occasions, until he retired from the underworld in 2009. Since then, he has guided hundreds of criminals to do the same.</p>
<p>“I suffered at the hands of the police,” claims Wainaina. “I was tortured and unlawfully detained. But I also met good police who gave me a second chance, which I am now extending to my peers.”</p>

<a>Kenya</a>, Steve Musau. “Being in poverty also stirs up peer pressure where those [involved] in drugs or crime tend to inspire others negatively.”
<p>Kelvin Mwanga’s life was changed by Wainaina. Once a criminal who mugged and threatened people, he now works as a bus conductor on the busy Waiyaki Way, west of the capital.</p>
<p>Mwanga, 26, says Wainaina’s efforts to turn him away from crime began in 2016. “At first, I wouldn’t hear him out. It was not until 2019, when I was caught by a mob and then arrested that 2Sharp’s persuasion made me decide to change,” he says.</p>

<p>A Madagascan minister was one of two survivors to have swum about 12 hours to shore after their helicopter crashed off the island’s north-east coast, authorities said.</p>
<p>A search was continuing for two other passengers after Monday’s crash, the cause of which was not immediately clear, police and port authorities said.</p>
<p>“My time to die hasn’t come yet,” says the general, adding he is cold but not injured.</p>
<p>The helicopter was flying him and the others to inspect the site of a shipwreck off the north-east coast on Monday morning.</p>
<p>At least 39 people died in that disaster, police chief Zafisambatra Ravoavy said Tuesday, an increase from an earlier toll after rescue workers retrieved 18 more bodies.</p>
<p>Ravoavy earlier told AFP that Gelle had used one of the helicopter’s seats as a flotation device.</p>
<p>“He has nerves of steel.”</p>
<p>Gelle became minister as part of a cabinet reshuffle in August after serving in the police for three decades.</p>

<p>About 40,000 people have been made homeless by demolition works for a major Chinese-backed toll road in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.</p>
<p>At least one person has died in a partially demolished building, with unconfirmed reports of children being injured in the chaos, says Amnesty’s Diana Gichengo.</p>
<a>publicly announced on 8 October</a>, started only three days later. Heavy road-building machinery, some bearing government logos and flanked by Kenyan police, flattened homes and businesses along a 30-metre-wide strip of Catherine Ndereba Road.
<p>“I got a call [from a neighbour] that my house was going to be demolished,” says Mary Ndhamba, who works in Briton school, next to the cleared area, which is now a landscape of rubble, sewage and scattered personal effects.</p>
<p>Ndhamba got a lift on the back of a motorbike and raced home. “There were police beating people and launching teargas. People were scattering and as we approached I could see the bulldozers were less than 100 metres from my house.”</p>
<p>She was only able to save her bedframe. Police “started caning people”, when the diggers were just metres away, says Ndhamba, who claims she had to kneel in front of them to beg “not to be hit”.</p>
<p>“I ran to safety,” he adds. “I was lucky. When I came back to look for my belongings I saved my mattress, but everything else had been destroyed or picked up by street boys to sell.”</p>
<p>The road is financed by the Chinese state-owned <a>China</a> Road and Bridge Corporation, which will use the tolls to recoup their $550m (£410m) investment.</p>
<a>mode of transport</a>, accounting for 45.6% of commuters, compared with 40.7% by bus, 13.5% by private vehicle, and 0.2% by rail. People walk because they cannot afford a bus fare.
<a>between Kenya’s rich and poor</a>. Even its bus lane is expected to carry only larger coaches, not the matatus favoured by the poor.
<a>half of Nairobi’s population (more than 2 million) live on just 5% of the city’s residential areas in slums</a> lined by rutted, ill-kept roads, while the green suburbs of the large, neat houses in the wealthy suburbs are far better served.
<p>“My kids are supposed to be going to school. How can we pay for it now?” asks Muiruri, who is staying with a friend. “I have nothing now, nothing. We don’t know the way forward.”</p>
<p>Orbit Chemical Industries bought the site in 1987. The firm wanted to build a factory but was unable to, as the land was inhabited. After years of legal wranglings, Orbit Chemical says it decided, in 2008, to try to sell the land off in parts.</p>
<p>Questions are being asked about how heavy government equipment and state police were used to clear private and donated land without notice.</p>
<p>Orbit Chemical was hoping their division of land would provide a model for the development of proper housing and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The road will make up part of China’s <a>belt and road initiative</a>, an ambitious agenda to link <a>land and sea trade routes</a> across Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>“People are desperate, so when you bring the building materials people will fight to get the sheets and it will create violence in the community,” says Kyee.</p>

<div> <time> Published: 4 Nov 2021 </time> </div> The British army has serious questions to answer about the alleged killing of Agnes Wanjiru
<p>At a meeting between police and community members in Kibera, Africa’s largest slum in Nairobi, Kenya, where crime is acutely high and mainly unreported, the two sides try to find common ground.</p>
<p>There are courteous introductions and then an appeal for openness – and information – to help the police tackle Kibera’s crime problems.</p>
<p>A young man asks why officers take bribes and extort money from the community. “That is corruption,” responds Insp Nick Sulwe of Kibera’s administration police, firmly. “To eliminate it you must comply with the law.”</p>
<p>“If you’re arrested, you will more than likely pay not to be arrested.”</p>
<p>A young woman refers to <a>the case of Carilton Maina</a>, a 23-year-old allegedly shot dead by police months earlier. She wants the inspector to explain why suspects were not simply taken into custody. “You are just killing us,” she tells him.</p>
<a>killings</a> in 2018 vary significantly. One organisation puts the figure at 121, another at 267 – which would mark a significant increase on the previous year, when there were an estimated 152.
<a>film</a> shooting an apparently handcuffed, unarmed suspect. That was in 2017; it appears that in 2019 little has changed.
<a> robberies</a>, there have been interventions in order to
<a> free corrupt officers from detention</a>, and, in one case,
<a>a previously maimed suspect was kidnapped from hospital</a>, and their body discovered days later with gunshot wounds.
<a>Human rights</a> watchers are still awaiting Kenya’s director of public prosecutions Noordin Haji to make a decision over whether or not the officer implicated in the shooting of Maina will be charged.
<a>Independent Policing Oversight Authority</a> were monitoring 9,878 outstanding complaints against police, of which 5,085 were earmarked for detailed investigation.
<p>It takes little to trigger angry confrontations between stone-throwing mobs and police, who retaliate with tear gas and automatic gunfire.</p>
<a> 1,000</a> lives across Kenya. In August 2017,
<a>24 people died</a> following the presidential vote, including a
<a>inquest</a> ruled that 36 officers should be held liable for the death.
<p>In 2017, Kenya’s police force <a>recorded</a> just 77,992 crimes. In 2018, there were 88,268 recorded crimes, a 13% increase across a population of 52 million.</p>
<p>“If we find that someone is committing burglary we go and see their parents and give them a warning. If the person does not respond, then when we catch up with them we act,” said Sulwe, who would not be drawn into explaining what “act” meant.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made to interview the superintendent in charge of policing Kibera. He agreed, and then later declined unless we offered payment.</p>
<a>. Independent monitors </a>suggest that between 2013 and 2017, at least 765 people have been unlawfully killed by police. It is alleged that 572 people have been “summarily executed” in circumstances similar to those surrounding the death of Maina.
<p>According to <a>Democracy in Africa</a>, victims were mainly men aged 18–24, killed “on their way to commit a crime”. Most cases were reported by the victim’s mother or wife, rather than by police. </p>
<p>In a written response, a spokesperson for Kenya’s police force said there are no policies, orders or directives to support unlawful killings.</p>
<p>“In cases where the cause of death is not outrightly clear, an inquest is held by a magistrate to establish the cause of death. Any person found culpable is charged in accordance to the law,” the spokesperson stated.</p>
<p>“Unfounded utterances against the police not only dents a good image but has the potential to discourage would-be investors and visitors to our country.”</p>
<a>killed 157 people in 2020</a>, up from 144 the previous year, according to Missing Voices, a group of organisations investigating unlawful killings in Kenya.
<a>inquest found that five senior police officers </a>involved in the policing of the protests were responsible, but the court case has yet to begin.
<p>Carilton Maina, a Leeds University student, was <a>shot dead in December 2018</a>. The officer who allegedly shot him pleaded not guilty to murder in April 2020. Now the inquest file has been declared missing.</p>
<p>The failure to appoint 41 judges, as recommended by the Judicial Service Commission, as well as interference from lawyers and judicial staff are other factors which cause delays. In some instances, victims give up on their quest for justice.</p>
<p>Feeling powerless is something Kinuthia can identify with. His son’s death has left the family materially and emotionally worse off. Kinuthia’s mental and physical health has suffered. </p>
<p>“The first day I went to court and saw the [alleged] perpetrators, the tears started flowing,” he says. “I asked myself, why did they have to take someone who had potential in life? Why couldn’t they come for me?”</p>
<p>Peaceful demonstration in Nairobi a response to increase in violence and killings during the coronavirus curfew</p>
<p>A crowd of up to 200 people peacefully marched through Mathare slum in Nairobi on Monday to protest against police brutality and an increase in extrajudicial killings in the Kenyan capital.</p>
<p>She said police often target young men after dark. “You can’t understand,” she said. </p>
<p>“We are here to protest against police killing us in the name of protecting us from corona. The police have killed us more than corona,” said another protester, Sobukwe Nonkwe, 30, a filmmaker, whose friend was shot and killed by the police.</p>
<p>At least 15 people have been killed by police, and 31 people injured since the curfew was imposed, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said last week.</p>
<p>“I am here today to talk on behalf of all the boys out there that can’t speak for themselves. They are so scared of the police,” said Faith Adoyo, 20. Adoyo’s brother was left critically injured after being beaten in the street by police.</p>
<a>documented eight cases</a> of police killings in less than two months.
<a>Last year</a>, HRW reported that police killed “dozens” of men and boys in two poor areas of Nairobi, “apparently with no justification”.
<p>At the end of the march, police used teargas to disperse the crowd. </p>

<p>All of the mandates are scheduled to take effect on 4 January.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit contends that the CMS vaccine requirement is unprecedented and unreasonably broad, affecting even volunteers and staff who don’t typically work with patients.</p>
<p>“The mandate is a blatant attempt to federalize public health issues involving vaccination that belong within the States’ police power,” said the suit filed by Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt, a Republican who is running for US Senate.</p>

<p>An estimated 6.8 million fewer female births will be recorded across <a>India</a> by 2030 because of the persistent use of selective abortions, researchers estimate.</p>
<p>India is estimated to have 63 million fewer women since sex determination tests took off in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Indian police regularly arrest gangs who offer tests to pregnant women, often charging up to £400. The arrests usually follow a tipoff or the use of a pregnant woman as a decoy.</p>
<p>Sikar had the worst child sex ratio of Rajasthan’s 33 districts, according to the 2011 census – 888 girls born per 1,000 boys.</p>
<p>Early marriage plays a part in aborting female foetuses as girls are often neither well-informed nor confident enough to challenge anyone in their husband’s family.</p>
<p>According to Girls Not Brides, <a>about 27% of girls in India</a> are married before they turn 18. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, said recently that he was considering <a>raising the legal age of marriage</a> for girls from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>According to the <a>UN population fund</a>, India and China account for more than 90% of the estimated 1.2 to 1.5 million missing female births worldwide each year because of selective abortion.</p>
<p>The fifth National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) carried out by the government between 2019 and 2021 has found India now has 1,020 women for every 1,000 men.</p>
<p>The survey of about 650,000 households also found that India’s reproductive rate had dropped to an average of 2, which is the first time it has been below replacement fertility levels. In urban areas, it was even lower at 1.6.</p>
<a>girls killed</a> before or just after being born due to a societal stigma to giving birth to a daughter. It indicates strides are being made in tackling
<a>sex-selective abortions</a>, female foeticide and neglect of girls and women, which have deeply impacted on the female population.
<p>In 1990, when the Indian Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen first wrote of India’s 37 million missing women due to these factors, the ratio of women to men was 927 women to 1,000 men.</p>
<a>Population</a> Foundation of India, said: “It is heartening to see the improvements in the overall sex ratio. It reflects the strides that the country has made towards gender equality and women’s empowerment.”
<p>Muttreja emphasised that a full picture of India’s shifting sex ratio would not become clear until the census, which was due to happen in 2021 but currently postponed, was carried out. India’s last census occurred in 2011.</p>
<p>Despite apparent progress, according to the survey, the gender ratio at birth still remains at 929 women for every 1,000 men, indicating that the issue of sex selection and <a>female foeticide</a> has not been eliminated.</p>
<p>Civil servants scrambling to save Afghans were ‘appalled by our chaotic system’ and animals were put above humans</p>
<p>Damning new light has been shed on the hour-by-hour decisions taken and frustrations encountered by a civil servant trying to help desperate Afghans flee the country in the days after the Taliban takeover.</p>
<p>These are some of the key criticisms made by Raphael Marshall, a former desk officer at the Foreign Office.</p>
<h2>Thousands of emails went unread</h2>
<p>The government falsely claimed each request for evacuation was logged, when in fact thousands of emails – including many sent by MPs – went unread, Marshall said.</p>
