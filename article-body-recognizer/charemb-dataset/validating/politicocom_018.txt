<p>The 2024 presidential campaign has unquestionably begun, with Donald Trump plotting, other Republicans networking and many Democrats panicking.</p>
<p>In what has become an annual POLITICO Magazine <a>tradition</a> for me, here is my look at the emerging presidential field and how their machinations fared this year.</p>
<h4>The Punch-Drunk Gambler</h4>
<a>Polls indicate</a> he would lap the primary field, typically putting at least 30 points between himself and his closest potential opponent.
<a>National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar</a> recently wrote, “The president has been acting like a punch-drunk gambler lately, throwing endorsements around like candy without doing the requisite vetting of his favored picks.”
<a>Alabama</a>, where his endorsed Senate candidates are
<b> </b>No. He has the inside track to the nomination, but his insecure, bullying nature led him to spend more time attacking fellow Republicans than Democrats, undermining his ability to unite his own party behind him.
<p>But in 2021 Pence began to prepare himself for that challenge, delicately distancing himself from Trump and redefining his political persona.</p>
<a>Polling</a> suggests Pence has maintained a modicum of support that’s enough to set him apart from most of the potential field. He is generally running in second or third place, cracking double digits when Trump is not included. In November’s
<a>Harvard CAPS-Harris poll</a>, when excluding both Trump and his son, Pence reaches a respectable 25 percent.
<a>endorsed</a> a primary challenger running against the Republican governor of Idaho,
<a>Pence told the Republican Governors Association</a>, “I want to be clear: I’m going to be supporting incumbent Republican governors.” The potential boldness of the edict has been quickly tested, however; according to the
<a>Associated Press</a>, during a high-profile visit to New Hampshire this month, Pence “declined to take a side in the GOP primary for governor in Georgia.”
<p>Such is the challenge of being Mike Pence: he wants to follow the normal rules of politics and show he’s not abnormal like Trump, but that inevitably puts him conflict with the de facto leader of his party and that’s not normal at all.</p>
<p>Did Pence make good use of 2021?<b> </b>Yes. He may have an uphill battle ahead, but he is more his own person today than one year ago. </p>
<a>banning local school boards</a> from imposing mask mandates and curtailing the ability of private business from issuing employee vaccine mandates.
<p>Thanks to his persistent pugnacity and purple state location, DeSantis has broken out of the GOP pack. In 2024 <a>primary polls</a> that don’t include Trump, DeSantis has almost always held the lead.</p>
<p>However, like everyone else, he doesn’t fare well in polls that do include Trump. And he hasn’t done anything to establish a rationale for running against Trump. What he has done is <a>annoy Trump</a> for <a>not ruling out</a> a run against Trump.</p>
<a>dropped six points to 48 percent</a> as Florida’s coronavirus case counts skyrocketed in August. (Morning Consult numbers released last month, based on sampling conducted in the summer and fall,
<a>pegged DeSantis’ approval at 52 percent</a>.)
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> in the early summer, but
<a>Florida is one of 14 states</a> with its own laws protecting abortion rights. Pressure from social conservatives to scrap those laws may conflict with Florida’s socially liberal tilt; a
<a>2014 Pew poll</a> found that 56 percent of Floridians believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Perhaps worried about alienating Florida swing voters, DeSantis has
<a>six-week abortion ban similar to Texas</a>, and has
<a>expressed concern</a> with the Texas provision incentivizing civil lawsuits against anyone involved in an illegal abortion. By the fall, DeSantis, who says he’s “100% pro-life,” will need to stake out a clear position.
<p>Did DeSantis make good use of 2021?<b> </b>Yes, but only if Trump doesn’t run. </p>
<h4>The Governors Who Are Not Ron DeSantis</h4>
<h3>Larry Hogan, Chris Sununu, Kristi Noem, Greg Abbott and Asa Hutchinson</h3>
<p>Several other GOP governors have signaled in interest in 2024 — either by refusing to rule out a run when asked or by traveling to key primary states. </p>
<a>surge of infections</a>). She even threw an
<a>pressured a state official</a> to overturn an earlier decision and grant her daughter a real estate appraiser license.
<p>Meanwhile three other governors sought to distinguish themselves as more post-Trump than Trump 2.0, as they navigate the three litmus tests of today’s GOP: Trump, Covid and abortion.</p>
<a>New Hampshire’s Chris Sununu</a> said in April, “I supported President Trump. He didn’t win. We’re moving on,” and “Donald Trump doesn’t define the Republican Party.” Arkansas’ Asa Hutchinson has
<a>publicly opposed</a> a Trump ’24 bid,
<a>criticized Trump’s April rant</a> at Mar-a-Lago for lambasting other Republicans and
<a>counseled</a> that “re-litigating 2020 is a recipe for disaster in 2022.” Maryland’s Larry Hogan has
<a>never even voted for Trump</a>, opting to write in deceased personal heroes (Ronald Reagan in 2020, his father in 2016).
<a>allow a bill</a> to become law without his signature giving employees the ability to ignore employer mandates, but did so while expressing opposition. Sununu has more
<a>forcefully opposed</a> such a bill, even though his fellow Republicans moved one through a House committee last month and are
<a>taking it to the House floor in January</a>. (
<a>Noem’s position</a> matches Sununu and Hutchinson, not Abbott and DeSantis.)
<a>Hutchinson</a> support a lawsuit filed by several Republican attorneys general which is holding up
<a>Biden’s executive order</a> imposing vaccine mandates on businesses with workforces of at least 100 employees. Maryland has not joined the suit, but Hogan expressed
<a>discomfort</a> with Biden’s mandate.
<a>“a little bit extreme.”</a> Sununu campaigned on being “pro-choice,” but this year antagonized abortion rights supporters by signing a bill
<a>banning abortion after 24 weeks</a> with an exception for medical emergencies, yet without an exception for rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies.
<a>Hutchinson signed a bill banning nearly all abortion</a>, with the explicit intent of encouraging the Supreme Court to overturn
<b> </b>No. The hard-right conservativism of Abbott and Noem was overshadowed by DeSantis. And the nuanced conservatism of Hogan, Sununu and Hutchinson didn’t make much of an impression, even among the faction of Republican Trump skeptics.
<p>Put an asterisk on Virginia’s Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin. He hasn’t done anything to suggest he is thinking about 2024, but for a Republican, winning a blue state is an unquestionably good use of 2021.</p>
<h4>The Cravenly Opportunistic Trump Hangers On Who Never Liked Trump in the First Place</h4>
<h3>Chris Christie, Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo</h3>
<a>Maggie Haberman</a>, told Trump in private that he would run regardless of what the former president decided. Soon after she reported that tidbit, a Pompeo ally told Haberman the former secretary was just making a
<a>joke</a>. Yet Pompeo clearly spent 2021 preparing for a run, starting a new
<a>political action committee</a> and
<a>traveling to key states</a>. Asked what his message would be if he did run, all Pompeo had was
<a>leftover talking points</a> from Rick Santorum’s failed bids: “a return to the idea that family is at the center of America.” With no provocative rationale for running against Trump, Pompeo remains barely known.
<a>caught Covid from the president</a>. Now Christie’s tone has abruptly shifted, and he’s one of the louder Republican critics of Trump, even lashing out in a new book,
<i>Republican Rescue</i>. But squaring his past and present views proved awkward. “The book’s schizophrenia is so undisguised it seems tactical,” wrote conservative columnist
<a>2,289 copies in his first week</a>.
<p>But when it comes to political schizophrenia, no one is as committed as Nikki Haley. </p>
<p>Did Christie, Haley and Pompeo make good use of 2021?<b> </b>No. They haven’t figured out how to cleanly break with Trump without exposing their craven opportunism.</p>
<h3>Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Rick Scott and Tim Scott</h3>
<p>Every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president. But these days, when does anybody look at a Republican senator?</p>
<a>escaping to Cancun</a> during the Texas power grid crisis. For Rick Scott, it was when he expressed
<a>expressing solidarity</a> with the Jan. 6 rioters and ended it by weirdly blaming liberals for making men
<a>watch too much porn and play too many video games</a>.
<p>But even with all that good fortune, the low-key Scott isn’t a constant media presence and hasn’t yet made much of an impression on voters. In 2024 polls, he is on par with Mike Pompeo. </p>
<p>Did these senators make good use of 2021?<b> </b>No. Tim Scott had a better year than the others, but he missed an opportunity to fully capitalize on his April address and command the media spotlight for the rest of the year.</p>
<h4>The Opposite Sides of the House</h4>
<h3>Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene</h3>
<a>Iowa</a>. In October, both called each other a
<a>“joke”</a> during a scrap on the House floor. If they both run for president, Reps. Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene could stage the biggest fight for the soul of the Republican Party we’ve ever seen.
<b> </b>congresswomen by giving them the opportunity to expand their supporter lists which could be used for future movement building.
<p>Did Cheney and Greene make good use of 2021?<b> </b>Yes. How quickly can you name two other House Republicans?</p>
<h4>The Underwater President</h4>
<p>Then December. Inflation hit 6.8 percent. The Omicron variant exploded. And Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) broke Build Back Better.</p>
<b> </b>No. Instead of reminding Democrats of his proven ability to defeat Donald Trump, Biden ends the year with polls suggesting he could lose a rematch, and renewed chatter that the soon-to-be octogenarian won’t run for reelection.
<a>“exodus,”</a> in the words of the
<i>Washington Post</i>, suggested the wheels were coming off.
<a>root causes of migration</a>. Harris joined Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to
<a>announce</a> the release of $8.7 billion for financial institutions that serve historically disadvantaged communities to help provide credit to minority-owned business — funds generated by
<a>bipartisan</a> legislation that
<a>Harris co-sponsored</a> as a senator in 2020.
<p>Sure, this may be a coordinated effort by the White House to counter her months of negative press, but a coordinated effort by the White House beats awkward silence.</p>
<p>Did Harris make good use of 2021?<b> </b>No, but she may have figured out how to have a better year in 2022.</p>
<p>But these favorable developments don’t address what stymied his 2020 presidential campaign: scant support among African American voters. That Morning Consult poll with Harris getting 52 percent of the Black vote had Buttigieg with just 3 percent.</p>
<a>Buttigieg joined Harris</a> on a trip to North Carolina to promote the new infrastructure law, dismissed talk of any friction and gave Harris a large share of the credit for getting the bill through Congress.
<p>Did Buttigieg make good use of 2021?<b> </b>Yes, but he still hasn’t figured out how to solve his biggest political problem.</p>
<h3>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</h3>
<p>The New York congresswoman retains one of the biggest social media followings in Washington and remains the most likely democratic socialist to carry Bernie Sanders’ torch. But that torch is flickering.</p>
<p>Did Ocasio-Cortez make good use of 2021?<b> </b>No. Her influence in the Progressive Caucus was diminished and she didn’t prove she can get ideological allies elected, even in some of the bluest areas of the country.</p>
<h4>If at First You Don’t Succeed …</h4>
<h3>Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren</h3>
<i><a>New York Times</a></i>, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) privately expressed interest in a second try, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) declined to give a direct answer about what she would do if Biden didn’t run.
<a>abandoning her past support of the filibuster</a> so Democrats can pass
<a>voting rights and gun background check legislation</a> on party line votes.
<p>Did Klobuchar and Warren make good use of 2021?<b> </b>No. They were boxed out of most of the Senate action by their moderate colleagues.</p>
<h4>The Martin O’Malley Lane</h4>
<h3>Gavin Newsom, Roy Cooper, J.B. Pritzker, Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer</h3>
<a>“never been on my radar”</a> hard to believe.
<a>Newsom, then lieutenant governor, chose to wait and run for governor</a> in 2018, letting Harris pursue the Senate. They’ve since reliably
<a>endorsed</a> each other’s campaigns, and have even shared a top political consultant, Ace Smith.
<p>Did these governors make good use of 2021?<b> </b>Newsom did as much as he could. The rest didn’t do much beyond feeding the gossip mill at a conference.</p>

<b>It’s a big day for astronomy.</b>
<p><b>On a light news day, a few key reads today:</b></p>
<b>MANCHIN IN THE MIDDLE — </b>A Christmas gift for progressives?
<a>WaPo’s Jeff Stein reports</a> that Sen.
<b>JOE MANCHIN’s </b>(D-W.Va.) Build Back Better offer to the White House last week included support for some kind of a billionaire wealth tax. Still, it’s not Manchin but other Democrats — most notably Sen.
<b>One other nugget from the story: </b>Manchin is being advised by
<b><a>ALAN AUERBACH</a>, </b>director of the Robert D. Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at Berkeley. He was deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation in 1992, according to his bio.
<b>CHARLES WOOD </b>said privacy and attorney-client privilege concerns overrode freedom of the press. The Times promised to appeal the ruling, which has drawn outrage from First Amendment advocates.
<b><a><i>More from Reuters</i></a></b>
<b>— <a>The NYT editorial board responded</a> </b>to the rare instance of prior restraint:
<b> </b>“This is a breathtaking rationale: Justice Wood has taken it upon himself to decide what The Times can and cannot report on. That’s not how the First Amendment is supposed to work.” (
<a>WaPo’s Erik Wemple calls it</a> “a monster lump of First Amendment coal.”)

<a>In a strange sequence of events</a>, an Oregon father named
<b>Jared </b>on the annual White House Santa tracking call with military families said “Let’s go Brandon” to
<b>JOE BIDEN. </b>The president, either unaware or playing along, responded, “Let’s go Brandon, I agree.” The caller then apparently hung up. Sitting next to the president,
<b>JILL BIDEN</b> seemed to roll her eyes.
<p><b>BIDEN’S SATURDAY — </b>The president has nothing on his public schedule.</p>
<b>— Still, the Bidens made a surprise visit </b>Friday to Children’s National Hospital to spread some holiday cheer. They “met with and read a story to hospitalized children and their families,”
<a>per The Hill</a>. It was the first time the president has joined what is typically a first lady-only tradition.
<b>— For Christmas, the first family is staying in Washington, </b>at the request of the Bidens’ grandchildren,
<p><b>PROMISES MADE … </b><a>NBC’s Lauren Egan has a roundup</a> of the promises Biden made about what he’d do in his first year vs. what he’s actually done. </p>
<b>VP FILES — </b>In an advance clip of the CBS interview airing Sunday with
<b>KAMALA HARRIS, </b>the VP says she regrets not being able to leave D.C. more and travel around the country to be “in touch with what people need at any given moment.”

<b>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY.</b> The same day, Sens.
<b>ROB PORTMAN </b>(R-Ohio) and
<a>wrote a WaPo op-ed</a> declaring that the U.S. must stand with Ukraine. They called on the Biden administration to send more weapons to Ukraine and “seriously reconsider the imposition of sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.”
<p><b>— <a>Andrew Desiderio notes</a>: </b>“Will be interesting to see if Shaheen and other Dems vote for <b>TED CRUZ’s</b> Nord Stream sanctions bill when it gets a vote in the Senate in early January. The Biden admin opposes this effort.”</p>
<p><b>— Meanwhile, the Kremlin said Friday </b>that “we expect our opponents in Washington to provide specific answers to our proposals in January,” referring to Russia’s demands that the West guarantee Ukraine won’t join NATO, <a>per the AP</a>.</p>
<p><b>BEYOND THE BELTWAY</b></p>
<a>In Sunday’s Playbook</a>, we included
<a>a dispatch</a> from WaPo’s Chico Harlan in Denmark, which has one of the world’s best coronavirus tracking systems and was flashing Omicron warning signs for everyone. A week later, though, the news is looking better out of Copenhagen:
<a>Harlan now reports</a> that the country seems to have steered away from the worst-case scenarios, as case numbers have leveled off and hospitalizations are “on the very low end of what was projected.” (Plenty of caveats remain, of course.)

<p>Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2019 and early 2020, we’ve all been in thrall to numbers: positive tests, occupied ICU beds and the bleakest count of all — deaths from the coronavirus, which passed 800,000 in the U.S. this week.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States and European allies would join together to impose “strong” economic penalties and other punitive actions on Russia should it mount an invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<a> according to a White House readout.</a>
<p>In a White House news briefing later Tuesday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan characterized the conversation between Biden and Putin as “direct and straightforward.”</p>
<p>“There was no finger-wagging, but the president was crystal clear about where the United States stands on all of these issues,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>In addition to proposing unprecedented economic penalties, Sullivan said Biden warned Putin that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would provide additional defense materials to the Ukrainian government.</p>
<p>“I will look you in the eye and tell you — as President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him today — things we did not do in 2014, we are prepared to do now,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Biden also made no commitments or concessions on NATO regarding a reduced U.S. presence or Ukraine’s potential membership, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Biden also will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Sullivan said.</p>
<a>Russia last breached the neighboring nation’s eastern border and annexed Crimea</a>.
<a>United States is exploring options for a potential evacuation of American citizens</a> from Ukraine if Russia invades.
<a>Blinken told reporters he warned Lavrov</a> of “severe costs and consequences on Russia if it takes further aggressive action against Ukraine.”
<a>United States was coordinating with European allies</a> on a package of financial sanctions that would impose “significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy” should Putin proceed with an invasion.
<a>official told reporters in a call organized by the National Security Council</a>.
<a>Biden participated in a call with Macron, Merkel, Draghi and Johnson</a>, during which they urged Russia “to de-escalate tensions” and advocated for a diplomatic solution, according to a White House readout.
<a>Blinken spoke by phone on Monday with Zelensky</a>, reiterating the United States’ “unwavering support” for Ukraine’s “sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression,” according to a State Department readout.
<a>Biden would not “hold back in conveying his concern”</a> to the Russian president, and that Biden planned on “conveying our conversations and our preparations, should they be warranted.”
<a>Austin met earlier in the day with department leaders</a> — including Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley and Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of U.S. European Command — to discuss the situation on the Russia-Ukraine border.

<p>None of that helped when, in 1922, his uncle, King Constantine I, abdicated and the family was forced into exile. Legend has it that the 1-year-old Philip was carried to France in a crib made out of an orange crate. </p>
<p>Though technically a Greek prince, he never spoke the language and grew up in Paris speaking French and German, while considering himself a Dane. His childhood was chaotic and infused with tragedy.</p>
<p>Gordonstoun was a new type of English private school that encouraged boys to be tough and resilient, and it fit Philip to a tee. </p>
<p>The Queen was young and beautiful. Philip was Prince Charming incarnate: handsome, brave and armed with a very un-British set of sparkling white teeth. A blissful five years and two children followed.</p>
<p>But in 1952, everything was thrown into disarray when King George died, and the 27-year-old Elizabeth was thrust onto the throne. </p>
<p>Asked by the actor Matt Smith to sum up his granddad in a 2016 encounter, Prince William proffered: “Just one word — legend!” And it seems that his cousins and other younger members of the royal family shared the opinion.</p>
<p>He also had relevance. He might not have been the captain of the ship he married into, but Philip steered the Crown through the turbulent waters of the postwar years.</p>

<p>After five years spent bullying the Republican Party into submission, President Donald Trump finally met his match in Aaron Van Langevelde.</p>
<a>tweeted out a statement</a> affirming the move “in the best interest of our Country.”
<i>can</i> ultimately succeed—is in convincing unprecedented numbers of Americans that their votes didn’t count. Last month,
<p>Trump failed to win Michigan. But he succeeded in convincing America that a loss, no matter how conclusive, may never again be conclusive enough.</p>

<i>supposed</i> to happen.’” (The Trump team’s much celebrated lawsuit against Detroit was recently withdrawn after being pummeled in local courtrooms; his campaign has to date won one case and lost 35.)
<p>“I was told the number was 38,000,” Spies replied.</p>
<p><span><b>By five o’clock on Wednesday morning,</b></span> it was apparent Trump’s lead would not hold. </p>
<b>In the days following Trump’s shameful address</b>
<p>“I don’t get it,” the president said, venting confusion and frustration. “All these other Republicans, all over the country, they all win their races. And I’m the only guy that loses?”</p>
<p><span><b>Right around the time Chatfield and Shirkey</b></span> were bearing the bad news to Trump in Washington, the Republican rumor mill was churning back home.</p>
<i>disinclined</i> to throw away his future in the Republican Party. A resignation from the board was his only way out.
<p>All for doing his job. All for upholding the rule of law. All for following his conscience and defying the wishes of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That’s right: The name Van Langevelde is already so infamous in Michigan Republican lore that those associated with him are at risk of being branded turncoats, too.</p>
<p>“This is not some whacked-out fringe,” James said in one taping. “When half the votes in our state believe we just had the most secure election in U.S. history, and the other half believe they were cheated, we have a problem.”</p>
<p>But errors are not fraud. And when James says he’s troubled that half of Michigan’s voters feel they were cheated, he would do well to remember that <i>he was the one telling them they got cheated in the first place</i>.</p>
