<p>In an email, Stone said he believed Trump signed the magazine in 1999 and that it was “indeed real.” While Real Estate New York was a magazine, POLITICO was unable to confirm when or if Trump graced the cover. </p>

<a>He told reporters</a> that he pleaded the 5th amendment on every question "not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats' long history of fabricating perjury charges," he said.
<p>According <a>to the letter subpoenaing him</a>, Stone tried to raise money for a “Stop the Steal” event on January 6 and had previously said he had been invited to “lead a march to the Capitol” but didn’t end up doing so.</p>

<p>Special counsel John Durham's inquiry into the origins of the investigation into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign spent close to $3.8 million over its first year of operations. </p>
<p>A previous spending report <a>released in May</a> showed the Durham probe had totaled about $1.5 million from Oct. 19 through March 31. </p>
<p>The spending, <a>detailed in documents released Wednesday</a> by the Department of Justice, coincides with an uptick in activity from Durham and his team in recent months. </p>
<p>Former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith received a one-year probation term in January for altering an email related to a surveillance request in the course of the Russia investigation. </p>
<p>To date, Garland has said little about the level of DOJ’s oversight into Durham’s activities, other than to say they are following the Justice Department’s rules regarding special counsels. </p>
<p>“The regulations regarding special counsels are pretty clear about what Mr. Durham does,” Garland told reporters on Dec. 6. “I don’t want to say anything beyond what is in the regulations, but we are following the regulations.”</p>

<p>The German bank will no longer do business with Trump or his company going forward, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump owes the bank more than $300 million.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank declined to comment on its relationship with Trump. The New York Times earlier reported the bank's decision to stop doing business with the president.</p>

<p>KAPALUA, Hawaii — The PGA of America cut ties to President Donald Trump when it voted Sunday to take the PGA Championship event away from his New Jersey golf course next year.</p>
<p>PGA President Jim Richerson says the board voted to exercise its right to “terminate the agreement” with Trump National in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The PGA of America, which has some 29,000 golf professionals who mostly teach the game, signed the deal with Trump National in 2014.</p>
<p>The shocking insurrection Wednesday rattled the country, and in golf circles, attention quickly focused on whether the PGA of America would keep its premier championship — and one of golf’s four major championships — at Trump’s course in 2022.</p>
<p>Trump had delivered a speech to his supporters in which he repeatedly made baseless claims that the election was stolen from him and urged them to “fight.”</p>
<p>A new <a>ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> released Sunday found that 67% of respondents said Trump deserves a “good amount” or a “great deal” of blame for the insurrection.</p>

<div> <div> <p> By JON RALSTON</p> <p><time>12/29/2021 02:02 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p><i>Jon Ralston is CEO of The Nevada Independent. He is writing a book on Harry Reid. </i></p>
<div> <p>There will never be another like him.</p> <p>Not a chance.</p> <p>Oh sure, there will be leaders who grew up in unimaginable poverty. Or those who are more workhorse than showhorse. Or who dominate their state’s political apparatus.</p> </div>
<a>like this one</a>, of Reid’s private acts of kindness and compassion.
<p>As much as he cared naught for what people wrote about him, Reid brooked no criticism of his family. I know. I know because the man I covered for 35 years cut me off for years after I wrote critical columns about his children.</p>
<p>“It was never about what you wrote about me,” Reid told me when he summoned me to his office at the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip<b> </b>and agreed to cooperate for a book I am writing about him. “It was always about my family.”</p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand: I come not to praise Reid, but I also do not want the good he did to be interred with his bones. Trust me — he would not want this to be a love letter, just as he told me he knew the book would not be all sweetness and light.</p>
<p>He just wanted the real story of Harry Reid told.</p>
<p>For all the bad he will be remembered for by some — his role in polarizing Washington, D.C., his brandishing of the nuclear option, his smash-mouth approach to politics — Reid did what few have done: He changed history. Several times.</p>
<p> He was a man of contradictions who either evolved in his views or changed them for political reasons, depending on your point of view.</p>
<a>a nativist speech on the Senate floor</a> and later ensured the DREAM Act passed? Who else could have been a devout Mormon, yet eventually press for gay marriage, even speaking at a gay staffer’s wedding?
<p>Regrets? He had very few. Only one, in fact, he told me: voting for the Iraq War.</p>
<p>Reid had no time for such feelings. That would mean looking back, which he rarely did. He was too busy, with no time for introspection or even for saying “goodbye” on the phone.</p>
<p>But his impact on the state he loved cannot be questioned. All roads through Nevada, figuratively and literally, ran through Harry Reid.</p>
<p>If Reid had not ascended to the majority leader’s spot, waste would have descended on the state. Harry Reid stopped Yucca Mountain. Period. Full stop. </p>
<p>The difference, perhaps, is that Adelson had several peers in his sphere — Steve Wynn, Kirk Kerkorian, at least. But Harry Reid, the master of the Senate and the king of Nevada, stands alone.</p>

<p><b>HARRY REID’s</b> journey from a poverty-stricken rock miner’s son to the Senate majority leader was so novelistic the details seem made up. </p>
<p><b>In his obituary, </b>NYT’s Jonathan Martin <a>rightly describes Reid</a>, who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, growing up “in almost Dickensian circumstances” in Searchlight, down in the tip of Nevada:</p>
<p><b>“His home had no indoor plumbing, </b>his father was an alcoholic miner who eventually died by suicide, and his mother helped the family survive by taking in laundry from local brothels.”</p>
<b>On the way to the Senate there were stints as an amateur boxer </b>and a Capitol Police officer, several losing campaigns, and positions at the highest levels of Nevada politics.
<b>BARACK OBAMA</b> noted in his memoir that throughout this journey Reid “was the first to tell you that he had never lost that chip on his shoulder.”
<b>In a statement, </b>Senate Minority Leader
<p><b>In 2005, as the new Democratic leader</b> in the Senate, he brought a sharper edge to the job and immediately started to deflate the presidency of <b>GEORGE W. BUSH.</b> </p>
<b>“Reid took over as Senate leader</b> when
<b>TOM DASCHLE</b> unexpectedly lost in 2004,”
<b>“Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment,</b> Harry Reid would reach out,”
<a>Rep. <b>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ </b>(D-N.Y.) wrote</a>. “It was like he knew. His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it.”
<b>“HMR was a great boss, </b>a master legislative and political strategist and I know a lot will be written about all of that,”
<b>LANDRA,</b> to his daughter and granddaughters to the countless staff and advisors. I wouldn’t be where I am today without his mentorship.”

<b>They had some big victories, </b>including an $800 billion stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, the end of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and the confirmation of
<b>ELENA KAGAN</b> to the Supreme Court. In 2013 he changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominations.
<a><b>In a letter to Reid that he shared publicly Tuesday</b></a>
<b>, </b>Obama wrote, “I wouldn’t have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn’t have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.”
<p><b>We reached out to a number of people who knew Reid well</b> and asked them to share their remembrances. Here’s some of what we received:</p>
<p>“After we left the meeting I asked him why in the hell would you say that. Sen. Reid threw up his hands and said, ‘Because he was fat.’ (He was.) I worked in the Senate for 21 years, and unlike most politicians, he really was unafraid to mix it up.”</p>

<i>him. </i>We could get by with a little help from our friends!
<p>So hey, Joe, it’s a sad song, but we can make it better. After all, it’s a long and winding road. Maybe somehow we might be able to get back and come together. Biden’s magical mystery tour has just begun.</p>

<div> <p> Lawrence O’Donnell has been one of Biden’s most unreserved cheerleaders over the past year. | Sergio Flores/Getty Images</p> <div> <div> <p> By MAX TANI</p> <p><time>12/29/2021 04:30 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>When his contract renewal was in doubt four years ago, Lawrence O’Donnell begged his viewers to help keep him on the air at MSNBC. </p>
<p>O’Donnell is, unlike virtually anyone else in cable these days, riding high. </p>
<a>said Biden’s discussion of his own immigrant history was historic</a>, that
<a>the president’s Aug. 31 speech on the U.S. military departure from Afghanistan</a> was the smartest and most honest address by a president on the subject,
<a>uncritically praised the state of the economy</a> under Biden, and declared that the president’s first 100 days were the most consequential since FDR’s presidency.
<p>But beyond the adulation, few, if any, cable hosts have mirrored the president’s professional arc as closely as he has.</p>
<a>during his first show </a>was, naturally, Biden.
<p>The connection wasn’t lost on the then-former vice president’s team when he launched his third bid for president in 2019.</p>
<p>“He and the president have established a good rapport, driven in part by Lawrence’s deep knowledge and appreciation of policy as a former Senate aide,” the former campaign official said.</p>
<p>O’Donnell also has the ear of one of the president’s top advisers.</p>
<p>Following the emergence of Covid-19 in 2020, Klain became a ubiquitous presence across MSNBC, offering insights and commentary drawn from his time as former president Barack Obama’s “Ebola czar.”</p>
<p>After the election, the relationship paid off with access.</p>
<p>O’Donnell, Klain and the White House all declined to comment.</p>
<a>finished</a> off the year with the highest number of total daytime viewers in cable news (as measured between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.).
<p>His current, secure, status represents a fascinating turnaround for a network personality who just a few years ago seemed days away from losing his job.</p>
<a>signed a multi-year deal in 2017</a>.
<p>Griffin declined to do so, Biden won office, and O’Donnell is now the steady ship in a network — and industry — experiencing its fair bit of turbulence.</p>

<a>said in a statement</a>. But the main point of conversation is certain to be the Russian military presence on Ukraine’s eastern frontier, which “remains a continuing source of great concern,” a senior administration official told reporters.
<p>“We are in a moment of crisis and have been for several weeks now given the Russian build-up,” the official said, adding: “It will take a high level of engagement to address this and to try to find a path of deescalation.”</p>
<a>warned his Russian counterpart</a> three weeks ago that the United States and European allies would impose “strong” economic penalties and other punitive actions on Russia should it mount an invasion of Ukraine.
<a>set to take place in Geneva in January</a>. Earlier this month, Russia
<a>demanded assurances from NATO</a> that the alliance will not expand farther east and that it will end all military activity in Ukraine and Eastern Europe.

<h2>National Republicans luring John James into House race</h2>
<p>Republicans anticipate James, one of their most coveted 2022 recruits, will run for Congress next year after Michigan's new district map was finalized.</p>
<p> Then-Republican U.S. Senate candidate John James greets supporters in Farmington Hills, Mich. on Oct. 26, 2020. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By ZACH MONTELLARO and ALLY MUTNICK</p> <p><time>12/29/2021 04:09 PM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/29/2021 07:00 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Prominent national Republicans are trying to lure John James, an Army veteran and two-time failed Senate candidate, to run for a newly-created Michigan congressional seat.</p>
<p>James, among the most prominent Black Republicans in the party, challenged Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters in 2018 and 2020, respectively. He lost by 7 points in the 2018 midterms and by 2 points last year.</p>
<p>House Republicans were thrilled at <a>a story from The Detroit News</a> on Tuesday, when the paper reported that James was “strongly considering” a run in the newly created 10th District.</p>
<p>“He’s seriously considering running,” one Michigan Republican familiar with his thinking, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, told POLITICO on Wednesday. “A lot of folks are encouraging him to do that both in the state and nationally.”</p>
<p>And while Republicans believe that Whitmer is vulnerable in 2022, they acknowledge that defeating her won’t be an easy task — and a third consecutive statewide loss, either in the primary or general election, could doom James’ political future.</p>
<p>As of Oct. 20, Whitmer had $12.7 million in cash on hand for her reelection bid, according to a filing with state campaign finance regulators this fall.</p>
<p>Top House Republicans were already gearing up to help James take on either Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens, who flipped a red seat in 2018, or Democratic Rep. Andy Levin, who replaced his father in Congress that same year.</p>
<p>In that survey James trounced both Democratic incumbents: He led Stevens 50 percent to 41 percent and Levin 50 percent to 42 percent.</p>
<p>Tuesday brought even better news for those boosting James: Stevens and Levin chose to <a>run against each other</a> in a more favorable 11th district, leaving him in an open seat divide roughly evenly between the parties, should he run.</p>
<p>If James does run for the battleground House seat, CLF won’t be the only group pushing him. FreedomWorks, a major conservative outside group, also said that it would support James should he decide to run for the House.</p>
<a>conceded to Peters about three weeks</a> after the election last year. That only came after a then-staffer for James declared him the victor and accused vote counters of “making up numbers” to cheat him out of a win. That staffer
<a>later told POLITICO</a> they deleted and apologized for that tweet, but still believed there were widespread “irregularities” — and James asked a state board to
<a>hold off certifying the results</a>

<p>William F. Buckley Jr. made conservatism intellectually respectable by saving it from the wackos and the demagogues. Rush Limbaugh gave it right back again.</p>
<p>In the Age of Trump, Limbaugh might not have been the most important figure, but he was a central player in the devolution of the conservative mind. </p>
<a>as former Barack Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau described him</a>: “Longtime listener, first-time candidate.” Trump won, Favreau wrote, “by doing a fairly good impression of a right-wing media celebrity.”
