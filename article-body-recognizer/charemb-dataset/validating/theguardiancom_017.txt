<a>Miwok 100K</a> in California. These races are intimate: you get to know the other runners, the race organisers. You get to feel like an oddball as you shuffle alone at dawn through quiet country towns with your backpack and head torch.
<a>UTMB</a> looming – the biggest ultra mountain trail race in the world – last week, it was time to get my first taste of the razzmatazz of the European ultra trail circuit, by taking part in the
<a>Lavaredo Ultra Trail</a> in the Italian Dolomites.
<p>And then, as the clock strikes 11, and to the strains of the race’s theme tune, The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, we’re off. The showboating is over – now it’s time to run.</p>
<p>After some pasta soup at a crowded aid station – who knew mini star-shaped pasta floating in vegetable stock could taste so good? – we begin the first long descent back down into the valley.</p>
<p>These mountain races are, of course, a series of climbs and descents, and until today I’ve always struggled with both, having come to ultras from road running. But today, finally, it all starts to make sense.</p>
<a>100 Mile Sud de France</a> in October, I was pretty much the only person in the race without poles.
<p>But after 10 ultra races, for the first time, I’m not that guy. I’m that other guy. The one who comes from nowhere, full of energy, skipping past you, and you think, bloody show off.</p>
<p>Outfits for the Pride parade were the main topic of discussion, but several of the runners also tell me about an upcoming trip to Odense, Denmark, where some will be completing their first half marathon. Followed, of course, by drinks to celebrate.</p>
<p>Creating safe spaces for everyone to enjoy sport is hugely important. Sadly, despite improving awareness and acceptance of LGBT+ people within the workplace, sport is one area of society that has been slow to catch up.</p>
<a>Rainbow Laces</a> and the visibility of large groups such as Frontrunners offer a blueprint to other organisations and teams that want to become more knowledgeable and inclusive.
<p>As we make the turn in Battersea Park to head back for the post-run pub social, Mary tells me that for the Frontrunners, inclusion, understanding and acceptance are what it’s all about.</p>
<p>“When we go for a social, it’s not even something you think about. We’ll go to a venue that is LGBT+ friendly, so that’s not even an issue because it’s part of the group’s identity and ethos.”</p>

<a>How was your weekend running?</a>
<p>So, what are your tips for hot weather running, and how was the weekend for you? As always, share your stories below the line - and apologies again for lateness. </p>
<div> <div> <h3><a> How was your weekend running? </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>Struggling in the heatwave? Share your tips for cooling down, as well as your weekend exploits, below the line as usual</div> </div> </div> How was your weekend running?
<p>There are two clear ways in which increased prize money is likely to improve results: the depth of the field and the intensity of preparation.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise to regulars when I say that I love the track. Track sessions, mostly on my own, twice a week, are the bread and butter of my training. But I also love a track race: and I wish more people did them. </p>
<p>So, over to you. How was your weekend running - did you race, enjoy the relatively cooler weather or are you starting to think about autumn races and goals? Share your thoughts and fears below the line as always</p>
<h2>At what temperature should I wash smelly, sweaty running kit?</h2>
<h2>If a top is just a bit sweaty, will a rinse do the trick?</h2>
<p>Your clothes should be thoroughly washed, as water alone will not fully break down body fats and sweat. Also, if you wait too long to wash your items, it will be more difficult to get rid of bad smells and dirt from the fabric.</p>
<h2>Should you use a specialist detergent for sportswear?</h2>
<h2>How should I wash outer running gear that is rainproof or windproof?</h2>
<h2>Some running gear starts to smell, even after washing, as it get older. Is there anything you can do about that?</h2>
<h2>Should you tumble-dry technical fabrics?</h2>
<h2>What about fabric softener?</h2>
<h2>Should you put your trainers in the washing machine? If so, should you take out the insoles?</h2>
<a>Pegasus Turbo</a>. Then just seeing my mates in London quite a bit, watching the World Cup football, having barbecue and social with the lads … That’s about it. I’ve been pretty busy competing and travelling so I haven’t had much down time.
<p>What’s the worst thing about running? I don’t think there’s anything bad about it. It’s tiring, but it is what it is! </p>
<p>What’s the best thing? You just feel free!</p>
<p>What’s your post-race indulgence? Depends on what’s there. If it’s room service, then pizza or burger and chips will do me well. </p>
<p>What do you eat for breakfast before your big sessions or a big race? Just something simple. Beans, fried eggs, or maybe smoked salmon. A nice healthy juice and a bottle of water. </p>
<p>Have you ever run barefoot? Not really. Not on the track, it’s too hard. Around the house, sure. </p>
<p>Who is your favourite athlete to watch as a spectator? Thomas Röhler. He’s a great javelin thrower. He throws things so far and he’s so consistent. I like a good javelin competition. </p>
<a>Usain Bolt.</a> That’s obviously who I grew up looking at, so I have to say him. Anyone who works really hard and achieves things, whether it’s in sport or business, that’s what I look for and find inspiring.
<a>Roger Federer</a> … they are all inspiring.
<a>How to wash your running kit</a>
<p>And so to the weekend, where I made my coaching debut for my club at track on Saturday morning (I don’t think anyone was too put off, fingers crossed...) and Sunday, where I got out early for a 90 minute sweatfest in the endless heatwave.</p>
<p>So, as always, over to you. </p>
<p>What a fabulous weekend that was. On Friday morning I flew to Berlin for the European athletics championships. Since then I’ve seen so many stunning performances and crammed so much in that it feels like about a fortnight ago. </p>
<p>I’ve also developed a total girl-crush on one Catherine Bertone from Italy. She’s 46, she finished eight, and she’s a doctor specialising in infectious diseases. Why she wasn’t running in Wonderwoman kit not the Italian colours I do not know. </p>
<p>So, a fabulous weekend to report on for my penultimate blog. As always though, it’s all about you: come share your stories below the line. </p>
<p>Simply put, we want to help girls and women get the best out of themselves and make smarter and more informed decisions. It is time to reclaim the menstrual cycle and make it work for us, not against us.</p>

<p>So without further ado, to the awards.</p>
<p>After the finish [of parkrun] one of the runners came over and asked if we'd had the baby yet. "yeah we did...early hours of Thursday morning!"</p>
<p>"Excellent" he said. "What did you get?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure but I think it was around 16.52" I replied.</p>
<p>"Riiiight....I actually meant was it a boy or a girl!"</p>
<p>To be honest, I think we should all just be grateful he didn’t name the poor boy Runfaster.</p>

<p>Amid the storm of Covid-19, a raft of cycling and walking announcements has landed as part of the government’s attempt to promote a healthier population, save the NHS from collapse and fend off the worst outcomes from coronavirus.</p>
<p>The plans, which were in the pipeline before the pandemic, are good news for anyone who wants cleaner, safer roads, and residential streets that do not moonlight as rat runs for short-cutting drivers.</p>
<p>The Highway Code matters because it shapes the culture on our roads, from how road users treat each other, to how we police road users.</p>
<p>Three of the most important proposals, which follow a review announced in 2018, are: </p>
<li><p>Rules on giving enough space when overtaking cyclists.</p></li>
<li><p>Detail on road positioning and riding two abreast, which aim to clarify a common source of conflict and confusion, even with roads police.</p></li>
<p>Campaigners would prefer it to be called a “hierarchy of responsibility”, rather than risking the suggestion that some road users are more important than others, but it is good news nonetheless.</p>
<p>There could be new “Dutch reach” rules to encourage motorists to look before opening car doors into the path of cyclists, which can be fatal.</p>

<p>Fortunately, cycling with small children is not merely convenient and healthy but also great fun too. Here is how to do it.</p>
<h2>Starting to cycle with children</h2>
<h2>The question of seating</h2>
<p>Don’t ever be tempted to cycle with your child in a sling or backpack carrier, as in the event of an accident you risk crushing them under your own weight.</p>
<p>There are a wide range of helmets available – the best ones for children come with adjustable headbands that will ensure you can get a good fit as your child grows.</p>

<p>An alternative road sign is being adopted by communities around England to promote the benefits of low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTN).</p>
<p>It has become a popular alternative to red “road closed” signs frequently used at entrances to LTNs.</p>
<p>Campaigners, residents, and councillors say red signs do not effectively communicate the point of LTNs, which are intended to deter drivers from cutting through residential streets between main roads, known as rat-running.</p>
<p>LTNs are not a new concept, but the response to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a proliferation, on a trial basis, as councils seek to promote active travel and reduce local pollution.</p>
<p>Cllr Tom Hayes said: “The street signage has to reflect the desire to have a sense of belonging and a sense of community within the low-traffic neighbourhood area.”</p>
<p>She believes the signs can also speak positively to drivers who feel excluded or inconvenienced by LTNs. Describing red closure signs as “antagonistic”, she said the green signs could help drivers see the roads – and themselves – differently.</p>
<p>But there was no crime in the bank, and the elderly woman lost the £1,000 she had left to be collected. “She was in denial, and she is in still in denial,” says Smith.</p>
<p>“From what I can gather, she is very embarrassed and really ashamed about what has happened. In the end, we had to stop talking about it because it was making her so upset.”</p>
<p>Just under 200,000 of the victims were elderly and vulnerable, it says. Separate figures from Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, show victims aged over 60 lost almost £370m in the 13 months to November.</p>
<p>The effect of being taken in by scammers can be very damaging to the elderly and vulnerable, according to Age UK, the charity which helps older people.</p>
<p>“The crime can have a profound and life-changing impact in someone who is already struggling on a low income, and is then defrauded out of a couple of thousand pounds,” says Lewis.</p>
<p>Older and more vulnerable members of society are often the victims of repeat offences, as information is circulated amongst criminals about easy targets, says Lewis.</p>
<p>The elderly are also particularly susceptible because they are typically at home during the day, often live alone, have some disposable income and use their landlines.</p>

<p>Thousands of people who bought leasehold homes from the housebuilder <a>Taylor Wimpey</a> will be liberated from terms where their ground rent charges doubled every 10 years, after a long-running investigation by the UK competition watchdog. </p>
<p>Taylor Wimpey has voluntarily given formal commitments to the CMA that it will remove terms from leasehold contracts that cause ground rents to double in price– a move welcomed by leasehold campaigners. </p>
<p>The company has also agreed to remove terms from contracts that had previously been converted, so that the ground rent increased in line with the higher retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation.</p>
<p>As a result, affected leaseholders’ ground rents will remain at the amount charged when they first bought their home and will not increase over time.</p>
<p>Taylor Wimpey has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses.</p>
<p>Andrea Coscelli, the CMA chief executive, called the announcement “a huge step forward for leaseholders with Taylor Wimpey”.</p>
<p>He said: “These are totally unwarranted obligations that lead to people being trapped in their homes, struggling to sell or obtain a mortgage.” </p>
<a>launched enforcement action against four housing developers</a> in September 2020 – Countryside, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes – which it believes may have broken consumer protection law in relation to leasehold homes.
<p>In March, the <a>CMA ordered Taylor Wimpey and developer Countryside Properties</a> to remove the terms in their contracts, and wrote to them giving them the opportunity to sign formal commitments, known as undertakings.</p>
<p>Countryside Properties said in September it was <a>voluntarily removing the terms</a> from its contracts.</p>
<p>The housebuilder <a>Persimmon</a> also agreed at the time to offer leasehold homeowners the opportunity to buy the freehold of their property at a discounted price, and to make repayments to some homeowners who bought their freeholds.</p>
<p>Of the four housebuilders against whom the CMA launched enforcement action in September 2020, only the investigation into Barratt Developments is ongoing.</p>
<p>Coscelli said the CMA was prepared to take further action against companies.</p>
<a>Leasehold</a> Campaign (NLC), a not-for-profit organisation created in 2018 to highlight the problems faced by leaseholders, celebrated the Taylor Wimpey announcement.
<p>The NLC co-founder Cath Williams, a university lecturer from Liverpool who bought a leasehold home from the housebuilder, called the move “a real step forward”.</p>
<p>The company said it was making a financial offer, agreed with the CMA, to third-party freeholders of leases that Taylor Wimpey no longer owns, to enable their leaseholders to revert to a fixed ground rent.</p>
<p>As part of its review into the leasehold sector, the CMA is continuing its investigation into two investment groups, Brigante Properties, and Abacus Land and Adriatic Land.</p>
<p>You can sense the sudden political alarm in Westminster. What, if anything, can be done to cushion the blow of higher energy bills that will hit consumers next April?</p>

<p>Energy bills could rise as much as 50% in the spring as the UK faces a “national crisis” over <a>soaring wholesale gas and electricity prices</a>, the energy industry has warned.</p>
<p>The trade body Energy UK has called on the government to intervene to help cut the cost of bills as soaring wholesale prices drive dozens of energy companies out of business.</p>
<p>“Domestic energy prices are going to go up 45% to 50% in the spring,” warned Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday.</p>
<a>Ofgem</a>, has been set at a record £1,277. It is due to change on 1 April when Ofgem is set to raise the cap significantly, which will in turn result in consumers’ bills rising significantly.
<p>Pinchbeck said that only about a fifth of a consumers’ energy bill in the UK is in the control of suppliers. The government sets other costs such as VAT and green energy levies, which could be reduced to help domestic customers.</p>
<p>Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of London-listed Good Energy, described the situation as a “national crisis”.</p>
<p>“Wholesale gas and power prices have increased to unprecedented levels over the last three weeks, creating an extremely difficult operating environment for every business in the industry,” <a>he told the Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>Energy bosses are dialling up the pressure on ministers to shield consumers from soaring gas and electricity bills, with calls on the government to set up a multibillion-pound scheme to help spread the cost to households over a number of years. </p>
<p>Amid warnings that energy bills could rise by 50% next year, <a>triggering a “national crisis”</a>, suppliers such as EDF have called on the Treasury to follow other European countries by cutting VAT and green levies to bring down bills.</p>
<p>One idea gaining traction within the industry, including at the trade body Energy UK, involves a government-administered scheme to smooth the impact across multiple years so that consumers aren’t hit all at once.</p>
<p>“We need government to be thinking about these sorts of options and to take action to mitigate the worst impacts.”</p>
<p>On Thursday the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months.</p>
<p>Since 1 October, the cap – set by the industry regulator <a>Ofgem</a> – has been set at a record £1,277. It is due to change on 1 April when Ofgem is expected to raise it significantly, prompting predictions that the cap will hit £2,000 in 2022.</p>
<p>He said scrapping green levies and VAT “wouldn’t touch the sides” but that an industry-wide loan facility could have a larger impact. “We’ll still have to pay it but we’re not trying to pay off a one-in-30-year event in a single year.”</p>

<p>The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a <a>“national crisis”</a> that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year.</p>
<p>Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are <a>pushing the government to intervene </a>to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices.</p>
<p>Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation.</p>
<p>Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their <a>bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April</a>.</p>
<p>While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers.</p>
<p>The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again.</p>
<p>Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months.</p>
<p>Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy.</p>
<p>But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up.</p>
<p>One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years.</p>

<p>We are renovating a 1950s bungalow that still has coal-fired central heating and we had planned to install a new clean heating system.</p>
<p>The voucher had an initial deadline of 30 August 2021. I requested an extension (due to the amount of time it would take us to do the necessary work) and was told it could be extended to 30 December 2021.</p>
<p>A week later, it emailed again to say that it had made an error and the voucher could only be extended to 30 November, because that was when it closed. It seems that if we can’t get the work done by the deadline, we lose the £5,000.</p>
<p>We have worked flat out to get it all ready, but have now discovered that the heat pump hasn’t been dispatched from the manufacturer and it can’t say when it will arrive.</p>
<p>The £1.5bn green homes grant was launched last year and was supposed to offer households up to £10,000 to improve their home with better insulation and cleaner heating.</p>
<p>It was designed to help people in exactly your kind of property. However, almost immediately it ran into difficulties and was finally scrapped in March. You must have been one of the last households approved for the grant.</p>
<p>Completely insulating a home and installing a new air source heating system with underfloor heating was always going to be tight in just over four months, even before the current supply chain problems hit.</p>
<p>I asked the Department for Business, Energy Industrial Strategy about your case, and it has now intervened. You have been offered a month’s extension to complete the work – until 30 December.</p>
<p>“There may be some limited and very exceptional cases where the voucher deadline could be extended, and applicants should discuss their case with the scheme administrator,” it says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it’s worth others noting that the boiler upgrade scheme, that replaces the green homes initiative and offers £5,000 vouchers to households, opens for business next April, so start planning now.</p>

<p>Unsubscribing doesn’t work and, in fact, seems to generate more.</p>
<p>I asked McAfee about your experience and, in fairness, it came back very quickly to explain that it had, in fact, repaid you for the previous year’s overcharge.</p>
<p>White goods and electronics should be clearly labelled with repair information and “expiry” dates, according to a new report from the Productivity Commission.</p>
<p>The commission’s report on the right to repair found the labelling system should be piloted in Australia.</p>
<a>Samsung</a> were making it harder for consumers to repair product themselves – or get repairs done by anyone but the maker.
<p>The commission also recommended warranty regulations be amended to state that right to remedies under consumer law do not require consumers to have previously used authorised repair services or repair parts.</p>
<p>It turns out that a month after the replacement installation, it issued a bill based on the old meter readings, hence the pursuit over the £1,000. Whether it would have got around to noticing the mistake if I hadn’t waded in is anyone’s guess.</p>

<p>In early October, the Guardian’s consumer desk totted up how many pounds’ worth of fraud had been reported to us by readers over the summer, and were horrified to find that <a>it was in excess of £1m</a>.</p>

<a>warning last year that problems could arise</a> from asking EU citizens to use a digital system to prove they had right to remain in the UK, she followed up the cases of some of those affected. In June, she revealed how
<a>women were being caught out by a glitch which meant the wrong surname would show</a> on the system; then in
<a>September she revealed problems arising from a technical anomaly for people changing their status</a>.
<a>were failing to deliver</a> results in time for travellers, and we received
<a>more and more emails on the subject as people started to travel again</a>. The whole system seemed flawed, and as the summer holidays got into full swing, Zoe Wood put the
<a>spotlight on providers who were charging much more than the headline rates</a>, discovering that the Advertising Standards Authority was investigating.
<a>Pressure mounted in the summer</a>, and there
<a>was more in September, </a>when we found that companies were turning down requests for refunds when tests failed to turn up. Anna Tims’s story was picked up elsewhere, causing Boots to relent and repay a reader whose case she featured. The
<a>competition watchdog has now called for better vetting</a> of the testers that appear on the government website.

<p>I asked to switch broadband/phone provider from Sky to Plusnet with the changeover due at the end of September.</p>
<p>Sky had advised me that if there were any problems, it would continue to provide my broadband until they were sorted out. But Plusnet told Sky that the broadband was up and running, when it obviously wasn’t.</p>
<p>I have spent hours either on the phone or messaging Plusnet but am no further forward.</p>
<p>Each update seems to take four working days, which is very slow. Being without the internet is very frustrating.</p>
<p>I have switched providers before without any problem at all, but I am now wondering if it is quicker to cancel and revert to Sky.</p>
<p>Your case isn’t a great advert for switching supplier, but after a bit of a wait, we have got you reconnected – eight weeks after it was supposed to happen.</p>
<p>Plusnet told you the delays were due to Openreach. A call to the BT press office – BT owns Plusnet – got things moving. The company has apologised for the delay.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason Plusnet is not part of Ofcom’s automatic compensation scheme that offers customers £5-£8 for every day they are without service, depending on the cause.</p>
<p>The company has offered you £300 compensation, which is worth £260, once your extra data charges are accounted for.</p>
<p>Other (potential) customers will want to take note that Plusnet is not part of the scheme which has been signed up to by all the other big providers.</p>

<p>My father, Michael Jones, who has died aged 93, was a science teacher who campaigned successfully for a change in the law to protect people from the nuisance of tall Leylandii hedges. He claimed to have invented the phrase “neighbour from hell”.</p>
<p>Michael was one of six children of Evelyn (nee Round) and Clarence Jones, a clerk. Born close to the West Bromwich Albion ground, in the West Midlands, he was a lifelong supporter of the football club.</p>
<p>In 1951 he married Maureen (nee Barry), a primary school teacher, and they settled on the Bournville Village Trust estate in Birmingham. In 1971 they moved to another part of the estate, where the trust had built new houses.</p>

<p>A Leeds-based firm of solicitors that has been acting on behalf of a debt company has caused an outcry after sending out letters claiming that the recipients had outstanding debts to the energy supplier E.ON.</p>
<p>Observer Cash understands the mailout featured three separate letters. One, headed E.ON, says that the recipient owes the debt for an unpaid gas and electricity bill.</p>
<p>A second letter says the debt has been bought by Barnsley-based PRAC Financial, and the third that PRAC is represented by BW Legal.</p>
<p>Rafael Heeb, a PhD student from Bristol, is one of those sent a letter. It stated that there was a balance due of £198, which would be reduced to £49 if he accepted a “pre-approved 75% discount”.</p>
<p>Other people sent the letters have reported the same experience, with some claiming the bills referred to addresses they had once lived in, but had left with no debts.</p>
<p>The Trustpilot reviews suggest many are furious to have been contacted.</p>
<p>“The letters refer to credit reports etc,” he adds. “I’ve had no contact from E.ON in the preceding five and a half years since we left the property - we settled the account at the time and my credit report shows the account to be satisfied.”</p>
<p>BW calls itself the UK’s largest independent law firm specialising in debt recovery services, and has built a multi-million-pound business, employing 250 people.</p>
<p>In a statement BW Legal questioned the credibility of the reviews published on Trustpilot.</p>
<p>It said in a statement: “Prior to writing to customers, our client (PRAC) has made enquiries with bureaus to trace (and verify) the occupants that were resident at the supply addresses at the time the energy was supplied.</p>
<p>“We have legitimately passed BW Legal the relevant property details and they have undertaken their own checks to identify people who they believe owe the debt.</p>
<p>“However, anyone who believes they have been contacted in error and does not owe the debt should contact BW Legal, so that they can remove their details from the debt.”</p>
<p>Some recipients of the letters have said they plan to report the matter to the Information Commissioner’s Office, believing that their data has been misused. Others say they plan to contact the Solicitors Regulation Authority.</p>
<p>BW Legal says customers are entitled to contact regulatory bodies as they wish. It adds: “We are not disregarding any enquiries from customers, rather, we are proactively working with them to reach amicable solutions.”</p>
<p>We are having a nightmare with Furniture Village, and, looking online, it seems there are many others in the same boat. </p>
<p>In July we ordered a table and chairs from the store’s website, paying £1,170. At the time, we were told delivery would be in mid-October.</p>
<p>By 21 November, there was been no communication and no delivery. I requested callbacks but have had no response.</p>
<p>Furniture Village has had £1,170 of our money for more than four-and-a-half months, and we have no product and no way of communicating with the company.CH, Walthamstow</p>
<p>Ouch! The online reviews do not make great reading, with many reporting similarly long waits for their orders. The retailer isn’t alone – the whole furniture sector is having problems.</p>
<p>I asked the company about your case, and it quickly looked into it and has just delivered your items. To apologise, it has refunded your delivery fee and offered a 10% discount on the extra chairs – should you still wish to buy them.</p>

<p>“By September the payments were still being deducted, and SLC claimed that a ‘mortgage-style’ loan, from Thesis Servicing on my account, was to blame. But it confirmed it had no record of anyone with my name.”</p>
<p>SLC says: “We have apologised for any inconvenience caused as a result of the restriction placed on the account, and can confirm that she is now able to access her balance and statements online, following an update to her account.”</p>
<p>Poor service from suppliers of PCR travel tests is “an issue of national significance”, and regulators are not doing enough to police hundreds of new businesses that have moved into the market, the former competition boss Andrew Tyrie has said.</p>
<a>Competition and Markets Authority</a> until last year, called for a clean up of the list of PCR test providers published on the government website, which many travellers consult before buying a kit.
<p>Tyrie said appearing on the official list has some of the characteristics of a “licence” and it should be possible to enforce minimum service standards. “It’s not beyond the wit of man to ensure that a reasonable service is available.”</p>
<p>These measures should include firms taking liability for consumer costs when test results are late and a staffed phone line and email address with a minimum response time, he says.</p>
<p>Customer reviews and performance scores, based on data such as complaint rates or the proportion of tests processed on time – which companies should be made to share – should also be visible on the official website, Tyrie adds.</p>
<p>If consumers were given more information to gauge the reliability of a service they could make their own decisions about whether to trade quality and reliability off against price. “That way the good firms can drive out the bad,” he said.</p>
<p>The government website, which lists testing companies in price order, says it “does not endorse or recommend any specific test provider” and “you should do your own research”.</p>
<p>Tyrie, a former Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury select committee, gained notoriety grilling prime ministers, Bank of England officials and banking chiefs after the 2008 financial crisis. He resigned as chairman of the CMA last summer.</p>
<p>Since leaving he has been critical of the watchdog’s performance. Problems in the testing market had been obvious since the spring and the CMA should have moved faster, with warning letters or potentially a test case, he argues.</p>
<a>coronavirus taskforce</a> was a mistake too, he suggests. The unit had been effective in the early months of the pandemic when, for example, it clamped down on suspected profiteering on hand sanitiser.
<p>With the PCR travel test still a minefield for consumers Tyrie said the CMA had the “technical expertise to help the DHSC minimise the consumer detriment and needed to make every effort to put it at their disposal”.</p>

<p>Showcasing the stunning <a>Lake District</a> scenery and covering the stories of local producers and farmers, the series provides an insight into rural community life in Cumbria and its relationship to the wider world along the M6 motorway.</p>
<p>First to feature is the master butcher – the ruddy-faced Dave Morland. He selects all the meat sold at the services, with the lamb, hogget and mutton coming from the <a>Herdwick sheep</a> that were served at the Queen’s coronation.</p>
<p>There is also a kitchen that makes homemade dishes for the vast restaurant, an indoor and outdoor children’s play area, a 51-bedroom hotel and restaurant, a caravan park and a truck stop.</p>
<p>We meet some of the suppliers after the documentary preview screening held inside another one of the Dunning family ventures – the <a>Rheged</a> – a cinema, shop and community space built in an old lime kiln 16 miles from Tebay.</p>
<p>Butcher Morland lives and breathes the “nose to tail” ethos of the services’ butchery and its close relationship with the Dunning family’s farm. Minimising waste and respecting every part of the animal, Tebay even processes its own sheepskins. </p>
<p>“What drew me to the services is that it is not always about the highest margin – they put quality and provenance above profit,” he says.</p>
<p>“I sent them an email and they came to my restaurant – they love it and now the whole country will be able to taste my food,” he says.</p>
<p>But Dunning remains inspiringly humble. Attending agricultural college as a young man, he recognised there would be a postwar recession in agriculture with a bleak future for hill farmers.</p>
<p>“We are still a farming family, but we have managed to employ hundreds of local people – in Cumbria, that is significant,” he says.</p>
<p>His daughter, <a>Sarah</a>, is chair of the Westmorland Family, which owns and operates the services.</p>
<p>“As we’ve grown, we’ve realised how important that central principle of good food and supporting local producers is – our businesses are always champions of their place,” she says.</p>
<ul><li>Lake District holidays</li></ul>
<p>My favourite agriturismo in the world is <a>Foresteria San Leo</a>, run by the bravissima Maria Giovanna Allegretti on a mountainside in Basilicata, but I think Glebe House could just make second place.</p>
<a>Tomorrow</a>) is also one of Leeds’ most exciting kitchens. Some meat is served but
<a>Torito Taco</a>, and Middle Eastern food at
<a>MorMor</a>), as is the music policy. Where else could you listen to leftfield Glaswegian legends
<a>Optimo</a> while scarfing a burger from the
<a>Patty Freaks</a>? Elsewhere in Leeds, streetfood fans should also check the indoor hubs,
<a>Trinity Kitchen</a>, as well as the permanent Vicar Lane home of one-time truckers
<a>Pizza Fella</a>, purveyors of outstanding wood-fired pizza. Thurs-Sun, card payment only, outdoor seating, QR-code ordering, meals from £6
<h2>Little Bao Boy @ Leeds City Tap</h2>

<h2>Culture and nature on the Teifi</h2>
<p>A winding section leads to the Cors Caron national nature reserve, a peat bog reddened by sedges, sphagnum moss and bog asphodel. The headless body of an iron age man was discovered here in 1811. The bog’s reed beds can be explored on boardwalks.</p>
<a>Riverbank Cafe and Farm Shop</a> in Tregarnon, and admire traditional textiles in Llanybydder at
<a>Jen Jones Welsh Quilts and Blankets</a>. Lampeter’s
<a>Welsh Quilt Centre</a> has a huge collection but has postponed reopening until 2022.
<a>Y’Gelli Campsite</a> (£35pp), overlooking the river. More comfy perhaps is the
<a>Emlyn Hotel</a> (doubles from £99 BB) with antique-filled rooms, garden and spa in Newcastle Emlyn.
<a>National Coracle Centre</a> at Cenarth Falls displays the traditional boats in a 17th-century mill, near a famous salmon leap and 200-year-old bridge.
<a>Fforest</a>, whose main glamping and cabin site lies upriver on an 81-hectare (200-acre) farm, has expanded into town, serving wood-fired pizza under riverside tipis at
<a>Pizzatipi</a>, Welsh craft beer at its pub Tafarn Smwglin, and creating new retro-rustic riverside apartments in an old warehouse at
<a>Granary Lofts</a> (sleep two, from £190 for two nights).
<p>Finally, almost at the river’s mouth, another ancient abbey, St Dogmaels, and several riverside pubs are a fab final fling before the sea.</p>
<h2>Picnics, walks and dips along the Wharfe</h2>
<a>George Inn</a> (doubles from £95 BB) will do a pint and a sarnie, or you can continue downriver to Kettlewell’s charming
<a>The Bluebell</a> (doubles from £100 BB). Further down, it’s worth making a detour to watch the rockclimbers on the sheer rock-face of Kilnsey Crag, and to hike over into stunning Littondale. Here in Arncliffe the characterful
<a>Falcon Inn</a> has brilliantly chintzy dining rooms and snugs, whose walls are covered in knick-knacky treasure, and beer is still poured from a jug.
<a>Craven Arms</a> is a delight, with great grub and shepherd’s huts from £140 a night. Or camp by the river at
<a>Masons Campsite</a> (pitches from £30 a night, glamping from £155).
<a>Bolton Abbey</a>, where you could spend a whole day swimming in the pool upstream, picnicking in the priory grounds, crossing the famous stepping stones and perhaps even pushing the boat out with a fancy dinner at the
<a>Devonshire Arms Hotel and Spa</a> (doubles from £189 BB).
<a>first designated bathing site on a river</a>, under an EU scheme. It will be regularly monitored, and protected by the Environment Agency. The town also has a
<a>stunning lido</a> if you’re missing chlorine and showers by then.
<a>River Spey Kayak</a> runs paddleboarding tours (from £45pp), while
<a>Much Better Adventures</a> has an epic five-day summit-to-sea canoe and wild camping trip (£650pp, Aug-Oct), kicking off with a hike up Ben Macdui and a dip in Loch Etchachan, taking in
<a> national nature reserve</a> and canoeing rapids called the Washing Machine, looking out for red squirrels, otters and ospreys along the way.
<a>Spirit of the Spey</a> has a luxury canoeing week including hotels, castle visits and distillery tours (£2,000pp).
<a>Old Bridge Inn</a> (doubles from £60 room-only) has good scran in a riverside beer garden; downriver
<a>Nethy House</a> (doubles from £62 room-only) is a stylish cafe with rooms that operates mountain bike trails on the neighbouring
<a>Glenlivet Estate</a>; and Grantown on Spey’s
<a>Garth Hotel</a> (doubles from £80 room-only) serves sublime local langoustines with chips.
<h2>Foodie tour along the Thames</h2>
<a>Le Boat</a> (three nights from £619, sleeps three, various pickup points), or a Zen electric boat (from £180 for a half-day for eight people,
<a>Sonning</a>, east of Reading, whose gardens are full of sofas and igloo domes. It’s in the grounds of the
<a>Great House</a>, which has cool doubles from £75 room-only. There are numerous waterside pubs in Henley-on-Thames, such as
<a>Bistro at the Boathouse</a>, good for a bargain breakfast or bottomless brunch, and Marlow’s
<a>Bounty</a> in Bourne End, which serves cask ales from a boat-shaped bar that’s accessible only by boat or on foot. Cookham’s bright white
<a>Ferry</a>might tempt with its rotisserie pork belly with scallops (£19) or trio of roasts (£18).
<a>Roux at Skindles</a> offers French dishes such as a dozen Burgundy snails (£14) and chantilly choux buns (£10). It’s a cheaper Roux clan indulgence than the famous
<a>Waterside at Bray</a>. Also in Bray, Heston Blumenthal’s
<a>Fat Duck</a> (from £250pp). He used to own the nearby
<a>Crown</a> too, where you can get a glass of vino for a fiver in the garden marquee. A last port of call might be
<a>Oakley Court</a> near Windsor, a Victorian gothic hotel newly souped up with maximalist boho-chic verve: its gorgeous riverside gardens are great for pizza on the lawn (from £11) or a savoury afternoon tea.
<h2>Wildlife and city thrills on the Tyne</h2>
<a>reintroduction programme</a> in Kielder Forest – and many bird species.
<a>Kielder Water</a>, with its woodland paths, red squirrels and wonderful collection of
<a>contemporary sculptures</a>. Its
<a>Gold Tier dark sky park</a> status makes it one of the best places in Europe for stargazing, so it’s worth staying overnight – try
<a>Landal Kielder Waterside</a> cabins (three nights from £415, sleeping four).
<a>River Tyne Trail </a>to Hexham, where the North Tyne meets the South and there’s a salmon leap. Nearby in Wall, the
<a>Hadrian Hotel </a>has doubles from £120 BB, and its restaurant,
<a>Hjem</a>, is a Michelin-starred, Scandinavian-style wonder (tasting menu £120pp). It’s a good base for Hadrian’s Wall, which ran for 73 miles from the mouth of the Tyne to Solway Firth, plus the Roman garrison town of
<a>Segedunum Roman Fort</a>, near Wallsend.
<a>Kittiwakes upon the Tyne.</a>Some of these birds nest on the ledges of Gateshead’s
<a>Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art</a>, whose exhibitions and self-guided audio tours are also worth swooping on.
<a>CBK Adventure </a>(£60pp), including drinks in the
<a>Head of Steam</a> bar. There’s another waterside bar at the smart new
<a>Innside</a> hotel (doubles from £74 room-only).
<p>To explore the whole river in an active dash, <a>Intrepid</a> has a source-to-sea trip by bike, on foot and in canoe or kayak, staying in hotels (from £851pp for four days).</p>
<a>Olive Branch</a>, Clipsham), the UK’s longest-retained Michelin star (
<a>Hambleton Hall</a>), one of England’s last operational 19th-century windmills (at
<a>Discover Rutland Food Drink Week</a>, a festival of samplings, beer tastings, pumpkin picking and special menus created by the county’s best chefs, culminating in the Rutland Ball.
<a>Food Drink Trail</a> – a 25-mile downloadable cycle route via various producers, cafes, brewers, fudge makers and more, in Oakham and countryside villages – to find out if the county was as tasty as it claimed.
<a>Whitwell</a>. And with breakfast in mind, I was soon pedalling up a leafy lane to
<a>Otters Fine Foods</a> cafe/deli to
<a>Leeson Butchers</a> (purveyor of award-winning pork pies). I rode to the
<a>Garden Nursery</a>, where behind the pot plants and lovely cafe an England cricketer has exchanged bat for barbecue tongs.
<a>Hoggy’s Grill</a>. Unsure what to do after retiring, he finally decided to focus on what he loves most – eating and drinking, ideally outside, with flames – and opened Hoggy’s in 2020.

<h2>Downhill Skiing and snowboarding, Scotland and northern England</h2>
<a>Snow Centre</a> (from £29 an hour adults, £24 juniors, group lessons from £42 an hour), or the country’s dozens of
<a>dry ski slopes</a> is a lot of fun, they can’t really compare with sliding down proper snowy mountains in the great outdoors.
<a>The Lecht</a> – usually open in December, with the best snow from January until resorts close in April. If you can, go last minute when there’s snow incoming, ideally midweek when the slopes are quieter.
<a>Register for snow alerts in advance</a> and check resorts’ own websites or Facebook pages for conditions updates.
<p>A quick lowdown: <a>Nevis Range</a> (day tickets £37.50 adults, £24.50 junior), Scotland’s highest resort, has arguably the widest variety of terrain, with 35 runs, 12 lifts and an off-piste area of “Back Corries” – steep chutes – for experts.</p>
<p><a>Glencoe Mountain Resort</a> (£27-35 per day adult, £20-22 junior), with 20 runs and nine lifts, claims to have the longest and steepest pistes, and has “<a>microlodge</a>” wooden cabin accommodation (from £65 sleeping four) at the resort base.</p>
<p>The smallest of the five, <a>The Lecht Ski Centre</a> (adult day ticket £32, children/juniors £16-21 per day) in the eastern Cairngorms, has 20 runs and 13 lifts on a rolling hillside.</p>
<a>Lake District Ski Club</a> (£20 per day, £50 annual membership) sets up a button lift on Raise, the peak next to Helvellyn, to access nine spectacular ungroomed runs; while
<a>Weardale Ski Club</a> (£20 adult day ticket, £48 season ticket) in County Durham has two button tows accessing off-piste terrain and about six runs, for intermediates only. In Northumberland, volunteer-run
<a>Ski Allenheads</a> (annual membership only, £35 adults, £20 junior, £70 family) has several tow lifts, a cabin, and is beginner friendly, offering short runs.
<p>Buy the annual pass for Yad Moss and you can ski at the others at a reduced cost.</p>
<h2>Dog-sledding, Gloucestershire and Kincardineshire</h2>
<a>Herder’s Hut</a>, based on a Sami home, is available too, from £120 a night, sleeping two.
<h2>Ice-climbing, Highlands and Snowdonia</h2>
<p>Using ice axes and crampons to ascend walls of ice is a portal to a beautiful, dangerous frozen world – those who master the sport scale frozen waterfalls and glaciers. Indoor ice walls provide introductory sessions and safety advice.</p>
<p><a>Ice-Factor</a> at the National Ice Climbing Centre near Ben Nevis is home to the world’s biggest indoor ice-climbing walls, offering beginners’ lessons (£30 adults, £25 juniors), or non-instructed (£9.50 adults, £5.75 juniors).</p>
<a>Climb365</a>, whose two-day introductory course in Scotland’s West Highlands costs from £275-350 for a group of one to four people per instructor, starting from Fort William. Similarly,
