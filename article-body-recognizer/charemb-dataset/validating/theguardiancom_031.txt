<p>Twenty-four hours after I gave birth to my second child, my employer called to ask when I planned to return to work.</p>
<p>As we gathered our things, the phone rang. It was someone from the HR office at the paper bag factory where I worked. After briefly making the obligatory inquiry as to how my new baby was doing, the HR rep got to the real reason for her call.</p>
<p>I got the message loud and clear.</p>
<p>That was in the early 1990s, in a rural area in the coal region of Pennsylvania, where I live. I doubt much has changed since then.</p>
<a>one in five workers</a> in the US has access to paid family leave. The rest are forced to make impossible and risky choices.
<a>One in four</a> new mothers returns to work within two weeks of giving birth. I know firsthand that is not nearly long enough to recover.
<a>44 million Americans</a> provide care to parents or other adult relatives or friends, representing 37bn hours of unpaid labor each year.
<p>Providing a basic minimum of paid family leave to all Americans shouldn’t be controversial – and definitely shouldn’t seem like such an impossible goal.</p>

<a>140 officers were injured</a>. Five people died.
<p>Even now, almost a year later, Americans remain confused and divided about the significance of what occurred. Let me offer four basic truths:</p>
<h2>1. Trump incited the attack on the Capitol</h2>
<p>For weeks before the attack, Trump urged supporters to come to Washington for a “Save America March” on 6 January, when Congress was to ceremonially count the electoral votes of Joe Biden’s win.</p>
<p>“We will never give up,” he <a>said.</a> “We will never concede. It will never happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.”</p>
<p>He then told the crowd that “different rules” applied to them.</p>
<p>Then he dispatched the crowd to the Capitol as the electoral count was about to start. The attack came immediately after.</p>
<h2>2. The events of 6 January capped two months during which Trump sought to reverse the outcome of the election</h2>
<a>Michigan</a>, to inquire about how they might alter election results. He even called two local canvassing board officials in Wayne county, Michigan’s most populous county and one that overwhelmingly favored Biden.
<a>find 11,780 votes</a>”, according to a recording of that conversation, adding: “The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.”
<p>Presumably, more details of Trump’s attempted coup will emerge after the House select committee on 6 January gathers more evidence and deposes more witnesses.</p>
<h2>3. Trump’s attempted coup continues</h2>
<a>said </a>the former president “supports any patriotic American who dedicates their time and effort to exposing the rigged 2020 presidential election”.
<p>“Remember,” he said, “the insurrection took place on 3 November. It was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on 6 January.” (Reminder: they were armed.)</p>
<p>He then referred to the House investigation: “Why isn’t the Unselect Committee of highly partisan political hacks investigating the CAUSE of the 6 January protest, which was the rigged presidential election of 2020?”</p>
<p>“In many ways a Rino is worse than a Radical Left Democrat,” Trump said, “because you don’t know where they are coming from and you have no idea how bad they really are for our country.”</p>
<p>He added: “The good news is there are fewer and fewer Rinos left as we elect strong patriots who love America.”</p>

<p>Living near green space could reduce the physical and psychological symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), researchers have found.</p>
<a>Health</a> and the University of Bergen found that women living in neighbourhoods with more green space had fewer PMS symptoms and were less likely to experience anxiety, depression, difficulty sleeping, breast tenderness or abdominal bloating.
<p>Although PMS causes clinically relevant symptoms in up to 20% of women of reproductive age, there have not previously been any studies into its relationship with green space.</p>
<p>The study, published in Environment International, adds to a growing body of evidence of the health benefits associated with natural environments.</p>
<p>The study adopted the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to calculate green space and scientists also estimated exposure to air pollution.</p>
<p>The research aimed to establish whether living near an urban green space could improve PMS symptoms and whether it was affected by body mass index, air pollution or physical activity.</p>
<p>The research is “another building block” in understanding of what the best conditions are to live healthily, he said.</p>
<p>Previous research has suggested that the benefits of natural space are linked to a rise in physical activity and a reduction in air pollution exposure. But the latest study did not find that these factors played a role.</p>
<p>Dadvand said that despite growing evidence of the beneficial impact of green space on health, many cities still did not have enough of it. He said: “City officials should therefore prioritise natural environments as essential for our health.”</p>

<p>Two diamond bracelets that Marie Antoinette sent away in a wooden chest for safekeeping before she was guillotined during the French Revolution, have sold at auction in Geneva for 7.46m Swiss francs (£7.04m).</p>
<p>The sum was several times higher than the pre-sale estimate, amid a growing interest in items of jewellery and clothing belonging to the former French queen. The buyer was bidding by telephone and not identified.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette’s surviving daughter, Marie Thérèse received the jewels on her arrival in Austria, the auction house added.</p>
<p>The bracelets were kept within royal lineage for more than 200 years, Christie’s said.</p>

<p>The trend seems to have started in a handful of high-end London bars and restaurants, which noticed how the free promotion from social media posts and check-ins brought new customers flooding in.</p>
<p>Now there are published lists touting the “most Instagrammable” restaurants – and they invariably feature vast and elaborate faux floral displays.</p>
<p>The trend is now moving beyond the restaurant sector – and the capital – and being picked up by hairdressers, beauty salons and even actual florists all over the UK.</p>
<p>And it is becoming a domestic trend too. Tesco, which these days has a dedicated buyer of fake blooms, is typical. “We’ve seen a nearly threefold year-on-year increase in sales of artificial flowers,” said a spokesperson.</p>
<p>In fairness, not all artificial flowers are plastic: there are varieties made from real silk, but they are vastly more expensive and make up only a fraction of sales. The great bulk are made from types of plastic.</p>

<a>popularity of artificial lawns.</a> Not only can astroturf not be recycled, but it destroys habitats for birds, insects and, famously, hedgehogs. Now, it seems, we need to take the boom in fake flora seriously on an eco level too.
<p>“To learn that we’re now seeing a surge in popularity for plastic flowers is utterly depressing. We need less plastic in our lives, not more.”</p>
