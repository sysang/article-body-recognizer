<h1> Costa Mesa honors 100-year-old World War II vet who built out South Coast Plaza </h1>
<div><div> By Sara Cardine </div><div>Daily Pilot</div></div>
<p>For many, turning 100 years old may be a quiet event. But not for Costa Mesa’s Merl Cornelius, who was never the quiet type to begin with.</p>
<p>Costa Mesa Mayor John Stephens and Councilman Loren Gameros spoke to the small audience and presented an official city proclamation to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Stephens said Monday that he’s happy to celebrate the city’s centenarians, especially those whose contributions have helped shape Costa Mesa into what it is today.</p>
<p>In addition to his military service, Cornelius has deep ties to Southern California landmarks.</p>
<p>In his decades overseeing the construction of large-scale structures, including the landmark Zenith Building on Los Angeles’ Wilshire Boulevard, a key project was the 1973 expansion of Costa Mesa’s South Coast Plaza.</p>
<p>“I said, we don’t have a year to give away — we’ll do the plaza, the dome and the fountains all at the same time,” recalled Cornelius, who would go on to become operations manager.</p>
<p>Doing the math himself, Cornelius found another subcontractor and personally guaranteed the work, said Nate Wendt, who, as a live-in caregiver for the Costa Mesa elder, has edited endless pages of autobiography recounting Cornelius’ rich life.</p>
<p>“He got it done in six months and under price, and that dome is still the cherry on top of South Coast Plaza,” Wendt said.</p>
<p>Daughter Bette Bell, 70, started organizing her father’s celebration well in advance of his Dec. 4 birthday, working with city officials to pull off the big day and organizing a birthday card campaign that netted more than 100 greetings.</p>
<p>The event went off without a hitch, she said Monday.</p>
<p>“He absolutely had a blast,” Bell said. “It was amazing — everybody stayed around for a while and shared stories.”</p>
<p>Though he understands the symbolic importance of reaching the personal milestone, Cornelius said being 100 doesn’t feel too much different from being 99 a few days ago.</p>
<p>When asked what advice he’d give youngsters today, given his long and varied life experience, the ordinarily talkative Costa Mesan answered matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Work hard,” he said.</p>

<h1> Before Pearl Harbor, L.A. was home to thriving Japanese communities. Here’s what they were like </h1>
<div><div> By Patt MorrisonColumnist </div></div>
<p>You know the date — Dec. 7 — and what happened then, and what happened thereafter, to the United States and to the world.</p>
<p>But what was life like on Dec. 6, 1941, and in the years before then, closer to home, for one group of people for whom that date would alter their lives — the Japanese and Japanese Americans in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>For the many thousands of them living on the West Coast — among them U.S. citizens — Pearl Harbor’s “thereafter” meant being detained, dispossessed of property, and sent to incarceration camps.</p>
<p>In 1941, about 36,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans were living in and around Los Angeles, most of them within about five miles of Little Tokyo, the growing nucleus of the community for more than half a century.</p>
<a>federal Chinese Exclusion Act</a> had codified what California, by law and
<a>by violence</a>, had been rolling toward for years.
<p>“But they also adopted American traditions, so you see the emergence of Japanese American culture: baseball, even food traditions — you definitely see them incorporating some American foods.”</p>
<b>-</b>luck treat, mochi, has become a hugely popular fusion sweet in the U.S. It was the inspiration of
<p>Little Tokyo is littler than it used to be. Part of it was sacrificed after the war to build the LAPD headquarters, Parker Center, which was itself razed a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Beyond the footprint of Little Tokyo itself, pre-war Japanese and Japanese Americans lived and worked across much of L.A.</p>
<p>It was a company town, as Naomi Hirahara and Geraldine Knatz wrote in “Terminal Island: Lost Communities of Los Angeles Harbor,” but also, to some residents’ way of thinking, an “enchanted island.”</p>
<p>How that idyll ended, I’ll get to presently.</p>
<b> </b>American man in four was a gardener, and, as The Times noted, gardeners “became the cornerstone of the Japanese American community, establishing schools and churches.”
<p>The 1913 ban on land ownership “was intentional,” said Hayashi, “to prevent social mobilization.” One work-around was buying or putting land in the name of U.S.-born citizen children.</p>
<p>And then, beginning <a>Dec. 7, 1941</a>, it was all <a>swept away</a>.</p>
<a>incarceration camps</a>. The village was bulldozed, possessions vanished. And, like the farmers of the South Bay, the fisherfolk of Fish Harbor did not return.
<a>Manzanar</a> during the war. Someone evidently looked after the property for them, and in 1960, the family moved the business to Silver Lake. They closed the place in 2006.

<h1> Community mourns after Wilmington shooting that killed one child, critically wounded another </h1>
<div><div> By Cindy Carcamo, <div>Kevin Rector, Richard Winton, Gregory Yee </div></div></div>
<p>The shooting of two children in Wilmington on Monday afternoon, leaving one dead and a second critically injured, sparked outrage and mourning in the community and across L.A. as police looked for suspects.</p>
<p>Coroner’s officials on Tuesday identified Alexander Alvarado, 12, as the boy who was killed. His stepmother, in her 30s, was injured in the shooting, as was a 9-year-old girl who was playing at a nearby school, police said.</p>
<p>The girl was struck while on a playground during an after-school program at Wilmington Park Elementary School, officials said.</p>
<p>After the shooting, the stepmother drove a short distance away, stopping at North Eubank Avenue near East Anaheim Street, where she and the boys were found.</p>
<p>The motive for the shooting is unknown. </p>
<p>Moore called the shooting “tragic” and said it was part of a broader increase in gun violence in the last two years — and particularly since last month.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven people were shot in the city in the last week, including 19 just over the weekend, Moore said.</p>
<p>Moore also highlighted a recent incident in which two homeless people were killed when gunmen opened fire on a trailer where they were staying in southeast Los Angeles. Moore said that shooting appeared to be a “very targeted” attack.</p>
<p>Between that shooting and the one in Wilmington, nearly 100 rounds were fired, Moore said, adding that both incidents reflected a troubling increase of firearms on the streets of L.A. in recent years and the willingness of criminals to use them.</p>
<p>For some residents, the shooting in Wilmington underscored the need for more attention to violence in the harbor area.</p>
<p>When Guadalupe Meza heard about the shooting, she couldn’t help but think of her 18-year-old grandson, who was shot to death near his home in September of last year.</p>
<p>“The violence continues,” she thought after she got the news of the latest fatal shooting, just blocks from her home.</p>
<p>Meza, 74, said her grandson Jesse Adrian Meza was studious and had just graduated from high school. He was shot while in a parked vehicle with his cousin, who was also killed.</p>
<p>“Why does this keep happening?” she asked in Spanish.</p>
<p>Meza said her community is largely forgotten and blames “government officials who don’t help the neighborhood.” </p>
<p>“They need to do something to stop all of this,” she added.</p>
<p>L.A. City Councilmember Joe Buscaino, whose district includes Wilmington, said that the community was in mourning and that parks and playgrounds should be safe havens for families.</p>

<div> <div> <div><a>California</a></div> <h1> Lizard people, deadly orgies and JFK: How QAnon hijacked Hollywood to spread conspiracies </h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Anita ChabriaStaff Writer </div> </div>
<p>Where we go one, we go all. </p>
<p>The motto was roughly engraved on the vessel’s bell, which served as the emotional heart of the story and earned its own close-up around the 16-minute mark. </p>
<p>Robinson, even with a writer’s mind, never imagined that a quarter century later, those seven words would be the rallying cry of QAnon, a global conspiracy theory that seeks to undermine American democracy. </p>
<p>In the convoluted and often nonsensical world of QAnon, Hollywood plays a big role — and not just for providing its “Where we go...” mantra, often shortened to WWG1WGA for merchandise and social media.</p>
<p>“There is no question that it is disturbing to hear that people involved in QAnon … have embraced that fictional creation,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to stand up and say out loud anywhere, anytime that this was a science fiction fantasy that had nothing do with reality.”</p>
<a>a curtailing of rights for women and minorities</a>.
<p>Johnson wanted to write a cautionary tale about how easily fascism can advance, even in the United States. </p>
<p>Sagansky, he recalled, suggested changing them into aliens to make it more palatable. </p>
<a>killed his brother with a sword</a>, believing he was a lizard person. He was found incompetent to stand trial and committed to a mental hospital.
<p>Bloom, the extremist researcher, said the familiarity of recycled Hollywood plots may be part of what eases followers into QAnon’s depths: Although the claims are outlandish, they tickle at recollections, whether from fiction or reality. </p>
<p>“Part of the idea is that Hollywood has been doing this for ages and ages, and they have been hiding in plain sight by putting it in film,” Bloom said. </p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>QAnon’s ‘collateral damage’: Families struggle to pull loved ones back from the brink</a> </p></div>
<p>No easy answers when a family member has fallen into the clutches of “Q,” the conspiracy theory popular with supporters of former President Trump. </p>
<p>“That’s one of the reasons some of the more outlandish things resonate, is because it sort of seems plausible,” Bloom said. </p>
<p>The screenplay was based on a 1926 novella, <i>“Traumnovelle”</i> (“Dream Story”), by Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler, that had long intrigued Raphael and Kubrick. </p>
<p>But he is not dismissive of the harm of current conspiracy theories. </p>
<p>“Please understand that I am not pretending that it doesn’t matter,” he said. “What I fear is that it does matter and there is nothing we can do about it.”</p>
<p>A world that has long embraced love, light and acceptance is now making room for something else: QAnon.</p>
<p>Some at Dealey Plaza have carried banners that read “Trump Kennedy 2024,” with “Where we go one, we go all” as a tagline. </p>
<p>The phrase was never meant to be a rallying cry, he said, but rather describes the symbiotic relationship between sailors and their ship.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, Robinson became aware of the QAnon fascination with both the motto and the bell, when a distant acquaintance began sending him cryptic texts, he said. </p>
<p>Eventually, “I was asked flat out about ‘White Squall’ and “where we go one, we go all” and if I had some inner knowledge or connection about any of this,” he said. </p>
<p>It made him amused, perplexed and concerned. </p>
<p>“How could something I wrote 24 years earlier have anything to do with some modern-day conspiracy theory?” he wondered. “It defies logic and any level of critical thinking.”</p>

<h1> Legal counseling, Zumba, English classes: Afghans adjust to temporary life on U.S. military bases </h1>
<div><div> By Andrea CastilloStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>A new father stopped Col. Soleiman Rahel as he walked through the old soldiers’ barracks, now dormitories for thousands of people evacuated following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p>
<p>“I want you to know I named my son after you,” the man told him. </p>
<p>The gesture stands out for Rahel as a symbol of the significance of his work assisting the largest U.S. resettlement effort in half a century. For Rahel, it’s personal — 35 years ago, he too arrived from Afghanistan as a refugee. </p>
<p>When the Taliban stormed Kabul last August, Rahel left his wife and home in Sacramento and moved temporarily to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. Afghans there know him as “the governor” of their new village. </p>
<div><p><a>World Nation</a></p><p> <a>Why are most Afghan evacuees still housed at U.S. military camps?</a> </p></div>
<p>Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August, 67,000 Afghan allies have been evacuated to the U.S. Only 10,000 of them have been resettled.</p>
<p>At a conversational English class, two Afghan volunteer teachers stood before a few dozen children. On a whiteboard, they had written the vocabulary words of the day: stand, sit, hot, cold, table, chair. </p>
<p>In unison, the students chanted sentences using their new words. “This is a chair. That is a table.”</p>
<p>Jeff Drumtra, who leads social programming for the refugees at McGuire, said some children are working though their trauma and loss in drawings. </p>
<p>“You see the colors of the Afghan flag, either as a flag or in a heart. Some drawings have blood droplets coming from the heart,” he said. </p>
<p>“We never want to let anybody think that we’re going to to let the Afghan flag drop on the floor,” she said in Dari through an interpreter. </p>
<div><p><a>World Nation</a></p><p> <a>An errant U.S. drone strike killed 10 members of their family. They’re still awaiting compensation</a> </p></div>
<p>U.S. officials called the errant drone strike that killed 10 in Afghanistan a ‘tragic mistake.’ The family is still waiting for it to be rectified.</p>
<p>Khairi said her father was in the Afghan military and worked with U.S. troops. When she and her parents arrived at the Kabul airport, he couldn’t make it safely through Taliban checkpoints and was left behind. Now he is in hiding. </p>
<p>Though she loves art and writing, Khairi said she dreams of becoming a surgeon — something that felt impossible in Afghanistan because of limited education and opportunities for women. </p>
<p>At Liberty Village, a linguist helped her translate some of her poems into English to share with military personnel. One, written Sept. 1 at a military base in Germany, is called “I Am a Refugee.” </p>

<p>More than 100 babies — including baby Rahel — have been born since the first Afghans arrived at McGuire on Aug. 24. Just under half of the guests are children under 14. </p>
<p>Each housing complex is overseen by a lieutenant colonel who is identified as the “mayor” and holds weekly town halls with residents. Two “governors,” including the elder Rahel, oversee the entire village. </p>
<p>Rahel came to the U.S. at age 15 after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Assisting Afghans in a similar position feels like his life’s purpose, he said. </p>
<p>After Liberty Village goes back to just being Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Rahel said, his work on Afghan resettlement will continue. </p>

<h1> How Richard Gomez’s tamale cart design will change sidewalk vending in L.A. </h1>
<div><div> By Carolina A. MirandaColumnist </div></div>
<p>Take one part classic car. Add a heavy scoop of midcentury ice cream cart. Paint in candy shades.</p>
<p>Officially known as the Tamalero, Gomez’s new cart design is revolutionary because it has managed to receive something that once seemed impossible: the approval of the L.A. County Department of Public Health. </p>
<p>When he finally saw that plan, he says he still couldn’t quite believe it. “The satisfaction,” he says, somewhat at a loss for words, “knowing that it may change people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Certainly, the Tamalero — which has been approved to dispense tamales and tamales only — is no small achievement. </p>
<p>Good luck pushing that anywhere, much less getting it on a sidewalk. </p>
<a>operate in a state of economic precarity</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the situation.
<p>This summer, a group of vendors took to the steps of L.A. City Hall <a>in protest</a>, complete with a cardboard mock-up of what a code-compliant cart might look like. It was unreasonably huge.</p>

<h1> Helping Indigenous restaurant workers in the languages they speak </h1>
<div><div> By Esther Tseng </div></div>
<p>Gustavo Molina, an undocumented, longtime cook in the Beverly Hills area, was at home in March 2020 when he got a call letting him know that he would no longer be needed at work due to the pandemic shutdown.</p>
<p>“Initially, the other cooks and I thought it was going to last one to two weeks — or one month, at the most. But later, we found out that the restaurant was going to close completely,” says Molina.</p>
<b> </b>another establishment, but he is working fewer hours than before COVID upended his world.
<a>40%</a> of all restaurant employees are undocumented. Many of these migrant workers are Indigenous, primarily speaking an Indigenous language local to their village in Mexico or Guatemala. (Zapotecs in particular have a
<a>long history</a> in the Los Angeles restaurant world.) Sometimes such workers are not fluent in Spanish, presenting barriers to communication with their co-workers and superiors as well as the ability to advocate for their rights.
<p>“There’s an assumption that we’re<b> </b>all Latinx, and people don’t take into account the diversity of our languages,” says Romero, who is Zapotec and interprets.</p>
<b> </b>could get services and representation. Since the pandemic started, however, CIELO has expanded, evolving into a resource for not only pandemic-related but basic needs, like cash assistance, food and other supplies.
<p>Workers are acutely vulnerable to exploitation. Often in back-of-house positions, undocumented restaurant workers experience <a>wage theft</a> or nefarious fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Molina was the victim of one. Using a caller ID made to look like LAPD’s Rampart Division, criminals impersonating an authority threatened to “charge” him with a crime unless he made payments, ultimately extracting $1,800 from him.</p>
<p>“Odilia connected me with the captain of the Rampart police station, and I told him the whole story. He told me that it was a scam and helped me file a report,” Molina says.</p>
<p>These scams among the community can fuel distrust, making it hard to know who to accept help from, but established relationships have been instrumental in connecting undocumented Indigenous workers to the right resources, including monetary aid.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, CIELO has given out more than $2.2 million in cash and $1.8 million in grocery cards, which is helping workers who are dealing with food insecurity.</p>

<p>“The Indigenous peoples have always been putting food on our table.”</p>
<div> <div> <div><a>Food</a></div> <h1> A young Black chef in complete command of his kitchen and himself </h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Donovan X. RamseyStaff Writer </div> </div>
<p>The history of American slavery is so weighty and dense that sometimes people like me — the descendants of enslaved Africans — try to avoid the topic.</p>
<p>So much has already been said and felt. What can one more book or Hollywood drama add? Why take another walk through a traumatic history?</p>
<p>Admittedly, I carried that heaviness into Hemings Hercules, a dinner series inspired by the work of James Hemings and Hercules Posey, who were enslaved by Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, respectively.</p>
<p>“My mom being a single parent, he ended up picking me up from school a lot of times. I would hang out with him. That’s how I figured out what I wanted to do,” Draluck explains.</p>
<p>They were working on Fuss Feathers, a dinner series at Hatchet Hall that explored early American foodways, when Draluck came across the stories of the enslaved chefs and decided to develop a dinner of his own in their honor.</p>
<p>“Their stories aren’t well known,” Draluck says of Hemings and Hercules. “I thought it was a cool way to approach history that isn’t often told.”</p>
<p>The chef left Hatchet Hall in March for his new position at Post Beam in April, taking his signature dinner with him. According to Draluck, it was a natural next step.</p>
<p>Draluck’s work with Hemings Hercules got another push in May when it was highlighted in an episode of Netflix’s “High on the Hog,” a series about the ways Black American cuisine transformed America.</p>
<p>I found at Post Beam a dining experience as fine as nearly any other I’ve had. Hosts greeted guests with glasses of Champagne, then escorted us to the softly lighted patio where dinner would be served at one long table.</p>
<p>Each dish was skillfully designed and executed, Draluck’s ambition and imagination on display.</p>
<p>There was some tension among the guests, me included, during the early courses.</p>
<p>The guests ate the first five courses quietly. We were trying, it seemed, to take it all in<b>.</b></p>
<p>The dishes seemed more familiar, a degree or two closer to the soul food fare associated with Black American cuisine. It’s a line Draluck walks carefully.</p>
<p>As a final touch, Draluck invites diners to watch him work. He’s not cooking inside, however, but outside behind Post Beam, over wood fire and using cast-iron cookware — just as Hemings and Hercules did in their day.</p>
