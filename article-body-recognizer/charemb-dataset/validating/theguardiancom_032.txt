<a>criminal anthropology</a> and exotic wax
<a>fruits</a>. They immerse me in the ambience of 19th-century Turin – a dark, macabre city of fanatical collectors, and a perfect contrast with the outside world, where everyone is glued to their smartphones.

<p>Food charities and restaurants are warning of a mountain of wasted festive meals, as hospitality businesses struggle with last-minute cancelled bookings amid soaring Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>Thousands of restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels had placed large orders for turkeys, Christmas puddings and other festive food in what should have been one of the busiest weeks of the year.</p>
<a>advised against socialising</a>, leading to urgent calls for government support for the struggling industry.
<a>FareShare</a>, the UK’s largest food redistribution charity, said offers of food – including turkey, seasonal produce, chocolate and coffee – had increased by 5% over the past seven days, but that it would struggle to take all it had been offered.
<p>Lindsay Boswell, FareShare’s chief executive, said: “In just the past week, FareShare has seen an increase in the number of offers of food to us from businesses in the hospitality sector, as a result of the cancellations of table bookings.”</p>
<p>The organisation takes good-quality surplus food directly from suppliers and supermarkets and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups across the UK, typically providing meals to vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Boswell said: “In Scotland, a government plan is under way to support the wholesale industry to ensure surplus stock, where possible, is redistributed by FareShare to those that can make good use of it.”</p>
<p>“It is frightening,” said the former MasterChef winner. “I am now sitting here thinking do I get it [next week’s food order], what do I do? There is no way of knowing what is going to happen.”</p>
<p>Wood said he had not yet been left with any surplus food “as I have been very careful with what I have ordered”. Yet he was fearful that the coming week would bring more cancellations. </p>
<p>Rishi Sunak, who <a>jetted back to the UK</a> from California on Friday, is under intense pressure to prop up struggling businesses for which trade has evaporated.</p>
<p>The company said it was monitoring the situation closely and would work with FareShare and other food charities if necessary.</p>

<p>Once you realise that, you realise you don’t have to do anything to make it go away. Fear likes to present itself as urgent and agenda-setting; it barges in and takes for granted that you’ll cancel your plans to spend time with it.</p>
<p>It can help, too, to notice when you feel the least dread about your relationship and then put yourself in those situations more. Absorbed in work? Doing something with your hands? Laughing? Chase the things that make you forget to be anxious.</p>
<p>But a word of caution: while you work to calm your worry, do be careful with your partner. To the person on the receiving end, dread and wrath can feel very much alike: they both make a roulette of what reaction you’ll get today.</p>
<p>Hypervigilance promises you safety at the same time as it erodes it: it overlays disaster onto your sunny afternoons, holds up the gifts you’ve been given and tells you they’re illusions. What a curse.</p>
<p>It’s natural to worry about losing the things you want to keep – but the worry doesn’t get to control you. To face it down, you must control yourself.</p>
<p>Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with? Eleanor Gordon-Smith will help you think through life’s questions and puzzles, big and small. Questions can be anonymous.</p>

<span><h3>Fred on Laurine</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?A genuine human connection, be it romantic or platonic.</p>
<p>First impressions?She looked like she’d come straight from the set of The French Dispatch.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Childhood memories; the best film adaptation of Emma (Clueless); her belief that she’s the reincarnation of Charlotte Brontë; how she once laid a rose on Keats’s grave and shed a tear (sorry, Laurine, it was just too good).</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?We kept having to repeat ourselves as there was a flock of 30 bankers across the room, whose cacophony vastly exceeded the socially acceptable decibel level. We asked to be reseated.</p>
<p>Good table manners?She tackled her curry, rice and naan with grace.</p>
<p>Best thing about Laurine?Her unwavering optimism.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Yes, especially the thespians and my friend who agrees that Clueless was indeed the best adaptation of Emma.</p>
<p>Describe Laurine in three wordsKind, introspective and hilarious.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Hopefully an adequate drinking and conversation companion.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?To the end of the street, whence she headed east and I west.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?It didn’t seem like the evening was heading in that direction.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?That the banker bros be recalled to the office, leaving behind their bottles of Prosecco in our care.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Who wouldn’t? She’s a delight.</p>
<span><h3>Laurine on Fred</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?That the other person wouldn’t be rude, boring or a Covid-denier.</p>
<p>First impressions?He started talking at me the second I sat down. Happily, he began asking me questions soon afterwards. </p>
<p>What did you talk about?Arts, our hobbies, views on literature, life and dating. We both have many opinions about the most casual things.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?There were two or three lulls, but we had to catch our breath; we talked lots.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Yeah, I think they could get along.</p>
<p>Describe Fred in three wordsFunny, interesting and open-minded.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?He may think I’m not right in the head. I should’ve stopped before I said I was Charlotte Brontë in a previous life. In fact, I should’ve stopped after two drinks. </p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No, we went our separate ways.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?Nah, don’t think either of us wanted to.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?The group at the table next to us.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?I don’t think there was a romantic spark, but I would definitely meet again, and perhaps become friends.</p>
<p>Fred and Laurine ate at Bangalore Express, London EC3. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com </p>
<p>Age: It is a relatively new thing, since the pandemic.</p>
<p>That’s fall as in …? The season. You might call it abstinent autumn if you were desperately trying to maintain alliteration in a British translation.</p>
<p>And flaccid as in …? Yeah, flaccid.</p>
<p>So we are talking about sex? Well, less sex. The phrase was a line in a New York Post article: we’ve gone from “slutty summer” to “flaccid fall”.</p>
<p>Meaning? So, in a survey …</p>
<p>Here we go, another dodgy survey of about 11 people. Actually, it’s a survey of 5,000 single Americans, by Match, the dating service.</p>
<p>I thought everyone went straight from locking down to hooking up? That was slutty summer – keep up. No pun intended.</p>
<p>What else emerged in the survey? Physical attraction is no longer the be-all and end-all, and emotional maturity is much more important.</p>
<p>Justin Garcia? The executive director of the Kinsey Institute and Match’s other chief scientific adviser. </p>
<p>Do say: “Yeah, no hurry. We’ve only known each other a few months, after all.”</p>
<p>Don’t say: “What if I keep the mask on – would that help?”</p>
<p>Butterflies in your stomach? Heart racing? “It’s normal to feel that way,” says Chloe Goddard McLoughlin, a psychotherapist and relationship counsellor. “Just tell the other person that you’re nervous, because I guarantee they will be as well.”</p>
<a>Billie Eilish</a> – let your date know. How can someone get to know you if you’re holding back or pretending to be someone else?” But there are no-nos: “If someone brought up sex on a first date, I’d be put off.”
<h2>Don’t sweat your first kiss</h2>
<h2>Think about when to make things official</h2>
<h2>Work out if you’re ready to have sex</h2>
<h2>Learn how to boost your confidence</h2>
<a>80%</a> of girls feel under pressure to send sexual images. Douglas says: “Once you send a picture, you can’t control where it goes, who sees it, or whether it’s shared. If it’s shared on the internet, it can stay there for ever.”
<h2>Understand how to handle rejection</h2>
<h2>Avoid being spooked by ghosting</h2>
<h2>Don’t use porn to educate yourself</h2>
<h2>… and don’t let Covid get you down</h2>
<h2>And remember, dating should be fun …</h2>

<p>What were you hoping for?Someone I could enjoy a meal and good conversation with, and maybe a second date.</p>
<p>First impressions?He was on time and waiting at the table. He had a big, beaming face with a nice smile and a chatty mouth.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Living in London, because he is from America. Family, travelling, work and gay dating. Free Britney.</p>

<p>Describe Ivan in three wordsConfident, chatty and resolute.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?I honestly have no idea.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?He made it clear up front that the first date isn’t for kissing.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?My outfit. I stayed at work late, so ran out to buy a shirt for the date, but it was too big, so I had to wear my work shirt.</p>

<p>"Then, having neared it, I worked inside out from there to create what turned out to be a collection of atmospheres: moods that harbour the light and the spirit of various ages in Time."</p>
<p>"Sadly," Dennis wrote, "I have recently come to accept what I refused to accept for so long: that the house is only ephemeral. That no one can put a preservation order on atmosphere." Certainly not now Dennis Severs has gone to join the Jervises.</p>
<p>• Dennis Severs, museum creator, born November 16 1948; died December 27 1999</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the best views are to be had from high places, although as musical hall star Gus Elen observed:</p>
<p>Wiv a ladder and some glassesYou could see the ’Ackney MarshesIf it wasn’t for the ’ouses in between</p>
<p>So, it’s all the better when you have an isolated peak, one left off the end of the range, or simply popping up, providing a fabulous 360-degree view, the sense of the entire Earth at your feet. </p>
<p>I’d even suggest that, with a couple of judicious additions, you could link all these in one magnificent UK-bisecting yomp, zig-zagging your way up the country, hopping from one visible peak to the next.</p>
<p>And autumn would be the season for it: the best time for pulling on your boots, when the trees are changing colour, when curls of mist haunt the hollows and when distant peaks might have a dusting of snow.</p>

<a>Beeching cuts of the 1960s</a>, the last regular train ran back in 1972. A Sunday service operated in the summer months from the late 1990s but the line was largely for transporting – ironically enough – railway ballast from Meldon Quarry.
<a>Dartmoor national park</a> visitor centre next year.
<a>Okehampton</a> is pitching itself as the “gateway to the moor” and is likely to be a popular base for those setting off on walks. Just west of the town is
<a>Meldon Viaduct</a>, a popular place to start ascents of
<a>High Willhays and Yes Tor</a>, the highest points on Dartmoor.
<a>178 bus</a> runs once daily (except Sundays) between Okehampton and Chagford. There are lovely woods and riverside footpaths around the town.
<h2>The best options for walks and rides from the new line</h2>
<p>Granite WayThe mainly traffic-free 11-mile <a>Granite Way cycle route</a> runs between the station and Lydford. You can rent bikes and e-bikes at <a>Granite Way Cycles on Klondyke Road</a>.</p>
<a>Meldon Viaduct</a> up to the two highest points on Dartmoor –
<p>Okehampton to Buckfastleigh</p>
<a>Buckfastleigh</a> is served by the touristy
<a>South Devon Railway</a>, which links up with Totnes for mainline trains.
<p>Cross DartmoorThe 37-mile <a>West Devon Way</a> between Okehampton and Plymouth is a good option for those who come by bus or train: each of the eight stages starts and stops at a bus stop.</p>
<a>Two Moors Way</a> involves a 10-mile “walk in” or a taxi. The 102-mile coast-to-coast footpath, from Lynton in north Devon to Wembury near Plymouth, spans Exmoor and Dartmoor; ultra runners can complete the journey in a single day. Sustrans’ 99-mile
<a>Coast to Coast route</a>, between Ilfracombe and Plymouth, is the equivalent for cyclists.
<a>Dartmoor Way</a>, which passes through Okehampton, loops round the park on lanes and minor roads, ideal for cycling and e-bikes. It can be used for day trips or for a full five-to-seven day holiday. A parallel 108-mile route is used by walkers.
<p>Note on navigatingLarge areas of Dartmoor are featureless, mists are common and sudden, and there are morasses all over. The double-sided Ordnance Survey OL28 map covers almost the entirety of the national park at 1: 25,000 scale, ideal for walkers</p>
<p>BMC XT40, a single 1:40,000 scale map showing the whole of Dartmoor, is suitable for general planning or easy, short walks on well-used paths.</p>

<p>One of Scotland’s most recognised and reproduced paintings, <a>Sir Edwin Landseer’s The Monarch of the Glen</a>, is to appear at auction with a real possibility of it being sold abroad.</p>
<p>For the past 17 years the artwork has been on long-term loan to the <a>National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh</a>. It will go on sale at Christie’s in London on 8 December and is expected to fetch about £10m.</p>
<p>“The priority for Diageo is to ensure all our assets are focused on growing our business and delivering value for our employees, shareholders and the communities where we operate.”</p>
<a>Scotland</a> said The Monarch of the Glen was “an important Victorian picture that has taken on various layers of meaning, which include its use in advertising and as a romantic emblem of the Highlands of Scotland.
<p>“National Galleries of Scotland always carefully considers any paintings with a strong Scottish dimension that come on to the market, but for obvious reasons we never comment on our potential interest ahead of a sale.”</p>
<p>He said Landseer was conveying universal qualities of nobility, command of environment and athleticism. There will be some who find it a tricky painting to enjoy, perhaps seeing it is a biscuit tin cliche, but Brown disagreed. </p>
<p>“There is an incredible sense of command and destiny there and it is those qualities that lift it out of the ordinary and make it so beloved.”</p>
<p>Does Landseer’s celebration of sport in the Highlands ignore the displacement of working families in the 19th century to make way for vast sporting estates?</p>
<p>The Monarch of the Glen belongs to a group of grandiose deer paintings Landseer created in the 1840s. Others include <a>The Sanctuary, in the Royal Collection, </a>and The Challenge, owned by the Duke of Northumberland.</p>
<a>depicting the 93rd Highlanders halting a Russian cavalry charge during the Crimean war</a>.
<p>He was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1962 and an OBE in 1979 for services to mountaineering and mountain rescue. He also received honorary doctorates from several Scottish universities.</p>
<p>His 10-year marriage to Catherine (nee MacLeod), a GP who was also a climber, ended in divorce in 1970.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, depending on the repairs needed, specific skills can be required. They can vary from basic building experience or even just a head for heights.</p>

<p>The woods in question are glorious: tumbling in layers across the steep hills above Tintern Abbey. The roots of beech trees clamber over moss-covered dry stone walls and ferns line rain-washed gullies.</p>
<p>In Japan there are 62 designated forest-bathing woodlands, and doctors prescribe sessions to patients suffering from high blood pressure, anxiety and depression. Forest bathing is also thought to boost the immune system.</p>
<p>For those sceptical of the power of rock gods, scientists have proven that spending time beneath the trees does have <a>measurable benefits</a>.</p>
<p>We start our session with a short meditation before being asked to remove our walking boots and stroll barefoot up a rocky path. Tender-footed city dwellers inch forward gingerly, tiptoeing through the prickly beech mast on the forest floor.</p>
<p>“It certainly puts you in the present,” one of the group says. “I’m not thinking about anything else at the moment other than where I should place my feet.”</p>
<p>“Walking barefoot is thought to be one of the best antioxidants there is,” Tom says.</p>
<p>I can believe it, and decline to put my shoes back on when we are given the option.</p>
<p>For those wanting something more in-depth, Hill Farm runs weekend retreats, which include yoga, gong showers, an open-air spa and longer meditation sessions, where guests can connect with the trees more deeply.</p>
<p>It seems beneath the loamy and dappled beneficence of the trees, life-changing things can occur.</p>

<p>‘Would you go round the world with me?” I asked a friend on the phone.</p>
<p>“Wow! But the pandemic …” she said.</p>
<p>I interrupted her, “Ljubljana is near the 46th parallel north and if we follow it west there are 16 countries along it. Italy first, then Switzerland …”</p>
<p>Now, she interrupted me: “The borders are closed. Flights cancelled. We have a curfew. In fact, we’re not even allowed to leave the province.”</p>
<a>I optimised</a> it to avoid zigzagging,
<a>and we were left with 20</a>.
<p>“Are you in?” She laughed, which usually means yes.</p>
<p>“It’s funny, I always wake up with a bout of travel anxiety, strong reisefieber, at three in the morning before travelling, and it also happened to me last night, even though our trip was just a walk,” I said.</p>
<p>My friend laughed, “What about travelling around the world along the meridian next week?”</p>

<a>Rheinfels castle</a>, built in 1245 by Count Diether V von Katzenelnbogen – was once the mightiest fortress of the Middle Rhine, but has been reborn as the
<a>Romantik Hotel Schloss Rheinfels</a>.
<a>Weingut Matthias Müller</a> in Spay.
<a>Jakobsberg</a>, located high above the river at Boppard and featuring its own golf course, can cost a lot more. If you really want to push the boat out, try the
<a> Richtershof</a> at Mülheim, near Bernkastel-Kues on the Mosel – a "Weinromantikhotel" with a true sense of style, as demonstrated by the presence of a classic (but sadly non-running) Adler motorcycle in the lobby.
<p>Long before tourism came to the Palatinate, viticulture formed the basis of its economy – a tradition begun by the Roman garrisons that guarded the volatile river borders between Gaul and unconquered, barbarian Germania.</p>
<a>Cochem</a> is one option; their well-preserved medieval centres, full of cobbled alleys and small squares, cafes and monuments, cake shops and churches, never disappoint. Picturesque
<a>Rheinsteig</a>, a 320km trail following the right side of the Rhine from Wiesbaden to Bonn. The trail can be picked up at Osterspai, for example, and followed to what is possibly the Rhine's most famous landmark,
<a>Marksburg castle</a>, about 10km away.
<a>Lahnradweg</a> – follows the river Lahn 40km east from its confluence with the Rhine towards the spa town of Bad Ems and on to Nassau. Bike hire from
<a>Lothar Gebhardt, Burg Bike</a>, in Lahnstein.
<a>Burg Eltz</a> – and endless, unspoilt forests of native oak and beech, the dream paths are aptly named. Even if little else about the Rhine Palatinate appeals, these walks on the wild side will get you out of your head.

<p>Its name evokes images of glamour and mystery and has provided authors including Agatha Christie and Ian Fleming with perfect backgrounds for their tales of intrigue and suspense.</p>
<p>But now the Orient Express is to be cut from Europe's rail timetables. Next weekend, the service – which runs only between Strasbourg and Vienna – will be scrapped, a victim of high-speed railways and cut-price flights.</p>
<p>"The name the Orient Express will disappear from the official timetables before the year is out, after more than 125 years," says Mark Smith, the rail expert who runs <a>The Man in Seat Sixty-One</a> website .</p>
<p>Only travellers who can afford lavish private trains – such as the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and the Danube Express's Istanbul Odyssey – will be able to enjoy the service's former glory.</p>
<p>Over the years, the service improved and ferry journeys were cut out. The Orient Express earned a reputation for ostentatious luxury and spawned several rivals – including the Simplon Orient Express, which ran though Venice.</p>
<p>And in their tracks came the stories and novels. In 1929, the Orient Express was stuck in snow for days at Çerkezköy, near Istanbul – an incident that inspired Agatha Christie's 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express.</p>
<p>And in Ian Fleming's From Russia with Love, James Bond travels on the Orient Express with Tatiana Romanova, a beautiful Russian clerk, while being pursued by the Russian killer Donovan "Red" Grant.</p>

<p> A jovial chorus of voices was fast approaching, punctuated by the excited yelps from an accompanying dog. “Beautiful morning for it, how far you walking?” came the call from the man at the front. Yet my party of 16 did not answer.</p>
<p>The two people nearest to him moved awkwardly aside, as he became increasingly inquisitive. Then our leader – Abigail Rowe – approached him, clasping a sign that read: “We are on a silent pilgrimage. We mean no disrespect”.</p>
<a>British Pilgrimage Trust</a> (which was set up in 2014 with the aim of bringing back spiritual journeys to Britain almost 500 years after Henry VIII banned them during the
<p>For me, as a mother of a 14-month-old, the silence was a treat, but I was quickly discovering that the hardest part was not being able to chat to passing walkers – which is something of a sacrilegious offence between hikers.</p>
<p>Abigail read the poem <a>Leisure</a>, by WH Davies, after which the Stoughton rector, Lindsay Yates, offered us a pilgrim blessing. Then, without a word, we were off.</p>
<p>Here a few people gave the improvised sign to indicate a toilet stop (a necessary bit of sign language quickly learned to ensure no one got left behind), before we walked on to West Stoke Church, where we ate lunch in the glow of candlelight.</p>
<p>No great revelations came, but I did feel I finally had earned the time to linger with my thoughts – and my friend – for a while, and for that last half-hour I felt oddly at peace with the world.</p>
<p>Moments later we entered the cathedral where the choir were singing a Christmas carol, which we were invited to join in with. Suddenly, 16 new voices began to emerge from our small crowd in unison.</p>

<h2>I walked the county boundary of Gloucestershire: Claire Jenkins</h2>
<p>I used to live in London, but went home to Gloucestershire at the start of the pandemic. I’m an active person, easily bored, and I thought: “What am I going to do?” I decided to get to know my county by walking its boundary.</p>
<p>I have a geography degree but I don’t know how to plan a route, so I turned to the <a>YesTribe</a>, a community that comes up with ideas and solutions. Someone plotted the 300-mile route for me, and I thought: “Oh no – I’ve got to do it now!”</p>
<p>I saw parts of Gloucestershire I’d never seen before – I absolutely loved walking by the Severn, and exploring the north-east of the county. I walked alone, but I had conversations with other walkers, cyclists and paddleboarders.</p>
<a>trig points</a> in Gloucestershire. I did a lot of that with my dad and my aunt – I wanted an activity we could share. It was fun to see my 70-year-old aunt climbing over fences and barbed wire! We’d have tea and cake and look at the stunning views.
<h2>I circumnavigated England on my free bus pass: Penny Ibbott</h2>
<p>It was New Year’s Eve 2019. I was slightly sozzled when my daughter asked if anyone had anything exciting planned for 2020. I said: “I wonder how far I can get on my free bus pass?”</p>
<p>Just over two months later, I set off from my home in Chidham, West Sussex. I had planned to travel around the whole of England by bus, but was I got about 10 days in, when the first lockdown was announced. I was gutted.</p>
<a>Devon</a>, on an open-top bus. You go up and up Porlock Hill, coming out on Exmoor. It was a beautiful afternoon: the sea was sparkling on my right and sheep and ponies were grazing on my left. Other highlights were riding the Coasthopper along the
<a>Norfolk</a> coast, exploring the north-east coast right up to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and travelling along the Scottish border.
<p>The best moment came right at the end. A Stagecoach manager boarded the bus I was on and asked me to get off. He had arranged a vintage open-top bus to take me the last few miles, and all my family and friends were on it.</p>
<p>Age is no barrier if you’re feeling well. If you’re capable of taking a journey, do it! It keeps the sparkle in your life. It’s about the people you meet as much as the places you go, and I met some extraordinary characters.</p>
<h2>I went wild camping with a baby: Bex Band</h2>

<a>long-distance hiking trails published in National Geographic</a>. It changed my life! When I came home I didn’t go back to teaching but set up

<a>north cliffs of Skomer Island</a>. It was magical – loads of puffins, guillemots and razorbills, plus a friendly seal.
<h2>I rode my horses hundreds of miles over the Scottish Highlands: Claire Alldritt</h2>
<p>I’ve always loved hillwalking in the Scottish Highlands. I was into horses as a child, but I didn’t have my own until I was 35. When I did, I decided to combine the hills with the horses.</p>
<p>In August, I did a 300km route through the Cairngorms. These were the most challenging trails I’ve ever done. I rode through deep, rocky rivers, over stony obstacles and through bogs that were up to the horses’ bellies.</p>

<a>Berney Marshes</a> sees as many as 15,000 of them gathering between October and March each year, migrating from their summer breeding grounds in Iceland and Greenland.
<a>Berney Arms wind pump</a> is the tallest in the Broads. Around it, miles of water and grass stretch out to a distant horizon, home to wild geese, galloping hares and muntjac deer. On Sundays, with buses from Winterton into Yarmouth and
<a>trains onward</a> from there, you can
<a>follow an isolated loop</a> through the windmill-studded landscape. You’ll need to keep an eye on train times and bring weatherproof kit and refreshments.
<a>Hermanus holiday park</a>. Three silver, 70s Airstream caravans nearby belong to
<a>Duarte’s cafe</a>, where everyone else is drinking espresso and speaking Portuguese. The seafront is two minutes away, but it’s still drizzling, so I head for
<a>Time and Tide museum</a>. Alongside a temporary exhibition of
<a>Roman fort at Caister-on-Sea</a>, whose ruins I saw from the bus window on the way here, and an 1819 painting by George Vincent of the local seafront, complete with Dutch traders, bathing machines and Yarmouth’s towering monument to Norfolk-born Nelson.
<a>Yarmouth</a> cafe. The greyish-brown North Sea lies ahead, beyond young, grassy dunes. The
<a>Britannia pier</a>. After lunch, I hike past the airy
<a>Minster</a> and five miles out of town to third-century
<a>the Angles Way</a>, a long-distance route that leads from Yarmouth, along the winding River Waveney and through the Broads, to wild
<a>Queens Head</a> pub. Bus 5 goes back to Yarmouth every hour until teatime from the stop outside. As I wait, the pink-footed geese fly overhead again, calling to each other as they circle the ruins and head out across the twilit marsh.
