<li>France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data.</li>
<li>One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far.</li>
<li>South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday.</li>
<li>Additionally, people in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public.</li>
<li>France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories, with the new measure coming into effect on 28 December.</li>
<li>The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone.</li>

<p>Some further data from France. Some 16,173 people are currently hospitalised for Covid-19 in the country, with 3,254 of them in emergency care.</p>
<p>Some 122,462 people have died of Covid-19 in France since the start of the pandemic, AFP reports/</p>
<p>Some 76.5 percent of the population have received two vaccine doses, and nearly 21 million people in a country of 67.4 million residents have received a booster shot.</p>
<p>On Friday, health authority recommended that adults receive a booster jab three months after their initial vaccination.</p>
<p> New coronavirus restrictions could be in place until late March under measures examined by UK government scientific advisers.</p>
<p>The U.S. will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports.</p>
<p>Countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa after the variant was detected in South Africa, which reported Omicron to the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 24.</p>
<p>WHO and the United Nations spoke out against the travel bans and officials in South Africa said they were being punished for identifying the strain and being transparent.</p>
<p>He said the travel ban would be lifted on December 31.</p>
<p>In Bethlehem, hoteliers have been disappointed. After a near-total lockdown last year, Israel has again closed its borders.</p>

<p>“It is a bit surreal,” American student Hudson Harder told AFP.</p>
<p>The prospect of a fourth Covid booster jab in the UK is possible as immunity may subside for millions by the new year, the Telegraph newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Protection against getting ill with the Omicron variant is as low as 35 per cent 10 weeks after a booster, according to government data.</p>

<p>The Wayside Chapel is among many Australian organisations that will open its doors to those with nowhere else to go on Christmas Day, offering a sense of something that has been particularly hard to grasp over the past two years: togetherness.</p>
<p>The UK government will send millions of text messages on Boxing Day urging people to get a coronavirus booster vaccine.</p>
<p>The message, part of the Get Boosted Now campaign, is the latest attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant sweeping the UK.</p>
<p>More than 32 million booster and third doses have already been administered, PA reports.</p>
<p>The message will read: “Get boosted now.</p>

<h2>France sees record new daily Covid-19 cases</h2>
<p>France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data.</p>
<p>The seven-day moving average of new cases, which evens out weekly data reporting irregularities, also reached a new record of 66,417, a total that has tripled in just one month, Reuters reports.</p>

<p>For Sarah Clifton-Bligh, the most useful thing to have when you’re travelling is an older brother who plays rugby.</p>
<p>“The worst place I’ve been was the New York subway,” Clifton-Bligh says. “There are not a lot of lifts in that subway system. There were these metal stairs and there was a platform and then there were another two flights of stairs. It was so bad.”</p>
<p>The commission’s research also found Australian tourism providers could being doing much more. Surveys showed 23% of non-travelling disabled people found travel “so stressful it’s not worth it” and 22% found it “just too hard”. </p>
<p>“There is a lack of useful and accurate information in the public domain that allows disabled people to plan travel,” says Dale Reardon, the founder of the accessible travel consultancy Travel For All.</p>
<p>Customer service for someone who is autistic, for example, might require staff having the right training, a flexible attitude and being empowered to bend the rules or make decisions on the spot.</p>
<p>On the ground, wheelchair accessible taxis can be scarce the further away from the cities you go – and many taxi and Uber drivers refuse people with assistance animals, even though it is illegal to do so.</p>
<p>There are restrictions on the disability pension for recipients travelling internationally, with payments cutting off after 28 days out of the country, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>One of the most persistent issues Clifton-Bligh and her family encounter is the lack of a shower chair.</p>
<p>“You would think that would be something that wouldn’t be such a big deal, but it is,” Jordan says. “Which is why we just cracked and bought one. It can be taken apart and we take it with us.”</p>
<p>Clifton-Bligh has heard other horror stories from the disability community, too. “Sometimes the chairs get damaged on planes,” she says.</p>
<p>Jordan adds: “We know people who’ve been bumped off planes, who’ve had to crawl down the aisle to the bathrooms.”</p>
<p>The key to getting everything to work out, Jordan says, is starting a dialogue early.</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of trying to do it significantly in advance, making sure you communicate with the accommodation provider and that they know what we want, and then if it’s not quite there, making it work.”</p>
<p>And don’t leave accessibility considerations to the last minute: “Some things that might have been very easy to do in the beginning are very difficult later on.”</p>
<p>Ovens argues that investing in accessibility is good business sense.</p>
<p>“For every person with a disability who doesn’t travel because of the logistical challenges, you have a family, you have carers, you have friends who did not travel either,” she says.</p>
<p>US airlines called off more than 1,000 flights on Sunday as crews were grounded amid surging Covid-19 infections, causing misery for thousands of Christmas travelers.</p>
<p>Commercial airlines had canceled 1,001 flights within, into or out of the US by mid-afternoon, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.</p>
<p>It was a third straight day of traveling pain and more cancellations were likely as Covid infections soar, driven by the highly transmissible <a>Omicron variant</a>.</p>
<p>A total of 997 flights were scrapped on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve. Thousands more were delayed.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Detroit airport, Rodriguez said she was surrounded by angry passengers, flustered airline representatives and families with young children.</p>
<p>“I’ve run into a lot of people sharing their horror stories here. We’re all just stuck in Michigan, Detroit, heading different places,” Rodriguez told Reuters. She was rebooked on a flight to Kentucky that she hoped would end her days-long journey.</p>
<p>Poor weather in some areas also contributed to air travel problems. Los Angeles international airport said a “storm-related electrical issue” forced a partial closure of Terminal 5, causing passengers to divert to other terminals.</p>
<p>“Cancellations and delays are possible, so it will be important to check your flight status today if flying through Terminal 5,” LAX tweeted.</p>
<p>United Airlines had to cancel abougt 100 flights on Sunday, a spokesperson said, adding that the company was working to rebook the affected passengers.</p>
<p>“Importantly, 25% of customers whose travel was interrupted were able to rebook on flights that allowed them to get to their final destination earlier than they otherwise would have,” United spokeswoman Maddie King said in an email.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines said all their cancellations were weather related.</p>
<p>The US airports most heavily affected by the cancellations were in Seattle, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and JFK International in New York.</p>
<p>A White House official, who asked not to be named, said despite the mess at some airports, “we’re in a better place than last Christmas” and noted that “only a small percentage of flights are affected”.</p>
<p>Omicron was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of US cases and as many as 90% in some areas. The average number of new US cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week.</p>
<p>While research suggests Omicron produces milder illness and a lower rate of hospitalizations than previous iterations, officials have maintained a cautious outlook.</p>
<p>In other economic developments, a second Christmas in the shadow of Covid saw holiday sales rise at the fastest pace in 17 years, even as shoppers grappled with higher prices, product shortages and Omicron, according to one spending measure.</p>
<p>Mastercard Spending Pulse, which tracks payments including cash and debit cards, reported that sales were up 8.5% from a year earlier. It had expected a 7.4% increase.</p>
<p>The results, which covered 1 November through 24 December, were driven by purchases of clothing and jewelry. Holiday sales were up 10.7% compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 holiday period.</p>
<p>At last it is morning and time to move. Clearing camp, we discover hair ice pluming from a fallen branch like candy floss, shiny white and soft to touch. An owl makes a wild, demonic shriek from deep in the trees, and we depart the forbidden isle.</p>

<p>Frankly, you're lucky she remembered the cake.</p>
<p>Certainly, seeing her wearing a dress for her mother's wedding in Season two is as incongruous as if she were dressed as a giant rabbit.</p>
<p>Sitting in a small Copenhagen cafe, next to her apartment, the actress Sofie Gråbøl is trying to make sense of the cult status she has achieved in Britain thanks to BBC4's Danish thriller, The Killing. "It's amazing," she says. "I can't believe it."</p>
<p>Lund is a tenacious and enigmatic homicide detective investigating the sadistic rape and murder of a schoolgirl. As each line of inquiry has doubled back on itself, the audience has been drawn into an intricate web of political and social intrigue.</p>
<p>At one time, Gråbøl could not visit a supermarket in Copenhagen without being drawn into elaborate discussions about Lund's love life and the identity of the killer.</p>
<p>Lund is particularly downbeat in her style. She wears her hair tied back, dispenses with makeup and is almost always in jeans and flat shoes – and a woolly jumper.</p>
<p>She says it was her choice to take Lund in an unsociable direction. She had worked with Sveistrup in a previous Danish TV series and he came to her early with the idea for The Killing. Originally it was going to take place in a small village.</p>
<p>"He said: 'We have a woman detective, a murder and the whole town should be involved. What do you think?' "I said I wanted to play an isolated person, unable to communicate and I'd like her to be at peace with that, so she's not even reaching out."</p>
<p>Such was her frustration that she couldn't sleep – she knew what she wanted but didn't know how to get it. Finally she realised that the only people she knew like Lund were men.</p>
<p>So she began acting like a man for a few days. Her character snapped into place. After that she forgot about being a man and allowed Lund to take shape. But she's had to defend her creation from possible deviations.</p>
<p>Can it be assumed that Lund does not make it to Sweden in the coming series? "We don't want her to go to Sweden, do we?" she taunts. "What's she going to do there?"</p>
<p>The second series is apparently more complex and far-ranging than the first, taking in the war in Afghanistan and big-time politics. And it features none of the characters from the first, except for Lund and her boss.</p>
<p>There's a pause, a teasing giggle, then silence. If nothing else, Lund would appreciate the suspense.</p>
<p>Not like crisps, then? An emphatic no. “I love crisps.” Do they fuel her on set? Yes, she says, but “when you keep on shooting for nine months, you can’t have crisps every day. Because then you can’t fit in the leather trousers!”</p>

<h2>Ernest Hemingway: the old man and the fridge magnet</h2>
<h2>Lil Nas X: so it’s true – the devil has the best shoes</h2>
<p>All thrillers depend on tension, but the final part of a successful TV crime drama brings an extra element of suspense: whether the conclusion will satisfy the large audience that has tuned in every week.</p>
<p>Although slightly weakened (as was the finale of Line of Duty) by the apparent pressure to leave open the possibility of a second series, the conclusion of Happy Valley was happy for the main characters and for the audience.</p>
<p>That was a laudable ambition, but it told only half the story. For the public that made up Peel's police service was entirely male. The female half of society was excluded.</p>
<p>The right for women to have a meaningful career in policing has been hard-won, together with an equality of opportunity which at times, remains a matter of continuous struggle.</p>
<p>But does maintaining that balance affect the way I do my job? Am I a better police officer for being a woman? Others may have a view on that, but for me, the honest answer to both questions is yes.</p>
<p>There can be a perspective which is uniquely female and which is capable of making a nuanced contribution to a rounded and inclusive whole policing service, which is not at odds with equality.</p>
<p>I am an active member of the Women's Police Association (WPA). The fact that the WPA exists and nurtures the gender agenda is a reflection of the importance of affirming and sustaining the strides made by female colleagues.</p>

<p>Ivins died of cancer in 2007, at the age of 62. Now, she is the subject of a documentary, Raise Hell: The Life Times of Molly Ivins, which is making its way around the festival circuit after showing at Sundance and SXSW.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing. I sometimes think she’s more relevant now than when she was delivering her message. Right now, across the world, democracy is in crisis.”</p>
<p>Engel chose her shots of protests against Trump, she says, to show “the passing of the torch”.</p>
<p>“People may say, ‘Who’s the next Molly Ivins?’ There. That’s the next Molly Ivins.</p>
<h2>‘Who’s getting screwed and who’s doing the screwing’</h2>
<p>For fundraising, Engel says, she came up with a tagline: “How many documentaries make you laugh?”</p>
<p>“And it’s true! There’s a lot of depressing shit out there but you’ve got to laugh. Molly said it, ‘You’ve got to have fun while you’re fighting for freedom. It might be the only fun you ever have.’”</p>
<p>“Again, Molly said it: ‘It’s not a left-against-right issue, it’s a top-versus-bottom issue.’ It always has been. It’s about the haves and have-nots.”</p>

<p>That American women are facing a hostile supreme court and are looking at a future without abortion rights – and potentially without the constitutional right to contraception – isn’t a matter of law or “life”. It’s a sign of a democracy in decline.</p>

<a>Roe v Wade</a> that led to abortion becoming legal in the United States, made a stunning admission just before her death in 2017, it has emerged.
<p>In a documentary that is premiering on Friday and is already making waves, McCorvey admits that her infamous reversal on abortion rights “was all an act”.</p>
<p>“I took their money and they’d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. That’s what I’d say,” she said. “I did it well too, I am a good actress.”</p>
<p>The documentary reveals McCorvey received at least $450,000 in “benevolent gifts” from the anti-abortion movement.</p>
<p>Included in the documentary also are scenes from the presidential election night in 2016, depicting McCorvey’s disappointment as Democrat Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“I wish I knew how many abortions Donald Trump was responsible for,” she quipped in the scene. “I’m sure he’s lost count, if he can count that high.”</p>
<p>“I wondered, ‘Is she playing us?’” he said. “What I didn’t have the guts to say was, ‘because I know damn well we’re playing her’.”</p>
<p>McCorvey’s opinion toward abortion evolved throughout much of her life, but what stayed consistent was the feeling she was used as a pawn by both sides in the debate.</p>
<p>As far as her thoughts on abortion at the time of her death, McCorvey made sure to set the record straight: “If a young woman wants to have an abortion, that’s no skin off my ass. That’s why they call it choice,” she said.</p>
<a>Henry Wade</a>, previously best-known as the DA in charge of the case against
<a>Barack Obama</a> spoke at the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame in 2009, and was arrested at Senate hearings while protesting against the appointment of the pro-choice
<a>Sonia Sotomayor</a> to the supreme court. She also made
<a>TV ads</a> against Obama in 2012, saying: “He murders babies.”
<p>She is survived by Melissa; she does not appear to have had any contact with her other two children after their adoption.</p>
<p>The divisive question among the conservative majority appeared to be whether abortion should be restricted to earlier than 15 weeks, weakening Roe, or if the precedent set in Roe should be overturned entirely.</p>
<a>nominated to the court by Donald Trump in 2018</a>, said “the constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice … and leaves the issue to the people to resolve in the democratic process.” If the issue is returned to the states, 26 states would be
<a>“certain or likely”</a> to ban or severely restrict abortion access.
<p>Although the supreme court decision in Brown v Board of Education called for an end to racial segregation in schools in 1954, many schools continued de facto segregation 14 years later.</p>
<a>tax authorities revoked</a> the non-profit status of 111 segregated private schools.
<p>In Balmer’s view, revoking the non-profit status of segregated private schools catalyzed evangelical Christian leaders, but even in the early 1970s defense of racial segregation was not a populist message. However, defense of the fetus could be.</p>
<a>essay</a>, she described the feminist movement as “anti-family, anti-children, and pro-abortion,” and the writing of contemporaneous feminists as “a series of sharp-tongued, high-pitched whining complaints by unmarried women”.
<p>Many clinics went out of business as they struggled to meet the expensive new requirements, and pregnant people struggled to obtain abortions as they had to travel further and spend more to find a provider.</p>
<p>“Why is 15 weeks not enough time?” asked Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, in the hearings.</p>
<a>Tea Party swept the midterm</a> elections. More extreme candidates entered Congress and statehouses through the practice of challenging incumbents in
<a>anger of white evangelicals</a> for a
<a>pro-choice</a>”, saying there should be “
<a>punishment</a>” for women who have abortions, and promised to nominate conservative supreme court justices who would “
<a>automatically</a>” overturn Roe v Wade.
<a>by any means necessary</a>”, according to social researchers such as Indiana University associate professor Andrew Whitehead.
<p>Supreme court decisions are notoriously difficult to predict, but abortion rights activists believe Wednesday’s hearing shows that conservative justices are ready to significantly weaken or perhaps overturn Roe v Wade. </p>

<p>The producers of Suffragette are to make a film telling the story of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that gave every woman in the US the right to have an abortion.</p>
<p>According to Deadline, Alison Owen and Debra Hayward’s Monumental Pictures is set to produce the film, which will be written by the Bafta-winning screenwriter Jennifer Majka.</p>
<p>In the late 60s, the burgeoning movement to legalize US abortion state by state found an unlikely yet loyal ally – a contingent of women at the First Unitarian Universalist church in Dallas, <a>Texas</a>.</p>
<a>Roe v Wade</a>, the pivotal US supreme court case that protects abortion care in the US as a constitutional right.
<p>The trailblazing women laid the groundwork for not only the church’s intrepid commitment to reproductive freedom over the decades, but today’s growing pro-choice faith community movement in Texas.</p>
<p>“These women had the foresight at the time to understand that abortion rights wasn’t just a debate for the moment but would be very important to future generations of women,” says Kathleen Campbell, current president of the Women’s Alliance.</p>
<p>“They also understood that one of the core teachings of the church is the belief that every human is worthy of love and dignity and that a woman’s right to control her own body and reproductive future is a very natural extension of that principle.”</p>
<p>The Dallas church has carried on their legacy for generations by openly supporting reproductive rights groups and causes, spiritually advising abortion patients, and even helping challenge onerous abortion laws in court.</p>
<p>Even as Texas’s leadership has become more conservative and the voices of anti-choice evangelical religious figures became louder, the church remained dedicated to its abortion advocacy.</p>
<a>abortion ban</a> in effect for more than three months – and the prospect of the US supreme court potentially
<a>overturning</a> Roe v Wade next year – that mission has only grown stronger for the progressive congregation, who hope others around the US will join their movement.
<h2>‘We believe God loves us all’</h2>
<p>Wanting to assist in any way they could, the women took the bold step of filing a legal brief on behalf of McCorvey in her pursuit to strike down the Texas law, helping spur support for what would later become Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>Over the decades the church has carried on the tradition of ardently supporting reproductive rights, a seemingly radical mission in a state headed by Christian rightwing leaders deeply hostile to abortion care.</p>
<p>Among its activism the church offers comprehensive sex education, financial support to Planned Parenthood and abortion funds like the Texas Equal Access Fund, and volunteer to drive and safely escort patients to abortion clinics.</p>
<a>Senate Bill 8</a>. The law, which went into effect on 1 September, has devastated reproductive health care in the second largest state in the US for three months. The US supreme court
<a>sent</a> the legal challenge from Texas abortion providers to the conservative US fifth circuit court of appeals. The law allows for any private individual to sue anyone who “aids or abets” abortion care beyond around six weeks of pregnancy, casting a
<a>chilling effect</a> on those who seek to assist abortion patients, including clergy. SB 8, says Kanter, is an affront to religious liberty.
<a>vast pro-choice faith community</a> that comprises the majority or at least, near-majority, of the overall religious community in the US; it is akin to a sleeping giant waiting to be “reckoned” with.
<p>As abortion rights are in the crosshairs nationally after the Supreme Court recently heard Dobbs v Jackson – a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week ban that <a>could upend</a> Roe – the time to mobilize feels especially urgent, says Clarkson.</p>
<a>Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</a> and
<a>Catholics for Choice</a> – both founded in 1973 following Roe – have continued to gain influence.
<p>“While our views have caused some friction, we are not afraid and not backing down,” says Kanter. “We want to steer the wheel back from evangelicals and those who claim to be pro-life. We feel strong and more ready than ever to do so.”</p>

<p>Constitutional scholars in the US said a litany of rights, from same-sex marriage and sex to birth control and in vitro fertilization, could come into question if the country’s highest court moves to overrule or weaken Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>The Mississippi case is <a>widely regarded</a> as the most important abortion rights case since Roe v Wade, when the supreme court effectively legalized abortion nationally in 1973. A decision in the Dobbs case is expected June 2022.</p>

<a>Griswold v Connecticut</a>. In 1967 with
<a>Loving v Virginia</a>, the court invalidated anti-miscegenation laws that barred interracial marriage. In 1972 in

<p>Cutting universal credit by £20 a week is an “unconscionable” move that breaches international human rights law and is likely to trigger an explosion of poverty, the United Nations’ poverty envoy has said.</p>
<p>De Schutter urged the government to drop its plans to withdraw the £20 uplift from 6 October, saying it was too soon. There was <a>plentiful evidence</a> showing millions of people would struggle to afford food and pay essential bills as a result.</p>
<p>The intervention came as Labour raised pressure over the cut, which will be followed with a rise in national insurance contributions from April.</p>
<p>A working universal credit claimant paying tax would have to work more than nine hours extra every week to cover the loss from the two changes, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said.</p>
<a>was passed</a> with the support of four Tory MPs: Peter Aldous, Neil Hudson, John Stevenson and William Wragg. The Tory former welfare secretary Stephen Crabb spoke in the debate to argue the benefit should be retained.
<a>a scathing report </a>on the impact of austerity in the UK, calling rising child poverty levels “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”.
<a>charities and opposition parties</a> that 500,000 people, including 200,000 children, will fall into poverty, there is
<a>nervousness among Tory MPs</a> that the withdrawal will hit families struggling with the cost of living, not least in politically sensitive former “red wall” seats in the north of England and the Midlands.
<a>record inflation</a> spurred by a rise in food and drink prices. Inflation rose to 3.2% in August, from 2% in July, putting further pressure on household budgets. The £20 cut will come as furlough ends and energy prices increase.
<a>urged ministers </a>to “seize the opportunity to protect more families from poverty and make the £20 uplift permanent”.
<p>A government spokesperson said: “Universal credit is supporting 6 million people and will continue to provide a comprehensive, vital safety net for those both in and out of work.</p>
<p>The move was welcomed by homeless charity Shelter, which said a number of asylum seekers were refused help by some authorities during lockdown last year because they were supposedly ineligible for homelessness assistance.</p>
<p>The data was compiled by the No Accommodation Network (NACCOM) whose 138 frontline member organisations support destitute asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds across the UK.</p>
<p>2,771 people approached NACCOM members due to homelessness between April 2020 and June 2021, despite unprecedented levels of emergency statutory provision during Covid-19.</p>
<p>A group of NACCOM community researchers <a>looked at</a> the challenges for homeless migrants during the pandemic. “You are wrestling with need for shelter, but afraid to ask for support as you do not know who you can trust,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Ewan Roberts of Asylum Link in Merseyside, which helps homeless asylum seekers and others with accommodation, said some of the people they work with are too frightened to access mainstream support.</p>
<p>“Work needs to be done to build up relationships of trust. But it’s hard to establish these relationships while pushing hostile environment policies.”</p>

<p>Growing numbers of women are reporting as homeless in England as figures show rough sleeping in <a>London</a> has risen by 35% in five years.</p>
<a>push to house people in hotels</a> at the start of the pandemic was “in imminent danger of being lost”.
<p>Charities said the figures showed the battle against rough sleeping was at “a precipice”, with last month’s <a>lifting of the eviction ban</a>, the winding down of furlough and a chronic shortage of affordable housing all increasing the threat.</p>
<p>St Basils, a charity in the West Midlands, found 35% of those using services under the <a>Everyone In scheme</a> were young women.</p>
<p>Official rough sleeping statistics for England released in February show just 14% of rough sleepers were women and the new figures for London show 16% were women.</p>
<p>Outreach workers fear women are not being included in official rough sleeping statistics because they often go inside when the counts are happening, seeking shelter on buses or staying in AE departments for safety.</p>
<a>Councils said</a> more than 5,000 people were accommodated at the peak of the Everyone In initiative but the number of people bedding down in London for the first time had increased on the previous year.
<p>Gemma Thapermall, a senior caseworker at Glass Door, said job loss was a key cause of homelessness for women but “when I start supporting these women I always notice there is something more going on”.</p>
<p>She said: “They may have come to the services with problems such as losing a job but other issues in their lives will soon become apparent, such as domestic abuse.”</p>
<p>Marike van Harskamp, from New Horizon, said men and women “negotiate street homelessness quite differently”, with women often not staying visible at night, meaning they do not appear in the data.</p>
<p>She eventually received support from the charity and was able to get universal credit but said she found the experience “psychologically and physically very hard”.</p>
<p>“After living on the streets, I never in my life want to go back to that. I don’t want to sleep on the streets again even for a night,” she said.</p>
<p>“A third factor is that young women in normal times may be able to get early support, or it would be identified in college or via youth services, but these services closed due to coronavirus.”</p>

<div> <div> <h3> French watchdog 'did not act fast enough on faulty PIP breast implants' </h3> </div> <div> <div> <time> Published: 2 Oct 2013 </time> </div> </div> </div> French watchdog 'did not act fast enough on faulty PIP breast implants'
<p>A group of more than 200 women are considering legal action over controversial breast implants that have been linked to a rare form of cancer.</p>
<a>which were pulled from the European market in December</a>. Six of the women developed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a rare blood cancer that has been linked to textured implants.
<p>Irene Kennedy, 49, was diagnosed with ALCL in December, eight years after getting her implants. “I hadn’t heard of it, I didn’t know anything about it at all,” said Kennedy, who lives in Leeds. “It’s very scary.”</p>
<p>“If someone said ‘By the way, you could get a cancer’ your ears would prick up and it would be more of a thoughtful process you’d go through,” she said.</p>
<p>Three of the women considering legal action were given the implants after having preventative mastectomies to protect against high genetic risk of breast cancer and now fear they may be at increased risk of getting a different cancer.</p>
<a>Women</a> who have the implants and capsules removed can make a full recovery, but if left untreated the disease can spread throughout the body and become life-threatening.
<p>In a statement, Allergan said the company is committed to strict adherence to all regulatory requirements and rigorous scientific evidence.</p>
<a>published guidance</a> on ALCL and breast implants, said there was no need for women with Allergan breast implants to have them removed or have any additional clinical follow up.
<p>Thousands of women are missing from the breast implant register set up as a result of the <a>PIP breast implant scandal</a>, new figures suggest.</p>
<p>Thousands of breast implant patients are now being urged to ensure their details are recorded on the register to safeguard their health.</p>
<p>Lee Martin, an NHS breast surgeon and chair of the breast and cosmetic implant registry steering group, said: “We want all patients, past and present, to be aware that the registry exists and ensure they are included by speaking to their surgeons.</p>
<p>As well as containing the details of patients and their implants, the registry also allows the identification of trends and complications relating to specific implants.</p>
<p>A type of breast implant used by millions of women around the world is under scrutiny after French surgeons were advised to stop using it because of a potential link with a rare kind of cancer.</p>
<p>Textured breast implants have been linked with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), which forms in the scar capsule around the implant and normally begins with pain and swelling in the breast.</p>
<p>Women who have the implants and capsules removed can make a full recovery, but if left untreated the disease can spread throughout the body and become life-threatening.</p>
<p>There is growing concern about the effects of the implants, with figures collected by plastic surgeons suggesting there have been at least 615 cases of the disease associated with breast implants, and 16 deaths.</p>
<p>In France, where 85% of the breast implants used in women are textured, the health regulator, ANSM, has recommended surgeons switch to smooth implants while the links are investigated.</p>
<p>ANSM said it would convene a meeting of experts in February to hear from patients, health professionals and other stakeholders, before making a ruling. The situation in France is likely to stir the debate about the implants in other countries.</p>
<p>In the UK, where most of the implants used are textured, there have been 45 confirmed cases of the lymphoma being linked to them, and one fatality. The health regulator estimates the risk at one in 24,000 women with implants.</p>
<p>In the US, 252 cases have been confirmed, but experts believe the true figure to be 800 to 1,000, with many as yet undiagnosed.</p>
<p>Australia’s health watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, reported 72 cases and has said “expert opinion puts the risk of ALCL at between one in 1,000 and one in 10,000”.</p>
<p>The first report of a link was made in 1997, and the UK’s health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), put out an alert in 2011 after reports of cases in other countries.</p>
<p>“ALCL is rare, but it is important healthcare professionals and patients who have implants know about it,” the regulator’s most recent update said.</p>
<p>However, several women who have received textured implants since the first alert in 2011 said they were not told about the risk – and an apparent lack of awareness among doctors meant some waited months before getting treatment.</p>
<p>Wilson said she was initially told to take hot baths because she might have strained a muscle at the gym.</p>
<p>By the time ALCL was considered “there was an 11cm x 8cm mass in my chest and various lymph nodes in my neck were enlarged, the lymphoma had also spread to my heart, I was quite poorly. I was diagnosed at stage four,” she said.</p>
<p>“The doctor wanted to take me into hospital straight away because the nodes were pressing on my trachea and also a main artery; he was concerned I was going to stop breathing over the weekend.”</p>
<p>She only received appropriate treatment after contacting a doctor in the US. </p>
<p>After 13 rounds of immunotherapy, she had surgery to remove the implants. “I had implants simply due to being under-confident. I thought they would make me happy but it was very short-lived.”</p>
<p>Charlie Fouracres, 33, from Essex, was diagnosed after the cancer spread beyond her breast, although in her case doctors were quick to identify ALCL.</p>
<p>Nigel Mercer, a plastic surgeon who chairs the plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery expert advisory group (PRASEAG) for the MHRA, said: “There is no excuse now for a surgeon working in the UK not telling people what the risk is.”</p>
<p>Doctors in the US have been studying the link between ALCL and breast implants for more than 20 years, and have helped provide British women with a diagnosis.</p>
<p>A pioneer of the work, Mark Clemens, an associate professor of plastic surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he had never seen a case of ALCL that was not linked with textured implants.</p>
<p>“It is an uncommon disease so when women are deciding on breast implants they need to be aware of the risks and benefits of textured and smooth; they need to be told that it can exist, what the symptoms are and what to do about it.”</p>
<p>“Some reports have suggested it may be as much as one in 2,500 or one in 3,000 for some textured implants. In the least risky types of textured implants it is lower: one in 50,000 or 60,000.”</p>
<p>Some women admitted the stigma of having breast implants may be preventing others from finding out more.</p>
<p>The breast implant maker Allergan said it was “fully committed to investing in and supporting work to further understanding and increasing awareness” of BIA-ALCL and had developed new product labelling as well as funding external research.</p>
<p>“While these efforts to enhance understanding and awareness are ongoing, we continue to support the needs of patients and their surgeons.”</p>
<p>Another maker, Mentor, said it was important for patients to understand the benefits and potential risks of the different types of implants.</p>
<h2>‘It was the worst pain I’ve ever had’</h2>
<p>It was Deborah Grokes’s husband who first spotted a problem with one of her implants in 2016. “We were on holiday and he said ‘Oh my God, your left breast has swollen’. I hadn’t noticed. I didn’t have any pain,” she says.</p>
<p>Her textured implants had been put in four years earlier as replacements for some made by the French manufacturer PIP, which was found to have <a>used dangerous silicone in its products</a>.</p>
<p>Grokes went to a private hospital for a checkup. “They aspirated my breast – they took out 310 millilitres of fluid – about the same as a can of Coke, and it looked normal again. But six weeks later it was back to the same size.”</p>
<p>Her GP was sympathetic and referred her to a hospital, which prescribed antibiotics.</p>
<p>Grokes went back to the NHS and a different surgeon. She says he told her he had never heard of ALCL, and thought it was unlikely she had it but would do tests.</p>
<p>Two weeks later he said he would remove the implants and do a biopsy on the capsule that had formed around them.</p>
<p>Grokes felt better as soon as they were removed, and took along her young sons to what she thought would be a routine checkup a few weeks later. “He examined me and then said: ‘I’m really sorry, but you have BIA-ALCL’.”</p>
<p>After further tests she was back on the operating table to have the capsules removed. “It was so painful. I’ve had implants twice, I’ve had two natural births, and it was the worst pain I’ve had.”</p>
<p>She was given the all-clear after the operation, but had chemotherapy to ensure the cancer was gone. Months later she feels much better, but worries the cancer could return.</p>

<p>Leading a Westminster Hall debate about international men’s day, Nick Fletcher said discussions about women’s safety, such as after the murder of Sarah Everard, risked achieving nothing because of a focus on the idea of toxic masculinity.</p>

<p>He continued: “Is it any wonder that so many young men are committing crimes? Such programmes make crime look cool.”</p>
<p>Another Conservative from the 2019 intake, Blackpool South’s Scott Benton, said during the debate that men’s issues had been “swept under the carpet for far too long as society focuses on the false narrative of male privilege”.</p>
<p>Benton said: “The very mention of men’s issues will have hypocritical virtue signallers seething as they try to condemn white men as oppressors.”</p>
