<h2>Learn from your mistakes</h2>
<h2>Spend less and get creative</h2>
<h2>Grow what works best for your space</h2>
<p>Stop trying to grow high-maintenance plants that don’t naturally flourish in your location and soil type. Look at easier, more resilient alternatives.</p>
<p>Avoid anything with exacting watering requirements (for example, sprouts or cauliflower); instead, grow pick-and-come-again leaves such as spinach, chard and kale. For ease of growing, I also favour purple sprouting broccoli over the ordinary kind.</p>
<h2>Protect your plants naturally</h2>
<p>Over winter, soil fertility can leach away with lots of rain, so help bind it together with green manures, perennial plants and spent crops left to rot naturally. Mulches and covers also protect against erosion.</p>
<h2>Favour natural pest control</h2>

<h2>Baked cauliflower with roast almond and prune mole</h2>

<h2>Pleasant ways to eat sprouts</h2>
<p>With gnocchi Gnocchi is frequently a soft, pillowy stomach-filler. Bland carb overkill. Sprouts are useful in bringing an astringent, adult edge to your gnocchi. Throw in some sausage meat and you are home and hosed.</p>
<p>With chestnuts and creamAs with spinach, almost any combination of cream, shallots, garlic, wine, mustard, nutmeg and sprouts is going to fly.</p>
<h2>Less pleasant things that can occur with sprouts</h2>
<p>They encounter blue cheeseNo blue cheese in hot food is a rule HTE lives by. It has served it well. Please, step away from the stilton.</p>
<p>So, sprouts, how do you eat yours?</p>

<p>Make six skewers by removing the bottom 2cm of leaves from the thick, woody of each rosemary sprig.</p>
<p>Put the leaves in a sealable container, addthe oil and sliced garlic, then season generously. </p>
<p>Cut the fish cheeks neatly in half, so you now have six scallop-shaped pieces, toss these in the marinade, seal and refrigerate for four to 24 hours; wrap the skewers and refrigerate until needed. </p>
<p>Using a metal skewer, pierce a pilot hole through the length of the fish cheeks, then poke a cheek on to the end of each rosemary skewer. Lay out the guanciale (or bacon, lay a garlic sliver on each slice, then wrap tightly around each fish cheek.</p>
<p>Put half a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and, once hot, lay in the skewers and cook for two to three minutes, or until caramelised. Turn, repeat on the other side and enjoy immediately.</p>

<p>Onorato can’t remember how he made it to the foyer’s steps after he’d been shot twice in the arm, but he was sitting there in a pool of blood when the carabinieri arrived. “I was cradling Mr Gucci’s head. He died in my arms,” says the ex-doorman.</p>
<p>As the only direct witness, Onorato was terrified that the killer would return. “I was a poor man, so I had to go back to work at Via Palestro 20 when I recovered. I had a panic attack every time an unfriendly looking stranger approached.”</p>
<p>If Gucci didn’t take Reggiani’s calls, she sent him diatribes on cassette tape, later played in court, saying he was “a monster” for neglecting her and their daughters, and warning that “the inferno for you is yet to come”.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Shein declined to say much about the software, but said the company invests “heavily in training, technology and IT support to help our suppliers become more efficient and profitable”.</p>
<a>Sixth Tone</a>. A knitting machine operator at a factory in the city of Zhejiang told Rest of World that, in China’s garment sector, working overtime is “a certainty”.
<a>viral</a>, TikTok users began pointing out that it was available for only $13 on Shein and as low as $3.83 on AliExpress.
<a>more aware</a> of the Chinese companies making their clothes. Because they know the bulk of what they buy is coming from China, many people, understandably, assume that similar items originated from the same factories.
<p>“At many of these companies these days – including, I suspect, at Shein – it’s not the fashion guys that are designing clothing,” he said. “It’s engineers. Engineers looking at data.”</p>
<a>reportedly</a> working with about 2,000 influencers in that country alone.
<p>The activity implies that the cycle of ultra-fast-fashion will only keep ticking up in speed and volume, as long as consumers continue to willingly buy into micro-trends – and discard them just as quickly.</p>
<p>Shards of silver sequins rattled like hailstones from floor-length hems as models stomped the catwalk in chunky-soled boots. There were sheer corset dresses with their bones flaring around the body like umbrella ribs.</p>
<a>a fairytale secret Royal Wedding dress</a> for Kate Middleton a year later, has form in surviving trauma. Alexander McQueen has matured from being the workshop of a singular genius into a global luxury brand.
<p>On the Road, Jack Kerouac’s seminal novel of the Beat generation, “sold a trillion Levi’s, [and] a million espresso coffee machines”, as the writer’s friend and fellow poet William Burroughs once wrote.</p>
<p>Now one of the coolest books in the literary canon is in the fashion spotlight as the inspiration for a <a>Dior</a> menswear collection unveiled at a blockbuster London catwalk show.</p>
<p>Chanel has denied deleting its <a>TikTok</a> account, after a beauty influencer made fun of the fashion brand’s advent calendar on its site.</p>
<a>TikTok user Elise Harmon</a>, a beauty influencer, less than what one would expect from the $800 (£604) price tag.
<p>“It has never been activated, no content has ever been published, it has no subscriber and no subscription. The page therefore appears empty to anyone who visits it,” said an official spokesperson.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Harmon posted a <a>video entitled</a> “When you accidentally cancel Chanel.”</p>
<p>The splashiest new venue in Paris fashion, the setting for a Chanel catwalk show bedazzled with pearls and sequins, is a workshop that celebrates the old-fashioned art of craft-made clothes that last a lifetime.</p>
<p>The old blouses of the stiff collar and cuffs would hardly recognise their descendants of to-day with the wide necks, the long, straight lines, the entire absence of stiffness, which are protests against any tendency to cabin and confine.</p>
<p>But even the straight blouse, so easy and so flowing in line, has been under a cloud. It has passed over into the dress to a great extent and its independent existence has been threatened by its very easiness.</p>
<p>Both kinds of blouse or jumper or casaquin, as they may be called, are striving for predominance – a process which, in reality, is a mortal combat between the dressmakers and the blouse-makers as separate organisations.</p>
<p>Peasant blouse There is, however, a middle road, based on the fact that the blouse is actually a traditional garment among the human race, as traditional as a head-covering which eventually becomes a hat.</p>
<p>Peasant blouses in various parts of the world testify to the permanent factor in blouses, and actually the peasant blouse has held its own among all the varying fortunes of the fashionable blouse.</p>
<p>The embroidery is also generally placed in a characteristic position, such, for instance, as round the middle portion of the sleeves and in a sort of ephod, back and front.</p>

<p>A symbol of rankAs an article of dress the girdle is almost extinct, though the belt is probably a modified form of it, and the seam which joints the bodice and skirt of the modern dress may be the last remaining evidence of its existence.</p>
<p>When you part with £12 for a T-shirt at a pop concert, you’re not just paying extortionate tribute to your heroes. You’re making the difference between the gig showing a profit or a loss.</p>
<p>These sorts of figures greatly interest managers, always alert to ways of reducing tour costs. They have to be: touring a band costs from £13,000 for a mid-level indie outfit to £160,000 for a Simply Red.</p>
<p>Other bands do something along these lines plus a high-priced “premium” item like a jacket. Happy Mondays once sold “designer” (the mind boggles) condoms.</p>
<p>That’s something to think about while you’re queuing for those Depeche Mode cycling shorts.</p>
<p>Ashes to Ashes official video, YouTube.</p>
<p>Men, on the other hand, Post decreed, may wear dark grey or blue business suits in place of morning suits at most weddings, but she believed white linen or light grey flannel was far more suitable for country weddings.</p>
<p>And never, ever, at any wedding, anywhere, would men ever get away with a sports jacket.</p>
<p>Then you rush off to find a pair of never-to-be-worn-after-the-event cream shoes. As you delve under the coat-rack for a handbag that could plausibly belong with the shoes, you realise your ideas of relaxed dressing have entirely collapsed.</p>
<p>You can, of course, decide to make do with what you already own. But will a mere mousseline scarf tied round a straw hat, a bar strap shoe, or beaded bag do the trick, or simply induce fantasies of BBC drama?</p>
<p>Even the simplest additions to a dress - a glittering animal brooch, pewter silk shoes or a slither of a tie pin - can stimulate an internal war about tastes in decoration.</p>
<p>The point is, while weddings turn single people into married couples, they also transform the personalities of the guests. Slouchy adolescents put on morning suits, lose their rolling gait and walk with their hands in prayer position.</p>
<p>Men of normally independent nature wear ties to match their partners’ shoes; and the most assured party animal can come out in a heavy sweat at the thought of a fellow guest wearing a similar outfit.</p>
<p>Not that they will, of course. Unlike the bride and groom, wedding guest nerves are forever.</p>
<p>Another beach-into-street style that does work is a large square collar with as much in the front as at the back. The corners are buttoned on to a strapless dress and no hint is given that there is a sun-dress beneath the demure collar. </p>
<p>There are various degrees of rank, so to speak, in a Frenchwoman’s robe de chambre. First comes the saut-de-lit, the jump-out-of-bed gown, to be thrown on over the nightdress for bedroom use only – the regular dressing-gown in fact.</p>
<p>Flower shapes What made the show exciting were the new Jacquard weaves for suitings, with flower shapes, lozenges, and zigzags replacing the fired trio of herringbone, check, and stripe.</p>
<p>Ties made of polyester yarn treated with a fluorescent finish will be in the shops by Christmas. They will give “gorgeous glowing effects under the ultraviolet light of the discoteque.”</p>
<p>And by January the shops will be stocking “Y-front” pants which “now reflect the more permissive age with a design of little red hearts with the message “I love you.” They are intended for women to buy for men on St Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>But the British fashion industry could, in the end, lose out, she says. “It’s a shame that Britain lacks the infrastructure to fully exploit and retain the talents of iconoclastic, innovative designers such as Alexander McQueen,” she says.</p>
<p>With the backing of LVMH, the possibilities for McQueen are endless. “Couture is beyond beyond,” he says. “It is where the dreams of your life in fashion become a reality.”</p>
<p>Certainly, it is a measure of the generosity and confidence of the French fashion establishment that it allows English designers to take over at two of the country’s greatest couture houses.</p>
<p>Fashion is an illusion, and in admitting that fact while celebrating it, French Vogue still beats everyone at the game.</p>

<p>After revelations of sexual violence in Lesotho garment factories, where jeans are made for brands such as Levi’s, workers fought for better conditions. But now Covid-19 has hit the fashion industry, those gains may be lost. By Annie Kelly</p>
<p>“Sexual harassment is the fashion industry’s dirty secret. Brands are rarely called to account for what is happening to women making their clothing,” said Aruna Kashyap, a campaigner and legal advocate for Human Rights Watch.</p>
<a>agreement</a> with Nien Hsing, the owners of five major factories, unions and women’s groups to put measures in place to protect workers, including stopping the use of “dailies” and creating an independent body to investigate allegations of harassment.

<p>Mamello Makhetha and Kabelo Sello, two of the women who faced sexual assault at the hands of their male supervisors, agree that the factories feel safer. “Everyone is on proper contracts now,” said Sello. “And a lot of the harassment has stopped.”</p>
<p>“It is still hard,” she said, “but at least here in Lesotho everybody is listening to us now. I want to try and make sure that no other woman in the factories has to come to work and suffer like that again.”</p>
