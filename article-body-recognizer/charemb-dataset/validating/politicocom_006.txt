<p><b>COOKING OIL IS A HOT CLIMATE SOLUTION — </b>Fuels made from plant and animal waste are in hot demand as companies that operate planes, trucks, trains and ships look for ways to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
<p>Congress is considering giving extra tax credits to one sector in particular: sustainable aviation fuel. The proposal in Democrats’ Build Back Better Act is raising questions about whether there will be enough fats, oils and greases to go around. </p>
<p><b>There is no clear-cut answer and a lot of uncertainty, </b>according to <b>Prashant Rao</b>, Citigroup’s director of biofuels equity research. The main concern is how fast new renewable diesel and SAF projects come online. </p>
<p>“Can the feedstock market keep pace with the amount of projects that have been announced? Rao said. “As with any large energy project, there is also the risk that some don’t get completed.” </p>
<p><b>Kim Carnahan</b>, senior director of net-zero fuels at sustainability consulting firm ENGIE Impact, had a different assessment. There is a limited supply of feedstocks, but it will be a decade or more before that market is saturated, she said. </p>
<p>By then, road transport could be moving toward electrification or other technologies like hydrogen fuel, said Carnahan, who also manages the <a>Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance</a>, which is creating a new carbon accounting system for SAF.</p>
<p>The sweetener is larger than the $1-per-gallon tax credit for bio-based diesel, which Build Back Better would extend for another five years.</p>

<b>DIVESTMENT COMING TO A STATE NEAR YOU — </b>Legislatures in states including Colorado, Hawaii and Oregon could take up a flurry of bills next year that would require public funds to either disclose their fossil fuel assets or divest from the industry.
<a>whether to divest its pension fund from fossil fuels within five years</a>, and a similar measure
<a>shot down</a> in Colorado earlier this year could be reintroduced in 2022 with some revisions.
<p>There are already bills circulating in <a>New Jersey</a>, <a>New York</a>, <a>Massachusetts </a>and <a>California</a>, too. </p>
<p><b>Reminder:</b> <a>Maine in June became the first state</a> to require that its $17 billion pension fund divest from coal, oil and gas companies by 2026.</p>
<b>The numbers:</b> A recent analysis showed that 14 U.S. public pension funds have $81.6 billion in likely fossil fuel assets. The

<p>Freshman GOP Congressman Tony Gonzales dashed Democratic hopes of flipping a Texas border seat blue during the 2020 election cycle. </p>
<p>Still, that could change: The Department of Justice<a> is suing Texas</a> over its redrawn district lines alleging the updated maps violate the Voting Rights Act and disenfranchise voters of color. </p>

<p>“This is about one thing: politics,” he tells me in an interview. </p>
<a>tens of thousands of Haitian migrants</a> set up a makeshift camp in his district in the city of Del Rio, he complained to
<a>Fox Business</a>: “This administration is doing nothing to secure this border.”
<p>But when we spoke this week, Gonzales told us the Biden administration has been more receptive to his overtures. (The White House declined to comment.) </p>
<p>These days, Gonzales has a new title, vice chair of the <b>Congressional Hispanic Conference, the Republican counterpart</b> to the Democratic-controlled Congressional Hispanic Caucus.</p>
<p>We discuss whether the inroads the <a>GOP made with Latinos</a> are sustainable heading into the 2022 midterms, what the administration gets wrong about immigration — and why he thinks Republicans need to talk about race more. </p>
<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><span><b>THE RECAST: </b></span>You spent 20 years in the Navy as a cryptologist. So you basically crack codes for living?</p>
<p><span><b>REP. GONZALES: </b></span>Yeah, I cracked codes for 20 years and now I'm trying to crack the code up here in Congress. It’s only been a year, I’ve got a long way to go. But it seems like the code is everchanging up here.</p>
<p><i>Every week, we sit down with diverse and influential characters who are shaking up politics.</i></p>
<p><span><b>THE RECAST:</b></span><b> </b>What has been the most perplexing thing you can't really wrap your head around about Congress? </p>

<p><span><b>THE RECAST:</b></span><b> </b>You’ve also been critical of the current administration’s handling of the border crisis. Has the administration reached out to you? Have you reached out to them on some of your ideas on how to fix the problem?</p>
<p><span><b>REP. GONZALES:</b></span><b> </b>Yeah, you know, at the very beginning, I mean, even before I was sworn in, and I reached out to the administration, I really didn't get anywhere. </p>
<p><span><b>THE RECAST: </b> </span>You say the administration has reached out to you more recently. So has that been since the Haitian migrant issue in Del Rio late this summer and the Border Patrol debacle? </p>
<span><b>REP. GONZALES:</b></span>
<p>So it's just kind of, like, a good start. [But] that's a drop in the bucket.</p>
<span><b>THE RECAST: </b></span>Let me ask you about your new title. You're named vice chair of the Congressional Hispanic Conference earlier this month. Tell me about the conference because it's being renewed after being somewhat dormant for a while.
<p><span><b>REP. GONZALES:</b></span><b> </b>The Congressional Hispanic Conference isn't something new. It's been around for a very long time. However, it's all about the members. And it's all about, you know, a member kind of driven organization. </p>
<p>To me, it's very important that the Republican Party continue to grow and be diversified and have Hispanics represent their areas from across the country. I’ll also say we have a long way to go. </p>
<p>Look, in Texas alone, we have 23 Republican congressional members: 22 are Caucasian … and then there's Tony Gonzales. Like that's an issue, right?</p>
<p>So I think step one is not labeling us all the same. And I think maybe that's one thing that the parties have gotten wrong. Two, the messenger matters. </p>
<p>Me being Mexican American, having six children, being a 20-year combat veteran, being Catholic in a district that's predominantly Hispanic. That matters, right? </p>
<p>When you look at policies, the conservative message, I think, is one that resonates with the Mexican American community: conservative values, right, life is very important, you know, pro-business, limited government, national security. </p>
<p><span><b>THE RECAST:</b></span><b> </b>So what is the path forward here? There are only seven members of the conference, if my math was correct. How do you get those numbers up so you can sell that conservative message?</p>
<p><span><b>REP. GONZALES:</b></span><b> </b>I think there's an opportunity to talk about race and a lot of Republicans don't like to do that. It's an uncomfortable area, but the reality is like, we're different, America is different. </p>
<span><b>REP. GONZALES</b></span>
<b>: </b>My take is, if you look at what is happening from a lawsuit standpoint once you have the DOJ suing Texas, right, just on the surface and you go OK,

<p>The letter, sent on November 8, made its way up the chain fast. Just four days later, she got a green light in the form of an email from the White House visitor’s office.</p>

<p>The floral shop, like many other businesses, has also experienced supply chain issues, but theirs came with a grim twist. </p>
<p>“We were running out of supplies, especially wreaths, because there had been so many funerals,” Suha Kaidbey said.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <header> <h1>Trump still likes the Trump vaccine</h1> </header> </div> </div> </div>
<p><i>With help from Renuka Rayasam, Chris Suellentrop, Myah Ward and Tyler Weyant</i></p>
<p><span><b>‘I CAME UP WITH A VACCINE’ </b></span>— At least twice this week, Donald Trump touted the vaccines that he has both taken and taken credit for.</p>
<b>Promoting the vaccine to skeptical, or militantly, anti-vax followers is something some of Trump’s supporters and public health experts asked him to do</b>
<a> <b>months ago,</b></a> privately or publicly, as my colleague Meridith McGraw and I reported earlier this year. But he was focused on pushing the conspiracy of The Stolen Election.
<p><b>“I came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines,” Trump told Owens. “All are very, very good.”</b></p>
<p>He also hit back at suggestions that the vaccines are harmful or ineffective, saying that vaccinated people who got breakthrough infections had mild illness. The vaccinated, he said, were not the ones dying.</p>
<p><b>“The ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine,” he said. “People aren’t dying when they take the vaccine.”</b></p>
<p>Trump reiterated his opposition to vaccine mandates, and, to Owens, to mask requirements for kids in school. But his endorsement of the vaccines themselves was hearty and unequivocal.</p>
<p><b>To the public health world, his shift this week was better late than never.</b></p>
<p><b>What made Trump do this now is anyone’s guess. </b>Hospitals have been swamped before, and the death toll is now past 800,000. For the past year, the unvaccinated have died in disproportionate numbers.</p>
<p>His sudden jab-advocacy also comes shortly before his planned news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 6, the anniversary of the assault on the Capitol.</p>
<p><b>One former aide, who did not want to be named talking about the former boss and who had urged Trump to speak out earlier, downplayed the new tone, </b>saying Trump had talked about vaccines “whenever he was asked.”</p>
<p>“His follow up” — his restated opposition to vaccine mandates — “gave everyone a window into his thinking,” the second former aide said. “Beyond that, I wouldn’t speculate.”</p>
<p><b>A programming note:</b> Nightly won’t publish from Friday, Dec. 24 to Friday, Dec. 31. But don’t fret: We’ll be back and better than ever on Monday, Jan. 3. </p>

<b>PUTIN’S PRE-CHRISTMAS WISH LIST </b>
<p>Speaking during a marathon annual news conference, the Russian leader welcomed talks with the U.S. that are set to start in Geneva next month, but warned the discussion focused on Moscow’s demand needs to produce quick results.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure our security,” Putin said. “We put it straight: There must be no further expansion of NATO eastward.”</p>
<p>Last week, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p><span><b>SEE YOU IN 2022 </b></span><b>— As we close out the last edition of 2021, here are New Year’s resolutions from the team that brings you Nightly every day. </b></p>
<p>My mom’s Facebook memory from 2019 popped up this month, showing me in my blue cap and gown, no mask. Pre-Covid. My LinkedIn in January will say two years at POLITICO. That means year three of the pandemic is approaching.</p>
<p>To think we’ve spent two years of our lives with Covid is overwhelming. We’ve all begun to talk about life the same way, categorizing time by a virus: Pre-Covid, Pandemic and Post-Pandemic, whatever that really means.</p>
<p><a>As an expert told Nightly,</a> we used to mark time by standout events. It’s true Covid has warped our sense of time but scroll through your camera roll. This year wasn’t as blurry as I thought. </p>
<a>pandemic kitten</a> to keep him company (whoops). I moved to D.C. I saw my grandparents. I ran a marathon. I saw people I love get married.
<p>Then there was a year of news: To name a few,<b> </b><a>Biden was inaugurated,</a> and Vice President Kamala <a>Harris made history.</a> The <a>Capitol was invaded.</a> We saw the end of <a>America’s longest war.</a></p>
<p>When I remember 2021, I hope I don’t just write it off as another year of Covid. And in 2022, I hope to soak it all in —<b> </b>the days, the months, the defining moments. Because Covid doesn’t stop time. <b>— <a>Myah Ward</a></b></p>
<p>Twenty-one months ago, when I was asked to move from POLITICO Magazine to edit a new pop-up pandemic newsletter, a colleague reassured me, <i>Don’t worry. No one expects you to be editing a coronavirus newsletter a year from now.</i></p>
<p>Well, here we are, about to start Season Three. At this point, no one expects me not to be editing this newsletter ever again. Or if they do, they haven’t told me about it yet. I guess we’ll see what happens at my next annual review.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not going to pretend to know what Team Nightly should be resolved to confront in the year ahead, with Omicron looming, a midterm election on the way, and new revelations about exactly what happened on Jan. 6 a near certainty.</p>
<i>will my family members die </i>and
<i>am I witnessing an in-plain-sight attempt to end the American experiment?</i> The normal stuff.
<p>My point is, I’m not worried about whether this newsletter will still be here, or whether we’re equipped to cover whatever comes next. We will be, and we are.</p>

<b>MORE ABOUT THAT CHRISTMAS CALL — </b>Yesterday,
<a>we told you about</a> a Christmas Eve conversation in which a father of four called into NORAD’s Santa Tracker, spoke with President
<b>JOE BIDEN</b> and first lady
<b>JILL BIDEN</b>, and ended his call by saying “Let’s Go Brandon,” a shorthand for “F--- Joe Biden.”
<p><b>Now, the man who made that remark</b> says <i>he</i> is the true victim of the exchange.</p>
<p><b>“I am being attacked for utilizing my freedom of speech,” </b>the man,<b> JARED SCHMECK</b>, <a>told The Oregonian’s Maxine Bernstein</a>.</p>
<b>“I mean no disrespect,” </b>he went on, describing himself as a “free-thinking American and follower of Jesus Christ,” and not a “Trumper.” (Honestly, it’s hard to square the “no disrespect” comment with the fact that
<b>(1)</b> he knew what “Let’s Go Brandon” meant, and
<b>(2) </b>said it to Biden anyway, even after the president cordially spoke with him about his young children and asked what they wanted from Santa.)
<p><b>OMICRON CRASHES CHRISTMAS — </b>The spread of the Omicron variant threw many Americans’ holiday travel plans into a tailspin this weekend as Covid-related staffing shortages led airlines to cancel hundreds of flights. </p>
<p><b>— <a>The AP reports</a></b> that Delta, United and JetBlue cancelled more than 10 percent of their planned Christmas Day flights. </p>
<p><b>— <a>CNN reports</a> </b>that the TSA screened 1.7 million people on Christmas Eve — almost 1 million <i>more</i> than the same date last year, but about 800,000 fewer than in 2019, before the pandemic.</p>
<b>Even so, a major holiday travel-related Covid surge</b> is likely to be reflected in the coming weeks, further straining a health system that’s already near its limits. Here’s a glimpse of where things stand — and keep in mind this is
<i>before</i> the data accounts for the holiday increase:
<b>ARKANSAS: </b>“The number of cases in the state considered currently infectious topped 10,000 for the first time since Sept. 30,”
<a>via the Democrat Gazette</a> …
<a>reports the L.A. Times</a> …
<b>DELAWARE</b> “breaks the record of reported daily Covid-19 cases as surge continues,”
<b>FLORIDA </b>“on Christmas Day saw its largest single-day increase of newly reported Covid cases since the pandemic began,”
<a>reports<b> </b>the Miami Herald</a>
<b>… MISSOURI: </b>“With 1,600 Covid cases, KC metro sees one of the biggest daily jumps since pandemic began,”
<b>NEW JERSEY </b>“sets COVID record for third straight day,”
<a>via Bergen County’s Record</a>
<b>OHIO:</b> “Last Christmas, more than 3,200 Ohioans reported new Covid cases. This Christmas Eve, there were more than 14,000,”
<b>“In Cleveland, the Covid picture is one of the bleakest in the country</b>,”
<b>MEANWHILE, the fight for the hearts and minds of the unvaccinated </b>is pitting right-wing podcast host
<b>CANDACE OWENS </b>against former President
<b>DONALD TRUMP</b>, who took a decidedly pro-vaccination stance in an interview with her that raised eyebrows this week.
<p><b><i>One thought:</i> </b>Could Trump’s embrace of the vaccines ultimately be the thing that causes the MAGA-adjacent right to sour on the former president?</p>
