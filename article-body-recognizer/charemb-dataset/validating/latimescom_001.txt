<h1> Here’s why you have many different credit scores </h1>
<div><div> By Liz Weston </div></div>
<p><b>Answer:</b> The fact that there are many different scoring formulas has come up frequently in this column. What you consider to be fraud is actually a manifestation of capitalism.</p>
<p>Credit bureaus are private, competing companies. So are the creators of scoring formulas. Lenders and other companies that use credit scores have many to choose from.</p>
<p><a>FICO </a>is the leading credit scoring formula, but rival <a>VantageScore</a> has gained market share in recent years. </p>
<p>Both types of scores come in multiple versions. The latest version of the FICO is the FICO 10, although the FICO 8 continues to be the most-used score. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, mortgage lenders tend to use much older versions of the FICO formula. Scores also can be tweaked for different types of lending, such as auto loans or credit cards. </p>
<p>So it isn’t shocking that the score your lender used was different from the one the credit bureau provided you. What would have been surprising is if the number had been the same.</p>

<h1> Planned Parenthood L.A. was hacked. What it means, and what you can do </h1>
<div><div> By Ada TsengAssistant Editor, Utility Journalism </div></div>
<a>hacker had accessed the personal information of about 400,000 patients</a>.
<p>Though the breach happened in October, the timing of the announcement could have been unsettling to those made vulnerable by the leak. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of what happened and what you can do to protect yourself — financially and mentally. </p>
<h2>What information was taken?</h2>
<p>According to a <a>Planned Parenthood letter sent to victims</a>, the stolen information included names, dates of birth, addresses, insurance identification numbers, clinical data, diagnoses, treatments provided and prescription information. </p>
<p>This could include highly sensitive private information, including whether patients have had abortions or other medical procedures. </p>
<a>Medical record breaches</a> are
<a>common</a>, but hacks involving Planned Parenthood can be — or feel — extra personal or politically driven. The organization’s D.C. branch was
<a>hacked last year</a>, and there was a data breach
<a>in 2015</a> that targeted Planned Parenthood employees.
<p>Planned Parenthood Los Angeles has pledged to increase its network monitoring and add cybersecurity measures.</p>

<a>Catherine L. Fisk</a>, an employment and labor law professor at UC Berkeley, said she could imagine someone who works for a very conservative, religious or anti-abortion supervisor being worried about being fired, but at the moment, the law is clear.

<h1> Explaining Hollywood: How to get a job as a TV director </h1>
<div><div> By Ada TsengAssistant Editor, Utility Journalism </div></div>
<p>When Ava DuVernay launched “Queen Sugar” on the OWN Network in 2016, she hired only women as directors — a practice she’s continued through six seasons of the Louisiana-set family drama. </p>
<a>directing opportunities to accomplished women</a> who were still struggling to get work. A more recent
<u><a>DGA report</a></u> shows improvement: Women made up 34% of the directors of the 2019-20 season.
<p>Historically, network television was seen as creatively limiting, compared with film. But now, especially with the rise of streaming, television is not only widely respected but also where most of the job opportunities are.</p>
<p>But it’s still extremely competitive, regardless of gender.</p>
<a>working as a TV writer</a>. She also had her first TV directing break on “Queen Sugar” in 2018.
<p>“All of us had been, you know, really close a bunch of times, on a bunch of shows. ... You just need that one person to say, ‘Go! I trust you,’” Bennett said. </p>
<p>She has since directed episodes of “Billions,” “Ordinary Joe” and “Animal Kingdom,” and she returned to “Queen Sugar” this year as a director, writer and co-executive producer.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to break in? And how can you best prepare — so that one day a showrunner like DuVernay might give you a call? </p>
<div><p><a>Company Town</a></p><p> <a>Explaining Hollywood: How to get a job as a TV writer</a> </p></div>
<p>What does a TV writer do? How do you become one? How do you move up? How much money can you make? The L.A. Times is explaining the entertainment industry — here’s what you need to know about being a TV writer. </p>
<h2><b>Who becomes a TV director?</b></h2>
<p>Directing for TV requires versatility and an ability to bring someone else’s vision to life. While film is a director’s medium, the main creative forces behind television are the showrunners and writers.</p>
<p>“This is someone else’s baby,” Pan said. “They are asking you to temporarily babysit, and you just have to do everything that the baby’s parents asked you to do.”</p>
<p>“It’s already a very well-structured power machine, and I can just go in and just focus on the parts that I really enjoy,” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s such a gift,” said Bennett, “especially coming from the indie film world, where you’re kind of everything. You’re the writer, the director, the producer, sometimes the editor and the sound designer.”</p>
<p>While some shows have regular directors, it’s also common for a TV director to come in as a guest for a few weeks to help the team execute one particular episode’s vision. So TV directors need to be very collaborative.</p>
<div><p><a>Television</a></p><p> <a>‘SNL’ nearly squashed Natasha Rothwell. Then ‘Insecure’ helped her find her voice</a> </p></div>
<p>The multi-hyphenate calls her directorial debut for the HBO series ‘a call to arms for authenticity.’ But getting there took a lot of growth.</p>
<h2><b>How do you get started?</b></h2>
<p>TV directing is one of the hardest career paths to break into, said Windsor, who runs both the writing and directing TV workshops for Warner Bros. </p>
<p>There are many ways people end up getting their first breaks in television episodic directing, but there are three ways that, anecdotally, seem to be the most common.</p>
<p><b>Building up your directing portfolio in other mediums</b></p>
<p>To get a job directing TV, you often have to have a body of work outside of television, whether it’s directing films, documentaries, commercials or music videos. </p>
<p>That is difficult, Windsor acknowledged, because unlike writing, which can be done alone with a laptop, directing even a short film requires a significant amount of money, time, people and resources. </p>
<p>But having a strong portfolio that showcases your skills makes it easier for a showrunner to take a chance on you.</p>
<p><b>Working in television in another capacity </b></p>
<p><b>Applying for a fellowship program</b></p>
<p>The major Hollywood studios have <a>diversity fellowship programs</a> meant to support emerging directors who would otherwise not get these opportunities. </p>
<a>Half Initiative</a>, that allow people to apply for shadowing and mentorship opportunities.
<p>In the last few years, the DGA has been pressuring the studio directing fellowship programs to guarantee that <a>each fellow will get the chance to direct an episode</a>. </p>
<p>“I know some people who shadowed a very long time and never got an episode,” said Bennett. “So it’s a very useful way to learn to direct, but I don’t know that it’s a useful way of getting hired.”</p>
