<p>Rail fares in England are to rise by 3.8% in March, the government has confirmed, in line with July’s RPI inflation rate and the biggest increase in nine years.</p>
<p>However, with current inflation rates running much higher, and many former season ticket-holders in the commuter belt working from home, the fare rise is likely to be met with less passenger outcry than in previous years.</p>
<p>Industry leaders have argued for a freeze to tempt passengers back to the railway, with numbers again declining with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Numbers had peaked at about 70% of pre-pandemic levels in November.</p>
<p>However, the Treasury is keen to reduce subsidy, with the government having invested more than £14bn to keep services running during the pandemic, and said the fare rise would help meet some of these costs.</p>
<p>The increase officially applies to regulated fares – such as season tickets, long-distance returns and anytime urban fares – in England alone, but is likely to be reflected throughout UK rail.</p>
<p>Rail fares have risen at or above the higher rate of RPI inflation for more than a decade, while fuel duty on petrol and diesel for motorists has been frozen in absolute terms at 57.9p per litre.</p>
<p>News of the fare rise comes as rail unions <a>gear up for industrial action</a>, with a wave of job cuts expected as train operators and Network Rail have been <a>told to find savings</a> of £1.5bn a year.</p>

<h2>Months to get a driving licence back</h2>
<p>To say Jo Makinen is frustrated is an understatement. The account manager, who lives in rural West Sussex, has been trying to renew her driving licence since February but says she has no confidence that it will be processed any time soon.</p>
<a>biggest government services failure during the Covid-19 pandemic</a> was by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Outbreaks of Covid
<a>at its Swansea HQ</a>, and subsequent strikes by staff, have led to long delays for anyone whose paper application requires some kind of manual intervention.
<p>A DVLA spokesperson says driver licence transactions should be back to normal in the spring. He also revealed that DVLA has been told not to contact GPs over the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>If you want a driving test the first one available is next May</h2>
<a> resulted in strike threats</a>.
<h2>Waiting for tax rebates: don’t hold your breath</h2>
<p>Taxpayers are reporting that they have been kept waiting up to six months for rebates normally completed within 10-12 weeks because of severe delays at HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
<a>in some cases, up to nine months</a> – for rebates to be processed.
<h2>Need a new passport? Apply at least 10 weeks before travel</h2>
<a>TNT’s service has been bedevilled </a>with problems, with deliveries repeatedly postponed. Since then, the problem
<a>appears to have worsened</a>. An online petition has been started demanding an investigation into HMPO’s £77m three-year contract with TNT, signed in 2019.
<p>A FedEx spokesperson says: “We fully understand the importance of these shipments to our customers and are taking additional steps to provide timely delivery by adding additional resources to the operations in the UK.”</p>
<h2>Waiting months to register lease extension with Land Registry</h2>
<p>She says long processing times have been “wreaking havoc in the property market”.</p>
<p>When a person or company buys a freehold or leasehold title, they do not become the legal owner of the property until it is officially registered with the Land Registry. Until that time, the purchaser is merely the owner in equity, she says.</p>
<p>“The Land Registry was already operating a significant delay prior to the coronavirus pandemic,” she says. “What lawyers affectionately refer to as the ‘registration gap’ has become a gaping sinkhole swallowing properties.”</p>
<p>“When you tell clients that it could take a year for Land Registry to process their purchase, they can’t believe what they are hearing. It’s a conversation that has been happening for too long. The matter needs to be addressed urgently,” he says.</p>
<p>After the death certificate has been obtained and the estate has been valued, an application for probate is registered with a local office and any necessary paperwork provided.</p>
<p>A scheme to centralise the process seems to have slowed things down, with solicitors already complaining about delays before the pandemic hit. But things have been exacerbated by changes to working practices.</p>
<p>A warning on the government website tells applicants that because of Covid, “it’s taking longer to process paper applications than online applications. Use the online service to apply for probate if you can.”</p>
<p>“Our solicitor members have told us that they’re unable to get sufficient updates on the status of an application, meaning they’re unable to communicate effectively with their clients on how their application is progressing.”</p>
<p>HM Courts and Tribunals said that waiting times have come down and straightforward applications were taking an average of four weeks to process.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said: “We hired extra staff in response to unprecedented demand for probate during the pandemic, and correctly completed online applications are now taking less than a month to process.</p>
<p>“Due to a focus on tackling a backlog of complex cases over the last quarter, average wait times increased, but over the same period 6,000 more cases were completed than received.”</p>
<a>Home Office</a> was accused of causing “turmoil for families” after a failure in its online system for registering
<a>births, deaths and marriages</a> – contravening the government’s 42-day limit. Laura Mogford, a veterinary nursing assistant from south Wales, told the Observer she had been trying to register her son Arthur’s birth for almost three months.
<p>There are only a few weeks left to apply for a UK government grant to help with the cost of getting an electric vehicle home charging point installed if you own your house.</p>
<a>qualifying vehicle</a> and has appropriate off-street parking.
<p>However, the scheme will remain open to homeowners who live in flats, and people in rented accommodation.</p>
<p>The cost of installing a home charging point varies, depending on the type you go for, although quotes typically come in at between £500 and £1,000.</p>
<p>Many drivers need to act now or they will miss out, says Steve Tigar, the chief executive of loveelectric, a company that helps employers provide staff with electric vehicles via salary sacrifice.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the grant, drivers for whom the scheme is closing must order their charging point by the start of February, he adds.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that once you have found an installer you are happy with, you may have to wait five or six weeks for the work to be done.</p>
<p>“Installers are currently very busy, and often they will want to do a site survey before they get to work. But they are vital to the process, as it is they who apply for the EVHS grant on your behalf,” Tigar says.</p>
<p>The unit prices are marked up on the shelves but from the outside it is not obvious that you are buying a box with a small bag inside. The box effectively costs £1.52 once the price difference and the 10% fewer sweets are taken into account.</p>
<p>Pricing quirks and the cost of excess packaging are always worth bearing in mind, particularly around Christmas and Easter when manufacturers invent new ways to present their goods.</p>
<p>Helen Bird from the waste reduction charity Wrap says that while presentation “can be an important part of the gift experience”, it often means more packaging.</p>
<p>Bird says that once the packaging is finished with, it is important to recycle as much as possible.</p>
<p>Outgoing competition regulator Rod Sims says foreign companies that do business in Australia have no excuse for ignoring the nation’s consumer protection laws, warning there will be more big fines for breaches in the future.</p>
<p>Sims, an economist by training, will finish as chair of the ACCC after five terms in office spanning 11 years, making him the regulator’s longest-serving boss.</p>
<p>He will be replaced by Gina Cass-Gottlieb, a competition lawyer who has represented companies in stoushes with the ACCC.</p>
<a>pushing</a> for increases to fines for breaches of Australian consumer protection laws in 2018 and more recently launching a campaign to make it
<a>easier for the ACCC to block mergers</a> – a proposal for which the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg,
<p>The ACCC chair said the increased fines meant companies could no longer shrug off penalties for breaching Australian consumer law as a cost of doing business.</p>
<a>increased to $12.5m after the ACCC appealed</a>), with the
<a>record $125m penalty</a> against Volkswagen for deceiving customers and breaching diesel emissions standards and the
<p>It is <a>seeking a $90m fine</a> while Trivago has argued it should pay just $15m.</p>
<p>“When you breach the law and you get a penalty that’s low, compared to the size of the company, it sends a signal to everybody that it just doesn’t matter,” Sims said.</p>
<p>“So you’ve got to get everyone sitting up and saying, ‘Wow, they must have done something bad, look at that penalty.’</p>
<p>“So it’s hugely important and something we’ll be pushing even more in the years ahead.”</p>
<p>It’s work that continues thanks to the Omicron variant causing a new surge in case numbers and a global logistics crisis that has <a>caused Christmas shortages</a>.</p>
<p>At the peak of the crisis the ACCC granted 30 authorisations in three weeks, “which was a 16-hour day massive effort by a lot of people because normally we would do 30 of those in a year,” Sims said.</p>
<p>“We thought those would finish about now.</p>
<p>2021 was also the year Sims and the Morrison government picked a fight with big tech companies including Google and <a>Facebook</a> over their dominance of the media market.</p>
<p>In an extraordinary act of corporate petulance, Facebook <a>banned</a> news from its site in Australia over a code that would require them to negotiate payments to media companies.</p>
<p>The social media multinational <a>reversed course</a> after the government amended the code.</p>
<p>Since its introduction Google and Facebook have struck deals to pay media companies, <a>including Guardian Australia</a>, for their news content.</p>
<p>He rejected criticism that the code allows big tech to avoid negotiating deals with smaller media companies.</p>
<p>“There are a few small players that haven’t yet got deals,” he said.</p>
<p>“They are very small. And while on the one hand, I think they should get deals, it’s pretty hard to rate the bargaining code a failure when the companies that employ 98% of journalists – I’m making up the number – got deals.”</p>
<p>The lack of enthusiasm from the current government does not bother him.</p>

<p>The under-30s are driving a surge in people getting their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine, with the overall number of people rising by almost half in the week up to 21 December, figures show.</p>
<p>The sudden uptick is fuelled by fears of the Omicron variant, as well as the government’s “Get boosted now” publicity drive, which has seen millions of people come forward for their third Covid shot in the past fortnight.</p>
<p>A total of 221,564 first doses were administered in England in the week of 15-21 December, a 46% increase from the previous week, and 279,112 second doses were administered, a 39% jump, the Department of Health and Social Care said.</p>
<p>The largest increase was seen among young people, with an 85% increase in first doses for those aged 18 to 24 and a 71% increase in first doses for those aged 25 to 30.</p>
<p>More than seven in 10 people aged 18 and over have now received their booster, with 27,127,951 people who are three months on from their second dose already boosted in England, as of 24 December.</p>
<p>The effect is also being seen in older age groups. In the week up to 21 December, more over-60s had had a first dose than during any seven-day period since early June.</p>
<p>But a third dose provides between 60% and 70% protection against symptomatic infection from Omicron two to four weeks after the booster dose.</p>
<p>The government and NHS England have expanded the booster programme and launched an advertising campaign urging the public to “Get boosted now”.</p>
<p>More than 30 million people have had their third dose and all of those eligible will be offered a booster by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The health and social care secretary, Sajid Javid, said that it had “never been more vital to get your jabs” and described the recent surge in first and second doses as “excellent”.</p>
<p>“Those initial jabs lay the foundation for the booster jab to protect against Omicron, two doses is not enough and you need to build protection jab by jab and once eligible get boosted now,” he said.</p>
<p>The news comes as a senior NHS doctor warned “stragglers” who were eligible for a booster but had yet not had one that there was “no time to lose”.</p>
<p> One or two jabs can help but they do not provide the protection we all need against Omicron,” said the NHS national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis.</p>
<p>Over the festive period, 750 armed forces personnel have been drafted in to support the rollout of the booster programme, while extra vaccine centres and pop-up sites have opened to make it as easy as possible for people to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>More than a million slots for vaccinations are still available in the run-up to the New Year.</p>

<p>Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, is a model of compassion, honesty and humility that we should all aspire to, and some in the science community have fallen short of during Omicron.</p>
<p>When the new data was published on Wednesday, the models changed. We are not out of the woods; should Omicron continue to spread rapidly, there are risks for the NHS and those developing long Covid.</p>

<p>More than 500,000 UK participants in one of the biggest ever surveys of the prevalence of Covid-19 have been given shopping vouchers worth more than £210m, figures reveal.</p>
<p>The <a>Covid-19 Infection Survey</a> is the largest regular survey of coronavirus infections and antibodies in the UK, helping to provide information to shape the government’s response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>As an incentive to take tests, participants are offered vouchers. These can be redeemed for specific retailers, including supermarkets, fashion stores, hotels and airlines. Some households have picked up vouchers worth a total of more than £1,000.</p>
<p>The survey aims to find out how many people are getting Covid, how many people previously had Covid, and how many people have had a strong immune response to the vaccination.</p>
<p>The ONS said: “The Covid-19 Infection Survey has been vital in understanding the spread of coronavirus in the community and informing the government’s pandemic response.</p>
<p>The ONS and the DHSC carry out the study in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, the UK Health Security Agency and the Wellcome Trust.</p>
<p>Ministers have been urged to retain a facility that can swiftly create and test new vaccines, amid concerns over the sale of a leading centre originally designed to prepare Britain for future pandemics.</p>
<p>Kate Bingham, the original chair of the vaccine taskforce, has also claimed “the waters have closed over” the innovative approach taken when the pandemic arrived.</p>

<p>Children aged between five and 11 are now eligible for vaccinations in Queensland. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged parents to book children, to get them vaccinated before school goes back, and to talk to their GPs about any concerns. </p>
<p>The jabs will be available from state health clinics, GPs and pharmacists.</p>
<p>Queensland has recorded 784 new cases. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said they are not seeing “massive impacts” on hospitals, but urged people to get their booster shots.</p>
<p>Qld chief health officer John Gerrard said patients are “on the young side”, and that Omicron is the dominant strain at about 75% of cases. There are also some changes to vaccinations for children, more on that in a minute. </p>
<p>Tasmania has recorded 35 new Covid-19 cases, a slight drop on the 44 reported on Boxing Day.</p>

<h2>Xi'an tightens measures as China's case count driven to 21-month high</h2>
<p>The Chinese city of Xi’an, where 13 million residents are currently in lockdown and confined to their homes, announced tightened restrictions on Sunday as the country recorded its biggest Covid-19 infection numbers in 21 months.</p>
<p>On Sunday the country reported 206 new Covid infections - the highest daily number since March 2020, according to the national health commission. </p>
<p>“In the coming days, a number of cases are still likely to be detected,” Xi’an official He Wenquan warned, Agence France-Presse reported. </p>
<p>The northern metropolis - about 900 km (560 miles) from the Olympics venues - reported 155 new Covid patients on Sunday, bringing the total to nearly 500 over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>About 29,000 people have been placed in hotel quarantine, he said.</p>
<p>Xi’an residents have already been tested several times, authorities said, and a “total” disinfection was to begin Sunday evening. Restrictions on movement have also been tightened.</p>
<p>Each household can only send one member out to buy basic necessities once every three days - down from two days under previous rules. All businesses except supermarkets, convenience stores and medical facilities have been ordered to close.</p>

<p>I’ll be bringing you the news from over here in sunny Sydney so let’s start with a quick snapshot of how Covid is unfolding in Australia.</p>
<p>The nation’s most populous state of NSW recorded three deaths and 6,324 new cases while Victoria recorded three deaths and 1999 new cases.</p>
<p>Around Australia there have been lengthy delays getting PCR tests, and now moves are afoot to switch to rapid antigen testing in some cases. </p>
<a>The Age reports</a> that Covid contacts in Victoria could use rapid tests to clear themselves from isolation. In South Australia, the government has
<a>scrapped a requirement</a> for PCR tests for interstate arrivals in favour of rapid tests on arrival.

<p>NHS staff treating Covid patients should be given much more protective facewear than thin surgical masks to help them avoid getting infected during the Omicron rise, doctors say.</p>
<p>The British Medical Association (BMA), Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) and Doctors’ Association UK are calling for frontline personnel to be given FFP3 masks.</p>
<p>FFP3 masks, also known as filtering facepiece respirators, have been <a>shown in a trial in Addenbrooke’s hospital</a> in Cambridge to reduce the number of healthcare staff who become infected.</p>
<p>However, the Department of Health and Social Care’s (DHSC) <a>guidance on personal protective equipment</a>, updated last week, only recommends their use in limited circumstances.</p>
<p>Surgical masks are “unsuitable” given the threat Covid poses, the BMA believes.</p>
<p>In its letter it has reminded hospital chief executives of their legal responsibilities as employers to keep their staff safe from harm, including by providing FFP3s.</p>
<p>A handful of hospitals are understood to already issued FFP3 respirators as standard, but most do not.</p>
<p>Dr Claudia Paoloni, the president of the HCSA, said that giving staff proper PPE would help reduce the fast-growing tide of sickness absence among frontline workers who are getting Covid.</p>
<p>“If we don’t get PPE right we risk contributing to a further wave of sickness absences when hospitals and patients can least afford it.</p>
<p>“The current reliance on inadequate fluid-resistant surgical masks is likely to leave staff vulnerable in enclosed hospital settings,” Paoloni said.</p>
<p>“The fear, as in 2020, is that we are seeing a cavalier approach to safety where infection control guidelines are once again being driven by supply issues and cost.</p>
<p>“We need hospitals to see sense and take a precautionary approach,” by making FFP3s available to anyone who wants to use one instead of a surgical mask, Paoloni added.</p>
<p>The BMA has also written to NHS England asking it to ensure all GP practices are also issued with FFP3s instead of surgical masks, particularly because family doctors often work in small, cramped surgeries.</p>
<p>A DHSC spokesperson confirmed that it does not plan to recommend routine use of FFP3 masks. </p>
<p>“The safety of the NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to deliver PPE to protect those on the frontline.</p>
<p>“Emerging evidence and data are continually monitored and reviewed and guidance will be amended accordingly if appropriate.”</p>
