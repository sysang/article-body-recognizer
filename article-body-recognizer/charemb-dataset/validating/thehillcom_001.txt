<div> <h1>Overnight Defense National Security — Biden prepares for second Putin call</h1> <div> By Jordan Williams - 12/29/21 05:37 PM EST </div> </div>
<p> Biden, Putin to talk again Thursday </p>
<p>President Biden will hold another phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday amid ongoing tensions with Ukraine and ahead of upcoming discussions on Moscow’s security demands.</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement that the two leaders will discuss “a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia.” </p>
<p>Thursday’s call between the two leaders is “at the request of the Russian side,” a senior administration official told reporters on a phone briefing.</p>
<p>“President Biden has always believed that there is no substitute for direct leader to leader dialogue and engagement and that is especially true when it comes to Russia and to his engagement with President Putin,” the official said. </p>
<p>Upcoming talks: U.S. and Russian officials are scheduled to speak on Jan. 10 regarding Moscow's security demands, which were laid out earlier this month. </p>
<p>That meeting will be followed by a Jan. 12 meeting of the NATO-Russia council and a Jan. 13 meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Permanent Council.</p>
<p>Biden and Putin are not expected to directly participate in those talks, the official said. That dialogue will be led by the State Department and include representatives from the National Security Council and Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The change “reflects the need for a persistent presence in Europe and is necessary to reassure our allies and partners of our commitment to collective defense,” a defense official told The Hill.</p>

<p> Judge rejects Okla. lawsuit over vax mandate </p>
<p>An Oklahoma federal judge on Tuesday denied an attempt from the state to block the Department of Defense’s coronavirus vaccine mandate for National Guard members.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major development in the battle between Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) and the Pentagon which began in November after the governor asked Austin to exempt his state’s National Guard from the mandate.</p>
<p>Stitt and Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor (R) asked an Oklahoma federal judge to declare the mandate unconstitutional and to preliminarily enjoin the mandate. </p>
<p>Oklahoma responds: Oklahoma was the first of seven GOP-led states to voice objections to the mandate, and is so far the only state to sue in an attempt to block it from taking effect. </p>
<p>In a statement to The Hill, O’Connor’s office said “we are disappointed” by the ruling. </p>
<p>The Pentagon had no comment on the ruling.</p>

<div> <h1>Biden asks Supreme Court to hear case on 'Remain in Mexico' policy</h1> <div> By Joseph Choi - 12/29/21 11:12 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The Biden administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review its case seeking to end the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy.</p>
<p>Soon after assuming office, the Biden administration sought to end MPP, but Texas and Missouri sued in an effort to keep the policy in place, calling it a "common sense" approach to asylum law.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates, meanwhile, say that the MPP is in violation of U.S. statute as well as the country's international obligations to give asylum-seekers a safe place to wait as their applications are processed.</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit's decision was written by Trump-appointed Judge Andrew Oldham, who said that DHS's proposed approach to the policy was "as unlawful as it is illogical."</p>

<div> <h1>Capitol Police officer says officers worry that Jan. 6 could become an 'every four year thing'</h1> <div> By Monique Beals - 12/30/21 03:23 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>A U.S. Capitol Police officer said he and other officers were concerned the attack that occurred during the certification of presidential election results on Jan. 6 may become an incident that repeats every four years. </p>
<p>Almost one year after the Capitol riots, Gonell still suffers physical and mental injuries from the attack, the outlet reported. He is unable to fully raise his left arm and is still experiencing psychological pain, as is his family, he said.</p>
<p>"They see me cry. They cry with me. They see me in pain. And they also cry because they can't do anything for me other than try to make me feel a little bit better," Gonell told NPR. "This whole year has been horrific."</p>
<p>Since the attacks, hundreds of people who participated in the attack on the Capitol have faced charges in court for their actions on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>But Gonell said the consequences are not enough. </p>
<p>"Their jail time is less than my recovery time," Gonell told NPR. "The charges they're getting do not compare to the mental and physical injuries some of the police officers, including myself, got."</p>
<p>A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that only 29 percent of Republicans supported federal efforts to arrest and try people accused of participating in the attacks. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, 86 percent of Democrats supported the efforts.</p>

<p>Gorton also noted that Jabri could not seek a judgment regarding his counter claim over Boston properties he acquired that the Saudi state-owned firm is seeking, citing the same state secrets privilege dilemma, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Jabri denies allegations that he defrauded Sakab Saudi Holding Co. and nine other state-owned firms while he was a Saudi official. The 10 firms filed a lawsuit against him, alleging that he had swindled them out of $3.5 billion. </p>

<div> <h1>Shutterfly hit by ransomware attack</h1> <div> By Maggie Miller - 12/27/21 02:39 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Photography company Shutterfly announced this week that it had been hit by a ransomware attack that had impacted some services, making it the latest in a string of companies to be targeted by hackers looking for a payout. </p>
<p>While the company was not aware as of Sunday what data had been compromised, it emphasized that credit card numbers, other financial information and Social Security numbers were not stored by Shutterfly. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Shutterfly did not comment on these findings to The Hill, pointing instead to the company’s statement. </p>
<p>The Conti ransomware strain is one of the most prolific currently in use, with a coalition of U.S. federal agencies issuing a joint alert warning organizations to be aware of the dangers related to Conti attacks earlier this year. </p>

<div> <h1>Washington grapples with how to expand crypto oversight </h1> <div> By Sylvan Lane - 12/28/21 06:00 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>The cryptocurrency explosion has forced Washington to adapt federal financial rules to a quickly growing and changing industry.</p>
<p>Even so, the growing prominence of cryptocurrencies has forced critics to focus on how to make them safer and more transparent.</p>
<p>"What I think is really complicated is you're talking about old statutes, and old case law that just never contemplated this,” said Michael Liftik, partner at Quinn Emanuel and leader of the law firm’s SEC enforcement practice.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers and regulators in both parties have also expressed particular concerns with “stablecoins,” tokens tied to cash or other safer assets held by the coin’s issuer.</p>
<p>“If well-designed and appropriately regulated, stablecoins could support faster, more efficient, and more inclusive payments options,” wrote a group of White House officials and financial regulators in a November report on stablecoins.</p>
<p>Liftik said it will likely require legislation to clearly delineate which federal agencies — or perhaps a new one devoted exclusively to digital assets — are responsible for overseeing which parts of the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p>"Once you have the rules of the road, it's easy to tell who's following them. You can catch the speeders, you can catch the people who run red lights, and everyone knows those are the rules and so they can abide by them or not,” he said.</p>

<div> <h1>Congress zooms in on cybersecurity after banner year of attacks</h1> <div> By Maggie Miller - 12/28/21 06:01 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>The past 12 months stand as a banner year in the severity of cyberattacks that wreaked havoc on organizations large and small. </p>
<p>But in the wake of the chaos, a silver lining has emerged around a never before seen level of bipartisan support and genuine interest on Capitol Hill for strengthening the nation's cybersecurity. </p>
<p>The changes come after one of the most bruising years in history for cyberspace, with a barrage of high-profile and highly damaging attacks occurring in quick succession.</p>
<p>These included ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline, meat producer JBS USA, IT company Kaseya, and scores of schools and hospitals throughout the year that were already under pressure from changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>“It seems like a week doesn’t go by that there is not some major new cyber issue that has emerged, so yes, more attention is being paid to it, and more willingness to do something about it,” Langevin said. </p>
<p>The increasing number of attacks has drawn congressional attention and increased interest on a scale not seen prior to 2021. </p>
<p>The attack on Colonial Pipeline in May, which crippled fuel supplies in several states for a week before the company chose to pay the hackers the equivalent of around $4.4 million in Bitcoin to regain access to systems, was a key wakeup call. </p>
<p>“Colonial Pipeline was a real game-changer, eye-opener for many members that maybe were not focused on cyber before,” Langevin said. </p>
<p>Because of the bipartisan consensus around the need to take further steps to defend the nation against cyber threats, the action is likely to be a speed bump instead of a roadblock. </p>
<p>Congress has not been alone in focusing more attention on cybersecurity during a tumultuous year. </p>
<p>“I just think world events are going to demand that members of Congress pay more attention to these issues,” Gallagher told reporters. </p>
<p>“[The year] 2021 was a series of gut punches,” Wright noted. “I think collectively they all will absolutely have a permanent impact on how the government defends itself.”</p>
<div> <h1>Cyber agency warns of increased threats to manufacturing groups during pandemic</h1> <div> By Maggie Miller - 12/29/21 02:59 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Manufacturing organizations are at higher risk of being targeted by hackers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation’s key cybersecurity agency warned Wednesday.</p>
<a>insights report</a> released Wednesday, noting that attacks could increase due to more remote work, which had expanded the threat surface for hackers to exploit.
<p>CISA Director Jen Easterly tweeted out the report Wednesday, underlining the importance of manufacturing groups taking steps to protect themselves. </p>
<p>“As more critical manufacturing plants move to adopt robotic process automation (RPA) due to Covid, bad actors have more opportunities to take advantage of vulnerabilities,” Easterly tweeted. </p>
<p>More recently, researchers found that large biomanufacturing companies, including those involved in producing COVID-19 vaccines and medications, were targeted by hackers potentially linked to Russia.</p>

<div> <h1>FAA warns of continued flight delays amid rising COVID-19 cases</h1> <div> By Sarah Polus - 12/30/21 08:04 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday warned that travelers can expect more flights to be canceled as the omicron variant continues to surge around the country, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
<p>By midday Thursday, nearly 1,200 flights in the U.S. had been nixed and about as many cancelations were already planned for Friday. The flight changes are largely due to staffing shortages among FAA workers due to the newest coronavirus variant.</p>
<p>"To maintain safety, traffic volume at some facilities could be reduced, which might result in delays during busy periods," a FAA spokesman told the Journal.</p>
<p>Many airlines are resorting to offering incentives to bribe workers to log overtime hours during the chaotic holiday travel season.</p>
<p>"We have negotiated holiday incentives to help with operational challenges, but there’s only so far you can stretch people," Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), said in a statement to Reuters.</p>
<div> <h1>Amtrak scales back schedule amid spike in COVID-19 among employees</h1> <div> By Caroline Vakil - 12/30/21 09:58 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Amtrak will reduce its service between Friday and Jan. 6 as it grapples with a rising number of COVID-19 cases among workers and poor weather conditions, according to The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Among the affected routes include four trains between Washington and Springfield, Mass., overnight trains between Newport News, Va. and Boston and several trains between New York and New Orleans, among others.</p>
<p>The Post said that the cancellations for that week compromised 1.5 percent of its scheduled trains. </p>
<p>“Amtrak regrets any inconvenience,” the service said in a statement, according to The Post. “We are continuing to monitor changing conditions and will make any further adjustments as required.”</p>
<p>However, in mid-December, Amtrak decided to suspend its vaccine mandate as the federal requirement was temporarily halted amid legal battles. </p>
<p>Other transit companies are also suffering service setbacks due to a rising number of COVID-19 cases amid the spread of the omicron variant and poor weather conditions.</p>
<p>Several thousand flights were canceled between Sunday, Monday and Tuesday as coronavirus infections led to a shortage of staff. Airline cancellations were also experienced on Christmas Eve, disrupting holiday plans.</p>
<p>The Hill has reached out to Amtrak for comment.</p>
<div> <h1>Hong Kong airline suspends cargo flights amid COVID-19 protocols, warns of supply chain issue</h1> <div> By Joseph Choi - 12/31/21 10:16 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>Hong Kong's flagship Cathay Pacific airline said on Friday that new quarantine guidelines may lead to further supply chain disruptions as the city keeps to its "zero Covid" strategy.</p>
<p>Wong warned that this new policy would cause "dramatic disruptions to supply chains in the short-term" and threaten Hong Kong International Airport's status as a "leading cargo hub."</p>
<p>The Post noted that Cathay Pacific has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, experiencing losses of $3.75 billion in the past two years and losing thousands of staff members.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific said on Thursday that due to tightened quarantine rules, an unspecified number of passenger flights would be cancelled. Long haul cargo flights going into Hong Kong will also be suspended for a week, the company said.</p>

<p>“It’s a great program that reflects our values, brings us closer to the product and helps us build empathy for all our audiences,” the spokesperson said in an email. </p>

<p>Apple is offering large bonuses to employees in an attempt to retain talent from rivals such as Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Bloomberg News reported.</p>
<p>The reported bonuses range from approximately $50,000 to as much as $180,000, according to Bloomberg. Many company engineers have received sums in the amount of roughly $80,000, $100,000, or $120,000 in shares, sources told the outlet.</p>
<p>Apple informed some engineers in the silicon design, hardware and select software and operations groups last week that they will receive the bonuses, which are being issued as restricted stock units. </p>

<div> <h1>Amazon updates AI after Alexa tells 10-year-old to try 'penny challenge'</h1> <div> By Rebecca Klar - 12/30/21 10:31 AM EST </div> </div>
<p>Amazon updated its Alexa artificial intelligence (AI) after a user posted that an Amazon device told their child to do what is known as the “penny challenge,” a company spokesperson said Thursday. </p>
<p>"Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers," the spokesperson said in a statement. </p>
<p>"As soon as we became aware of this error, we quickly fixed it, and will continue to advance our systems to help prevent similar responses in the future," they added. </p>
<div> <h1>Virginia AG sues town where Army officer was pepper sprayed during traffic stop</h1> <div> By Cameron Jenkins - 12/30/21 04:03 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) on Thursday sued a city in the commonwealth after two local police officers pepper-sprayed an Army officer during a December 2020 traffic stop.</p>
<p>Herring filed the lawsuit against Windsor after his office conducted a 14-month investigation into data that revealed Black drivers made up nearly 42 percent of traffic stops conducted by the city's police, <a>according to The Virginian-Pilot</a>.</p>
<p>Windsor police were also found to have searched vehicles driven by Black citizens more frequently than those with white drivers despite Black drivers being a minority of the state population, The Virginian-Pilot reported.</p>
<p>Body camera footage from last December showed Caron Nazario, a second lieutenant in the Army, parked at a local gas station with his hands up as <a>two Windsor officers point their guns at him</a>.</p>
<p>After Nazario said he was afraid to exit his vehicle over concerns that the officers might harm him, he was pepper-sprayed.</p>
<p>Nazario filed a lawsuit earlier this year arguing that his constitutional rights were violated during the traffic stop.</p>
<p>Herring, who lost his reelection bid last month to Republican Jason Miyares, is set to leave office on Jan. 15.</p>
<div> <h1>NASCAR's Brandon Brown to be sponsored by LGBcoin in 2022 season</h1> <div> By Cameron Jenkins - 12/30/21 05:53 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Brown announced the partnership with LGBcoin — a cryptocurrency "meme coin" playing off the "Let's Go Brandon" catchphrase — in a tweet on Thursday. </p>
<p>Brown recently told the New York Times that he had "zero desire to be involved in politics," adding: "Our whole navigation is, you want to appeal to everybody, because, all in all, everybody is a consumer.”</p>
<p>A press release announcing the sponsorship deal claimed it will promote "positivity and unity, grounded in a strong belief of the American dream," <a>according to a press release.</a></p>
<a>said they were chanting "Let's go, Brandon."</a>
<p>The chant has since become a wry rallying cry for critics of Biden.</p>
<div> <h1>Hillicon Valley — Tech's big year</h1> <div> By Rebecca Klar,Chris Mills Rodrigo and Maggie Miller - 12/30/21 06:07 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>Happy New Year’s Eve eve! A big year for tech and cybersecurity news is (finally) wrapping up. Celebrate the end of the year with us by taking a look back on some of the most notable moments over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Programming note: Hillicon Valley is taking tomorrow off but will return on Monday.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into the news.</p>
<p> Antitrust starts, stops on Capitol Hill </p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee in June advanced six bills aimed at revamping antitrust laws to target the biggest tech companies in the U.S.</p>
<a>faced roadblocks on both sides of the aisle</a>. Notably, members of the California delegation — even typically solid progressive votes —
<a>pushed back against the bills</a>, which largely target companies based in the Golden State.
<p>In the upper chamber, senators put forward some similar proposals to target the market power of tech giants, but despite numerous hearings in both chambers the proposals have largely stalled. </p>
<p>Meanwhile: The Biden administration signaled it would take a tough stance on antitrust through nominations to key regulatory and advisory positions.</p>

<p> Trump banned on social media</p>
<p>In June the board said an indefinite suspension was not appropriate, leading Facebook to keep Trump's account suspended until at least Jan. 7, 2023 — with the option to let him back on before the next presidential election.</p>

<p><u>A MESSAGE FROM HUAWEI</u></p>
<p> Facebook whistleblower goes to Washington</p>
<p>Facebook had a rocky end to the year in terms of Washington scrutiny and the court of public opinion, largely due to documents leaked by company whistleblower Frances Haugen. </p>
<p>In October, several news outlets published a series of stories based on thousands of internal Facebook documents that Haugen leaked, which painted a picture of a company prioritizing profits and ignoring internal warning signs on safety issues. </p>
<a>dismissed Haugen’s testimony</a> by saying she “had no direct reports” and “never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives.”
<p> Four big takeaways from a tough hearing for Facebook</p>
<p>Facebook papers turn up heat on embattled social media platform</p>
<p> Cyber world rocked by attacks </p>
<p>The vulnerabilities left thousands of organizations exposed and led to the United States and other allied nations formally blaming China for exploiting the vulnerabilities. </p>
<a>JBS USA</a> and IT company Kaseya also served to endanger critical organizations and supply chains.

<div> <h1>Health data suggests South Africa's Omicron peak has passed with no major spike in deaths</h1> <div> By Joseph Choi - 12/30/21 06:55 PM EST </div> </div>
<p>A study out of South Africa found the country may have already passed the peak of it omicron-fueled surge in cases of the coronavirus, with data suggesting the variant has not caused a corresponding jump in hospitalizations and deaths.</p>
<p>The study looked at the rate at which the fourth surge in cases progressed in the South African city of Tshwane, which researchers described as the "global epicentre" of the omicron wave.</p>
<p>The study determined that the wave peaked during the week of Dec. 5, roughly four weeks after an exponential increase in cases was observed.</p>
<p>"It was a flash flood more than a wave," he said.</p>
<p>Abdullah also shared a graph showing the rate of COVID-19 deaths and cases in South Africa over the course of the pandemic and noted the significantly lower peak in deaths when compared to previous peaks.</p>
<p>"Is this hybrid immunity or lower virulence?" Abdullah asked.</p>

<div> <h1>Overnight Health Care — Omicron puts pinch on vaccine mandates</h1> <div> By Nathaniel Weixel - 12/30/21 07:40 PM EST </div> </div>
<p> Omicron hurts Biden vaccine mandate efforts </p>
<p>The rapidly spreading omicron variant poses a problem for the White House as officials try to convince a skeptical public that vaccine mandates are necessary. </p>
<p>Opponents of mandates are seizing on early evidence that shows vaccines are not as effective at stopping transmission of the new strain, which they say undermines the administration's key arguments for championing them. </p>
<p>Administration officials have cast vaccine mandates for health workers, and mandate-or-test requirements for large employers, as essential tools to get more people vaccinated. </p>
<p>More than 85 percent of U.S. adults over the age of 18 have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but overall close to 40 percent of all Americans remain unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Part of the problem: Inconsistent and sometimes fatalistic messaging from the administration.</p>
<p> Biden asks SCOTUS to keep mandate </p>
<h2>bidenjoe_121621ap-evan-vucci.jpg</h2>
<div>On the subject of vaccine mandates... </div>
<p>The Biden administration on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to leave intact a workplace vaccine-or-test mandate as public health officials contend with the surging COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The administration’s brief, filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ), comes in response to a legal challenge brought by interest groups and employers across the country who allege the health measure is an unlawful exercise of government power.</p>
<p>The central question in the case is whether Congress gave the executive branch the broad authority to impose such a sweeping workplace regulation, which applies to businesses with 100 or more workers.</p>
<p>To date, more than 820,000 people have died in the U.S. as a result of the global pandemic. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show unvaccinated people are 14 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Challengers to the mandate have asked the justices to block the policy while the case proceeds through the lower courts, or take up a formal appeal of a federal appeals court ruling that preliminarily sustained the mandate.</p>
<p>STUDY: MOST CHILDREN SERIOUSLY ILL WITH COVID NOT FULLY VACCINATED</p>
<p>Only a small fraction of children hospitalized for COVID-19 have been fully vaccinated, according to a report released Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>The CDC said that 0.4 percent of children and adolescents admitted to six hospitals during July and August with serious COVID-19 infections were fully vaccinated. </p>
<p><u>CDC SAYS AVOID CRUISE SHIPS REGARDLESS OF VACCINATION STATUS</u></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised Americans to avoid traveling by cruise ships regardless of their vaccination status amid a global surge of coronavirus cases. </p>
<p><a>In a statement</a> released Thursday, the health agency’s COVID-19 Travel Health Notice updated the warning from level 3 to level 4, which is the health agency’s highest level of warning. </p>
<p>The agency said even people who are vaccinated and boosted are at risk of spreading the virus onboard. </p>
<p>The CDC also recommended that those who have traveled on a cruise ship who are not vaccinated get vaccinated and receive their booster shot if eligible. </p>
<p>Cruise lines reported 5,013 COVID-19 infections on ships operating in U.S. waters between Dec. 15 and 29, according to CDC data, a significant increase from the 162 cases reported over the prior two weeks.</p>
<p>Many cruise lines have implemented vaccine requirements, and ships have put in place mask rules for common areas as omicron has spread. </p>
<p>Jury finds company liable for NY opioid crisis </p>
<p>A jury on Thursday found drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals liable for fueling the opioid crisis in New York.</p>
<p>Initially, the New York attorney general filed suit against six manufacturers as well as the largest distributors in the country. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was the first of its kind to target companies that made the drugs along with distributors and pharmacies that filled prescriptions. It was argued jointly by the state as well as Suffolk and Nassau counties. </p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said other settlements from manufacturers and distributors have netted about $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Teva in a statement said it would "swiftly" appeal the verdict.</p>
<p>The jury did not award damages, that amount will be decided at a later date. </p>
