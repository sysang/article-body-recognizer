<a>Kyrsten Sinema</a> (D-Ariz.) and other Democrats on the tax section late last week, our Burgess Everett reports — as he tries to make good “
<a>on his repeated vows</a> to finish work on the climate and social policy legislation in the next two weeks.”
<p>And on a related note: Democrats are <a>really hanging their hopes</a> on the year-end expiration of the expanded Child Tax Credit spurring some action, as Sarah Ferris and Marianne LeVine noted. </p>
<p>The big question there: Lawmakers do love a deadline to force them to act. But Manchin has sounded at times ambivalent about the monthly payments of up to $300 per child, so will that be enough to get him on board this month?</p>
<p><b>MORE ON THAT IN A BIT, </b>but first thanks for joining the “this is all for 2021 version” of Morning Tax. </p>
<a>an unsavory reputation</a>.”)
<p>You have our permission to spoil this newsletter with scoops.</p>
<p><b>BACK TO MANCHIN: </b>It’s not as if there’s been any shortage of focus on the West Virginia Democrat throughout this whole process. But if possible, that might have only intensified in recent days. </p>
<p>And in fact, the Republican who requested the CBO report, Sen. <a>Lindsey Graham</a> of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that Manchin suggested that he ask for the estimate. </p>
<p>Not only that: Graham used his time on the show to openly lobby Manchin to oppose the bill. “Joe Manchin, if you're watching, you were right, Joe. You got this right. It is a lie,” he said.</p>
<p><b>THE LATEST FROM FINANCE: </b>Wyden <a>dropped some tweaks</a> to the social spending measure’s tax provisions on Saturday — the biggest probably being a carveout for pensions in the proposed corporate minimum tax.</p>
<p>Any income increases that big corporations get from the growing value of the pension plans they offer would essentially be exempt from the corporate book tax, under the Democrats’ latest proposal.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats have been trying to limit the amount of changes they make to the tax section of the BBB, even though the measure was always bound to need another vote in the House if and when it passes the Senate. </p>
<p>Some clean energy advocates also lobbied to ensure that their projects weren’t hurt by the book tax’s limits on quicker write-offs for investments, but Wyden — a champion for clean energy incentives — has so far brushed aside those efforts.</p>
<p>Among the other changes over the weekend, via Pro Tax’s Brian Faler: Wyden loosened proposed restrictions on writing off business interest, in exchange for expanding the reach of anti-inversion rules. </p>
<p>Tax provisions aren’t supposed to be among the most hot-button issues before the parliamentarian this week — think matters like immigration there. But we have some ideas about proposals that could be in the crosshairs. </p>
<p>The big question on both of those would seem to be whether the proposals’ budgetary impact is, in Senate parlance, a “merely incidental” part of the provision. </p>
<p><b>As we were saying: </b>“Canada <a>threatens U.S. with retaliatory tariffs</a> in EV tax credit dispute,” via our Zi-Ann Lum.</p>
<p><a>That was the case</a> that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made to Democrats late last week, as our Laura Barron-Lopez reported. </p>
<p>But with that in mind, it can be useful to know just how much in offsets Democrats would need to find to keep extending the benefits in the Build Back Better measure. </p>
<p>To put that another way: Who knows what the composition of future Congresses will look like, but let’s not forget how difficult it has been for Democrats to cobble together tax increases this year.</p>
<p>Sen. <a>Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minn.) got into that issue on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, in the process bringing up one of the tax hikes that ended up getting vetoed by Sinema — increasing the corporate rate from 21 percent to 25 percent.</p>
<p>“Every point you bring it up, if you brought it up to, say, 25 percent, that's $400 billion,” Klobuchar said. “That's still on the table. So, why do I bring that up, is that there are still ways to pay for things going forward.”</p>

<p>— Like delinquent holiday shoppers, a number of states are scrambling to beat congressional redistricting deadlines over the next two weeks. We have a full rundown of what to expect, and what’s at stake.</p>
<p>— Democrats are increasingly bearish on 2022 — and aren’t planning on blowing up their 2024 primary calendar.</p>
<p>— Another Democratic retirement appears imminent: Rep. Albio Sires (D-N.J.) is reportedly hanging ‘em up next year, and the apparent frontrunner to replace him has a familiar name.</p>

<p><b>THE MAP LINES — It’s crunch time across the country</b> — not just to get those gifts in time for Christmas morning, but also for states with end-of-year deadlines to finalize their new congressional maps. Here’s a rundown of the latest action:</p>
<a>Associated Press’ Bob Christie</a> noted, “even with the changes made by the commission Friday, Democratic seats held by Reps. Tom O'Halleran and [Ann] Kirkpatrick, who had previously announced she planned to retire, could flip.”
<b>Virginia: The public-comment deadline for the special master-drawn maps</b> released earlier this month is 1 p.m. this afternoon, following twin hearings last week.
<a>The Associated Press</a> reported that many speakers “raised concerns about Richmond and its suburbs being carved into three congressional districts.” Rep.

<p>— The Biden administration talked a big game in addressing climate change, but the legislative path forward is still as shaky as ever.</p>
<p>— Republicans are offering some common ground on climate legislation, but it'll likely not be enough to satisfy Democrats' climate goals.</p>
<p>— FERC's decisions on a Texas LNG project could have major implications for future CCS projects.</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a lot of skepticism about that if none of this can be salvaged," John Podesta, who led climate efforts in President Barack Obama’s White House, told ME.</p>
<p>“We really need to keep that whole-of-government approach alive and really lean into that,” he said.</p>

<p>— For Deb Haaland, Santa will get back to you in, uh, early summer.</p>
<p>— For Jennifer Granholm, a brand new high-flow showerhead to extinguish her hair on fire. </p>
<p>— For the Supreme Court, a request from all environmental reporters to please, please not rule on the scope of EPA’s climate authority 10 minutes before ruling on abortion rights.</p>
<p>— For Andrew Wheeler, a set of quality reusable shopping bags.</p>
<p>— For Tom Carper, an “RIP” locket with his 2001 Town Country minivan on one side and the Clean Electricity Performance Program on the other.</p>
<p>— For John Kerry, a lump of coal that won’t get phased out.</p>

<p>The agency is expected to finalize the rules before the end of 2022. It’s likely to be more than a few years before EPA’s regulations take a bite into methane emissions, so current energy prices aren’t especially relevant. </p>
<a>Nanette Barragán</a>, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Climate Change Task Force,
<b>ICYMI: CAR EMISSIONS, ROUND 2:</b> The Biden administration this week quietly finalized a Department of Transportation rule
<a>repealing a Trump-era decision</a> that had blocked California and other states from setting vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government’s. The move came the same week that EPA also
<a>finalized more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles</a> — the sector responsible for the largest share of climate-warming gases.
<b>Still to come: </b>The Biden administration last week
<a>asked Friot for its own injunction</a> against Oklahoma to stop the state from implementing mining clean-up oversight on the affected lands — and given Friot’s ruling here, OSM may be well placed for a win. The state has until Jan. 24 to respond.

<p><span><b>— Chicken marketed as friendlier for the climate is about to hit grocery stores,</b></span><b> </b>as the Agriculture Department is mulling what climate-smart commodities could look like in the future.</p>
<span><b>— Consumer price index data show food prices continue to rise —</b></span>
<b> </b>and the Biden administration continues to blame dominant meat processing companies. The White House also defended its work to ease supply chain congestion, including for farm goods, amid GOP attacks.
<p><span><b>— President Joe Biden took aim at Kellogg’s plans to replace striking workers,</b></span><b> </b>the latest case of the administration siding strongly with employees in recent labor disputes.</p>
<b>CLIMATE-FRIENDLY CHICKEN IS HERE: </b>Environmentally conscious consumers will soon be able to buy “carbon-reduced” chicken that’s partially raised on food waste diverted from grocery stores.
<a>Do Good Chicken</a>, which launches at major national retailers in February, is a sign of things to come as the food industry increasingly grapples with consumer concern about the climate crisis.
<b>New co. in the barnyard:</b> In this case, the product comes from Do Good Foods, a startup with
<a>substantial financial backing</a> and working with some of the most well-known names in food. Last week, founders
<b>Justin and Matt Kamine</b> held a Food Tank event with
<b>Sam Kass</b>, who served as nutrition policy advisor to former President Barack Obama and is now chief strategy officer for the company, as well as former Agriculture Secretary
<b> Ann Veneman</b>, who’s advising the company, and
<b>Tom Colicchio</b>, a well-known chef and advocate, who said he looked forward to serving the chicken at his restaurants.
<p>“We think we can convert the vast majority of retail food waste in the next five to 10 years,” Kass tells MA.</p>
<b>Two quick examples:</b> Horizon Organic dairy is now on the market with claims it will be “
<a>carbon positive” by 2025</a> (meaning beyond net-zero emissions). Cascadian Farms is also on the market with
<a>“climate-smart” cereal made with Kernza</a>, a perennial grain that helps sequester more carbon.
<p><b>FOOD COSTS ON THE UP AND UP? </b>Food prices remain high, with at-home prices up 6.4 percent for the 12 months ending in November compared with 2020, and away-from-home prices up 5.8 percent, according to the latest consumer price index data.</p>
<p><b>The biggest contributor? Meat.</b> Beef prices increased nearly 21 percent from the year ending in November. And in one month, from October to November, pork prices jumped 2.2 percent, <a>reports POLITICO’s Hannah Farrow</a>.</p>
<p><b>Blaming big meatpackers: </b>The White House attributes rising meat prices to “dominant corporations in uncompetitive markets,” where “just four large conglomerates control approximately 55-85 percent of the market for pork, beef and poultry.”</p>
<p>The gross profits of the four largest meatpackers have “increased by more than 120 percent since before the pandemic, and their net income has surged by 500 percent,” according to <a>a White House analysis</a> released Friday.</p>
<b>What USDA is doing about it:</b> The department is offering financial support for small meat processors, including about $1 billion now available through its
<a>loan guarantee program</a>. The administration
<a>has also pledged</a> to “crack down on illegal price fixing, enforce antitrust laws and bring more transparency to the meat-processing industry.
<b>WHITE HOUSE TOUTS ‘COST CUTTING’ EFFORTS: </b>In
<a>social spending package</a>, which passed the House and is under negotiation in the Senate. Majority Leader
<a>Chuck Schumer</a> (D-N.Y.) is aiming to pass the bill by Christmas — but the calendar is shrinking.
<p><b>The GOP’s own campaign: </b>Republicans, meanwhile, are shelling out millions of dollars on ad campaigns in key 2022 Senate battlegrounds, warning voters that inflation is “killing us,” <a>reports POLITICO’s Burgess Everett</a>.</p>
<p><b>For context: </b>Consumer prices in general are rising at record rates, fueling the GOP attacks against Biden’s policies. <a>POLITICO’s Ben White explains</a>.</p>
<p><b>BIDEN CALLS OUT KELLOGG: </b>The president made a rare interlude Friday into employer-employee relations when he condemned Kellogg Co.’s plans to permanently replace striking workers at the company’s cereal plants.</p>
<p>“I am deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg’s plans to permanently replace striking workers,” <a>Biden said in a statement</a>, adding that such a move amounts to “an existential attack on the union and its members’ jobs and livelihoods.”</p>
<a>infrastructure package</a>, alongside Democratic Sen.
<p><b>Vilsack announced a new $1.2 million grant for OSU</b> to work on a robotic irrigation project. He touted the project as beneficial for the environment, especially out West.</p>
<p><b>NO DATE YET FOR AG-TRADE NOMINATION HEARING: </b>It looks increasingly likely that the Senate Finance Committee won’t hold a hearing until early 2022 on the nomination of Elaine Trevino to be chief U.S. agricultural negotiator.</p>

<p><span><b>— Chicken marketed as friendlier for the climate is about to hit grocery stores,</b></span><b> </b>as the Agriculture Department is mulling what climate-smart commodities could look like in the future.</p>
<span><b>— Consumer price index data show food prices continue to rise —</b></span>
<b> </b>and the Biden administration continues to blame dominant meat processing companies. The White House also defended its work to ease supply chain congestion, including for farm goods, amid GOP attacks.
<p><span><b>— President Joe Biden took aim at Kellogg’s plans to replace striking workers,</b></span><b> </b>the latest case of the administration siding strongly with employees in recent labor disputes.</p>
<b>CLIMATE-FRIENDLY CHICKEN IS HERE: </b>Environmentally conscious consumers will soon be able to buy “carbon-reduced” chicken that’s partially raised on food waste diverted from grocery stores.
<a>Do Good Chicken</a>, which launches at major national retailers in February, is a sign of things to come as the food industry increasingly grapples with consumer concern about the climate crisis.
<b>New co. in the barnyard:</b> In this case, the product comes from Do Good Foods, a startup with
<a>substantial financial backing</a> and working with some of the most well-known names in food. Last week, founders
<b>Justin and Matt Kamine</b> held a Food Tank event with
<b>Sam Kass</b>, who served as nutrition policy advisor to former President Barack Obama and is now chief strategy officer for the company, as well as former Agriculture Secretary
<b> Ann Veneman</b>, who’s advising the company, and
<b>Tom Colicchio</b>, a well-known chef and advocate, who said he looked forward to serving the chicken at his restaurants.
<p>“We think we can convert the vast majority of retail food waste in the next five to 10 years,” Kass tells MA.</p>
<b>Two quick examples:</b> Horizon Organic dairy is now on the market with claims it will be “
<a>carbon positive” by 2025</a> (meaning beyond net-zero emissions). Cascadian Farms is also on the market with
<a>“climate-smart” cereal made with Kernza</a>, a perennial grain that helps sequester more carbon.
<p><b>FOOD COSTS ON THE UP AND UP? </b>Food prices remain high, with at-home prices up 6.4 percent for the 12 months ending in November compared with 2020, and away-from-home prices up 5.8 percent, according to the latest consumer price index data.</p>
<p><b>The biggest contributor? Meat.</b> Beef prices increased nearly 21 percent from the year ending in November. And in one month, from October to November, pork prices jumped 2.2 percent, <a>reports POLITICO’s Hannah Farrow</a>.</p>
<p><b>Blaming big meatpackers: </b>The White House attributes rising meat prices to “dominant corporations in uncompetitive markets,” where “just four large conglomerates control approximately 55-85 percent of the market for pork, beef and poultry.”</p>
<p>The gross profits of the four largest meatpackers have “increased by more than 120 percent since before the pandemic, and their net income has surged by 500 percent,” according to <a>a White House analysis</a> released Friday.</p>
<b>What USDA is doing about it:</b> The department is offering financial support for small meat processors, including about $1 billion now available through its
<a>loan guarantee program</a>. The administration
<a>has also pledged</a> to “crack down on illegal price fixing, enforce antitrust laws and bring more transparency to the meat-processing industry.
<b>WHITE HOUSE TOUTS ‘COST CUTTING’ EFFORTS: </b>In
<a>social spending package</a>, which passed the House and is under negotiation in the Senate. Majority Leader
<a>Chuck Schumer</a> (D-N.Y.) is aiming to pass the bill by Christmas — but the calendar is shrinking.
<p><b>The GOP’s own campaign: </b>Republicans, meanwhile, are shelling out millions of dollars on ad campaigns in key 2022 Senate battlegrounds, warning voters that inflation is “killing us,” <a>reports POLITICO’s Burgess Everett</a>.</p>
<p><b>For context: </b>Consumer prices in general are rising at record rates, fueling the GOP attacks against Biden’s policies. <a>POLITICO’s Ben White explains</a>.</p>
<p><b>BIDEN CALLS OUT KELLOGG: </b>The president made a rare interlude Friday into employer-employee relations when he condemned Kellogg Co.’s plans to permanently replace striking workers at the company’s cereal plants.</p>
<p>“I am deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg’s plans to permanently replace striking workers,” <a>Biden said in a statement</a>, adding that such a move amounts to “an existential attack on the union and its members’ jobs and livelihoods.”</p>

<p><b>Vilsack announced a new $1.2 million grant for OSU</b> to work on a robotic irrigation project. He touted the project as beneficial for the environment, especially out West.</p>
<p><b>NO DATE YET FOR AG-TRADE NOMINATION HEARING: </b>It looks increasingly likely that the Senate Finance Committee won’t hold a hearing until early 2022 on the nomination of Elaine Trevino to be chief U.S. agricultural negotiator.</p>
<p><b>As of Friday,</b> the panel was “still processing her paperwork and materials while it does its due diligence review,” a committee spokesperson said. </p>
