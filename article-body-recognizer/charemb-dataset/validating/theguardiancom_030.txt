<a>healthcare group Vectura</a>, didn’t see the point in competing with Philip Morris’ deep pockets and said it wouldn’t improve its second-placed offer. The auctioneer’s gavel was not required.
<a>Morrisons</a> with a chain of petrol stations it owns. Really, though, it’s hard to call a clear favourite in the contest.
<p>The way <a>Smiths Group</a> told the tale a month ago, the FTSE 100 engineering group had scoured the globe and considered multiple offers, as it sought a sale of its misfit medical devices division.</p>
<p>It turned out my record indicated I had granted power of attorney to another person. I certainly had not, and NSI call handlers admit they have no evidence. I was variously told “human error, or a technical problem” must be to blame.</p>
<p>I now don’t have 100% confidence that my investments are safe.</p>
<p>Luckily that turns out not to be the case. NSI’s investigation has since established that following a systems update an incorrect marker was tagged on the account which suggested that you had a power of attorney.</p>
<p>However, no third party was ever connected to the account, and no fraudulent activity took place. You have now received an official apology and £75 in goodwill.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for NSI said: ‘We monitor the performance of our staff to ensure that their work is of a high and accurate standard and take appropriate action if these standards are not met.’</p>
<p>Banks need to do more to treat people fairly when they are the victim of scams, according to the UK financial sector’s official complaints body, which is finding in the customer’s favour in three-quarters of such cases.</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service said the number of people asking it for help with fraud and scam problems was up 66% in the period 1 April to 30 June, compared with the same three months in 2020.</p>
<p>Over that period 60% of fraud and scam complaints were upheld in favour of the consumer, compared with 50% the previous year.</p>
<a>authorised push payment</a> fraud – which often involves email accounts being hacked – the ombudsman upheld three-quarters in customers’ favour.
<p>A spokesperson said these figures “suggest that banks and other financial institutions still need to do more to resolve complaints from their customers fairly before people are forced to seek help from the Financial Ombudsman Service”.</p>
<p>Cases looked at by the ombudsman included fraudsters posing as a customer’s bank and convincing them to move their money to a fake “safe account”, and shoppers paying for goods that never arrive.</p>
<p>The data also revealed there had been an increase in complaints about cryptocurrencies during the pandemic, which appeared to have been driven in part by scam investments advertised on social media.</p>
<p>While cryptocurrencies are unregulated investments, and are therefore for the most part are outside the ombudsman’s remit, it can look into complaints about banks refusing to reimburse people who feel they have been a victim of a fraud or scam.</p>
<p>It said anecdotal evidence suggested the increase in cryptocurrency complaints could be linked to young people wanting to make extra cash while furloughed or simply spending more time online.</p>
<p>The figures showed that nearly a third (29%) of students were prepared to risk allowing a third party to use their current account or transfer money for someone.</p>
<p>Technology, telecoms and social media companies should take more responsibility for stopping scams as the problem reaches “epidemic proportions”, the UK’s biggest building society has warned.</p>
<a>losses from such scams were up by 71%</a> in the first half of the year.
<p>In many of these, customers are persuaded that their account has been compromised, or that they are buying into a good investment, and are asked to transfer cash into an account elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nationwide said that every day it was supporting customers who had fallen victim to a scam. The society’s economic crime director, Stuart Skinner, said: “We’re at epidemic proportions – for my team, the majority of their time is spent on scams.”</p>
<p>The society has launched a scam checker service, where members can call at any time of day or night to talk about whether a potential payment is legitimate.</p>
<p>The details of the phone line will appear in various places, including on-screen during online payments.</p>
<p>The society said it hoped that by offering the service it could make people stop and think before making payments.</p>
<p>Whether you are on the brink of retirement or have years to go, there are things you can do now to generate a larger post-work income.</p>
<p>Increasing the sum you pay into your pension each month is the most straightforward way to boost your fund – and can be especially lucrative if your employer is willing to match some of your extra contributions.</p>
<p>Bringing together several small pensions makes it easier to keep track of them. You may also be able to cut the fees you pay at the same time.</p>
<h2>Maximise your state pension</h2>
<p>People reaching pension age after April 2016 who are not on track for the full state payment can make top-ups relatively cheaply, says Steve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP.</p>
<a>lots of women have been short-changed</a>.
<h2>Switch to more risky funds</h2>
<p>“In general, the more risk you are prepared to take, the higher return you can expect to get over the long run,” Webb says. “Though you need to be able to cope with the fact that there may be periods when your investment goes down as well as up.”</p>
<h2>Take advice on how to use it on retirement</h2>
<p>If you go for an annuity – a contract offering to pay you an income in exchange for your fund – you should shop around. “Even if you don’t take advice, an annuity supermarket or broker can help you get the best product,” Webb says.</p>
<p>A “world first” green savings bond from National Savings and <a>Investments</a> (NSI) goes on sale today, giving people the chance to back the government’s environmental projects and join the fight against climate breakdown.</p>
<p>But at 0.65% fixed for three years, the interest rate prompted widespread disappointment, with the MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis labelling it “pants” and “paltry”.</p>
<p>The new bonds can be bought online from today – just days ahead of the <a>Cop26 climate summit</a> – and will be on sale for at least three months.</p>
<p>The money invested will help finance green projects chosen by the government, which could include zero-emission buses, offshore windfarms and flood defences, and tree-planting and environmentally sustainable farming schemes. </p>
<p>The bonds, announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the spring budget, have a minimum investment of £100 and a maximum of £100,000. Savers’ cash cannot be withdrawn during the three years. </p>
<p>The Treasury said it was the world’s first green savings product from a sovereign issuer. With NSI, the government-backed organisation that offers premium bonds and other products, 100% of people’s money is guaranteed by the Treasury.</p>
<a>UK interest rates could rise</a> before Christmas and could hit 1% by next summer, savers may not rush to lock away their money for three years at just 0.65%.
<p>Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the rate was “such a disappointment”, and that NSI was relying on savers who were willing to pay a price for going green with their savings.</p>
<p>She added: “You can get 0.65% on an easy access account (with limited withdrawals) from Coventry building society, so it’s easy to wonder why you’d bother tying your cash up for three years for the same return.”</p>
<p>So how might a rise in interest rates affect you?</p>
<p>David Hollingworth of LC Mortgages says that a family with a £200,000 mortgage over 20 years, with a variable interest rate at 3.59%, will pay an additional £15 a month if the rate goes up by 0.15%, as it is expected to next month.</p>
<p>While fixed rates are still very competitive, says Hollingworth, some of the lowest offers may soon disappear.</p>
<p>Borrowers who want to take advantage of the low fixed rates still have time. If you are still tied into a deal, an application for a new product may secure the rate for up to six months.</p>
<p>“It is normally best to fix and fix long if you don’t expect to move again soon. It will cost more, but think of it as taking out insurance against future interest-rate rises,” says Williams.</p>
<p>Savers could be forgiven for hoping that a rise in interest rates will result in them finally earning some money after a prolonged period of rock-bottom returns. The reality may be more frustrating, however.</p>
<p>Typically, it takes banks longer to pass on the changes in rates to savers than it does to people who owe them money. Laura Suter of investment firm AJ Bell says the banks are also unlikely to pass on the full rise.</p>
<p>At a time when other household bills are going up, those with debts on high rates of interest such as credit cards, loans and overdrafts could be badly affected by rate rises, says Jason Hollands of financial advisers Bestinvest.</p>
<h2>Invest some of your savings</h2>
<p>The Climate Assets Fund from the investment firm Quilter Cheviot is another fund that Lipski says could beat inflation – it invests in businesses working on environmental technologies.</p>
<p>The Bank of England keeps a close eye on inflation – <a>it is tasked with making sure it stays at 2%</a> and if it looks like it is out of control, it will act. When inflation is rising, that means it will consider increasing interest rates.</p>
<p>If you have six months or less left on your current deal, you may be able to lock into a new one.</p>
<p>According to research published in the summer, employers are planning to give workers an <a>average pay rise of 2.9% next year</a> – that’s slightly lower than inflation has been over the past two months.</p>
<p>Unions are likely to use the inflation figures to argue for better pay for their members, and employers in shortage industries will already be considering higher wages to attract staff. But if you are at a smaller organisation you may need to ask.</p>
<p>Coles suggests: “If your employer is currently recruiting, check the pay on offer, which could be a useful way of opening a conversation with your employer about a pay rise.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, look at comparable jobs with other employers – if these advertise higher wages, you may be able to use them as evidence that you should get more.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics has a <a>calculator</a> that will show you how much you would need for your earnings to keep up with inflation.</p>
<h2>Index-link your pension income</h2>
<h2>Don’t put off big purchases</h2>
<p>If you invested £50 a month for 10 years and enjoyed a 3.9% return, you would end up with £7,348, according to investment firm Fidelity. That’s growth of £1,348 on your contributions. Carry on for 20 years and your profit rises to £6,193.</p>
<p>Before choosing where to put your money, decide on your risk profile. In other words: how comfortable are you with seeing the value of your investments fall?</p>
<a>Wealthify</a>, and sustainable investment provider
<p>Investing a small amount every month is a great way to get started. You could, say, kick off with £25 a month into a single fund, although some providers will accept contributions from as little as £1.</p>
<p>Regular investing will help to iron out the highs and lows of the market. You buy more shares when the stock market is performing poorly and the price is lower, and fewer when their value rises. </p>
<p>Rather than buying shares in individual companies, funds are a good option for beginners. They hold a range of different companies, so you don’t have all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>“When it comes to choosing funds, I think of personal investors in three broad camps: ‘choose for me’, ‘help me choose’ and ‘I’ll choose myself’,” says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International.</p>
<p>Many investment websites offer best-buy fund lists put together by experts, including Hargreaves Lansdown’s <a>Wealth Shortlist</a>, and Interactive Investor’s <a>Super 60</a>.</p>
<p>Active funds are usually more expensive as they have a manager who chooses the shares they hold, aiming to beat the market.</p>
<p>You can pick from thousands of funds, such as those focusing on, for example, sustainable investments, smaller companies or emerging markets.</p>
<p>Holding a range of funds spreads your money and protects you from market falls. If one company falls in value, hopefully another will rise.</p>
<p>If you don’t know where to start, you could go for a single, ready-made fund that holds investments from around the world.</p>
<p>Watch out for fees, as these can really eat into your returns. Investment providers either charge a percentage fee, based on how much you invest, or a fixed fee.</p>
<p>If you are investing a larger lump sum, you will be better off with Interactive Investor, which charges £9.99 a month, including one free trade a month, she adds. As your investment grows, charges stay the same with a flat fee.</p>
<p>Wrapping your investments in a stocks and shares Isa means you won’t pay tax on profits, or need to include them on your tax return.</p>
<p>Investing can be a bumpy ride, but it generally pays to hold your nerve. You need a time frame of at least five years, ideally far longer.</p>
<p>If you can sit tight through market falls your investments may bounce back and go on to be worth more.</p>
<p>If you want further help before investing, seek assistance from a financial adviser, but you will need to pay. You can find one local to you online on <a>Unbiased</a> or <a>VouchedFor</a>.</p>
<p>A much-anticipated <a>Christmas spending</a> spree is unlikely to materialise despite consumers having around £150bn of savings on deposit to splash on toys, food and festive parties, economists have warned.</p>
<p>According to a study by the <a>Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, much of the savings built up during the pandemic will remain in household bank accounts until the economic outlook is more upbeat.</p>
<p>A survey that formed part of the analysis for the report found that when people were asked what they would do with an extra £500, they said on average that only £55 would be spent over the next three months.</p>
<p>Richer households were more likely than poorer households to report they would use the extra funds to add to their savings, the IFS said. Poorer households were more likely than richer households to report they would use them to reduce their debts.</p>
<p>With only two weeks until shoppers seek online bargains on Black Friday, the IFS said shoppers would keep the spending taps open, but would be more circumspect about running down savings.</p>
<p>Households deposited an additional £9.4bn with banks and building societies in September compared with an average of £8.9bn between April and August.</p>
<p>To capitalise on the expected surge in spending, companies have ramped up their <a>Christmas advertising</a> on social media, TV, newspapers and magazines to record levels.</p>
<p><a>Policymakers at the central bank have forecast a rise in inflation to 5%</a> by next spring and a slowdown in GDP growth linked to supply chain issues, such as the hold-ups of vital components for industry from abroad and labour shortages.</p>
<p>The IFS, which was funded by the Nuffield Foundation to carry out the research, said the composition of spending was also crucial after a bounce back in the sale of goods to levels higher than before the pandemic. </p>
<p>It said the sharp increase meant there was little room for any more explosive growth.</p>
<ul><li><a>Consumer spending</a></li></ul>
<p>The government’s green bond promises savers they will be able to “make the world greener, cleaner and more sustainable”. But what they won’t make is a return on their investment that beats other options on the market.</p>
<p>However, the return on your investment is just 0.65%, fixed for three years – a figure dubbed as “paltry” by the opposition and analysts.</p>
<p>The green savings bond was announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak in the spring budget and went on sale at the end of October. Savers can invest from £100 and up to £100,000. The money cannot be withdrawn for three years.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed by the Treasury, which means all of the investment is protected. Under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), customers of financial services firms are protected for up to £85,000 is the firm goes bust.</p>
<p>The fixed 0.65% rate means that someone who invests £10,000 will earn £65 a year in interest.</p>
<p>Anna Bowes of Savings Champion says the NSI bond is not for those who are solely looking for a return on their investment, especially at a time when interest rates are expected to rise and inflation is high.</p>
<p>Sarah Coles of Hargreaves Lansdown says that as interest rates are expected to rise in the near future, “we can expect fixed rates to keep climbing and 0.65% to look even less attractive by comparison”.</p>
<p>But the low rate will not turn off all investors, especially those who are committed to using their money for sustainable objectives.</p>
<p>“For those who just want to know their money is a part of the solution, who want to park it somewhere safe and are really not bothered about real rates of return, then it might still be attractive,” says Rebecca O’Connor of Interactive Investor.</p>
<p>Halifax has cut the interest rate it pays on its Kids’ Saver account, despite expectations of an <a>imminent increase</a> in the Bank of England base rate.</p>
<p>Savers into the account will have their returns cut from 1.45% to 1% on savings up to £5,000. On balances above that the account will continue to pay 0.01%,</p>
<p>The change has already come into effect for new customers and existing accountholders will have their returns cut from 25 January 2022.</p>
<p>Halifax says the change follows regular reviews of its products, and that customers can get a higher rate on some of its other products.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said: “We have written to customers with Kids’ Saver accounts to let them know their rate will be changing.</p>
<p>Monthly savings accounts do typically offer higher rates than those available on instant access, but requite a regular commitment to save and the headline interest rate is earned only on the early contributions.</p>

<p>UK homeowners made a rare net repayment of mortgage debt in July as the tapering of the stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland fuelled a drop in housing market activity after a record June.</p>
<p>The <a>Bank of England</a> said individuals collectively paid back £1.4bn more of mortgage debt than they borrowed, in the first net repayment since the housing market ground to a halt during the first wave of Covid-19 in April 2020.</p>
<p>Threadneedle Street said it was only the second net repayment in a decade, and followed record borrowing of £17.7bn in June in the final month of the full stamp duty holiday tax break in England and Northern Ireland.</p>
<a>House sales across the UK have tumbled since June</a> after a rush by consumers to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday. Figures from HMRC show
<a>a record surge in activity in June</a>, when 213,370 UK homes changed hands, was followed by a slump in July as transactions collapsed by 62% to 82,110.
<p>Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said there had been an “unusually dramatic pause” in the housing market since the end of the full tax break.</p>
<p>“The stamp duty holiday encouraged people to bring their property purchases forward, so the market was always going to pause for breath when it ended,” she said. </p>
<p>A surge in spending on leisure, entertainment and eating out in the UK made the August bank holiday the busiest for consumer activity since the pre-pandemic Christmas of 2019, Barclaycard has said.</p>
<p>Figures from the card payment company show individuals were undeterred by weather that felt like autumn and rising Covid-19 infections, with transactions 14.4% up on the same long weekend in 2020 and 9.4% higher than in 2019.</p>
<p>Office for National Statistics data had indicated a <a>levelling off</a> in credit and debit card spending, which some analysts attributed to a more cautious mood among consumers after the spread of the Delta variant.</p>
<p>“The sectors where we’ve witnessed particularly strong growth – leisure and entertainment, and food and drink – demonstrate that consumers certainly haven’t lost their appetite for a celebration.”</p>
<p>In the leisure and entertainment sector, transaction volumes were up 37.2 % compared with last year, and were 26.8% higher than in 2019.</p>
<p>Barclaycard said there had also been growth in the food and drink sector – which was boosted last year by the government’s eat out to help out discounts. Activity was up by 20.3% on 2020 and by 14.5% on the August bank holiday in 2019.</p>
<ul><li><a>Consumer spending</a></li></ul>
<p>Jump in August to a nine-year high of 3.2% will have an impact on pay packets and savings</p>
<a>expected annual price rises to hit 4%</a> before the year was out, before dropping off slightly.
<h2>Why is August’s figure so high?</h2>
<a>Office for National Statistics</a>, which publishes the figures, said higher prices in transport, restaurants, hotels and for food and drink had driven the rate up in August.
<a>higher than at any time since 2013</a>.
<h2>What if you are saving?</h2>
<p>If high levels of inflation stay for longer than anticipated, the Bank may raise interest rates, which would be good news for those with cash on deposit.</p>
<h2>What if you are borrowing?</h2>
<p>And inflation reduces the size of your debt in real terms. If it leads to a pay rise, then the sum you need to repay each month will be less of your income than when you first took on the loan.</p>
<h2>What about student loans?</h2>
<h2>And pensions and other benefits?</h2>
<p>A number of benefits are linked to inflation, including the state pension. The <a>government suspended the pensions “triple lock” last week</a>, but committed to raising pension payments in line with CPI if September’s figure is above 2.5%.</p>
<p>September’s figure determines how much elements of universal credit and other benefits will go up next April, so they should keep up with rising costs. However, before then the temporary £20-a-week <a>universal credit uplift will have ended</a>.</p>
<p>Some private pensions offer payments linked to inflation, so payouts should increase.</p>
<ul><li><a>Inflation</a></li></ul>
<p>The digital bank Monzo is muscling in on the UK’s booming “buy now, pay later” market and will be offering its customers credit limits of up to £3,000.</p>
<p>Monzo is one of the first UK banks to launch into the fast-growing but controversial BNPL sector, which is dominated by financial technology companies such as the industry leader <a>Klarna</a> and <a>PayPal</a>.</p>
<p>Monzo, which has more than 5 million customers, said it had taken the “best bits” of BNPL, credit cards, loans and overdrafts to create its Monzo Flex product, which it is introducing from Thursday.</p>
<p>BNPL credit allows customers to stagger payments for goods such as clothes, beauty items and furniture with no interest or fees – unless they fail to pay back on time, in which case some firms will impose late fees.</p>
<p>Customers can also opt to pay in six and 12 instalments, but with these options they pay interest at 19% APR.</p>
<p>Last week, Goldman Sachs spent $2.2bn (£1.6bn ) to acquire GreenSky, a BNPL fintech focused on spreading the cost of home improvement loans rather than retail.</p>
<p>“The issue is the checkout button. That’s the hippy crack of the industry. It’s the button where somebody can pay and leave the checkout without spending any money up front.</p>
<p>Boohoo said the average customer spend per item using BNPL on its website was “relatively low”, at £11.96. “Like virtually every other retailer in the UK, our website offers a range of payment options to suit the needs of our customers.”</p>
<p>Ronan Dunphy, a banking analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said the regulators’ approach will be a critical determinant of how large the market could get.</p>
<a>over 10 million users</a>” in 2020.
<a>spending will reach $995bn</a> in five years’ time, almost four times the current figure.
<p>Up until now the focus has mainly been on occasional fashion and beauty purchases, and the average amounts borrowed are often relatively small – £65-£75 per transaction, according to the FCA. </p>
<p>But regulated banks have another concern on the horizon: how BNPL may be diverting income from other revenue streams such as credit cards and traditional loans.</p>
<p>In July the consultancy firm McKinsey <a>said US banks had been slow to respond</a> to the surge in demand for BNPL and so had lost about $8bn to $10bn in annual revenues to fintechs.</p>
<p>“For credit cards in particular, there is a major threat from buy now, pay later,” said Nick Maynard, lead analyst at Juniper Research.</p>
<p>In June, Klarna launched an app that allows UK users to shop at any online retailer, regardless of whether it has partnered with the firm, and split the payment into three interest-free instalments – eliminating the need to use a credit card.</p>
<p>Laybuy – which lets people pay in six weekly instalments – recently launched a digital card allowing customers to buy now, pay later at selected stores with just a tap of their smartphone instead of using their bank plastic.</p>
<a>said recently</a> that following a successful test phase, it was rolling out current accounts in Germany so people there could “experience the full end-to-end Klarna experience”.

<p>The prospect of higher energy bills has prompted a deluge of calls to charities, with Citizens Advice warning of a “very difficult winter” for households on low incomes.</p>
<p>Seven small energy firms have failed in recent weeks because of <a>record energy market prices</a>, forcing their customers on to more expensive deals with a new supplier.</p>
<p>Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the prospect of higher bills had come on top of dealing with the fallout from the end of the government’s job subsidy scheme as well as the<a> £20 a week</a> cut to universal credit.</p>
<p>The charity was seeing a big increase in people seeking information and advice on energy suppliers but also seeking help coping with the wider cost of living squeeze.</p>
<a>800,000 households fell victim </a>to the turmoil in the energy market on Wednesday as both Avro and Green Energy went bust. Seven energy suppliers have now gone under, with a total of more than 1.5m households being shunted on to a new supplier.
<p>The charity’s head, Sue Anderson, said it was anticipating greater demand for its services as households had accumulated “serious levels” of unpaid bills and debts.</p>
<p>Moriarty said the people whose energy supplier has collapsed should “stay calm”. They would not lose their gas and electricity connection and would be transferred by Ofgem to a new supplier. </p>
<p>However, they could have to pay more for heat and light, making it a “very, very worrying time” for people, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p>

<p>Key’s chief executive, Will Hale, says the money has effectively been “recycled” – and that one of the driving forces was the stamp duty holiday, which started to be phased out at the end of June. </p>
<p>“In recent years, using equity release to facilitate intergenerational wealth transfer has become increasingly popular,” he says.</p>
<blockquote> The average lump sum released is £113,000, while for a drawdown customer it is an initial £85,000 with a further £34,000 held in reserve, according to Equity Release Council data. </blockquote>
<p>Borrowers who find that they can repay their loan early can face the prospect of “early repayment charges”. These may occur when either part or the entire amount is repaid before a date in the contract.</p>
<p>A 70-year-old with a £368,000 house is looking to release money from her property. Key looked at two scenarios for The Observer.</p>
<p>In the first one, the woman wanted to take out £78,000 as a lump sum. Based on an interest rate of 2.73% from more2life, the amount owing – loan plus interest – would be £102,452 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be £134,570.</p>
<p>Under the second scenario, with the same interest rates, she took out an initial £10,000 and then £5,000 a year. She would owe £71,403 after 10 years (£60,000 withdrawn in total), and £152,057 after 20 years (£110,000 withdrawn in total).</p>
<p>Tighter regulation of the <a>buy now, pay later</a> credit industry is on the way, though the government has concluded there is “relatively limited evidence” of widespread consumer harm.</p>
<p>The new form of credit is especially popular among shoppers under 30 and those with tight finances, who have welcomed the ability to delay payment, and it has taken off during the pandemic.</p>
<a>next Wonga-style scandal</a>.
<p>Citizens Advice said BNPL borrowing “can be like quicksand – easy to slip into and very difficult to get out of”.</p>
<p>BNPL should be subject to regulation that is “proportionate” but “not so burdensome that it inhibits the product being offered, or reduces consumer choice”, it says.</p>
<p>It could be late 2022 or 2023 before regulation takes effect. The Treasury consultation, which runs until 6 January, will be followed by an FCA consultation.</p>

<p>American Express is to increase the interest rates it charges UK consumers’ credit cards from February.</p>
<p>The company said the increase in the rate by 2.3 percentage points – from 22.2% to 24.5% – was because of the rising costs of providing loyalty programmes, rewards and benefits to its customers.</p>
<p>Commentators said other providers could follow suit, particularly if the Bank of England announces an increase in interest rates next month.</p>
<p>“Following a recent review, we are making changes to the interest rates on our personal credit cards, to reflect the cost of providing rewards, product benefits and loyalty programmes, which have increased in recent years.”</p>
<p>The changes just apply to personal cards, and business cards will be unaffected. In August, American Express cut the amount of cashback that<a> Platinum Everyday and Platinum Cashback cardholders could earn</a>.</p>
<p>Under the new plans the interest rate for purchases on cards will increase from 22.2% to 24.5%. The rate for withdrawing money on a card will rise from 27.2% to 31.5%.</p>
<a>whether to raise interest rates was a “live” one</a>.
<p>Andrew Hagger of the consultancy Moneycomms said American Express could be the first of many providers to increase their rates in the coming months.</p>
<p>An interest rate rise before Christmas is unlikely despite rising energy prices and supply shortages that are <a>expected to push inflation towards 5%</a>, according to the Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro.</p>
<a>warned in recent weeks</a> that inflationary pressures could warrant a rapid response by the central bank, Tenreyro said it was unclear whether a rise in the cost of borrowing before Christmas would control the escalating price of imported goods.
<p>With the economy already slowing and consumer confidence falling, she predicted a spike in prices over the next few months was likely to prove short-lived, meaning that an interest rate rise would take effect after the prices had begun to come down.</p>
<p><a>Last month inflation dropped to 3.1%</a> from 3.2% in August, but the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, said the fall would be quickly reversed and by the end of the year be heading back towards 5%.</p>
<p>Tenreyro said there was evidence that the wide geographic spread of supply lines from the UK to the rest of the world had made the economy more resilient during the pandemic, contrary to some assertions that it made businesses more vulnerable.</p>
<p>“A range of temporary factors have been pushing the consumer prices index (CPI) above target, and will continue to do so over the coming months.</p>
<p>“Some of these, such as the direct impact of energy price rises, are short-lived, and monetary policy can do little to offset them,” Tenreyro said, adding: “Much of the effect of policy would not come until after their impact had faded.”</p>
<p>It was more important, she said, to monitor energy prices to see if they eat into disposable incomes and factory costs, a development that would slow economic growth next year.</p>
<p>Investors have bet that the Bank will begin increasing its 0.1% base interest rate – which is the amount it charges other banks to borrow money – at its next meeting in November and again in December.</p>
<p>Tenreyro said that unless there was a major change to the CPI inflation or the outlook for wages, the bank should stick to its plan to raise rates by 0.5% by the end of next year.</p>
<p>She said wages were modest and could fall back in the coming months as about 1 million furloughed workers and 1 million people who have quit the labour market begin to return to jobs or the unemployment register.</p>
<p>“A large number of workers need to be reabsorbed into the labour market over the coming months, some of whom will flow into unemployment.</p>
<a>tighter regulation of the multibillion-pound BNPL industry</a> was on the way amid concern among regulators and politicians about how easy it is for consumers to buy more than they can afford and potentially build up sizeable debts.
<p>A growing number of companies such as Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy allow customers to stagger payments for products such as clothes, footwear, beauty items and furniture with no interest or charges, provided they pay what they owe on time.</p>
<p>Invitations to buy now and pay in three monthly or six weekly instalments are omnipresent at the checkouts of hundreds of online retailers including Asos, HM, Boohoo and JD Sports.</p>
<a>according to official data</a>. Between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year, 5 million people used a BNPL product, a Financial Conduct Authority survey found.
<p>Credit Karma said BNPL had continued enjoying rapid growth, and that there were now an estimated 11.6 million active UK users.</p>
<p>The credit report provider said it was urging caution when it came to such services, adding that they could contribute to “an opaque debt bubble”.</p>
<p>Klarna indicated it did not recognise some of the data. “Our average outstanding balance is £48, and we restrict the use of our services if a payment is missed to stop debt building up,” said a spokesperson.</p>
<p>In February it was announced that BNPL would be regulated by the FCA, though it could be well into 2022 or 2023 before the rules take effect.</p>
<p>For loans, dig out the original agreements or check online banking – see how much you borrowed, what is outstanding and for how much longer you are due to be making repayments.</p>
<p>Be sure to include expenditure that only occurs occasionally, such as Christmas presents.</p>
<h2>Prioritise and sort debts</h2>
<p>Not all debts are equal. Some can cause more problems than others. Identify and deal with your priority debts first. If you have limited money each month, direct it to repaying these.</p>
<p>After housing-related debts come bills for your gas and electricity, phone, internet, TV licence and court fines.</p>
<p>Citizens Advice also lists goods bought on hire purchase – which could be taken back by the seller – and unpaid child maintenance among those that must be paid first.</p>
<a>StepChange</a>, the debt charity, says it is possible to negotiate settlements with creditors where they accept a percentage of what is owed if it is clear they will not get the full amount of money.
<p>If you find you owe a creditor money that you are not currently repaying, contact it via email so that there is a record to confirm details of the amount, and tell it that you are trying to deal with your debts. </p>
<a>usually six years</a>. After that it might not be able to force you to pay. But if it is under, or close to being under, the time limit might restart.
<p>Dealing with debt can be an intimidating prospect but there are many organisations there to help.</p>
<a>StepChange</a> (0800 138 1111) gives free debt advice to 650,000 people every year.
<a>National Debtline</a> (0808 808 4000) gives advice to people across the UK. The
<a>Debt Advice Foundation</a> (0800 043 40 50), another charity, offers free advice about loans, credit and debt.
<a>Citizens Advice</a> (England – 0800 144 8848, Wales – 0800 702 2020) has been in operation for more than 80 years, giving advice on legal and debt issues, among others.
<p>The scheme can only be started by a debt adviser or a local authority that provides debt advice.</p>
<h2>Consider formal solutions</h2>
<p>When informal arrangements with creditors are not enough to help you clear your debts, you may need to consider an alternative. Take advice before doing so, as most options have long-lasting implications.</p>
<p>At the end of the period, the debts are usually written off but it will stay on your credit record for six years and there’s a £90 fee you have to pay.</p>
<p>An<a> administration order</a> is an option if you have an unpaid county court judgment and owe no more than £5,000 in total. You pay a monthly amount to the court which shares it out to your creditors.</p>
<p>Thousands of vulnerable people struggling with personal debts could lose access to free specialist face-to face help as a result of a government shake-up that seeks to move more services online, advisers have said.</p>
<p>Some areas could have more than half of their debt adviser workforce made redundant, with local debt advice charities forced to abandon in-person services or even risk closure as a result of the plans to put debt advice services out to tender.</p>
<p>Despite funding for debt advice increasing from £51m a year pre-pandemic to £77m, from April the bulk of the money will go to three national call centres, while cash for local services that provide face-to-face help will be halved.</p>
<p>Advisers say the shift away from in-person appointments will especially hit vulnerable clients at a time when personal debt is soaring as a result of rising energy and food bills and the end of furlough and debt payment holidays.</p>
<p>Nearly 4 million low-income households in the UK are <a>behind on rent, bills or debt payments</a>, up threefold since the pandemic hit, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p>
<p>Debt advice groups say that although the bidding process is ongoing, leaked estimates suggest West Yorkshire’s advisers could be cut from 32 to 11, South Yorkshire’s from 28 to seven, and Hull, East Riding and North Lincolnshire’s from 18 to four.</p>
<p>Under current arrangements, the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS), an arms-length government agency, funds nine regional grants for face-to-face debt advice provided by a network of local providers and national charities such as Citizens Advice.</p>
<p>Under the new tender, three national contracts for a mix of face-to-face and digital and phone services will be issued covering the north, Midlands and south of England, with separate arrangements for national call centre and online-based advice.</p>
<p>Buy-now-pay-later lenders should be regulated urgently to prevent young consumers taking on a mountain of debt they may be unable to afford, the Labour MP <a>Stella Creasy</a> has said.</p>
<p>Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, called a debate in parliament on Tuesday to draw attention to the rapid growth of companies such as Klarna.</p>
<p>Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) lending allows consumers to pay for goods in several instalments instead of meeting the full cost up front, and many mainstream retailers now offer it to customers as a routine part of online shopping.</p>
<p>Citizens Advice, which is also calling for the sector to be regulated, recently warned that one in 10 people are expecting to rely on buy-now-pay-later to cope with Christmas spending.</p>
<p>The firms charge no interest, but borrowers unable to meet repayments can find themselves charged late payment fees and pursued by debt collectors.</p>
<p>Citizens Advice research found that one in 10 BNPL users – or one in eight younger users – had been chased by a debt collector over the past year. Its director of policy, Matthew Upton, recently described using it as, “like quicksand”.</p>
<p>Creasy called on retailers to stop using BNFL until it is properly regulated.</p>
<p>The government agreed to regulate BNPL lenders after an independent review chaired by City expert Christopher Woolard, published in February, warned that the sector represented a “significant potential consumer harm”.</p>
<p>By that time, she says, young consumers will have taken on millions of pounds more in debt.</p>
<p>Creasy previously campaigned vociferously against the payday lender Wonga, which ultimately went into administration after a government crackdown, amid allegations of irresponsible lending.</p>
<p>The Treasury was approached for comment.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Clare Seal is the author of My Frugal Year</p></li> </ul>
<p>The troubled sub-prime lender Amigo has said it will go bust unless it is allowed to resume lending and raise new equity under a proposed new rescue plan.</p>
<p>Amigo said that in the six months to the end of September it had set aside £344m for customers who complained they were mis-sold loans that they could not afford.</p>
<p>The lender, which grew in popularity after the demise of its rival Wonga in 2018, was <a>banned from lending in May</a> by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>While details of the scheme were not made public, Gary Jennison, the Amigo chief executive, said the company had taken on board the view of an independent customer committee that it was recommended be set up by the high court judge.</p>
<p>“It will offer a markedly better cash contribution compared with the original scheme developed a year ago.”</p>
<p>The company added: “The sanctioning of a new scheme is increasingly urgent. Without an approved scheme, Amigo expects to have to file for administration or other insolvency process.”</p>
<p>Amigo said the loan impairment rate had jumped from 14% to 22% of its gross loan book in the first six months of its financial year, compared with the same period last year, as more customers default as Covid repayment holidays expire. </p>
<p>It had set aside a much lower figure of £159m for potential compensation for the six months to the end of September 2020. </p>
<p>A second option has also been offered of a “managed wind-down of Amigo Loans”.</p>
<p>Amigo said that despite reporting a small profit for the period the company has significant net liabilities of £117.6m.</p>
<p>Campaigners are calling for new legal caps on “exorbitant” <a>credit card interest rates</a>, which have hit their highest levels for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Bank of England figures reveal the average annual interest rates offered on credit cards has risen to 21.49%, compared with the base rate of just 0.1%. It is the <a>highest average credit card rate</a> since December 1998.</p>
<a>drives people further into indebtedness</a> with the rates continually going up?”
<p>In October 2001, credit card interest rates were 18.1%, while the bank base rate was 45 times higher than it is today at 4.5%. Financial experts say the credit card interest rate is also linked to the risk of consumers defaulting on payments.</p>
<p>Victoria Sully, 36, from Newquay, Cornwall, who runs the <a>Lylia Rose lifestyle blog</a>, racked up £17,500 in credit card and store card debt in just two years after starting her theology degree at the University of Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>Sully sought help from Citizens Advice and a debt management firm, which helped her with a repayment plan. She paid off her debts within five years and now provides online advice on managing finances.</p>
<p>Lockdown offered a chance to save money for more affluent households, and about £14bn of credit card debt in the UK has been paid off since February last year.</p>
<p>An FCA spokesperson said: “Our rules are helping tackle problem credit card debt. Credit card companies must help borrowers who have been in persistent debt for 36 months to repay their debt more quickly.”</p>

<p>The birth of a grandchild may be considered a priceless gift in itself, but for some grandparents it now comes with a new perk – an extra week off work.</p>
<p>Saga, the travel and insurance company for the over-50s, is to give employees a week of paid leave to celebrate the birth of a grandchild.</p>
<p>The company, which employs 2,500 staff, said it was introducing the policy in recognition that grandparents play an increasingly essential role in childcare while also building a work culture that appeals to the over-50s.</p>
<p>As part of the policy the grandchildren of all Saga staff will have access to its onsite nursery at its headquarters in Folkestone, Kent.</p>
<p>Extending perks is also increasingly being viewed as a way to retain and attract staff in the face of the post-pandemic labour shortage and the empowerment of workers in a new culture where flexible working is now the norm.</p>
<a>offered time off work to look after them</a>.
<p>Britain’s biggest white-collar employers have sent staff home after the government tightened its coronavirus guidance, but some companies have told workers they can continue to come to the office if required for their mental health.</p>
<p>Although the government instruction that people in England should work from home where possible from Monday is advice and not legally mandatory, organisations across the country are switching to home working where possible.</p>
<p>Amid growing concern about the psychological impact of nearly two years of restrictions, employers appear to be taking a more flexible approach than in the early months of 2020.</p>
<a>are not able to work from home</a>. However, some studies have found that many people who have been forced to work alone for long periods have reported
<a>increasing problems</a> such as loneliness and mental distress.
<p>The change in guidance may cause some disruption for some large office-based employers including auditors, who tend to have a busy end-of-year period while preparing for the company reporting season.</p>
<a>hybrid working system</a>, allowing staff to split their time between home and the office, albeit with extra precautions such as a lateral flow test every day before commuting in. It has now asked all staff to work from home if possible.
<p>Independent restaurants are being forced to offer hefty sign-on bonuses of £1,000 or more for chefs and other kitchen staff as the shortage of skilled workers tightens in the busy festive season.</p>
<p>The job search site Indeed said that less than 1% of hospitality job ads currently mentioned a signing-on fee but the number of posts in the industry offering such a bonus had soared fivefold (443%) since the end of May.</p>
<p>Whibley said the business had already upped basic pay by 10% as well as offering the bonus but will still be struggling to recruit staff. “It doesn’t seem they are there.”</p>
<p>She said that even with the bonus, the restaurant had attracted only two applications, neither of whom showed up for their interview.</p>
<p>“Two years ago if a chef left I would put an ad out and get four or five CVs and we would have gone to [kitchen] trials next day and I would have a choice. Now there are no CVs and no one is walking through the door. It is pretty extraordinary.”</p>
<p>She said that Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic had had a “huge impact” on the UK hospitality industry, with staff going home to mainland Europe when restaurants were forced to close and not returning to the UK.</p>
<p>He thinks the shortages will persist into next year: “Our data suggests 2022 will be a strong year for jobs as well. I expect it to be a good year if you’re looking to move.”</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs will start training apprentices directly on its London trading floor for the first time next year, feeding into wider efforts to boost social mobility across the UK’s financial sector.</p>
<a>across financial and professional services,</a> after research found that just under half of senior City roles were
<a>held by white men</a> who attended
<a>an independent or selective state school</a>.
<p>“As an industry, we are still not doing a good enough job at appealing to students from a more diverse socioeconomic background,” Daniel Freckleton, a managing director in global markets at Goldman Sachs, said.</p>
<p>They will also study at Queen Mary’s school of economics and finance for two one-week “teaching sprints” per semester. The academic programme will consist of lectures and assessments, covering topics ranging from asset pricing to machine learning.</p>
<p>Recruitment is open to students from all educational backgrounds, but will be broadly aimed at people coming from state education.</p>
<p>“We want to attract the brightest and best students from as diverse a talent pool as possible – that’s diversity of socio-economic background as much as anything else,” Freckleton said.</p>

<p>I remember them – they lived on an island and needed rescuing. You’re thinking of Zoombinis, the children’s video game.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe. My brain is fried. We’re talking about Zoombies – the exhausted, zombie-like survivors of back-to-back Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>Everyone did keep asking if I was OK. I’m just tired, I guess. Have you been polyworking, by any chance?</p>
<p>No, I’m married. “Polyworking” is another new term: it means seizing the opportunity of home working to perform two or more jobs.</p>
<p>I confess I’d not heard that one. What other jargon is arising from employment in the time of Covid? “Blursday” is a word coined to evoke the idea that the days of the week have lost their significance in the new paradigm.</p>
<p>That’s very 2020. And 2021 too, come to think of it. Give me another. Workers now talk about “synchronous communication”, when they just mean speaking to each other in real time.</p>
<p>Not in my Zoom meetings they don’t. What else? Are you familiar with the acronym RTO?</p>
<p>It rings a bell. It stands for “return to office”, and relates to timings and strategies for the gradual reintegration of a remote workforce into fully synchronous, in-person employment.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think we might not need that one. You may be right. Email me asynchronously about it.</p>

<p>The ban on allowing asylum seekers to work should be lifted and care workers should immediately be given access to fast-track visas, the government’s independent advisers have recommended.</p>
<p>The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) on Wednesday said the government should release evidence backing ministers’ assertions that allowing claimants to work would be a “pull factor” for others to come to the UK.</p>
<p>In its annual report to the home secretary, Priti Patel, the committee said there was clear evidence of the harm being caused by the ban on employment and that a change of policy was needed after the recent <a>drownings in the Channel</a>.</p>
<p>The immigration minister Tom Pursglove said last Wednesday that the ban must remain in place to “reduce pull factors to the UK, and ensure our policies do not encourage people to undercut the resident labour force”.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough to say: ‘There’s a pull factor’. You’ve got to have evidence to support that. You can’t come to conclusions if you’re not willing to tell us what the evidence is on one side of the equation,” he said.</p>
<p>In December 2018, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, told parliament he would like to review the ban after findings by <a>the Lift the Ban coalition</a> showed that allowing asylum seekers to work could generate £42m a year for the government.</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, told the Spectator magazine in an interview <a>in September</a> he would support allowing asylum seekers to work.</p>
<p>The committee has also recommended that those working in social care should be placed on the shortage occupation list, which was introduced after free movement of people across the EU ended in January.</p>
<p>It also advised the jobs be made eligible under the health and care visa.</p>
<p>The recommendation, which is usually accepted by ministers, follows months of warnings from the social care sector that it is facing <a>severe staff shortages</a> because of Brexit and the stipulation that all workers be vaccinated against Covid-19.</p>
<p>The list includes jobs where employers face a shortage of suitable labour and where it is sensible to fill those vacancies with migrant workers. Ultimately it is for the government to decide whether the recommendation is accepted.</p>
<p>The Home Office has been approached for comment.</p>
<p>“If we can’t recruit more pickers, there won’t be a daffodil industry left. The situation is very grim,” said James Hosking, of Fentongollan Farm, near Truro in Cornwall.</p>
<a>grown in the duchy</a>. Harvesting begins in the first week of January and a workforce of around 2,500 people is needed to pick over a billion stems.
<p>Hosking also struggles to employ locals. “We always have three or four local pickers, but we need 60. At the moment I have about 20 mostly people who return to us every year and who already have settled status to be in the UK,” he said.</p>
<a>told MPs</a> on the environment, food and rural affairs committee that non-edible crops will be added to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (Saws).
<p>“We’ve heard promises from the government before,” said Hosking. “We’re still waiting.”</p>
<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was contacted for a comment but did not respond.</p>
<p>The question I need help with my career. My heart sinks every morning – I feel overwhelmed, under-capable. Everything is a firefight and I just get through and think OK, and then I must face it all again the next day, repeat ad nauseam.</p>
<p>I feel I’m over-promoted. Probably because of a family connection. I’m very senior at a large charitable foundation.</p>
<p>Aim for the space between commanding and pleading that is assertiveness.</p>
<p>The number of FTSE 350 companies with a director of colour has jumped 108% over the past year, as companies face <a>greater pressure to increase diversity</a> across top leadership roles.</p>
<p>The review, which launched in 2017, <a>gave FTSE 100 firms</a> until the end of 2021 to appoint at least one BAME board-level director. The same target was set for the FTSE 250 companies, but with a deadline of 2024.</p>
<p>It also follows the UK regulator’s plans to require listed companies to either achieve targets for ethnic and gender representation on their boards, or publish an explanation as to why they continue to lag behind.</p>
<p>The proposals, which would require changing the UK’s listing, disclosure and transparency rules, would also force listed companies to publish data on the gender and ethnic composition of their boards, as well as across senior executive roles.</p>
<p>Currently, women make up 39% of all directorships across the FTSE 100, up from 35% last year, holding a total of 402 roles, Thompson Reuters research also found.</p>
<p>About 46 companies now have boards where women hold at least 40% of the roles, compared with 31 in 2020 and just 25 in 201, suggesting “significant strides” had been made towards gender parity at board level, the report said.</p>

<p>Almost 5 million families in social housing in England are facing the biggest rent hike for a decade from April amid a mounting cost of living squeeze, according to a report.</p>
<p>The Resolution Foundation thinktank said 4.75 million families would see rent on their local authority or housing association home rise by up to 4.1%, adding to the pressure on living costs by an average £202 extra a year.</p>
<p>“Rising social rents on top of these increases will be very damaging for living standards indeed,” it added.</p>
<p>According to the report, social renters now spend 19% of their income on housing costs after housing benefit is taken into consideration, up from 15% a decade ago – equivalent to an extra £768 per year for the average family.</p>
<p>In contrast, the share of income for private renters has remained flat over the same period, at an elevated level of 31%. <a>Housing</a> costs for homeowners have fallen from about 10% to 9% thanks to a drop in interest rates over the past decade.</p>

<p>Nurses, care home staff and police officers working on Christmas Day will be thousands of pounds worse off than they were a decade ago as a result of wages failing to keep pace with prices, Trades Union Congress analysis has shown.</p>
<p>Urging the government to raise the minimum wage to £10 an hour, the <a>TUC</a> said the key workers expected to keep Britain going on 25 December had taken real pay cuts since 2010.</p>
<a>earnings</a> including bonuses in the three months to October were up 4.9% on the same period in 2020.
<p><a>Frances O’Grady</a>, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “Many of the key workers who are bracing themselves for another surge of Covid cases are earning less in real terms than they were a decade ago. That is not right.</p>
<p>“The pandemic must be a turning point; 2022 should be the year that the government finally gets wages rising across the UK. They can start by giving our public service workers a proper pay rise, and by raising the minimum wage to £10 an hour.”</p>
<p>The <a>national minimum wage</a> is £8.91 an hour and will rise to £9.50 an hour in April.</p>
<p>It means that, if you are ready to step outside your comfort zone – or rather broaden it – you can start right now.</p>

<p>Major UK banks have agreed to join forces and share services to help people and businesses to continue to be able to access cash.</p>
<p>Barclays, HSBC UK, <a>Lloyds Banking Group</a>, Nationwide building society, NatWest, Santander UK, TSB and Danske Bank have agreed to the new approach, with some other firms also considering joining up.</p>
<p>The collaboration, achieved through the Access to Cash Action Group, signals a long-term commitment to ensuring widespread cash and banking access for communities where services are limited.</p>
<p>It means that, from Wednesday, if a bank involved in the initiative decides to close a branch, it will inform the ATM network Link.</p>
<p>Link will independently assess what the closure means for cash provision, looking at the community as a whole, including its residents and businesses. It will consider whether a new solution is needed.</p>
<p>If, for example, there are no bank branches remaining, Link could consider whether there is a local post office. It may, for example, suggest a refurbished <a>Post Office</a> branch or a bank hub.</p>
<p>Bank hubs involve banks working jointly to offer basic cash services on high streets, with spaces for people to speak to their own bank. Each bank may offer its own services from a hub, on different days of the week.</p>
<p>Communities will also be able to request a review of their community’s needs from the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>Cash use is still about 35% below pre-Covid-19 levels, those behind the initiative said. However, millions of people across the UK still use cash daily and many businesses need places to withdraw and deposit it.</p>
<p>Link has already assessed most communities where closures have taken place over the past year and new services are planned for 2022.</p>
<p>The Post Office is also ready to provide new and improved dedicated cash services in up to 30 branches, those behind the initiative said.</p>
<p>The Post Office already has an agreement with many banks that allows customers to do their everyday banking over its counters.</p>
<p>The UK government has said it will legislate to protect the future of cash.</p>
<p>Shops will offer cashback without consumers needing to make a purchase, under Treasury proposals to protect people’s access to cash.</p>
<p>In 2019 consumers received £3.8bn in cash when paying for items at a till, making it the second most popular way of withdrawing money behind ATMs.</p>
<p>It said the government was considering changing the rules after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December, freeing up more businesses to offer cash.</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated UK consumers’ move towards card payments and away from notes and coins, and the contactless card payment limit has been increased to £45.</p>
<p>Some hospitality businesses have stopped taking cash entirely while others have removed minimum spends on plastic. At the same time, banks have continued to announce branch closures, leaving fewer options for people who want to handle cash.</p>
<p>In September, £6.9bn was withdrawn from ATMs run by the Link network, compared with £9.3bn a year earlier and £10.3bn in September 2018.</p>
<p>Charities have said the move away from cash is a <a>problem for vulnerable people</a>, and in the summer a taskforce launched <a>community access to cash pilots</a> to experiment with different ways to keep cash in circulation.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it wanted to ensure no one was left behind in the move to digital payments.</p>
<p>Natalie Ceeney, the chair of the community access to cash pilots, said it was essential that the government and other groups committed to keeping cash viable.</p>

<p> <a>‘My wallet never leaves my bedside’: why cashless will soon be king</a></p>
<p>The UK has moved a big step closer to becoming a cashless society after official data showed that the number of payments made using notes and coins fell by 35% in 2020. </p>
<a>the 7.4 million figure in 2019</a>. Five in six payments now involve no notes or coins, compared with half of all transactions a decade ago.
<p>A growing number of businesses both big and small now refuse cash, with many having opted to go card-only over the past year.</p>
<p>Others such as Birds Bakery are discouraging the use of physical money. The Midlands chain, which was at the centre of a recent row <a>about only accepting card payments in-store</a>, says it “would prefer to take card payments where possible”.</p>
<a>have been avoiding touching banknotes</a> and coins because of Covid transmission worries.
<p>Contactless and mobile payments exploded in popularity last year.</p>
<p>The number of contactless payments rose by 12% during 2020, and overall they accounted for more than a quarter (27%) of all payments. As recently as 2016, the figure stood at 7%.</p>
<a>increase the upper limit</a> for tap and pay from £30 to £45 in April 2020 –
<a>a further rise to £100</a> is planned – and a belief that contactless is more hygienic than handling cash.
<p>About 83% of people in the UK now use contactless, with no age group or region falling below 75%.</p>
<p>Cash was used for 17% of all payments in 2020 – down from 45% in 2015 and 56% in 2010.</p>
<p>TSB Bank is closing a further 70 branches – a quarter of its network – in a move described by campaigners as “yet another hammer blow” to the UK high street.</p>
<p>TSB is the latest in a line of banks to announce it is slashing its network in response to what it said was a continuing decline in branch use and increasing numbers of customers switching to digital banking – a trend accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Its branches closing next year are spread across the country, from Thurso on the north coast of the Scottish Highlands to Exeter in Devon.</p>
<a>closing a further 48 branches</a>, while in September, Virgin Money announced it was
<a>shutting 31 outlets for good</a>. In March, Santander revealed it was
