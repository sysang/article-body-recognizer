<p>We asked a range of experts for advice on what people can do to protect themselves and their loved ones during the festive season</p>
<p>In the absence of restrictions that would normally accompany Covid case spikes, Australians are being left to their own devices to plan a Covid-safe Christmas.</p>
<p>There are measures we can take to reduce the risk of transmission at Christmas gatherings and help protect yourself, your family and friends.</p>
<p>Here’s some tips to enjoy a Covid-safe holiday season.</p>
<p>’Tis the season … to cut back on socialising. Perhaps the most difficult expert advice to heed is to reduce contact with large numbers of people.</p>
<p>It’s not something health experts advise lightly, but considering the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant, it becomes an easy way to reduce your risk of infection.</p>
<p>Prof Hassan Vally, an epidemiologist at Deakin University, said socialising was, unfortunately, directly linked to transmission risk.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a lot of sound judgment that’s going to be required.”</p>
<p>Be ruthless with your guest list. That means reducing the number of people invited to parties, gatherings, dinners or barbecues, with many potentially acting as super-spreader events.</p>
<p>Vally said it was a “simple relationship between the number of people you interact with and your likelihood of getting infected”.</p>
<p>Health experts estimate that the danger of transmission rises by up to 30% as soon as someone enters an indoor area, especially one with poor ventilation.</p>
<p>Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and microbiologist at the Australian National University, <a>told the Guardian</a> the safest Christmas gatherings were ones held outside.</p>
<p>“I think you’d get some protection, especially for your older relatives, if you tried as much as possible to hold your gatherings outside,” he said.</p>
<p>“The more events you’re indoors, in bars and pubs, those are the super-spreading events. The more you’re in those, the more it increases your risk.”</p>
<h2>4. Know the vaccine status of those around you</h2>
<p>An advantage of keeping to smaller and more intimate gatherings is that you are more likely to be able to keep a track of everyone’s vaccine status.</p>
<p>Prof Sarah Palmer, a virologist with the Westmead Institute, emphasised the importance of creating a “vaccine bubble” at gatherings, in an effort to protect people from infection.</p>
<p>“Is your whole family vaccinated? If not, there may be some difficult discussions to be had as to who should be getting together and who shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>Palmer was mindful of family gatherings being ruined by difference in vaccine status, but said it was of the utmost importance to keep track.</p>
<h2>5. Manage unvaccinated guests</h2>
<p>Vally said unvaccinated people pose a risk to everyone in attendance, and it was reasonable to ask them to take extra precautions to protect others.</p>
<p>“That may be getting them to wear a mask, be socially distant where possible, or it may be getting them to do the rapid antigen test,” Vally said.</p>
<p>Palmer added that the booster shot was essential in keeping Christmas gatherings Covid-safe.</p>
<p>But Palmer said people needed to be “extra careful” if they were still not due for a third dose.</p>
<p>“The booster increases your antibody level, up to 25-fold in fact. If you’re double vaccinated, you do have some protection, but you will probably be at more risk of getting infected.”</p>
<p>Masks are still considered essential in reducing transmission.</p>
<p>The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told reporters on Wednesday that masks do work to reduce transmission.</p>
<p>“They do protect yourself, they do protect others. The health advice is wear a mask,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Masks are particularly recommended in indoor settings, especially in retail settings, or in places where social distancing is impossible.</p>
<h2>8. Use rapid antigen tests</h2>
<p>Rapid antigen tests could be a convenient way to protect yourself and protect others, but only if they’re used regularly.</p>
<p>But with reports of shortages and varying levels of dependability, they should act more as an added layer of protection, not as a replacement for other preventive measures.</p>
<p>Vally said they’d need to be used “very judiciously” and at particular times.</p>
<p>“Doing a rapid antigen test in the 24 hours before a gathering, or even immediately before a gathering could give everyone that extra reassurance.”</p>
<h2>9. Maintain good hygiene</h2>
<p>Good hygiene still plays a major role in preventing infection.</p>
<p>Victoria Health advises people to continue practising good hygiene during the Christmas break, saying it is still essential.</p>
<p>“Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Regularly wash your hands using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser or soap and water, especially after touching surfaces, contact with others and when preparing, serving and eating food.”</p>
<p>Finally, after a difficult and turbulent year, experts also advise everyone to try to enjoy the holidays, despite the extra precautions necessary.</p>

<p>For once I’d love to see a story that celebrated a child managing to say “drink”, rather than screaming for two hours. That’s our idea of success.</p>
<p>For now, we feel like a tiny voice in a crowd of millions of happier people.</p>
<p>You’ve probably forgotten all about what I am now calling “that incident where Harmie properly lost her wotsit on the train”. But you made a big difference to me.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent that Harmie had had enough of being sociable. She really wasn’t fussed who knew that she was thoroughly fed up. In fact, the whole carriage was soon in no doubt.</p>
<p>I still felt the hot creeping shame overwhelm me when the tweed-coated man began to clap in the two minutes that Harmie was catching her breath, ready for her next onslaught. But I didn’t feel so alone.</p>
<p>I don’t think you ever really wanted children. But they were important to my mother, and you loved her very much.</p>
<p>I was loud and lively; you were quiet and studious. The door to your study was closed, and I was told not to bother you.</p>
<p>“Why are you keeping a dead man’s suit?” you mock.</p>
<p>I know I frustrate you when I fret and worry about safety, your lack of fear, your fragile confidence and vulnerability as a new driver. But I am your mum, and that is my job. Your dad was so cool. I know and I am sorry.</p>
<p>As I lay it on the bed, tears come. Do you remember the rare occasions when he wore it to work? We would tease him that he was off to be a grown-up for the day.</p>
<p>But the suit is empty, limp, old and out of fashion, and the smell of him no longer lingers. He is gone.</p>
<p>Charity shop it is, then. After all, you have no need of a dead man’s suit. You are your own man now.</p>

<p>To my surprise, our daughter’s reaction was not what I expected when I introduced the two of you – had I made a mistake?</p>
<p>I cannot say for sure if she is out of the woods yet, but she has done a fantastic job in regaining her health: I feel like we have our daughter back.</p>
<p>Thank you for your constant love and playfulness, and for showing me the simple pleasures of life. But most of all, thank you for being my light in the dark.</p>
<li> <div> <div> <div> <div> <h3><a> A letter to... my dog </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>‘On our walks together, you gave me the freedom to think clearly’: the letter you always wanted to write</div> </div> </div> A letter to... my dog </div> </div> </li>
<p>Almost 30 years ago, you exploded into our lives. Exploded is an appropriate term because we had no warning about your condition. It is fair to say that I was devastated. I felt I had been catapulted into a world in which I did not want to belong.</p>
<p>Your learning disability is such that you have no spontaneous language and require 24-hour supervision and support. Your additional needs demand a rigid structure and routine.</p>
<p>Your brother and sisters have now grown up and live in their own homes. Your dad and I got divorced, an unfortunate casualty, in part, of the pressures of raising a disabled child. You are living with me, still enjoying Postman Pat and Disney.</p>
<p>The positive contribution you have brought to our lives is immeasurable, and that extra chromosome I so despised in the early days of your life is now revered, with gratitude, as an integral feature of the wonderful person to whom it belongs: you.</p>
<p>You are the glue that binds our unique, amazing family together. I feel privileged to be your mum.</p>
<p>The midwives left us alone and we held you, your dad and I, sleeping with you for hours. Then we left the hospital empty-handed.</p>
<div> <div> <h3><a> A letter to… my stillborn daughter </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>‘The sadness of leaving the hospital empty-handed is indescribable’: the letter you always wanted to write</div> </div> </div> A letter to… my stillborn daughter

<p>To my mum: I was 12 when you died, and now, looking down the barrel of my 30th birthday, I realise more than ever how unfair it was on everyone that you were gone before your 39th birthday.</p>
<p>To my stepmum: I know I was a brat when you arrived, and the excuse of being a moody, grieving teenager will only take me so far. I’m sorry for the early years of our relationship – there is a huge sense of shame that I associate with that time.</p>
<p>When you married Dad it was one of the happiest days of my life. I remember calling you my “stepmum” for the first time the day after and it felt so normal.</p>
<p>Having a similar career to you means that you understand my work woes in a way that Dad never can, and I appreciate that more than you know.</p>
<p>You were the cool mum – Download festival in a hoodie and Converse – but now, you’re my cool friend for so many other reasons.</p>
<p>You have no idea how much I appreciate you sticking around because you want to, and not because you have to.</p>
<div> <div> <h3><a> A letter to… all my mothers </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>Mum, you’re irreplaceable – but the other women in my life are doing a pretty good job: the letter you always wanted to write</div> </div> </div> A letter to… all my mothers
<p>But I was also feeling more anxious. I didn’t feel a deep, close bond with my baby. I second-guessed everything I was doing. I felt incompetent. I didn’t have much time to enjoy him. My milk supply didn’t increase.</p>
<p>You mocked me for seeking the love and care of my mother. You saw it as weak. Your mother died when you were six – and no, I can’t imagine what that was like, and no, I don’t know how hard it was.</p>
<p>What I do know is that you have never dealt with it, never sought help. Your deep feelings of loss and hurt come out at night, during family dinners, and instead of addressing that trauma, you blame yourself: you hate, you spit and you rage.</p>
<div> <div> <h3><a> A letter to… my angry father </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>‘I don’t blame you, but I want you to understand how your actions affected me’: the letter you always wanted to write</div> </div> </div> A letter to… my angry father
<p>I taught you for almost two years and attended at least 15 meetings about you, as your pastoral head of house at a London secondary school. What you don’t know is that I often thought about the idea of fostering you.</p>
<p>How shocked would my boyfriend have been if I had brought you home – a “problem child” of almost 13? A couple who worked long hours, lived a hectic lifestyle and often ate cereal for dinner – could we have offered you much better?</p>
<p>Deep down, I knew it wasn’t to be, despite often feeling scared that I might suddenly suggest it in a meeting about you. I desperately wanted you to have some stability; I wanted to be in your corner.</p>
<p>You will be almost 18 now, I think. I always wonder what has happened to you. I hope you are happy and turning into a successful young woman.</p>
<p>I still wonder if I should have suggested you come to live with us, and if that would have been better. I wish I could shake the feeling that I could have done more.</p>

<p><a>Tony Kirkham</a>, head of arboretum at the <a>Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a>,describes arboretums as “a living reference library of trees”. At Kew there are more than 2,500 species from around the world, some of which are nearly 300 years old.</p>
<p>“It was a craze for wealthy people with some land,” says Kirkham. “Lots of these people went for rarity, the new introductions. As they were being discovered, they wanted to be the first to have them in their collections.”</p>
<p>“If you look at maps of the time, they created an arboretum from nothing,” says Westonbirt archivist Alison Vry.</p>
<p>According to Derby University’s Elliott, “it was about showing off, they [wealthy land owners] collected these exotic trees and shrubs almost as if they were works of art”.</p>
<p>“He was very interested in transforming the urban environment by ‘greenifying’, or beautifying towns and cities, and bringing parks, gardens and green spaces to the masses,” says Elliott.</p>
<a>Derby Arboretum</a> opened in 1840 as what its current manager Mick McNaught describes as the “first purpose-built public park in Britain”.
<p>Derby Arboretum was an instant success, and sparked a wave of park openings across an increasingly industrialised Britain. Elliott says that as a result, “arboretums were adopted as a model for public parks”.</p>
<p>McNaught says of Derby Arboretum that “even today, to the people who live around it, it’s their local park, but it’s of national importance”.</p>
<p>And it is a resource that’s becoming important in terms of conservation and climate crisis. “Our collection also provides a place to study how a changing climate is affecting a variety of tree species,” says Westonbirt’s Smith. </p>
<p>He adds: “I think if we can draw people into an arboretum and tell them stories about trees, then trees will get the respect that they deserve”.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that sea shanties have changed Nathan Evans’s life. The 26-year-old postman from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, has become a phenomenon online thanks to the driving, rhythmic a cappella music.</p>
<p>The sea shanty genre has unexpectedly broken into the mainstream, having become something of a global online obsession over recent weeks, mostly driven by the duet feature on the video-sharing social media app <a>TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>The result is hundreds of versions of popular sea shanties with satisfying layers of harmonised voices, sung by people who have never met — and a boost to a genre that was previously relegated to being a niche, even novelty, branch of folk music.</p>
<p>Google searches for the term “sea shanties” are at an all-time high in the US, and the <a>Reddit sea shanties community</a> is currently the ninth fastest-growing on the site, having doubled in size in the last week.</p>
<p>He is also appearing on radio, television and in articles all over the world and has even been complimented by American singer -songwriter John Legend.</p>
<p>“It’s all gone so fast and it was all a bit overwhelming,” he said.</p>
<p>“They’ve changed my life,” he said. “They’ve opened up so many doors and opportunities that I would never have had if it wasn’t for them.”</p>
<p>Jonathan “JD” Darley, Andy Yates, Robbie Sattin and Dave Robinson have spent the best part of the last decade performing sea shanties at festivals throughout the UK and had attracted a moderate fanbase.</p>
<p>But in late 2020, after the Longest Johns allowed Twitch streamers to use their music free of charge in the background of their streams, one song in particular exploded.</p>
<p>Uzowulu said: “He put it on and I was sceptical at first because he plays some weird music. But to my surprise I really liked the song. I asked him to play it on repeat until I learned the chorus.</p>
<p>“The video shows the honest progression from scepticism to full-blown enjoyment.”</p>
<p>“It’s people stuck in a bad situation hoping for better. Something about that seems to resonate with people,” said Robinson.</p>
<p>Yates added: “Or maybe they just need a food delivery.”</p>

<p>He is newly appointed head of the provincial office for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, a title which strikes fear into many Afghans old enough to remember its previous incarnation under <a>Taliban</a> rule in the 1990s.</p>
<a>Islam</a>, whipping men into mosques to pray, policing beard length, smashing radios and televisions and attacking or detaining women who tried to work, went out without a male guardian or showed their faces in public.
<p>He described a network fully integrated into the Taliban police force, with ties to mosques and madrassas, and formal rules of operation, which have been made public.</p>
<p>“The difference is we didn’t have a specific book of principles. There was just the mujahideen without a written code,” he said of the 1990s.</p>
<p>It also included rules redolent of the harshest aspects of Taliban rule in the 1990s, including a requirement that women leave the home only if they are accompanied by a male guardian, compulsory prayer and stipulations on beard length for men.</p>
<p>He wants to start with a campaign of persuasion, with enforcement efforts coming later. For now the group is overlooking small deviations, but he laid open the prospect of harsher controls.</p>
<p>“We want to inform everyone first about the principles,” Shebani said. “There are some small things we aren’t reacting to, as we don’t want people to be in a panic, or feel negative.”</p>
<p>In urban Kandahar, where the Taliban only recently took control, he foresees a more difficult campaign to educate residents on how the new government wants them to live and worship.</p>
<p>“We are focusing more on the city because the Taliban were not in control. People in the districts have learned the principles and are obeying them, but we have come to the city very recently.”</p>
<p>He ruled out, at least for now, the much feared patrols of the last Taliban rule. “There won’t be any patrols … we want to emphasise we will not be entering people’s homes, or places they have their gatherings and we will not use violence.”</p>
<p>“You should patiently prevent women going outside without hijab, and without a male guardian accompanying her,” the rules said.</p>

<p>So, with the final deal settled, does <a>Cop26</a> look like a success or failure? The unsatisfactory answer is both, but it’s more the latter than the former.</p>
<p>In relative terms, the agreements and deals made by the 196 nations in <a>Glasgow</a> nudged the world a little closer towards the path to keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C and avoiding the worst of the climate crisis’s impacts.</p>
<p>But in absolute terms, there is still a mountain to climb. Before Cop26, firm pledges to cut emissions by 2030 pointed to 2.7C of global heating – a catastrophe. After, <a>the figure is 2.4C</a> – still a catastrophe.</p>
<a>notably by India</a>, might possibly restrict heating to 1.8C by the end of the century, but lack the concrete plans to be credible. And 1.8C still means immense suffering to people and the planet.
<p>Worst of all, a deal to compensate nations for the heatwaves, storms and floods that are already hitting the most vulnerable people was booted into a talking shop. There is currently just $2m in that <a>“loss and damage”</a> fund – a pittance.</p>
<p>The climate emergency is a slow motion disaster and our escape was only ever going to be in slow motion too – remaking a world that has run on fossil fuels cannot happen overnight, particularly in the face of lobbying by rich vested interests.</p>
<p>But the world has been kicking the climate can down the road for three decades now. The Cop26 deal means the next 18 months will truly be make or break.</p>
<a>ending the razing of forests by 2030</a>,
<a>cutting emissions of methane</a> – a powerful greenhouse gas – and
<p>An end to international finance for coal power will also dent emissions and some of the most outrageous loopholes in proposed rules for a global carbon market rules were closed – but not all, and cheats may yet prosper.</p>
<p>Other negatives included the initiative claiming to put the world’s financial institutions – which bankroll the fossil fuel industry – on a green path but it represented tiny steps.</p>
<a>cutting overseas aid</a> in the run up, for which it was called out in the halls of Glasgow. Failing to join an alliance to phase out oil and gas at its own summit and planning a new oil field at home cannot have helped either.
<a>on life support</a>”. It still is.
<p>Children born today will be fighting each other for food and water in 2050 if the Cop26 climate summit fails, exhausted delegates were told as negotiators fight over the <a>final details of a potential deal</a>.</p>
<a>a “planetary boundary” </a>beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible.
<p>Cop26 president Alok Sharma said a new draft would be published early on Saturday, after which it would be debated. Sharma said he anticipated the summit would finish on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<a>would lead to at least 2.4C of heating</a>, a disastrous level.
<a>told the Guardian</a> the treaty allowed for a faster return and called on countries to come back to the negotiating table next year with revisions in line with 1.5C.
<p>These sticking points include:</p>
<a>others fear</a> that the proposed rules would lead to a flood of cheap carbon credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions.
<p>Tasneem Essop, executive director of the Climate Action Network, said it was essential that Cop produced concrete decisions to alleviate the suffering of millions of people worldwide coping with the double impacts of Covid and climate breakdown.</p>
<a>Travis Scott</a> continued performing when first responders were already dealing with a mass casualty event.
<p>Eight people ranging in age from 14 to 27 were killed and dozens were injured at the Astroworld festival in <a>Houston</a> on Friday night, when fans were crushed against the stage.</p>
<p>Details of the victims who died during the surge have begun to emerge. One of the victims was reported to be Brianna Rodriguez, 16, a student at Heights High School in Houston, described as “beautiful” and “vibrant” by her family.</p>
<p>A fan using the Instagram handle <a>SeannaFaith</a> gave a harrowing account of how their cries for help were apparently ignored by guards. The user said people began to “drown” in the crush as soon as 30 seconds into Scott’s set.</p>
<p>Amid the panic, SeannaFaith said they climbed on to a camera platform and pleaded with guards to stop the show.</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts of how warnings were allegedly ignored could feature of at least two investigations, one criminal.</p>
<p>Officials also said autopsies were being performed as soon as possible so bodies could be returned to families. </p>
<p>The Chronicle <a>predicted</a> a slew of lawsuits claiming millions of dollars in damages. Among possible targets, the paper reported, were the promoters of the festival, Live Nation, security companies and Scott himself.</p>
