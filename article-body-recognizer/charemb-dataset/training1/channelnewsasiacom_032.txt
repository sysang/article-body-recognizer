<h1> Singapore DJ Mr Has dreams of throwing a COVID-19 'closing party' in the jungle </h1>
<div> <p>In this instalment of our Creative Capital series, the co-founder and music director of the Telok Ayer Arts Club tells CNA Lifestyle what he's been up to since the pandemic started and what music lovers can look forward to from him.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>He is a co-founder and music director of the Telok Ayers Art Club, a Mr Porter Style Council member (one of only three from Singapore), and founder of his own music label Rawjak.</p>
<p>Mr Has is yearning for a time in which live entertainment can come back and has an awesome idea for what he calls the Covid Closing Party.</p>
<p>HI HAS, WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO MUSIC, EVEN WHEN REALLY YOUNG?</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed music since a very young age. Back in the late '80s when breakdancing came onto our shores, I remember dancing to Kraftwerks’ Tour De France in the HDB common corridor with some other kids with our track suits on.</p>
<p>WHEN DID YOU FIRST TRY YOUR HAND AT DJING?</p>
<p>IF YOU WERE TO LOOK BACK, HOW WOULD THE MR HAS OF TODAY CRITIQUE THE YOUNG DJ YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED OUT?</p>
<p>I would encourage more record digging and collecting, and not to hurry to get a gig. It is a beautiful part of the process which takes a lot of time and practice, so I would tell my younger self to slow down.</p>
<p>WHEN DID YOU DECIDE MUSIC COULD BE A REAL CAREER FOR YOU?</p>
<p>WAS IT HARD TO GET RECOGNISED AND TO GET GIGS?</p>
<p>Yes, I had to do a lot of networking apart from just practising at home. Getting to know the scene more and sharing my mixtapes with other fellow DJs and friends helped in getting my music out there.</p>
<p>WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE YOUR DJS WHO ASK YOU HOW THEY CAN STAND OUT AND BUILD THEIR OWN CAREERS?</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE MOST MEMORABLE PERFORMANCE TO DATE?</p>
<p>AND WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING?</p>
<p>They are all challenging. The most challenging part, as a DJ, is that connection and control on the dance floor. It’s a powerful energy that you have to keep up for a good four to six hours, sometimes more at a party. Not an easy task.</p>
<p>WHAT IS BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION YOU GET ABOUT WHAT YOU DO?</p>
<p>That it’s all fun and travel.</p>
<p>ANY OPINION ON CELEBRITIES WHO ALSO DJ?</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure there are some out there that can really deejay.</p>
<p>WHAT WOULD YOUR DREAM GIG BE?</p>
<p>YOU HAVE WORKED IN-HOUSE AT COMPANIES LIKE LO BEHOLD AND W HOTEL. HOW DIFFERENT IS WORKING FOR COMPANIES LIKE THESE FROM PLAYING GIGS?</p>
<p>It was a totally different scope. Those were both management roles for brands that involved budgets, strategy, planning, producing, curating executing on a corporate level. Very different from gigs.</p>
<p>TELL ME ABOUT TELOK AYER ARTS CLUB? HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?</p>
<p>WHAT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMES DO YOU DRIVE AT THERE?</p>
<p>WHAT EXCITES YOU RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE LOCAL MUSIC SCENE?</p>
<p>The talent that is coming out right now excites me. We are more expressive these days so we will see more musicians and artistes doing their thing.</p>
<p>Family, friends, ping pong. And of course, music.</p>
<p>HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED TELOK AYER ARTS CLUB AND YOUR OTHER GIGS?</p>
<p>We had to end our lease and regroup during this difficult time. We just launched #TAACAWAY, an online takeaway platform featuring new Singaporean cuisine. Check it out! Every order comes with a playlist and an NFT.</p>
<p>As for the other gigs, they will only come back when the entertainment industry is back on.</p>
<p>ANY EXCITING PLANS FOR 2022?</p>
<p>Look out for more updates on Telok Ayer Arts Club and the rebranding of my label Rawjak.</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Cathay Pacific to cancel some passenger flights in January amid tougher curbs </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific will cancel some passenger flights in January because of operational and travel curbs at a time when the Asian financial centre has tightened quarantine requirements, the airline said on Wednesday (Dec 22).</p>
<p>"The new consolidated schedule will result in several flight cancellations," the company said in a website notice, without giving details.</p>
<p>The carrier declined to comment on the routes involved, but said it would immediately reach out to all affected customers and try to make alternative flight arrangements for them.</p>
<p>A travel industry source who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter told Reuters the cancellations included many long-haul flights to and from Australia, North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Cathay's Australian website said it would only fly to Sydney from Hong Kong in January, with no flights to Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, which had been destinations in December.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has tightened travel rules since the Omicron coronavirus variant emerged, and arriving passengers from many countries are limited to citizens and residents who are now subject to three weeks of managed quarantine even if fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government has a "zero-COVID" policy in line with mainland China as it hopes to persuade Beijing to allow cross-border travel.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Swedish company offers a COVID-19 pass that gets under the skin </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>STOCKHOLM: Dystopian nightmare or a simple convenience? A Swedish company implanting microchips under the skin has is promoting its devices for use as a COVID-19 health pass in a country with thousands of early adopters.</p>
<p>Though still rare, several thousand Swedes have opted to have an electronic implant inserted under the skin in recent years, eliminating the need to remember key fobs, business cards, public transport cards, and recently: vaccine passes.</p>
<p>The country that created the show Real Humans and its English language adaptation Humans, is also a stronghold of so-called biohackers who are convinced that humans will become evermore entangled with technology in the future.</p>
<p>For Sjoblad, the COVID-19 pass is just one example of a possible application, which will be a "thing for the winter of 2021-2022".</p>
<p>The Swedish entrepreneur added he has a "strong interest in privacy".</p>
<p>While he acknowledged that many "people see chip implants as a scary technology, as a surveillance technology", Sjoblad said that instead they should be viewed as a simple ID tag.</p>
<p>"They don't have a battery, they cannot transmit the signal by themselves, so they're basically asleep, they can never tell your location, they are only activated when you touch them with your smartphone," he said.</p>
<p>All implants are voluntary, and if someone were to make them compulsory for prisoners or elderly people in retirement homes, "you will find me on the barricades", Sjoblad said.</p>
<p>"Nobody can force anyone to get a chip implant."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Japan to unveil record US$943 billion budget draft to ensure post-COVID recovery </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO :Japan's government is set to unveil its largest annual budget on Friday with US$943 billion in spending for the fiscal year beginning next April, further straining the industrial world's heaviest debt, a draft plan seen by Reuters showed.</p>
<p>The 107.6 trillion yen (US$943 billion) annual budget for the 2022 fiscal year underscores the challenge Kishida faces as he tries to realise "new capitalism" with a cycle of growth and wealth distribution and restore tattered public finances.</p>
<p>"I want to see swift parliament approval of this budget so that we can deliver measures quickly."</p>
<p>The next fiscal year's budget would mark a 1per cent rise in spending from this year's initial plan, up for a 10th straight year.</p>
<p>From Europe to America, policymakers globally are unwinding crisis-mode stimulus but Japan's fragile economic recovery has kept it from following suit, straining public debt that tops twice the size of its economy.</p>
<p>In a show of will to improve public finances, Kishida's government will likely trim new borrowing next fiscal year to 36.93 trillion yen from an initially planned 43.6 trillion yen for this year, the draft showed.</p>
<p>Excluding mandatory expenditure such as education and public works, Japan's budget has been stretched, leaving little room for spending in growth areas like green and digital transformation.</p>
<p>The spending plan needs to be approved by parliament by the end of this fiscal year in March 2022.</p>
<p>It will be rolled out along with the first extra budget for this fiscal year as a combined 16-month budget aimed for seamless spending to secure post-COVID recovery.</p>
<p>Japan's economy, the world's third largest, contracted an annualised 3.6per cent in the July-September quarter following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, putting a drag on private consumption that makes up more than half of the economy.</p>
<p>In a glimmer of hope, tax revenue is expected to grow by 7.79 trillion yen from this year's initial estimate to reach a record 65.24 trillion yen, the draft showed, in a sign of rising corporate profit and household income.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> World stock markets rise as COVID-19 fears ease </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: World stock markets advanced on Thursday (Dec 23) on fading fears over both the Omicron coronavirus variant and elevated inflationary pressures, dealers said.</p>
<p>Natural gas prices continued to fall sharply from record peaks that were struck earlier this week, but crude oil edged upwards.</p>
<p>The upbeat pre-holiday mood was helped by two preliminary studies from Britain indicating Omicron infections were less likely to result in hospitalisation compared with the Delta variant, confirming a trend first identified in South Africa.</p>
<p>Global equities climbed on "optimism that Omicron could lead to fewer hospitalisations than Delta", noted Interactive Investor analyst Victoria Scholar.</p>
<p>The cautious optimism was also lifted by news that the US Food and Drug Administration had authorised Pfizer's anti-COVID-19 pill, providing fresh tools to battle the disease.</p>
<p>Sentiment won another shot in the arm after Britain's AstraZeneca revealed that the third, or booster, dose of its COVID-19 vaccine "significantly" lifted antibody levels against the Omicron strain in a laboratory study.</p>
<p>New cases of the highly mutated Omicron strain continued to soar, but market watchers are becoming more confident the health effects will be milder than with earlier variants.</p>
<p>The rebound from Monday's sharp sell-off over Omicron fears "doesn't mean the market isn't concerned about Omicron", said Briefing.com market analyst Patrick J O'Hare.</p>
<p>"But it does suggest the market isn't overly concerned about Omicron doing any extended economic damage."</p>
<p>Data released Wednesday showed US consumers remained upbeat about the economy despite the rise of the fast-spreading Omicron strain.</p>
<p>The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped nearly four points to 115.8 compared to the prior month.</p>
<p>Sentiment was also boosted by revised data from the US Commerce Department showing GDP expanded at a faster annual rate of 2.3 per cent in the third quarter, up from earlier estimates of 2.1 per cent.</p>
<p>The positive mood spilled over into Asia Thursday, with Tokyo adding 0.8 per cent.</p>
<p>Even a COVID-19 lockdown in the Chinese city of Xi'an failed to dampen enthusiasm, with Shanghai closing 0.6 per cent higher and Hong Kong up 0.4 per cent.</p>
<p>Data released on Thursday morning showed the US economy continues to motor along, with personal income and spending rising, as did orders for durable goods. First-time unemployment claims remained at pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Thursday is the last trading day before Christmas for Wall Street, as it is for the Frankfurt stock exchange. Both London and Paris are open for half of a day of trading on Friday.</p>

<p>CES officials on Thursday said the event will still be held in person Jan 5 to 8 with "strong safety measures in place", which include vaccination requirements, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The mynahs pecking at scattered rice grains from open garbage bags were startled and flew away when the lift door opened.</p>
<p>Open food packets and fried fish heads strewn around the public rubbish chute area were the first things someone stepping out of the lift would see at this Housing Board block in Tampines North.</p>
<p>Residents told CNA that it is a problem they have lived with for a few years now, although the issue of cleanliness at the ward was only recently highlighted in Member of Parliament Baey Yam Keng’s (Tampines GRC-PAP) social media posts.</p>
<p>“The cleaning contractor is therefore facing severe manpower shortage and operational challenges,” Mr Baey wrote. “The 40 per cent migrant cleaner staff strength are doing their best to keep our common areas clean.” </p>

<p>When CNA visited the block along Tampines Avenue 9, residents said that they do see cleaners coming to clean the common areas - sometimes a few times a day.</p>
<p>Mr Goh Joo Meng, 51, said that even after the chute area has been cleaned, bags of rubbish that should be thrown into the rubbish chute or larger bags that should be taken to the dump downstairs would appear again.</p>
<p>He takes matters into his own hands by either informing the cleaner to come to clear it, or cleaning it himself. He’s not the only resident who does so.</p>
<p>Ms Razianah Ramzan, 36, said that her husband also cleans the chute area often, and one of her neighbours would wash the common area almost daily.</p>
<p>“I’m upset because they are not responsible about their rubbish … and it makes it difficult for the rest of us,” she said, adding that the rubbish attracts ants, cockroaches and other pests.</p>
<p>The situation in Tampines and elsewhere highlights how the shortage of foreign workers is having an impact beyond <a>the construction industry</a>.</p>
<p>“But by and large, the contractors are able to carry out their work with the mix of workers,” said Mr Liang, who is the chairman of the GRC’s town council.</p>

<p>Visitors with travel history to India have been barred from Singapore since Apr 23, and Singapore authorities extended the travel restrictions to visitors from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from May 2. </p>
<p>From May 7, Singapore stopped accepting new entry applications for work pass holders from higher-risk countries and regions, except for workers needed for key strategic projects and infrastructural works.</p>

<p>MANPOWER CRUNCH, HIGHER COSTS</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the situation is highly uncertain and the limits on foreign workers coming to Singapore could be a reality the country has to deal with for some time.</p>
<p>The woes of the construction industry have been widely reported, but CNA found that cleaning firms, landscape companies and firms doing building maintenance are also facing manpower constraints.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Companies seek alternatives as workers from India, Bangladesh dwindle</a></h3>
<p>Many of these companies hire work permit holders from India and Bangladesh. While some are considering workers from other countries, their pay is generally higher than those from the two South Asian countries. </p>
<p>And there may be other challenges.</p>
<p>Two companies said that they hesitate to hire workers from other countries as they may not be able to communicate with the existing workers from India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>With these barriers, the salaries of workers already in Singapore have risen as companies pay more to retain them, or to poach them from other companies.</p>
<p>Over the last year, he has upped his existing workers’ salaries by about 30 per cent, and they're likely to stay elevated even after the pandemic, he said. </p>
<p>And it’s not just workers from South Asia. The daily pay of skilled tilers from Malaysia has risen from about S$120 to S$150 a day to around S$250 to S$300 a day, said Mr Oei.</p>
<p>Even at that rate, they are hard to come by and he had to hire another company to complete the tiling for a hawker centre upgrading project, at twice the amount he would normally have spent. </p>
<h3><a>READ: BTO projects expected 'to be delayed' by a year or more due to tightened COVID-19 border measures</a></h3>
<p>This is an example of how a “break in the chain” - a lack of skilled workers, or shortage of supplies - can delay a project or raise costs significantly, he said. The upshot is that costs have risen, and are likely to be passed on.</p>
<p>“I have to adjust the tender price to the current market situation,” he said. </p>
<p>“And also the material price from this pandemic, we foresee that it will go up again … I’ve noticed that current tender prices have already gone up, compared to pre-COVID.”</p>
<p>Some companies have adapted by hiring more Singaporeans, but a few also told CNA that their productivity tends to be lower, and they need two or three Singaporeans to do the work of one foreign worker.</p>
<p>“We are expecting the restrictions to be prolonged in light of recent developments relating to the pandemic,” said Mr Low. </p>
<p>“Long-term implications will be project delays, cost of manpower will be higher and part of these cost increases will be passed on to customers.”</p>

<p>A few firms also appealed for there to be understanding about the difficulties they face.</p>
<p>“I think everybody should know that because of the pandemic a lot of things are being affected. We should expect things to move slower,” said Success Forever’s Mr Oei.</p>
<p>Mr Ooi of Limelite said that the public cannot expect their shrubbery to have a “Shangri-La look” all the time, even as more essential works like removing the dead branches of trees and grass-cutting continue.</p>
<p>Going forward, if this situation continues, he thinks that a more streamlined and manpower-light maintenance regime has to be considered for Singapore’s greenery, and this should be incorporated at the design stage.</p>
<p>“There should be some very good, clear guidelines when designing landscape - Number one is: (To be) equipment friendly when it comes to maintenance,” he said.</p>
<p>With the difficulties of hiring foreign workers, is a manpower-light future the way forward? </p>
<p>Associate Professor of Economics Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that the alternative is adaptation. </p>
<p>“On the production end, adaptations means shifting to greater use of technology and capital, redesigning jobs to make them more attractive to Singaporeans, and improving working conditions and pay,” he said. </p>
<p>“On the consumer end, adaptation means accepting that any goods and services relying on foreign manpower will simply become priced out of reach of many consumers, or will have to be adjusted in scope and quality.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: COVID-19: Construction industry stakeholders appeal to Govt to bring in foreign workers in a ‘controlled manner’</a></h3>
<p>He said that this need not mean “a huge reduction in our quality of life”.</p>
<p>“But it would mean that we have to change our expectations and behaviour considerably in many areas,” he said.</p>
<p>These may include fewer having live-in domestic workers, pricier food when dining out, and more expensive public services - including clean streets, road maintenance and trash removal.</p>
<p>He too thinks that this is a trend that’s here to stay as countries around the world, particularly those with underdeveloped public health systems, continue to face COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>
<p>“In addition, local transmission risk among migrant workers in Singapore will remain elevated due to the difficulty of creating living conditions that provide workers with substantially more private space,” he said.</p>
<p>“For this model to change, and to reduce dependence on foreigners to perform such work, there needs to be both legislative and mindset changes,” she said.</p>
<p>Prof Theseira expects that with less migrant manpower, Singapore companies’ output will fall as there are “significant limitations” to the extent to which technology or capital can be substituted in manpower-intensive sectors.</p>
<p>However, he also thinks current low-wage jobs could become more attractive to locals as firms raise wages and adapt to hire more locals.</p>

<h1> IN FOCUS: How Johor’s residential property market has been hit hard by COVID-19 </h1>
<div> <p>The Johor skyline is now dotted with empty condominium units, due to an oversupply in the market and lack of foreign buyers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Amir Yusof </a> </div> </div>
<p>JOHOR BAHRU: When Singapore business owner Jonathan Gan purchased a four-room condominium at Lovell Country Garden in 2018, he thought he had clinched his dream retirement home.</p>
<p>The freehold apartment located near Johor Bahru’s city centre was twice the size of his three-room HDB flat in Singapore, but the cost was only half of the latter when he bought it directly from the developers.</p>
<p>“The best thing about the unit is the amazing view. You never get anything close to it at such value in Singapore,” added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters.</p>
<p>The apartment, like most units in the Lovell development, overlooks the Straits of Johor. The balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below. </p>
<p>“It was the ideal weekend home,” said Gan. “But now it’s becoming a bugbear.”</p>
<p>Just three years after he purchased it, Gan, who bought the unit at around RM1 million (US$242,000), is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it.</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between Singapore and Malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gan’s business in Singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity.</p>
<p>“All this was never part of the plan. But the house is just left there, collecting dust and its value is going down by the day. We felt it is better to cut our losses and try to get rid of it,” he told CNA.</p>
<p>Despite being on the market for over a year, there have been no takers. He has engaged agents and even advertised the unit on various property portals but to no avail.</p>
<p>“There is not much hope. Barely anyone has viewed or signalled interest,” he said.</p>
<p>Gan is among property owners in Johor Bahru who are having issues trying to sell their properties, as the market is in the doldrums due to the prolonged effects of COVID-19.</p>
<p>JOHOR'S OVERSUPPLY PROBLEM </p>
<p>According to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm Henry Butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in Johor had been climbing “rather steadily” from 2017 until 2019.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that the Movement Control Order (MCO) imposed by the Malaysian government from Mar 18, 2020, was a key reason that reversed the upward trend.</p>
<p>It said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>Property analyst Debbie Choy, who is director of Knight Frank Malaysia’s Johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the Iskandar region.</p>
<p>“Many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers. With the prolonged effects of COVID-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,” said Choy.</p>
<p>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in Malaysia under the Malaysia My Second Home Program (MM2H) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since July 2020.</p>
<p>MM2H was suspended by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) in line with the government's decision to bar foreigners from entering enter Malaysia following the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>
<p>MOTAC added that the government is currently reviewing the MM2H programme, and that foreigners still interested to participate must abide by the latest requirements when it is reinstated.</p>
<p>MM2H president Anthony Liew was quoted by local media last Sunday (Jun 6) saying that the suspension has curtailed interest from Singapore and China buyers in Johor property.</p>
<p>“The three big Chinese developers, Country Garden Pacificview, RF Development and Greenland Group, have seen the demand for their developments in Johor from Chinese buyers drop,” Loke reportedly said.</p>
<p>Even owners of the more premium, newer developments in Johor Bahru are having problems trying to attract tenants.</p>
<p>A Taiwanese woman, who wanted to be known only as K, told CNA that she has put up her 3-room condominium unit at The Astaka for rent, after she headed back home when the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>The Astaka, a premium condominium located at Bukit Senyum in the heart of Johor Bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019.</p>
<p>The two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have three- or four-room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft.</p>
<p>However, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in Johor are not able to find interested tenants. </p>
<p>K told CNA that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns. However, after almost two years, no tenant has made a "suitable offer".</p>
<p>She first listed her 3-room unit at RM5,700 a month. Fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to RM3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants. She purchased the unit for around RM2 million.</p>
<p>“I think considering the circumstances, I have no choice but to lower the rental price. I notice that there have been no offers. I am patient. Hopefully, when the pandemic is over, there will be people who are interested,” said K.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Johor planning new COVID-19 economic stimulus package, says chief minister</a></h3>
<p>The demand from Johoreans has also weakened, as they reel from the effects of the pandemic. </p>
<p>She noted that locals with more spending power were typically Johoreans who commuted daily to Singapore for work. However, with borders closed from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in Singapore.</p>
<p>“The spending power of the former Johor daily commuters and Singapore residents who visited Johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the Johor economy,” said Khor.</p>
<p>She noted that the impact on the Johor economy meant that some Johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance, and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic. </p>
<p>“A year later, with Johor’s economic umbilical still cut off from Singapore, and Malaysia suffering a big wave of COVID-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing," added Khor. </p>
<p>Even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to COVID-19, Khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units.</p>
<p>In its report, Henry Butcher Malaysia highlighted that Johor was the state with the highest proportion of unsold residential properties in the country, even before COVID-19.</p>
<p>The report said that Johor contributes 19.5 per cent of “overhang” residential properties and a whopping 73.7 per cent of all overhang condominium apartments in the country in 2019.</p>
<p>“Of these, approximately 34 per cent of the overhang service apartments/sohos are priced over RM1 million which were believed to have been designed specifically for foreign investors from Singapore and China,” the report said.</p>
<p>LANDED HOMES ALSO AFFECTED</p>
<p>Besides condominiums and serviced apartments, those with landed properties in the southern state are also concerned about depreciating values.</p>
<p>A Singaporean who wanted to be known only as Mustaqim, who owns a two-storey 4,000 sq ft terrace home at gated community Horizon Hills, has expressed concern that the value of his house is depreciating since he purchased it in July 2017.</p>
<p>Mustaqim bought the house as a retirement home rather than an investment, but admitted he was worried that based on recent price trends in the area, his home has lost some of its value.</p>
<p>He bought his home a decade after the development was launched in 2017, for around RM1.8 million.</p>
<p>“With COVID-19, some of my neighbours who are Singaporeans have decided to sell their homes for RM1.1 million to RM1.2 million. It is spoiling the market a bit but I can understand why with the borders closed,” said Mustaqim.</p>
<p>“I am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home’s value will be going lower and lower. I would be owning a depreciating asset,” he added.</p>
<p>However, Mustaqim, who is currently in Singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The value will rise again post-pandemic,” said Mustaqim.</p>
<p>Property agents in Johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during COVID-19.</p>
<p>An agent who wanted to be quoted only as Brian, told CNA that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of transactions has dried up since the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Some months I barely make any transactions, so I’ve been looking around for another job to tide through over the next few months,” he said. </p>
<p>The agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central Johor Bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with “almost zero” demand.</p>
<p>"Some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions. So, the situation is really bad for us,” added Brian. </p>
<p>CNA has approached the Johor chief minister's office, as well as the state housing and local government committee for comments on the state of the property market and whether measures will be taken to assist industry players.</p>
<p>EMPTY HOMES SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRIME</p>
<p>Another headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins.</p>
<p>Economist Khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Investors with properties in Johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said.</p>
<p>"The reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand," she added. </p>
<p>In September last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at Taman Bukit Indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property.</p>
<p>Johor police added that the pair had specifically targeted vacant homes whose owners were in Singapore due to the border restrictions.</p>
<p>Rahmah Zainolabidin, a Singaporean who chose to remain in Johor Bahru during this pandemic, told CNA that she has been taking care of homes belonging to her family members who have chosen to return to the city-state.</p>
<p>She told CNA how her sister’s home, a terrace house located in a non-gated community in Taman Bukit Indah, had been robbed in August 2020.</p>
<p>“When I was walking towards the home from afar, I could see that something was wrong. The windows were pried open wide and the gate was ajar,” said the 65-year-old.</p>
<p>“They broke the gate grilles and drilled into the safe, taking thousands of dollars in cash as well as jewellery,” she added.</p>
<p>Rahmah said that her sister was considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted.</p>
<p>“It is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell it off. And in this market, I’m convinced there will be little interest, especially with the number of robberies reported in the area,” Rahmah added.</p>
<p>“Crime is a serious issue ... I don’t think people would consider buying homes in areas with high incidences of break-ins.”</p>
<p>Charmaine Tay, a freelance agent who focuses on property deals in Johor Bahru and the Medini Iskandar Malaysia area, told CNA that houses located in areas with a high incidence of break-ins have seen a drop in value and demand. </p>
<p>"Many buyers are aware that landed homes are susceptible to break-ins in Johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks," said Tay. </p>
<p>"But for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like Taman Bukit Indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently," she added </p>
<p>BUYERS FROM OTHER STATES, OVERSEAS BARGAIN HUNTERS COULD SPARK RECOVERY</p>
<p>Those interviewed by CNA said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector.</p>
<p>The first group is potential buyers from other states. </p>
<p>Choy said that many Malaysians who have been stuck in Kuala Lumpur would then take some "leisure time off” and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities.</p>
<p>However, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in Johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals.</p>
<p>“Developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i.e. by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,” said Choy.</p>
<h3><a>READ: 'The ball is in our court': Johor chief minister on reducing COVID-19 cases and border reopening with Singapore</a></h3>
<p>The return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief.</p>
<p>Choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide "a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements", especially with the currently low prices. </p>
<p>She noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the Johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of RM1 million on residential homes for non-Malaysian citizens. </p>
<p>With borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like Gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his four-room apartment at Lovell Country Garden.</p>
<p>“It’s a sticky situation. Although we had good times using it as a weekend home, ultimately buying it was a wrong decision we now regret,” he said.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Tang See Kit </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: More than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, a filled cinema hall is what Mark Shaw misses the most.</p>
<p>For the third-generation boss of film distribution and cinema chain Shaw Theatres, there is something special about watching a movie in a full house.</p>
<p>“I miss the crowd,” he said. “Because for me, cinema is people cheering when Rocky gets up from the ground or hearing the gasps when Jaws is approaching and the music starts.”</p>
<p>“It is quite a personal experience yet that personal experience is amplified by all the people around you and I think that’s what makes cinemas special."</p>
<p>But the coronavirus pandemic has put the brakes on people's ability to enjoy that experience. </p>
<p>Cinema halls now have seats marked out to leave gaps in between movie-goers, while crowd-attracting celebrity tours and gala premieres seem like a distant memory. At one point last year, the screens here turned dark for almost four months.</p>
<p>That has never happened before, recalled Mr Shaw, not even during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>“The screens have never been down … We live and breathe cinema so it’s a terrible feeling to not be able to show films but at the same time, we know it was a necessary thing to do,” he said.</p>
<div> <div><blockquote><p>In line with the Singapore government’s directive, we will be temporarily closing our cinemas from 27th March (Friday)...</p>Posted by <a>Shaw Theatres</a> on <a>Tuesday, March 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div></div>
<p>The ever-changing safety protocols are weighing down on the financials of an industry that thrives on ticket sales and even more on food and beverage (FB) revenue.</p>
<p>There are also other challenges: A lack of major releases and consumers turning to streaming platforms to fill the need for entertainment while staying at home.</p>
<p>The latter, in particular, has heightened anxiety over the future of cinemas: Will the crowds return when the pandemic abates?</p>
<p>SINGAPORE’S LOVE FOR THE MOVIES</p>
<p>Singaporeans love going to the movies.</p>
<p>Affordable ticket prices and an ample supply of accessible cinemas are among the contributing factors, said PwC Singapore’s entertainment and media leader Oliver Wilkinson.</p>
<p>Data showed there were 274 cinema screens operated by a mix of big and small exhibitors last year, just a notch below the all-time high of 281 screens in 2019.</p>
<p>The availability of a variety of movie content across languages and genres, given the country’s status as a cultural melting pot, is also another pull factor for audiences, he added.</p>
<p>But COVID-19 changed that.</p>
<p>Box office takings fell from S$175.4 million in 2019 to S$49.6 million last year.</p>
<p>Eternality Tan, 33, said he waited “for a fortnight or so” after cinemas reopened last year before returning to his usual movie haunts like The Projector and the Oldham Theatre. </p>
<p>Still, he has dialled back on the frequency. The 33-year-old used to watch at least one or two movies in the cinemas a week, but now catches two or three a month.</p>
<p>“It’s also the content available … but from what I see, consumers in general have been slow to return.”</p>
<p>“We were really taking off so we thought 2020 is going to be a great year - famous last words – and later on, we kind of stepped off the edge of the cliff.”</p>
<p>Like others in the industry, having to <a>take a hiatus at end-March</a> as the Government shut all entertainment venues was a worrying turn of events.</p>
<h3><a>READ: COVID-19 shutdown: How Singapore’s cinemas, bars and theatre groups are coping</a></h3>
<p>“I do remember the day we had to shut. Most of the team was there and everyone felt a bit sentimental because you know when the lights go out, especially for cinema, it’s quite visual,” said Ms Tan.</p>
<p>More recently when safety protocols were tightened in May, The Projector took another hiatus – this time voluntarily to cope with “the worst set of restrictions without equivalent support”, said general manager Prashant Somosundram.</p>
<p>“This is a return to Phase 1 but without FB and even lesser support,” said Mr Somosundram, adding that food sales are critical not just because they make up about half of a cinema’s revenue but they also complement the movie-going experience.</p>
<p>The Projector has since reopened but as of mid-June, visitor levels are down nearly 80 per cent.</p>
<p>It’s not just the smaller players that are hurting.</p>
<p>Golden Village, Singapore’s largest cinema chain with 14 outlets, described the past year as a “start-stop year” and that it is “an understatement” to say COVID-19 has adversely affected global cinemas.</p>
<p>“It is estimated that movie halls across the world lost US$32 billion in 2020, or a 71.5 per cent reduction in revenue. In Singapore, the situation is pretty much the same,” said chief executive Clara Cheo.</p>
<p>Shaw Theatres, the second largest player here with nine cinemas, said it is operating “way below” its breakeven capacity number.</p>
<p>For Mr Shaw, a huge reason was a lack of major releases as movie studios opted to postpone their most expensive action flicks amid lockdowns in the bigger markets such as United States and Europe.</p>
<p>These include major Hollywood tentpole movies like the new James Bond film No Time To Die and Marvel’s Black Widow.</p>
<p>Those that did stay on last year’s release schedule, such as superhero film Wonder Woman 1984, period fantasy drama Mulan and thriller Tenet, were few and far in between, industry players said.</p>
<p>"We don't have the capacities to make cinemas financially viable right now and I think that is maybe 60 to 70 per cent caused by the lack of movies,” said Mr Shaw.</p>
<p>At the same time, audiences have picked up new viewing habits with on-demand streaming services making further headway.</p>
<p>“We were always anticipating this kind of growth but COVID-19 has made it a little faster and sooner by about a year or so,” said Mr Wilkinson.</p>
<p>Even cinema operators have ventured into the streaming space – Shaw Organisation’s Kinolounge and The Projector’s Projector Plus were launched last year.</p>
<p>Both said their new pay-per-view streaming platforms complement their physical cinemas by featuring niche content, such as older titles, festival films and even local short films.</p>

<p>Ms Angelia Lim said the last movie she watched in the cinemas was Avengers: Endgame in 2019.</p>
<p>Convenience also plays a part.</p>
<p>“To be honest, we haven’t run out of options,” said the 37-year-old. “And I can watch anything whenever I want, or pause the video, go off and not miss anything.”</p>
<p>But this does not mean that people are ready to forsake the big screen and the unique experience it offers, said Mr Wilkinson.</p>
<p>“They go because they want to browse, try something on, meet people. Overall, it’s a day out and I think that holds well with cinemas – it’s a day out with friends or family that isn’t fully replicable at home.”</p>
<p>Coupled with the abundance of cinema screens here and a likely recovery in consumers’ discretionary spending when the economy picks up, the industry observer said existing cinema-going habits are unlikely to change dramatically anytime soon.</p>
<p>“For all these reasons, I think it would be definitely an exaggeration to talk about cinemas going away after the pandemic.”</p>

<p>Industry players echoed that.</p>
<p>While streaming services will impact the cinema industry, it remains unclear if it will be a positive or negative one, said Ms Cheo of Golden Village, adding that some data “actually suggest that people who stream more also go to movies more”.</p>
<p>Even as some studios plan to release their latest movies online and in cinemas simultaneously, it is also unclear if this will be the norm going forward, the chief executive added.</p>
<p>“Most movies are made with the big screen in mind. When watched on a home TV, some of the essence of the movie may be lost,” she said.</p>
<p>“Imagine watching Avatar on TV when it was first released – it just wouldn’t do the movie and special effects justice and have the same wow factor.”</p>
<p>Mr Shaw pointed out that this is not the first time that the possible demise of cinemas has been debated. Over the years, there have been several apocalyptic threats including the emergence of television, videotape, DVDs and the Internet.</p>
<p>“Those didn’t happen and now people are saying Netflix will kill cinemas, I don’t think it’s going to be true either,” he said.</p>
