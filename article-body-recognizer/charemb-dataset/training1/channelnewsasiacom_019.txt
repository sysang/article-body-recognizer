<p>“Triple negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive and have a higher chance of recurrence, as there is no target to treat in triple negative breast cancer” says Dr Wong.</p>
<p>Positive about Triple Negative Breast Cancer</p>
<p>Conventional treatment that involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been the main course of action in treating this strain of cancer so far.</p>
<p>However, as Dr Wong points out, “recent studies using immunotherapy in treating triple negative breast cancers show very promising results.”</p>
<p>Immunotherapy activates the body's own immune system to recognise and destroy cancer cells.</p>
<p>“This gives hope to this group of patients where treatment options are often limited.”</p>
<p>It is therefore imperative for patients to have the breast cancer cells tested for appropriate targets.</p>
<p>“Through testing, we can provide the most comprehensive treatment”, says Dr Wong.</p>

<h1> Better Odds in Fighting Lung Cancer </h1>
<div> <p>The tide is starting to turn on lung cancer with improved diagnostics and a familiar ally, the body’s own immune system. But second-hand smoke and vaping remain big risks.</p> </div>
<p>Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide and in Singapore. </p>
<p>According to the Singapore Cancer Society, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the third among women. It is also the number one killer among men and second, for women in Singapore.</p>
<p>As recently as 2010, only around a third of lung cancer patients survived a year after treatment. This is mainly due to the fact that the disease is often discovered in most patients during its later stages.</p>
<p>Despite the stark statistics, lung cancer survival has improved dramatically over the last two decades with almost half of victims surviving with chemotherapy alone and 70 per cent with a combination of treatments.</p>
<p>“Advancement in treatment such as targeted and immunotherapy have also improved the response rates and control for patients”, says Dr Chin, who specialises in lung cancer.</p>
<p>Targeted therapies is a treatment that hones in on cancer cells based on the cells’ mutations. But not all lung cancer patients can be treated with these methods as not all have a mutation which can be targeted.</p>
<p>“Immunotherapy works by garnering the patient's own immune system to control and kill tumour cells” says Dr Chin, adding that “immunotherapy is generally very well tolerated.”</p>
<p>The Rise of Immunotherapy</p>
<p>Immunotherapy works by blocking molecular pathways that prevent cancer cells from hiding so that the immune system can do what it was meant to do - detect and rid the body of cancer cells. </p>
<p>The view of experts is that immunotherapy presents a potentially longer term and effective treatment option when treating patients in the later stages of lung cancer.</p>
<p>In some cases, patients with even stage IV cancers have been able to achieve long term positive results with immunotherapy. </p>
<p>Immunotherapy may see side effects which are different from those experienced from chemotherapy. However, as Dr Chin points out, “immunotherapy is generally very well tolerated, 90 per cent of patients go through it without any problems.”</p>
<p>“There are some patients who have certain side effects… 10 per cent of patients may get serious side effects, such as inflammation of the lungs, liver and gut... some patients also develop hormone problems, but these are easily treated” she says.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the goal of immunotherapy is to control the tumour, and to prevent recurrence for as long as possible.”</p>
<p>The Danger of Second-Hand Smoke</p>
<p>Most are aware that lung cancer traditionally affects cigarette smokers, but inhaling second-hand smoke regularly can also put non-smokers at risk. </p>
<p>“Second hand smoke is a known risk factor for lung cancer” says Dr Chin.</p>
<p>“The guiding principle as with smokers, is to minimise the amount of exposure, as it is known that the more exposed one is to unhealthy air, pollution or smoke with nicotine and carcinogens, the higher the risk of developing lung cancer.”</p>
<p>“Vaping also exposes users to nicotine, and other potentially carcinogenic substances in its vapor” explains Dr Chin.</p>
<p>“Although there are no definite strong links at this point in time, one should be aware of potentially harmful compounds in the vapor generated by vaping, which can either result in lung problems, or lung cancer.”</p>
<p>As Dr Chin points out, “smokers who have stopped smoking have a reduced chance of developing lung cancer, compared to a smoker who continues to smoke.”</p>

<p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p>
<h1> It’s a Guy Thing - Prostate Cancer </h1>
<div> <p>Though difficult to detect during the early stages, diagnostics and new treatment methods mean that men diagnosed with prostate cancer can possibly live a fairly normal life.</p> </div>
<p>It is rare to find a person with prostate cancer under the age of 40. Occurring only in men, prostate cancer is highly treatable and most victims could continue with a fairly normal life.</p>
<p>Dr Khoo Kei Siong, Deputy Medical Director at Parkway Cancer Centre explains that “it's important to take into consideration the age of the patient, his general medical condition, as well as the nature of the prostate cancer.</p>
<p>“Whether it's an early stage disease, whether it's of a slow-growing behaviour, these can be determined by looking at the pathology of the cancer cells” says Dr Khoo.</p>
<p>“One of the challenges is that not all prostate cancers that are found will necessarily cause long-term harm. Many of these cancers found are slow-growing cancers that may not need a lot of treatment.”</p>
<p>The risk of contracting prostate cancer increases with age.</p>
<p>Men with a family history of prostate cancer face a higher risk of developing the disease.</p>
<p>Dr Khoo also cautions that men who are obese, consume a lot of meat but little fruits and vegetables are at risk.</p>
<p>In its early stages, prostate cancer will display no symptoms.</p>
<p>The cancer is often picked up through abnormal findings in a blood test or a physical examination that reveals a nodule in the prostate gland.</p>
<p>When prostate cancer is suspected, either a transrectal ultrasound or an MRI is required to locate the cancer. This is often followed by a biopsy of the area.</p>
<p>Once cancer is confirmed, the crucial next step by doctors is to determine if the cancer is confined to the prostate gland or has spread.</p>
<p>The tell-tale symptoms become apparent only when the cancerous tumour grows larger, causing either difficulties in the passing of urine or a sensation of an incomplete emptying of the bladder.</p>
<p>Pain, says Dr Khoo, is only experienced when the cancer starts to affect surrounding organs or spreads to other locations.</p>
<p>Treatments Options Will Vary</p>
<p>Depending on the stage of prostate cancer, oncologists would generally advise either immediate treatment or active surveillance.</p>
<p>“Meaning … monitor the cancer by X-rays and imaging and testing of the PSA level - the prostate-specific antigen - something you can measure in the blood,” says Dr Khoo.</p>
<p>Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer</p>
<p>In prostate cancer where the disease has extended beyond the prostate gland but remained localized, radiation treatment will be the main treatment.</p>
<p>According to Dr Khoo, other kinds of treatment such as hormonal treatment is usually added for better long-term results.</p>
<p>When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it usually affects the bones, bladder, rectum, lung or liver. In such cases, experts will call for a systemic treatment of the disease.</p>
<p> “Systemic means we treat the entire body. We use drugs such as hormone treatment, chemotherapy, systemic radiation and immunotherapy”, says Dr Khoo.</p>
<p>Dr Khoo points out that different methods have different treatments outcomes. </p>
<p>“The aim of the treatment is to contain the disease and give the patient a better quality of life and a longer survival” he says.</p>
<p>Understanding Hormonal Therapy</p>
<p>According to Dr Khoo, prostate cancer grows on male hormones, and drugs that reduce the amount of testosterone in the blood or block its action on cancer cells, are effective in containing the cancer.</p>
<p>“Hormonal therapy is an important treatment option available to patients with both early and advanced stages of prostate cancer” points out Dr Khoo.</p>
<p>Taken either in the form of tablets or injections, hormonal treatment is often well tolerated by patients too.</p>
<p>“It is understandable, when a cancer diagnosis is made, everyone will be anxious on how best to contain it.”</p>
<p>Dr Khoo says, “if a treatment is needed and we're looking for something that's non-toxic or less toxic, hormonal treatment is a good choice.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h1> Sudden Death and Weekend Warriors Wearing Health Devices </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>When Taiwanese-Canadian actor Godfrey Gao collapsed and died at the age of 35 while filming a competitive sport segment, the news sent shockwaves at the unexpected death. </p>
<p>Known as Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD), it’s an area of special clinical interest for cardiologist Dr. Jeremy Chow of the Asian Heart Vascular Centre (AHVC).</p>
<p>“Heart disease and its mortality is the second most prevalent cause of death in Singapore, after cancer” points out Dr Chow, a cardiologist who's been practising for almost a decade.</p>
<p>The Heart of the Matter in SCD</p>
<p>SCD is defined by Dr Chow as “unexpected death due to cardiac causes that occurs in a short time period (generally within 1 hour of symptom onset) in a person with known or unknown cardiac disease.”</p>
<p>Worldwide, SCD accounts for 25 per cent of 17 million heart-related deaths each year.</p>
<p>In Singapore, up to 1,000 Singaporeans die from SCD every year, based on a 2003 study by the National Heart Centre Singapore and the Health Sciences Authority.</p>
<p>According to Dr Chow, whose clinical interests include sudden cardiac death prevention, SCD is generally caused by structural heart diseases. </p>
<p>One that commonly afflicts athletes and weekend warriors says Dr Chow, is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, “a genetic disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied).” </p>
<p>With the heart being less able to pump blood effectively, there are arrythmias (irregular heartbeats) that could eventually result in cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Apart from arrhythmic death syndrome, Dr Chow lists aortic valve stenosis as another possible cause of Sudden Cardiac Death.</p>
<p>An aortic valve stenosis is a common but serious heart valve problem. </p>
<p>When there is a narrowing of the heart’s aortic valve opening, the flow of blood is restricted from the left ventricle to the aorta, the main artery that delivers oxygenated blood to the body.</p>
<p>The problem with aortic valve stenosis is that it shows no symptoms. </p>
<p>While SCD may seem like an unexpected, lethal episode, a person without any cardiac concerns shouldn’t dismiss having an ECG (electrocardiogram) during a regular health screening.</p>
<p> “A normal 12 lead ECG during routine screening will exclude silent myocardial infarction (heart attack) and abnormal conduction intervals,” points out Dr Chow.</p>
<p>And while many today rely on wearable health devices to check on their heart, the cardiologist and cardio electrophysiologist makes clear that general users cannot use such devices to prevent or detect SCD.</p>
<p>“Currently no wearable tech has the ability, or have been validated, to be able to prevent SCD” warns Dr Chow.</p>
<p>Smart-watches or wearable health devices is a multi-billion dollar industry which analysts predict will reach some US$27 to US$87 billion worldwide in less than a decade. </p>
<p>Most devices now offer a heart-rate monitor. So what should a person do if extremely high heart rates or fluctuations are noticed?</p>
<p>“Asymptomatic patients should use different wearable devices to re-verify” is the expert advice of the cardiologist. “Symptomatic patients should see a cardiologist to do a 24-hour Holter evaluation.”</p>
<p>Based on the results of the Holter, a portable ECG monitoring device, treatments for irregular heart rates may vary.</p>
<p>“Depending on the diagnosis, most will require medical intervention. If medication fails, then ablation may be an option” says Dr. Chow. </p>
<p>Whether male or female, if you plan to start on a new exercise routine or competitive sport, think about your heart.</p>
<p>“A normal ECG will reinforce that the athlete is fit to participate in competitive sport."</p>
<p>“ECG is an inexpensive test and can be done in primary health care as well as in a specialist clinic,” adds Dr Chow.</p>
<p>So apart from getting the right gear and gym membership for your next fitness routine, get a pre-participation evaluation as well.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h5> Brushing Up On Alzheimer’s Link to Gum Disease </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h1> Brushing Up On Alzheimer’s Link to Gum Disease </h1> <div> <p>New findings on gum disease and oral bacteria in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease puts more attention on dental health.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Six billion – that’s the number of bacteria that exists in your mouth, yes, even if you brush regularly. </p>
<p>These billions of oral bacteria that usually feed on what you feed on, are often the ones that cause decay, inflammation and infections, and even tooth loss.</p>
<p>One bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) that’s usually the culprit behind periodontal disease, commonly referred to as gum disease, is now also possibly linked to Alzheimer’s Disease say experts.</p>
<p>The link between oral disease and the neurodegenerative disease which has long been investigated saw clearer connections revealed in a study published by Science Advances in early 2019.</p>
<p>It was also observed during a 6-month study on a group of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease that those with chronic gum disease and oral infections suffered a notable decline in cognition.</p>
<p>“Porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, was identified in the brain of Alzheimer’s Disease patients” says Dr. Ansgar Cheng, a prosthodontist at the Specialist Dental Group.</p>
<p>Dr Cheng who had discussed gum disease and Alzheimer’s Disease at a dental health seminar held in collaboration with CNA, explains the problem simply with three letters - BBB.</p>
<p>“For many years in medical and dental school, we were taught about this thing called the BBB or blood-brain barrier” says Dr Cheng of the semi-permeable border between blood in the brain and fluids in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>The blood-brain barrier was long thought to be able to prevent bacteria or even medicine from travelling through, he explains.</p>
<p>“But now, evidence has shown that bacteria does travel via the bloodstream, from one side of the body to the other side” he points out.</p>
<p>The problem with the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis which is prominent in oral disease, is that it secretes the toxin gingipain, which studies indicate, promotes neuronal damage.</p>
<p>When asked to explain further, Dr Cheng says “it is a very specific chemical process called beta pleating. </p>
<p>What all that adds up to, is good oral health could ease the pain of not just gum disease but Alzheimer’s Disease as well. </p>
<p>Alzheimer’s Disease International predicts that the future will see an exponential global rise of people living with dementia, the umbrella term that refers to affected mental cognitive tasks. </p>
<p>Compared to the 46.8 million recorded in the 2015 World Alzheimer Report, there will be an estimated 75 million cases by 2030. And that number will rise to 131.5 million come 2050.</p>
<p>While there is yet no cure for Alzheimer’s Disease or dementia, there are preventive measures.</p>
<p>Poor oral care could lead to gingivitis which is often characterised by gum inflammation with symptoms that can range from bad breath to gums that bleed easily, are swollen or appear bright red.</p>
<p>However Dr Cheng also warns that “gingivitis frequently causes no pain and none of the signs and symptoms."</p>
<p>His advice is to visit a dental specialist regularly so that an early diagnosis can be made if any form of gum disease is present. </p>
<p>As for those already suffering dementia, it is equally important for care-givers to observe the 2-2-2 rule.</p>
<p>“This will help to keep their oral health in good condition, and provide one less area to worry about when it comes to health” says Dr Cheng.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h1> When Cancer Returns </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Despite the best care and treatment, cancer may occur in a person for a second time. A cancer recurrence, or a relapse, can happen within a few months or even decades later.</p>
<p>However, as Dr Ang Peng Tiam, Medical Director and Senior Consultant of Medical Oncology at Parkway Cancer Centre points out, not all cases of cancer have a high risk of recurrence. </p>
<p>It is for that reason that doctors continue to keep their patients under observation, therefore making regular check-ups on the part of patients, very important.</p>
<p>He adds that “whenever we see a patient with cancer, we already have a good idea what are the chances that this patient will remain cancer free.” </p>
<p>To illustrate the point, Dr Ang cites an example. “In dealing with a patient with stage 1 breast cancer, you can be pretty sure in a good 90 per cent of these patients (cancer) will not recur. </p>
<p>There is no denying that dealing with cancer, whether for the first or second time, is a strain both for patients and their loved ones. </p>
<p>“I always tell them this is very important. Don't be discouraged.”</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h5> The Science and Heart of Holistic Cancer Care </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h1> The Science and Heart of Holistic Cancer Care </h1> <div> <p>A successful cancer plan often involves both a multidisciplinary team of experts and the use of new treatment therapies.</p> </div> </div>
<p>With more than a hundred types of cancer that grow, mutate, spread and respond to treatment in different ways, finding a single cure-for-all remains elusive. </p>
<p>However, the relentless pursuit of researchers in the last few decades has led to better prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>According to Dr Ang Peng Tiam who started practising oncology in 1986, chemotherapy used to be the solution course of treatment for patients with advanced cancer. </p>
<p>However, over the past three decades, he notes a growing armamentarium of new medicines, "which are more effective in killing the cancer cells and also have lesser side effects.” </p>
<p>As Dr Ang also points out, “chemotherapy is not obsolete, it can be used alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies or immunotherapy to achieve better treatment results.”</p>
<p>The Role of Immunotherapy </p>
<p>Immunotherapy is one of the latest buzzwords in the treatment arena.</p>
<p>“Because the treatment is specific to one’s immune system, and not specific to any individual cancer, it’s effective in a broad range of cancers” he adds.</p>
<p>Dr Quek has also observed that the side effects from immunotherapy are much more tolerable, with treatment outcomes resulting in "longer survival and a better quality of life." </p>
<p>Targeted Therapy and Monoclonal Antibodies </p>
<p>With newer treatments generally being less toxic, experts have observed that patients have become more willing to stick with their treatment regimen.</p>
<p>Alongside immunotherapy, another treatment that oncologists can administer is targeted therapy. </p>
<p>“Targeted therapy can also affect the tissue environment that helps the cancer cell to grow and survive. For example, we can target the blood vessel cells, thereby cutting off the blood supply and starving the cancer cells of the nutrients.”</p>
<p>Oncologists can also prescribe treatment using monoclonal antibodies, which as Dr Ang explains “can disrupt the signaling network that drives the cancer cell to grow”. </p>
<p>He says that both targeted therapy and monoclonal antibodies treatments are largely without significant side effects.</p>
<p>“This means that as long as the disease is responding to the treatment, patients can continue to use these drugs for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>A Multidisciplinary Approach </p>
<p>In treating each cancer patient and their complex affliction, a treatment plan often means that the medical oncologists do not work alone. </p>
<p>Often, both Dr Ang and Dr Quek draw on Parkway Cancer Centre’s multidisciplinary team of surgeons, radiation specialists and pathologists, just to name a few.</p>
<p>As Dr Quek points out, “cancer is a complex disease and it takes a whole, big team to cure cancer.”</p>
<p>Such knowledge sharing therefore allows the experts to plan the treatment options for each individual patient.</p>
<p>Science and Heart of Cancer Care</p>
<p>With the growing ability to study cancers at a molecular level, Dr Ang is excited about the potential it holds for personalised cancer care. </p>
<p>“Precision medicine means that it's not one-size-fits all, it is really to find the most appropriate treatment for that individual patient” he says.</p>
<p>“But for the patient, it makes a tremendous difference … their quality of life is much better and also the effectiveness of the treatment is much higher.”</p>
<p>As for Dr Quek, he is optimistic over immunotherapy’s success in treating earlier stages of cancer and when treatment is applied immediately after surgery to prevent cancer relapses. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Health Matters </a> </p> <h1> Advances and Options in Cancer Treatment </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Whenever the word “Cancer” is used, the next word that comes to mind is “Chemotherapy”. </p>
<p>While this form of drug treatment is closely associated with cancer management, it is not the only course of treatment that an oncologist would prescribe.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, targeted therapy, which emerged globally as a treatment option over a decade ago, works by targeting cancer cells without affecting a person’s normal cells.</p>
<p>Dr Ang adds that some cancers can also be treated by deploying monoclonal antibodies which block specific receptors found on the surface of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Another major advancement in the management of cancer is immunotherapy. A more recently approved form of treatment, immunotherapy uses a person's own immune system to fight cancer. </p>
<p>As Dr Ang explains, “immunotherapy acts by unveiling the 'camouflage' used by the cancer cells to hide itself from the body’s immune system, so that our immune system may be able to detect these cancer cells and eradicate them.”</p>
<p>“Very often, we will combine chemotherapy together with immunotherapy or combine chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies” says Dr Ang. </p>
<p>“These are all methods in which we will deploy to get the best possible results in terms of either controlling the disease or even curing the cancers.”</p>
<p>Apart from treatment, early detection also plays an important role in helping a person overcome cancer.</p>
<p>Dr Ang points out that “it is very important to try to diagnose cancer as early as possible.” </p>
<p>“In early stage cancer, surgery alone may be enough to eradicate the disease and achieve a good chance of a cure.”</p>
<p>Receiving a diagnosis of cancer, often comes with a tumult of questions and fears.</p>
<p>So Dr Ang offers this piece of sound advice.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things when you're diagnosed with cancer is, don't panic.”</p>
<p>“There are many advances in cancer management. It is very important to keep calm and listen to your doctor” he says.</p>
<p>With close to 30 years in the field of cancer treatment, Dr Ang agrees that it could be helpful to seek a second opinion. But what’s most crucial is the first step.</p>
<p>“Always remember, the first treatment is the most important treatment, as that gives you the best chance of a cure.”</p>
<p>Dr Ang also shared his insights with participants at a recent webinar, where new treatment methods such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy were discussed in depth.</p>

<div> <p> CNA Lifestyle </p> <h1> Woman accuses Sex And The City actor Chris Noth of groping </h1> <div> <p>The woman said Noth kissed her, "forcibly pulled" her against him and began squeezing her breasts during the 2002 encounter. </p> </div> </div>
<p>A New York musician on Thursday (Dec 23) accused Sex And The City actor Chris Noth of groping her nearly 20 years ago and threatening to ruin her career if she told anyone about their encounter.</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Lisa Gentile made the accusation following a Dec 16 Hollywood Reporter story that said two women, whose real names they did not disclose, had accused Noth of sexual assault in 2004 and 2015.</p>
<p>Noth called those allegations "categorically untrue".</p>
<p>The actor's representatives had no comment on Thursday about the accusations from Gentile, who spoke at a news conference on Zoom with attorney Gloria Allred.</p>
<p>Gentile said she met Noth in 1998 at a New York City restaurant they frequented. One night in 2002, the actor offered her a ride home and asked to see her apartment.</p>
<p>She said Noth kissed her, "forcibly pulled" her against him and began squeezing her breasts. "I grabbed his hands with my hands and tried to stop it," she said.</p>
<p>Gentile said Noth also pushed her hands toward his penis. "I finally managed to push them away and get out of his grasp and yell, 'No, I don't want this.'"</p>
<p>She said Noth "stormed" out and called her the next day, saying he would "ruin her career" if she told anyone about what had happened.</p>
<p>Noth, 67, is known for playing Mr Big, the on-again, off-again romantic partner of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw, in the HBO television series and new sequel And Just Like That.</p>
<p>Noth had said the encounters detailed in The Hollywood Reporter were consensual and that "no always means no – that is a line I did not cross".</p>
<p>Parker and co-stars Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis said in a statement on Monday that they were "deeply saddened" to hear the allegations made against Noth.</p>

<h1> Thank you notes, flowers, smiles: What drives Singapore's young buskers to play their hearts out </h1>
<div> <p>CNA Lifestyle met up with with three musicians and a circus artist to find out why they chose performing on streets instead of stages, and what they look forward to once restrictions are lifted.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Maxine Koh </a> </div> </div>
<a>turned to the online space</a> – but without the usual crowds and favoured locations, busking in the limelight has been a challenge.
<p>Why do they decide to give their all in front of people in public places? What motivates them to perform?</p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle met three musicians and a circus artist to find out what makes them tick. </p>
<p>MUHAMMAD FIRDAUS OSMAN: "I GET TO MAKE SOMEONE'S DAY"</p>
<p>“I’m the busker that always performs during Valentine’s Day.” </p>
<p>Over the years, Muhammad Firdaus Osman, better known as Fyrdauz Macbeth, has built a reputation as the singer who plays oldies and love songs near Orchard Road’s Mandarin Gallery.</p>
<p>“Typically, lovebirds will be sitting at Wisma Atria’s steps, listening to my love songs,” the 27-year-old recalled. “People will come to me saying ‘Hey, thank you for making our night’.”</p>
<p>From his years performing on the holiday, one memory in particular stands out. </p>
<p>Amidst the couples that stopped for his performance, one solitary audience member approached Osman saying, “You really made my day. Although today is Valentine’s Day, I just broke up with my girlfriend. So thank you for that.”</p>
<p>“It happened twice; two different people, two different years,” Osman recalled. “I’m thankful that I made their day at least.”</p>
<p>Armed with his guitar and a sign that says “I busk to make the world a better place”, the singer-songwriter began busking five years ago. </p>
<p>What started out as a side job quickly evolved into a full time career as Osman discovered that he could make a living doing what he loved.</p>
<p>“Music makes me free,” he said. ”The feeling is just magical. I get to see different faces, make new friends… and sometimes just make someone’s day.”</p>
<p>As the pandemic brought a halt to live busking performances, Osman turned to a career as an electrical engineer to make ends meet. </p>
<p>However, he hopes to continue busking once restrictions lift, because it gives him the freedom to sing outside and get known. </p>
<p>JASON YU: "IT TAKES AWAY THE STRESS"</p>
<p>Now an established singer-songwriter, Jason Yu, 27, first turned to busking to jumpstart his music career. </p>
<p>“I started about five years ago, right after ORD-ing,” he explained. “I’ve always wanted to get into music… but I never really put myself out there because I was too unprepared and too scared to approach a bar and ask them if a slot is available.”</p>
<p>At the time, busking presented a less intimidating option for him as a budding artiste. </p>
<p>“It takes away the stress because when you’re busking, you don’t really have to pander to anyone… You’re just going out there and performing, no one has to watch you… there’s just no expectations.”</p>
<p>Having recently released his own EP, Yu noted that busking has been a viable way for him to gain a foothold in the music industry. </p>
<p>“Busking itself was a great marketing tool because I was literally a standing advertisement,” he said, noting that he used to regularly perform to a crowd of 50 to 100 people. </p>
<p>“Before I started busking I never thought that would be possible… From there I kind of built a following and an audience.”</p>
<p>Speaking to aspiring musicians, he said, “Busking is an amazing way for anyone to get started, because the barrier of entry is really low.”</p>
<p>“It’s really accessible, even to beginners. If you're somewhat good and somewhat talented, you can start attracting attention to your art and your performance already.”</p>
<h2> How do you get started in busking? </h2>
<li>Complete and send in your application to the National Arts Council (NAC) at http://www.nac.gov.sg/Busking</li>
<li>Attend a pre-audition briefing</li>
<li>Audition for your Busking Card. Busking acts can range anywhere from street theatre to visual arts</li>
<li>You’re set! Once you’re endorsed under the busking scheme, you can perform on the streets as long as you display your Busking Card</li>
<div> <div> <div><p>EUNICE AMOR OH: "YOU GET TO CREATE THAT SPACE THAT PEOPLE CAN STEP INTO"</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>“During my first time busking, there was an old man who plucked a flower from the bushes along the road and gave it to me.”</p>
<p>When Eunice Amor Oh, 23, first started busking at 18 years old, one thing that surprised her was how supportive Singapore’s crowds could be.</p>
<p>“That really lifted my spirits… It was a very heartwarming experience that I don’t think I would have had outside of busking.”</p>
<p>In order to raise enough funds for university, Oh began busking nearly four years ago while working two other jobs. </p>
<p>Once school started, her busking sets were interspersed with performances at weddings and events. </p>
<p>Despite other performance and career opportunities, Oh decided that she wanted to return to busking after finishing her degree.</p>
<p>Speaking about how busking contributes to Singapore’s landscape, she said, “When it comes to busking you get to create that space… that experience that people can step into.”</p>
<p>“It’s like (buskers) are inviting you into their home, you enter it and you witness a whole other world.”</p>
<p>JONATHAN GOH: "SHE SAID SHE SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW MONTHS"</p>
<p>It’s not every day you come face to face with a homegrown circus artist.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Jonathan Goh, busker and co-chair of Buskers Association Singapore, used to busk full time along Orchard Road and Clarke Quay.</p>
<p>“I mainly do circus performances. So we do juggling, acrobatics, sometimes stuff that risks my life,” the 25-year-old smiled, breaking down an act that involves juggling knives while balancing a board rolling on top of a tin.</p>
<p>“I really enjoy (busking). There’s so much stuff that I see in the street versus, say, a corporate show.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Goh has witnessed a growing demand for his circus act, fielding performance offers from Esplanade and different corporations. </p>
<p>In spite of this, he treasures busking because of the intimacy it creates with his audiences. </p>
<p>“Kids coming up to me saying they enjoyed my show, or a family coming down specially for my show... that's what I treasured a lot,” he said.</p>
<p>“She said that she smiled for the first time in a few months, and (before that) she almost wanted to end things.”</p>
<p>“These are moments that tell me why I do what I do. That keeps me going whenever I feel like giving up… (remembering) that someone out there will benefit from watching (my) show.”</p>
<p>Since the busking ban, the performer has turned to food delivery as his main source of income.</p>
<p>Knowing the challenges that buskers face, Goh started Buskers Association Singapore to act as a voice and source of support for buskers.</p>
<p>"What I would always tell aspiring buskers is that, if they want to try busking, they have to just do it!"</p>
<p>He added, "It’s as easy as just applying for the endorsement and heading down to the street... If you have no idea where to start, there is always a busker somewhere in Singapore who is willing to share with you, just message them or talk to them."</p>
<p>If you want to catch some buskers in action, the Buskers’ Association Singapore have lined up nightly performances this month at Our Tampines Hub Festive Plaza, from Dec 24 to 26.</p>

<div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Chris Martin says Coldplay will stop making music as a band in 2025 </h1> <div> <p>Martin said the band might work on collaborations after that, but “the Coldplay catalogue, as it were, finishes then".</p> </div> </div>

<p>Chris Martin, lead singer of British band Coldplay, has revealed that the group will stop making new music together in 2025.</p>
<p>In the clip, Martin said: "Our last proper record will come out in 2025, and after that I think we will only tour.”</p>
<p>He added that the band might work on collaborations, but “the Coldplay catalogue, as it were, finishes then".</p>
<p>Whiley admitted that she’s "never quite sure if he's joking or being deadly serious" but added that he appeared “disarmingly honest”.</p>
<p>Martin had alluded in past interviews that there’ll be an end to the band making new records, although he had never specified when. </p>
<p>In October, he told UK music publication NME that the band intended to make 12 albums before calling it a day “because it’s a lot to pour everything into making them”. Coldplay released their ninth album, Music Of The Spheres, that same month. </p>
<p>The band is kicking off a world tour in 2022 with eco-friendly initiatives such as a kinetic dance floor that can generate electricity when fans jump on it, and a tree planted for every ticket sold. </p>

<h1> Online and on air, but buskers still waiting to perform live </h1>
<div> <p>While Singapore is opening up, live outdoor performances remain banned. Some buskers have turned to other jobs while others persist in performing – in whatever form they can.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Busker and circus performer Jonathan Goh felt frustrated when he cycled along Orchard Road last Christmas. </p>
<p>The crowds were there and so was his “stage”, but instead of wowing the shoppers with his juggling and acrobatics, he was delivering food, the 25-year-old told CNA.</p>
<p>While there was hope earlier this year that things may return to normal, renewed spikes in COVID-19 cases repeatedly dashed the hopes of performers like him.</p>
<p>It has been 18 months since Singapore’s “circuit breaker” in April last year, but Mr Goh and other buskers have yet to get the go-ahead to perform on the streets.</p>
<p>They have not stood still – some turned to virtual performances, some went on TV and some pivoted to other trades. Meanwhile, Mr Goh started an association to represent the community and wants to nudge fellow buskers to explore their art form.</p>
<p>Whatever they chose, the young buskers CNA spoke to said that the desire to perform live was still strong. </p>
<h2>TAKING THE LEAP ONLINE</h2>
<p>Mr Cliff Lee, who goes by the moniker “OFFTHECLIFF”, remembers how he sang his heart out during his last busking session – belting out songs for more than four hours near Holland Drive Food Centre.</p>
<p>“I felt my life just crumble, it felt like it was the end for me,” he said, when he heard that busking had to stop along with live events. “But music cannot stop, because I think it’s essential.”</p>
<p>Many buskers turned to online streaming in the initial period during the circuit breaker, but most have since stopped as the returns were paltry compared to before. </p>
<p>Mr Lee, 33, said that when people stayed home, he got a sizeable audience and reasonable earnings, but that tapered off once Phase 2 started in July 2020 and Singapore began gradually reopening.</p>
<p>There was a period where his earnings fell “almost to zero”, he said.</p>
<p>He started teaching music again and at his “lowest point”, he also started writing songs. “During that period I was very down so I started writing a song to encourage myself,” he said.</p>
<p>“You actually reach a whole audience that you’ll never meet on the streets,” he reflected.</p>
<h2>“I MISS PERFORMING LIVE”</h2>
<p>That’s not the case for Mr Lai Zi Jie, aka the Pudgy Busker, who used to perform regularly outside The Cathay.</p>
<p>“I did a few online recordings, a few online gigs, but to be honest, I'm not a huge fan … there's no interaction, you’re just playing to the camera,” said the 29-year-old.</p>
<p>Instead, he’s gone into something totally different – expanding a car grooming business. </p>
<p>Before COVID-19, Mr Lai focused on performing whether on the streets, at weddings or events. When the pandemic hit, he had to stop busking and about 30 wedding performances were cancelled. </p>
<p>He had started a car grooming business as a safeguard against the vagaries of busking, but he’s now glad that he did.</p>
<p>“You don't dare put all your eggs in one basket, and busking is very volatile because you're dependent on the weather and if it’s the rainy season, you may have no income,” he said.</p>
<p>For now, he spends substantially more time on the business than on music. The income is much more stable than busking but the level of “fun and enjoyment … cannot fight”, he laughed.</p>
<p>“When music comes back. I will definitely pursue it ... with the car grooming company running as well. I miss performing live, definitely.”</p>
<h2>FROM BUSKING TO BROADCAST</h2>
<p>A year-and-a-half after he had to stop performing at Haji Lane, Mohamed Fairuz Abdul Rahim joined a song-writing competition broadcast on Malay TV channel Suria.</p>
<p>Projek Lagu got close to 200 submissions, and Mr Fairuz, with his friend Wawan Husen, a Suria star, were among 12 contestants who made it on air.</p>
<p>The duo made it through 10 episodes of the show to the finale on Nov 9 with four competitors but didn’t win the grand prize.</p>
<p>The song they entered in the competition Cuba Lagi (“Try Again” in Malay), was written a few years ago but has an uplifting message for these times.</p>
<p>“Basically, it's about life, you shouldn't give up hope even when COVID hits. So we need to keep on trying wherever it is,” said Mr Fairuz, 33.</p>
<p>“Just try and try, don’t give up … that’s the message behind the song.”</p>
<p>For the busker, who was a fixture at Haji Lane for a decade, losing that part of his life was a big blow and besides some music production, he’s also working as a kitchen assistant.</p>
<p>On top of that, he and other Haji Lane buskers are collaborating on an album, to be released next year. </p>
<p>“We still need to move on and continue on with our lives. But busking is a really important part of my life,” he said. “I don’t know how other people see busking … for me, it’s really (my) passion.</p>
<p>“It's not only about money, but it's also about the connection between the performer and the audience.”</p>
<h2>DELIVERING FOOD AND COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>Busker Jonathan Goh, who is part of acrobatic duo The Annoying Brothers, said like other buskers, he picked up another job to make ends meet. But he has also been busy preparing for the eventual restart of street performances.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, he created the Singapore Buskers Facebook group which grew from five or six people to more than 500 today, not all of whom are buskers. </p>
<p>There are about 300 buskers registered with the National Arts Council in Singapore, with one in two below 35 years old.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr Goh started the Buskers’ Association which he described as the “NTUC”, or a union, for buskers.</p>
<p>A co-chair of the association, he feels that performing virtually is not sustainable, especially for acts like his. </p>
<p>“The virtual space is now overly saturated,” he said, pointing out that even big stars held concerts online during the pandemic. </p>
<p>“You can’t expect Ronaldo to play e-sports ... so why are you expecting the buskers to go become streamers?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You feel the adrenaline rush with the performer when you're in the same space.”</p>
<p>He’s now started a new programme called Buskers’ Lab, with funding from National Arts Council, to create a “safe, experimental space” so that the street performers can collaborate and create new, innovative acts.</p>
<p>“I can sing better, I can juggle better, but … what can we do to present it differently?” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, he’s pushing for the performances to be in an outdoor space and is applying for approval to stage a show with safe management measures in place, he said.</p>
<p>While there were busking pilots organised by the National Arts Council earlier, they have been suspended since community cases began rising around May this year and the first round of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions began.</p>
<p>This was a major disappointment for Mr Goh and many other buskers, who had hoped that some form of outdoor entertainment could resume after a year of not performing.</p>
<p>“Last year, everyone was patiently waiting … but this year, it was like someone is driving a car and keeps jamming the brakes.”</p>
<p>He said that some buskers are doing part-time jobs while waiting for things to get back to normal, while others have quit busking altogether. Some have had to dig deep into their savings, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s taking the opportunity to “create conversation” and make the community more tight-knit, he said.</p>
<p>“I think this is very important … If you have a segregated community, it's very, very hard for things to move forward."</p>
