<h4>A chef’s mission: Make plants irresistible</h4>
<p>Eight courses sound like a lot, but they’re presented so that something light (or lighthearted) might follow something weighty.</p>
<p>A host of memorable restaurants has rolled out during the pandemic. Dedicated to the good life, in all respects, Oyster Oyster leads the pack.</p>
<p>Dinner Tuesday through Saturday. Indoor seating only.</p>
<p>Tasting menu $75, wine pairing $55.</p>
<p>No takeout or delivery. Proof of vaccination required. Because of a step at the entrance, wheelchair users should enter via door to the left of the storefront; ADA-compliant restroom.</p>
<h3><i>2</i> Reveler’s Hour</h3>
<h4>A pasta and wine bar that deserves to stick around</h4>
<p>The owners publicly declared they’re in trouble in September — “down to our last four weeks,” says Jill Tyler, hostess with the mostest at what’s become the first place I think of on a rare night off from table hopping.</p>
<p>Dinner Tuesday through Sunday Saturday. Indoor seating only.</p>
<p>Takeout Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday, no delivery. Proof of vaccination or negative test required. No barriers to entry (door is automatic); ADA-compliant restrooms.</p>

<p>Takeout and delivery. No barriers to entry; ADA-compliant restrooms.</p>
<h3><i>4</i> Unconventional Diner</h3>
<h4>A French chef’s take on next-level comfort food</h4>
<p>The diner’s lively, art- and plant-stocked dining rooms are bridged by a long stretch of bar, my preferred place to eat and drink — when I’m not enjoying Deshaies’s happy meals at home, that is.</p>
<p>Brunch and dinner daily. Indoor and outdoor seating.</p>
<h4>A 32-year-old classic gets a modern makeover</h4>
<p>Dinner daily, lunch weekdays. Indoor and private outdoor seating.</p>
<h3><i>6</i> Caruso’s Grocery</h3>
<h4>Old-school Italian, done just right</h4>
<p>The appeal extends to the liquids and the hospitality: The $10 cocktails are improvements on throwbacks, and a spot on your shirt (hello, tomato sauce!) is followed by the offer of a Tide stick from a server.</p>
<p>1401 Pennsylvania Ave. SE.</p>
<p>Dinner Wednesday through Sunday. Indoor seating.</p>
<p>Takeout, no delivery. No barriers to entry, but wheelchair users might need assistance with the two front doors; ADA-compliant restrooms.</p>

<h3><i>8</i> Ruthie’s All-Day</h3>
<h4>Southern flair, from morning to night</h4>

<p>3411 Fifth St. South, Arlington, Va.</p>

<p>Entrees with sides $14-$43.</p>
<h4>Casual comforts from a four-star chef</h4>
<h4>Sandwiches $12-$14, pizzas $32</h4>

<p>Dinner Tuesday through Saturday. No on-site seating.</p>
<p>Sandwiches $12-$14, large pizzas $32.</p>
<p>Takeout, no delivery. Orders retrieved outside; no access to restaurant.</p>
<h4>Creative takes on Korean dishes in Annandale</h4>

<h4>An abundance of dim sum</h4>
<h4>Bites, small and large plates $2-$13</h4>

<p>301-251-7878 (Rockville location).</p>

<h4>Levantine dishes straight from a chef’s heart</h4>
<h4>Shareable entrees $52-$65</h4>
<p>[At long last, Albi gets to the heart of Levantine cooking]</p>
<p>A little card on the table explains Levantine ingredients; a sommelier with a sense of taste (and humor) identifies the perfect quaff for dinner. No restaurant can be all things to all diners, but I like how this one goes right for the hugs.</p>
<p>Mezze $16-$25, shareable entrees $52-$65. Sofra tasting menu $95, chef’s table at the hearth $150 per person.</p>
<p>No takeout or delivery. No barriers to entry; ADA-compliant restroom.</p>

<p>Pastas $24-$30, wood-fired entrees $28-$39.</p>

<h4>A southern Indian standout in Gaithersburg</h4>
<p>[Head to Chennai Hoppers for some of the area’s best Indian cooking]</p>
<p>The restaurant takes heat requests seriously. Rajoo adjusts the level with a combination of roasted black peppercorns and dried red chiles. Going in, even hot heads might want to ask for “medium” spice.</p>

<p>Four-course menu $95 per person; a la carte bar menu $28-$33.</p>
<h4>Where ‘Indian-ish’ food sparkles</h4>
<p>The most dramatic restaurant entrance in Washington? My vote goes to Daru, whose black-and-glass door commands attention with concentric white rings inspired by Himalayan mandalas and a welcome written in Sanskrit: The guest is god.</p>
<p>[Rasika veterans serve memorable ‘Indian-ish’ food and drink at Daru]</p>
<p>The entrance catches your eye at Daru. The food, drink and hospitality — even early in its game — win your fandom.</p>
<p>Dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Indoor and outdoor seating.</p>

<h4>Mussels, waffles and cozy consistency</h4>
<p>[Classic, well-executed dishes keep this Belgian veteran ticking]</p>
<p>Desserts — chocolate mousse, floating island, profiteroles — run to the classic. The most Belgian of them all, though, is a waffle — chocolate, served with white chocolate whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Voila!, for sure.</p>
<p>Dinner daily, lunch Tuesday through Friday, brunch weekends. Indoor and outdoor seating.</p>
<p>Entrees $19-$48 (for whole sole).</p>
<p>Takeout and delivery. No barriers to entry; ADA-compliant restrooms.</p>
<h4>A wine-country gem with a sense of humor</h4>
<p>Would you like to sit outside, on a covered patio or in a cabana resembling a Japanese teahouse? Prefer to sit indoors, in view of the animated open kitchen or in a room that dates to the 1790s and is said to get visits from a ghost?</p>
<p>P.S. Reported by mediums, the ghost in the oldest dining room is harmless. Wavra says she moves the votives on the mantle only when “nobody is there.”</p>

<p>Not into crab? Not to worry. Other delicious options include spicy steamed shrimp, fish and chips staged in a fry basket and tacos (pork or fish) distinguished by their two-ply cradles: a soft flour tortilla lined with a fried corn tortilla.</p>

<div><p>The weight of that wine bottle doesn’t indicate quality, and it’s hurting the planet</p></div>
<p>“I like the convenience of boxes,” Whitman told me. “The wine stays fresh for six weeks after opening, so I don’t have to finish it in one or two sittings. And I wanted a weekend wine that I could drink on Tuesday.”</p>
<div><p>Wine critics should consider a bottle’s social and environmental impact, too, one vintner says</p></div>
<div><p>Here’s the rub: Wineries are reluctant to put wine in boxes because consumers regard boxed wine as inferior. And with good reason. Most of it is. If we want better wine in boxes, we need to demand it. And buy it when we find it.</p></div>
