<h3>An Example of Passive-Aggressive Treatment at Work</h3>
<a>emotional intelligence</a>, and
<a>conscientiousness</a> made her successful, but Colleen also put a lot of pressure on herself to make other people happy.
<p>When Colleen shared this with me, I knew it was time to re-empower her and take back control from this passive-aggressive co-worker.</p>
<h3>Signs of Passive-Aggressive Behavior in the Workplace</h3>
<a>jealous</a>, or upset, but they mask their emotions through indirect hostility. A passive-aggressive colleague may act this way because of upbringing, low
<a>confidence</a>, or poor conflict-resolution skills, to name a few.
<p>Passive-aggressive behavior in the workplace can be subtle and hard to spot. It includes:</p>
<li>Procrastinating or leaving tasks unfinished</li>
<li>A cynical attitude or air of superiority</li>
<li>Disguised insults and non-compliments</li>
<li>Never giving a straight answer</li>
<li>Rejecting other viewpoints and feedback</li>
<li>Saying they feel under-appreciated</li>
<a>toxic workplace</a> environment. Left unchecked it can erode employee morale and contribute to
<a>burnout</a>, even if you otherwise enjoy the work you do.
<h3>How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Co-worker</h3>
<p>Shutting down passive-aggressive patterns in the workplace can be tricky. It takes time and patience. But learning to short circuit this unproductive cycle can make you more confident and effective.</p>
<p>1. See beyond the surface.</p>
<a>fear</a> – fear of rejection, fear of missing out, fear of not being good enough. Recognizing their
<a>motivation</a> helps you put their behavior in perspective, make space for a modicum of empathy, and pause to choose how you want to respond.
<p>4. Build better boundaries.</p>
<p>5. Take ego out of communication.</p>
<a>assertiveness</a> can help defuse resistance and bolster cooperation.
<p>6. Set limits and follow through.</p>
<p>7. Adopt an open-door policy.</p>
<p>Encouraging two-way communication helps head off passive-aggressive patterns before they start. By doing so, you help create a psychologically safe workplace where healthy, constructive problem-solving can thrive.</p>

<h1> 18 Signs That You're Dealing with a Passive-Aggressive Person </h1>
<h2> 6. Complains about being underappreciated. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Passive aggression is a way of expressing negative emotions in indirect ways.</li>
<li>Passive aggression involves a series of verbal, non-verbal, and evasive techniques that indicate discontent without ever saying it.</li>
<li>Passive aggression can include denial, distortion, cruelty, and silence.</li>
<a>aggression</a> is a way of expressing negative feelings in indirect rather than direct ways. Instead of having open, honest conversations about how they feel wronged, the individual may use hints, silence,
<a>denial</a>, and other subtle tactics to communicate their discontent. Here are 18 of the most common signs of passive aggression:
<p>1. Denies anger while enacting it indirectly</p>
<p>A <a>passive-aggressive</a> person may deny that they feel angry to avoid a direct confrontation and uncomfortable feelings. </p>
<p>2. Hints instead of stating need or complaint directly</p>
<p>3. Sulks, sighs, and pouts</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person will sometimes verbally and visually express their discontent in ways that clearly indicate their unhappiness, as with sighing, pouting, or sulking, but fail to actually address it in meaningful ways. </p>
<p>4. Has a sullen attitude </p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may act sullenly in place of direct confrontation. This tactic typically co-occurs with denial that anything is wrong. </p>
<p>5. Fails to follow through or uses intentional inefficiency</p>
<p>6. Complains about feeling wronged and underappreciated</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may never address their issues, but they will likely tally and keep track of times that they have felt wronged by others. This silent scorekeeping justifies the subtle, passive behaviors that they enact. </p>
<p>8. Gives backhanded compliments</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may give backhanded compliments as a way to hurt the other person under the guise of maintaining an amicable connection. </p>
<p>9. Acts out aggression physically</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may slam doors, move things around loudly, or use other physical means of getting their point across without words. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pexels: Liza Summer</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>10. Uses the silent treatment</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may decide to punish another person by shutting down all communication instead of addressing the issue directly. </p>
<p>11. Insists the conflict is resolved without letting it go</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person will struggle to move through conflict maturely because it is never actually addressed. Nevertheless, they may claim that everything is fine while harboring resentment and frustration.</p>
<p>12. Feels they are doing everybody a favor </p>
<p>13. Resents those who want to have a direct conversation</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may act out by sabotaging a loved one, by doing things like inviting a budget-conscious friend out for an expensive meal or planning an event at a time that is knowingly difficult for the other person.</p>

<p>15. Insists that others are simply misunderstanding them</p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may deflect possible direct conflict by insisting that the other person is simply misunderstanding their words and that that is their responsibility. </p>
<p>16. Distances from the person without saying why</p>
<p>17. Talks to uninvolved parties about what’s wrong </p>
<p>A passive-aggressive person may find comfort in addressing their concerns with a third party whom they can vent to as a means of letting off steam without ever having to address the issue directly. </p>
<p>18. Create an eggshell situation</p>
<a>fear</a> of setting them off. This fear may be compounded by helplessness to get out of the cycle and resentment toward the passive-aggressive person who is unwilling to speak directly.

<h2> Verbal abusers override conversational principles to control their victims. </h2>
<li>When we conversationally imply something without explicitly saying it, we rely on "violations" of conversational norms.</li>

<p>You are no doubt familiar with instances of verbal abuse that wear their name on the sleeve, as it were. Say you're at the store when you hear a woman ask her companion: "Do you think we need more milk?"</p>
<p>Her companion gets in her face and yells: "How the f**k would I know? Why didn't you check before we left? You're always wasting my time."</p>
<p>To your dismay, the first woman quietly apologizes to her companion.</p>
<p>"OMG," you think to yourself. "That's one toxic relationship. Thank goodness none of my connections are that bad."</p>
<p>But it's possible that your own connections (romantic or otherwise) differ not in kind but only in degree from the one you encountered.</p>
<p>Abusive anger, e.g. yelling, screaming, swearing, slurring, and name-calling, is only one type of verbal abuse. Another category exploits violations of conversational norms as a tool for the abuser to retain or regain power.</p>
<h3>Verbal Abuse and Paul Grice's Conversational Maxims</h3>
<p>The linguist and philosopher Paul Grice argued that most people tend to follow a cooperative principle, which comprises four norms, or maxims:</p>
<li>Quality: Only say what you believe to be true and backed by evidence.</li>
<li>Quantity: Don't say more or less than the conversation calls for.</li>
<li>Relevance: Don't say anything that is irrelevant to the current topic of the exchange.</li>
<li>Manner: Be clear, for instance, avoid ambiguity and obscure or cryptic expressions.</li>
<p>Receptionist: You said it's your first time with us?</p>
<p>Jamie: Yeah—of course, I've been to the dentist before but we just moved here from New York. Well, actually, we stopped for five days at my sister's in Cleveland on our way here. They just had their first baby, and....</p>
<p>Receptionist: Just fill out this paperwork. You can sit down over there.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Brie: Do you want to watch a movie?</p> <p>Andy: My dog is called Zeus.</p> </blockquote>
<p>The silent treatment and <a>ghosting</a> are extreme violations of the maxim of quantity.</p>
<p>Violating Grice's maxims isn't always a bad thing. In fact, we violate them all the time when we assume the listener can work out what we meant to imply.</p>
<p>While implied meanings (or "Gricean implicatures") are prevalent in ordinary language, verbal abusers sometimes exploit violations of Grice's maxims as a tool of abuse.</p>
<p>As with other forms of <a>psychological abuse</a>, the verbal abuser's ultimate purpose in abusing their victims is to chip away at the latter's <a>confidence</a> and sense of self and thereby retain or regain power.</p>
<h3>Verbal Abuse that Violates the Maxim of Quality</h3>
<p>Several subtypes of verbal abuse exploit violations of the maxim of quality. What these subtypes share in common is that the abuser knows that their statements are false or lack evidence. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>While sarcasm can sometimes be used as a form of humor, hurtful sarcasm is a form of verbal abuse that violates the maxim of quality. Abusers who exploit sarcasm as verbal abuse attacks others by saying the opposite of what they mean. Examples:</p>
<ol><li>"It was great to meet your new beau. Wish I had a boyfriend with as many blackheads."</li> <li>"That mustard stain goes really well with your new hair color."</li> <li>"Have another doughnut, so you can keep up that double-chin."</li> </ol>
<p>In trivializing, the abuser seeks to make the victim's accomplishments seem insignificant, despite the fact that they know that their trivializing statements are false or lack evidence. Examples:</p>
<li>"You painted the living room. So what?"</li>
<li>"Did you really just refer to your college degree? I would hardly call that a college degree. They have an 80 percent acceptance rate."</li>
<li>"You write poetry? I always found that to be a waste of time."</li>
<p>Some verbal abusers purposely make condescending or patronizing statements about you, despite knowing that their statements are false or lack evidential backing. Examples:</p>
<li>"You have no <a>sense of humor</a>. Maybe that's why no one likes you."</li>
<li>"Do you really want to go for a walk by yourself? You're never going to find your way back. Not with your sense of direction."</li>
<li>"You know nothing about money. Just leave the money decisions to me."</li>
<p>In undermining, the abuser violates the maxim of quality by making negative statements about your suggestions, opinions, or arguments, despite knowing their statements are false or lack evidence. Examples:</p>
<li>"I can't believe you insist on voting when you don't understand <a>politics</a>."</li>
<li>"Are you really suggesting we go out for sushi? That's really dumb. You know we always leave hungry."</li>
<li>"That's the stupidest argument I have heard so far."</li>
<p>Gas Lighting is an attempt to make you question your perception, your <a>memory</a>, and even your sanity. Gas lighting need not be verbal in nature, but gas lighters often violate the maxim of quality.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: You said you were with John last Saturday.</p> <p>Abuser: I never said that. Your memory is terrible.</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: Did you hear that sound?</p> <p>Abuser: No. You must be hallucinating.</p> </blockquote>
<h3>Verbal Abuse That Violates the Maxim of Quantity</h3>
<p>If, however, the passerby knows that the gas station is closed or doesn't have any gas, he is violating the maxim of quantity by leaving out essential information. While he isn't lying, he is being deceitful.</p>
<p>Verbal abusers who withhold information or purposely fail to share their thoughts and feelings violate the maxim of quantity.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: I made that your favorite dish.</p> <p>Abuser: Ok.</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: Could I see your credit card statements? Perhaps I can figure out if we can make some cuts in our budget.</p> <p>Abuser: No way, you ain't gonna scrutinize my credit card statements.</p> </blockquote>
<h3>Verbal Abuse That Violates the Maxim of Relevance</h3>
<p>Blocking and diverting are forms of verbal abuse in which the abuser assumes they have the right to decide the conversational topic.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: "Something really funny happened at work today."</p> <p>Abuser: "Do we always have to talk about your workday?"</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Abuser: "Your argument is circular. I can't discuss this issue with you."</p> </blockquote>
<h3>Verbal Abuse That Violates the Maxim of Manner</h3>
<p>Verbal abusers who violate the maxim of manner may use pretentious language to make you feel unintelligent. Example:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Abuser: "I suppose you aren't acquainted with Yeats' oeuvres."</p> </blockquote>
<p>Gas lighters may use non-sequiturs as a crazy-making tactic. Example:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Victim: Do you think this table is too big for our living room?</p> <p>Abuser: Of course not, it's made of wood.</p> </blockquote>

<h1> What Makes Marriage Work? </h1>
<h2> It's how you resolve conflict that matters most. </h2>
<p> By Nan Silver published March 1, 1994 - last reviewed on June 9, 2016 </p>
<p>Research indicates you can get mad as hell or avoid conflict altogether. But the positivity must outweigh the negativity by five to one.</p>
<a>happiness</a> and believe the claim "we never fight" is a sign of marital health. But I believe we grow in our relationships by reconciling our differences. That's how we become more loving people and truly experience the fruits of marriage.
<p>o Validating. Couples compromise often and calmly work out their problems to mutual satisfaction as they arise.</p>
<p>o Volatile. Conflict erupts often, resulting in passionate disputes.</p>
<p>o Conflict-avoiding. Couples agree to disagree, rarely confronting their differences head-on.</p>
<p>Previously, many psychologists might have considered conflict-avoiding and volatile marriages to be destructive. But my research suggests that all three styles are equally stable and bode equally well for the marriage's future.</p>
<p>"HEALTHY" MARRIAGE STYLES</p>
<p>The following three newly married couples accurately illustrate the three distinct styles of marriage.</p>
<a>anger</a> boiled over. Rather than engaging in shouting matches, they dealt with their disagreements by having "conferences" in which each aired his or her perspective. Usually, they were able to arrive at a compromise.
<p>What really separates contented couples from those in deep marital misery is a healthy balance between their positive and negative feelings and actions toward each other.</p>
<a>laughing</a>, etc. Across the board I found there was a very specific ratio that exists between the amount of positivity and negativity in a stable marriage, whether it is marked by validation, volatility, or conflict avoidance.
<p>WARNING SIGNS: THE FOUR HORSEMEN</p>
<p>THE FIRST HORSEMAN: CRITICISM</p>
<p>Criticisms also tend to be generalizations. A telltale sign that you've slipped from complaining to criticizing is if global phrases like "you never" or "you always" start punctuating your exchanges:</p>
<p>Complaint: "We don't go out as much as I'd like to."</p>
<p>Criticism: "You never take me anywhere."</p>
<p>THE SECOND HORSEMAN: CONTEMPT</p>
<a>attraction</a>. The focal point of their relationship became abusiveness.
<p>Recognizing when you or your spouse is expressing contempt is fairly easy. Among the most common signs are:</p>
<p>o Insults and name-calling</p>
<p>o Body language--including sneering, rolling your eyes, curling your upper lip.</p>
<p>THE THIRD HORSEMAN: DEFENSIVENESS</p>
<p>o Denying Responsibility. No matter what your partner charges, you insist in no uncertain terms that you are not to blame.</p>
<p>o Making Excuses. You claim that external circumstances beyond your control forced you to act in a certain way.</p>
<p>o Cross-Complaining. You meet your partner's complaint (or criticism) with an immediate complaint of your own, totally ignoring what your partner has said.</p>
<p>THE FOURTH HORSEMAN: STONEWALLING</p>
<a>divorced</a>, separated, or living
<a>lonely</a>, parallel lives in the same home. Once the fourth horseman becomes a regular resident, it takes a good deal of hard work and soul-searching to save the marriage.
<p>KEYS TO IMPROVING YOUR MARRIAGE</p>
<p>EXERCISE: HOW DO WE COMPARE?</p>
<p>This exercise gives you a chance to see the strengths of your marriage by comparing yourselves to other couples in your lives.</p>
<p>1. Each of you jot down the names of four different couples you both know. Two should be examples of "bad" marriages; two of "good" marriages.</p>
<p>4. Talk about your own ability as a couple to overcome hardship. Have you weathered episodes or incidents of which you're particularly proud? If so, how did you do it?</p>
<p>Happily married couples use certain phrases and actions during an argument that prevent negativity from spiraling out of control. In effect, these conciliatory gestures act as a glue that helps to hold the marriage together during tense times.</p>
<p>1. Try to make comments about the communication process itself, such as "Please let me finish," or "We're getting off the topic," or "That hurt my feelings."</p>
<p>2. Comment on what's happening while it's taking place, not afterward.</p>
<p>3. Remind your partner that you admire and empathize with them despite the conflict.</p>
<p>4. Use phrases such as "Yes, I see," "Uh huh," or "Go on." These are little psychological strokes at which stable couples are masters.</p>

<a>attention</a>, and emotion as that of
<a>passive-aggressive behavior</a>. Among the most frequently asked questions about this universally frustrating way of expressing anger—aside from "
<a>What exactly is passive aggression?"</a> and "
<a>Why do people act this way</a>?"—is "What’s the best way to respond to
<a>passive-aggressive</a> behavior?"
<a>fear</a> of receiving a person’s anger or out of discomfort with the possibility of causing someone else
<a>shy</a> away from confrontation is that without directly addressing passive-aggressive behavior, the pattern will be played out against them again and again. For lasting results and real
<a>behavioral change</a>, benign confrontation of passive-aggressive behavior is necessary.
<a>lonely</a> and resents the fact that while her friends can go to each other’s houses or be driven to afterschool sports, she is stuck home alone with nothing to do and no one to do it with.
<p>One weekend, Christine tries to raise the issue with her mother, but is immediately shut down by her mom’s angry, <a>guilt</a>-inducing response:</p>
<a>thankful</a> for what you have and stop complaining.”
<p>Following that tirade, Christine knew this was not an issue she would ever raise again with her mother—at least, not directly. Instead, she decided that a little less responsibility might help her case.</p>
<li>“I couldn’t find my phone.”</li>
<li>“I was so involved in my homework that I forgot to text you.”</li>
<li>“I accidentally left my phone at school.”</li>
<li>“I thought I did text you!”</li>
<li>“I know I texted you, Mom! Check your phone again. Or maybe your phone isn’t working right.”</li>
<p>Let’s see how the process of benign confrontation works to address Christine’s passive-aggressive behavior toward her mother:</p>
<p>Step 1: Recognize the Pattern</p>
<div> <h2>Anger Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>The Relationship Between Empathy and Anger Is Complicated</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>"A Child's Anger Can Be a Warning"</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Step 2: Refuse to Engage</p>
<a>assertive</a> responses works for a day or two before clever Christine figures out a new way to justify her defiance against her mother’s rules. At this point, Christine’s mother knows she must take Benign Confrontation to the next level.
<p>Step 3: Affirm the Anger</p>
<p>"No, Mom. That’s not true. I’m not angry; I’m just really busy and I forget things."</p>
<p>Step 4: Manage the (Predictable) <a>Denial</a></p>
<p>"Fine. But I still wish you would let me have a friend over sometimes. It gets really lonely at home all by myself every day."</p>
<p>"Sure. I’m sorry too, Mom. It’s just that I was so mad and so sad about being alone and I didn’t know how else to tell you."</p>
<p>Step 5: Revisit the Thought</p>
<p>Christine and her mother make plans for Christine to have a friend over after school three days a week and for Christine to do stage crew for the school show on Mondays so that she was only home alone on Thursdays. This arrangement worked well.</p>
<p>"I don’t know. Maybe."</p>
<p>Step 6: Affirm Areas of Competence</p>
<a>punishment</a> or belittling.
<p>Christine’s mother made it a point to compliment her daughter every time she expressed her anger in assertive, direct ways, and tried her very hardest to role model assertive anger expression whenever possible.</p>

<h1> 6 Tips for Confronting Passive-Aggressive People </h1>
<h2> 4. Know how to manage their denial. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Passive Aggression? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>passive-aggressive</a> person.
<a>passive-aggressive</a> behavior can be even more destructive to relationships than aggression. Over time, relationships with a person who is passive-aggressive will become confusing, discouraging, and dysfunctional.
<p>Below, I share a real-life passive-aggressive encounter between a husband and wife, and explain how they could confront and change this destructive pattern of interaction using the process of "benign confrontation."</p>
<p>See how the six-step process of benign confrontation plays out in this husband-wife dynamic:</p>
<p>Hayley ran to her mother with a huge, wide-awake smile: “Bedtime so fun!”</p>
<a>marriage</a> was already beginning to take its toll.
<p>Not wanting to continue harboring feelings of chronic irritation toward her husband, but also unwilling to carry all of the childcare responsibilities on her own, Kelly can use benign confrontation to communicate with Richard about the incident.</p>
<p>1. Know it when you see it.</p>
<h2>Passive-Aggression Essential Reads</h2>

<p>2. Decline the invitation to argue.</p>
<a>self-talk</a> strategies: “Richard didn’t want to put Hayley to bed tonight. Rather than telling me in words, he is showing me through this passive-aggressive behavior. I will not allow myself to get caught up in a no-win argument.”
<p>3. Acknowledge the anger.</p>
<p>When Richard returns downstairs, Kelly should share her thoughts about his underlying anger.</p>
<p>RICHARD: We were just having some fun. Geez. Why can’t you just relax a little?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: conrado/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>4. Manage the <a>denial</a>.</p>
<a>revenge</a> in a counter-passive-aggressive way, she would reinforce his original passive aggression. It will best serve Kelly to simply leave Richard with her thought, as demonstrated below:
<blockquote> <p>RICHARD: I don’t know what you are talking about. I got her to sleep, like you asked. I haven’t spent time with her all day. Lighten up!</p> <p>KELLY: Okay. It was just a thought I wanted to share with you.</p> </blockquote>
<p>5. Go there again (when necessary).</p>
<p>6. Build the relationship.</p>
