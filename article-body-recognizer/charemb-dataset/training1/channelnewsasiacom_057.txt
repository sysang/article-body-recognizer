<p>Therefore, travellers must secure self-isolation accommodation in Singapore to wait for the results, which they should receive within 24 hours. This accommodation can be a place of residence, <a>a hotel</a> or a serviced apartment.</p>
<p>Travellers should <a>register and pre-pay for on-arrival COVID-19 PCR tests</a>. If not, they will have to pay for the tests upon arrival and may face delays in being tested and allowed to leave the airport.</p>
<p>Within three days before arriving in Singapore, travellers should submit an <a>SG Arrival Card</a> with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration.</p>
<p>All travellers except those aged two and under must take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours before departure for Singapore. This test must be administered at an <a>accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country of departure.</p>
<p>Travellers should defer their trips if they have COVID-19 symptoms or have been diagnosed with or suspected to have contracted COVID-19 in the last 14 days before departing for Singapore.</p>
<p>They should also postpone their travels if they have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last 10 days before departing for Singapore.</p>
<h2>WHAT DO I DO WHEN I ARRIVE IN SINGAPORE?</h2>
<p>After clearing immigration, travellers must head straight to their self-isolation accommodation by private transport, taxi or private-hire cars. They are not allowed to use public transport.</p>
<p>Travellers can only leave their self-isolation accommodation after receiving their negative PCR test result. They will be notified by phone call or email, and they will be able to view their results on the TraceTogether app.</p>
<p>Should a traveller test positive for COVID-19, they will have to receive <a>medical treatment</a>. Prevailing medical treatment charges will apply.</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN I DO IN SINGAPORE?</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions on their itinerary in Singapore, but travellers must comply with prevailing <a>COVID-19 safe management measures</a>.</p>
<p>Social gatherings are limited to groups of two people under the current <a>Stabilisation Phase</a>, which is expected to last until Nov 21. The rule of two also applies to <a>dining in at food and beverage outlets</a> and <a>outdoor activities</a>.</p>
<p>People should limit themselves to <a>one social gathering a day</a>.</p>
<p>Up to two unique visitors are allowed to visit a household each day. </p>
<p>A maximum of 1,000 people are currently allowed to attend live performances, <a>MICE events</a> (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) and sporting events if all attendees are vaccinated.</p>
<p><a>Attractions</a>, shows, cruises and museums are currently operating at 50 per cent capacity. Tours are capped at 50 people for conveyance tours, such as Duck Tours, and 20 people for non-conveyance tours.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> FAQ: What you need to know about the Singapore-Malaysia land VTL </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Afifah Darke </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: From Nov 29, Singapore and Malaysia will begin a <a>land vaccinated travel lane (VTL)</a> via the Causeway using designated bus services. </p>
<p>There will be 32 trips each way daily between both countries, Singapore's Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced in a media release on Wednesday (Nov 24). </p>
<p>The land VTL, which launches on the same day as the VTL between <a>Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport</a>, will "be rolled out in a safe and calibrated manner", said PMO. </p>
<p>Here's what travellers need to know about entering Singapore under the quarantine-free arrangement. </p>
<h2>WHO CAN TRAVEL USING THE LAND VTL?</h2>
<p>In the first phase of the land VTL, travellers have to be citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders of the country that they are entering.</p>
<p>Therefore, entry into Singapore via land VTL will be for Singapore citizens, Singapore permanent residents and Singapore long-term pass holders. </p>
<p>Entry into Malaysia via land VTL will be for Malaysians, Malaysian permanent residents and Malaysian long-term pass holders.</p>
<p>"This is to give priority for those who have been working in either country, to visit their families," said PMO. </p>
<p>In-principle approval holders of a Singapore-issued long-term pass and foreign short-term visitors are not eligible to travel under the VTL land arrangement. </p>
<h2>WHICH ARE THE DESIGNATED BUS SERVICES?</h2>
<p>The designated bus services will be operated by two companies.</p>
<p>Transtar Travel will operate 32 daily designated trips - 16 trips from Malaysia and 16 trips from Singapore - between Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange in Singapore and Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru.</p>
<p>Handal Indah will similarly operate 32 daily trips between Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal and Queen Street Terminal in Singapore.</p>
<p>There will be 32 land VTL designated bus services entering each country per day, with a maximum capacity of 45 "fully seated" passengers per trip, said PMO. </p>
<p>That means the daily quota for the land VTL scheme will be about 2,900 travellers in total, with 1,440 passengers each way.</p>
<p>Travellers who arrive in Singapore via other means, such as private transport or walking across the Causeway, will be subjected to prevailing border control measures. </p>
<p>This includes serving a seven-day stay-home notice.</p>
<h2>HOW DO I BUY THE BUS TICKETS? </h2>
<p>Bus tickets will go on sale at 8am on Thursday on the <a>Transtar Travel</a> and <a>Handal Indah</a> websites.</p>
<p>Tickets will also be released for sale 30 days ahead. </p>
<p>Travellers are required to purchase their bus tickets at least three days prior to the date of departure. </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO TRAVEL? </h2>
<p>Travellers entering Singapore must have remained in Malaysia, any other VTL or Category I country or region as recognised by the Singapore Government, and/or Singapore in the last 14 consecutive days before arrival in Singapore.</p>
<p>They must also test negative in a valid pre-departure COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), within two calendar days before departure for Singapore.</p>
<p>These tests must be taken at a laboratory or centre that is accredited or recognised by the Malaysia Ministry of Health. </p>
<p>Children aged two and below in the calendar year are not required to undergo these tests.</p>
<p>Travellers also must be fully vaccinated, while unvaccinated children aged 12 and below must be accompanied by a vaccinated traveller.</p>
<p>All travellers are required to submit the SG Arrival Card with Electronic Health Declaration via the ICA website or through the SG Arrival Card mobile application that can be downloaded for free.</p>
<h2>WHEN CAN OTHER TRAVELLERS USE THE LAND VTL? </h2>
<p>Singapore and Malaysia aim to progressively expand the land VTL to include more travellers, including general travellers, "taking into account the public health situation", said PMO. </p>
<p>"Subsequently, we will also work towards restoring travel through Tuas Second Link," it added. </p>
<p>Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said Singapore will continue to work with Malaysia to expand the land VTL arrangement to more travellers "in the coming weeks". </p>
<p>"We seek the understanding of workers who may not be able to purchase a bus ticket to travel home immediately due to limited capacity in the initial phase of the launch," he added. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Loggers threaten Papua New Guinea's unique forest creatures </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>GOLGUBIP: In Papua New Guinea's isolated Star Mountains, indigenous people say the tree kangaroo is king and the bird of paradise is queen. But both have a price on their heads.</p>
<p>These extraordinary species have long been prized by traditional hunters, but conservationists now fear the forests they live in, one of Earth's last great wilderness areas, could soon fall to axe and bulldozer.</p>
<p>"Old people say tree kangaroo is the king," said Lloyd Leo, a young resident of Golgubip, a mountain community where most people are still subsistence farmers - their ancestors lived a Neolithic lifestyle until only decades ago.</p>
<p>"He lives high in the forest. Certain fruits he doesn't eat. He only takes the fresh ones," he explained.</p>
<p>The marsupial, which looks like a mix of a kangaroo and a lemur, was once a form of currency, used to pay bride prices. Its tail is still worn as an emblem.</p>
<p>Already the creature is listed among the planet's most threatened species, deemed critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List.</p>
<p>Two species of birds of paradise also live in the area, and one, called "karom" in the local Faiwol language, they call the queen of birds.</p>
<p>People hunt them on a small scale, despite it being illegal. The feathers and stuffed birds are prized, kept in homes and brought out for festivals.</p>
<h2>"PEOPLE WILL BECOME DESPERATE"</h2>
<p>But the trees around Golgubip are also valuable, as are others like them across Papua New Guinea - and the dual threat of deforestation and hunting may seal the fate of the nation's unique creatures.</p>
<p>"In the villages, there is a general expectation of economic development which is by and large not happening," said Vojtech Novotny, a biologist working with the New Guinea Binatang Research Centre.</p>
<p>"People will become desperate and go for development at any cost."</p>
<p>The country's population has roughly tripled since independence in 1975, and now stands at more than 9 million.</p>
<p>With fewer forests left in Southeast Asia, and much of the land there converted to palm oil plantations, some logging firms are now turning attention to Papua New Guinea, said Novotny, who has worked in the country for 25 years.</p>
<p>In the past, authorities mainly allowed "selective" logging, which enables forests to quickly recover. But that may be changing, he said.</p>
<p>"There is now pressure for large agriculture projects. The big issue here is oil palm. Once you have the first cut, you come for the second and third. Very soon you destroy the forest structure. That happened basically in Borneo," Novotny said.</p>
<p>According to the monitoring website Global Forest Watch, Papua New Guinea's forests covered 93 per cent of its land surface in 2010.</p>
<p>But the country has seen a 3.7 per cent decrease in tree cover since 2000, according to the website.</p>
<p>At this year's global UN climate summit, COP26, Papua New Guinea was among around 100 countries to <a>pledge to end deforestation by 2030</a>.</p>
<p>But illegal logging has become such a problem that non-governmental organisations and some local politicians have demanded authorities take urgent action now.</p>
<p>The Raggiana bird of paradise is featured on the country's flag and although officially only one related species, the blue bird of paradise, is listed as "vulnerable" by the IUCN, biologists say no one really knows their status for sure.</p>
<p>There are also concerns about another bird, Pesquet's parrot, which has distinctive red and black feathers that are worn in traditional dress for indigenous ceremonies.</p>
<p>"These bright red feathers are very highly prized for headdresses," said Brett Smith, curator of the Port Moresby Nature Park, adding that it appeared there were more Pesquet's parrot feathers now in tribal dress than on living birds.</p>
<p>Biologists say they want to involve more Papua New Guineans in conservation.</p>
<p>But it has proved hard, in the face of poverty, a lack of education and low awareness of the impact humans can have on the environment.</p>
<p>But there have been success stories.</p>
<p>As headhunting declined in the pig-nosed turtles' habitat, more people moved in and the rare creature became part of the local diet, according to Yolarnie Amepou, director of the Piku Biodiversity Network.</p>
<p>But by involving local children in the preservation of key species, they created a generation - now adults - invested in the pig-nosed turtles' survival. Hunting has now eased off.</p>
<p>She said: "This environment is what they depend on every day. If we want to save the turtle we have to fix the people."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> UN tonic for forest carbon market omits cure for corporate trading pains </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>But the long-awaited deal on Article 6 of the Paris pact has spotlighted the lack of rules for a murky, expanding voluntary carbon market.</p>
<p>Here companies are investing to safeguard tropical forests from the Amazon to the Congo Basin and claiming carbon credits to help reach their own net-zero emissions goals.</p>
<p>“There is a screaming need to have more regulation and rules around this,” said Anders Haug Larsen, head of policy at Rainforest Foundation Norway, which supports indigenous rights.</p>
<p>The Glasgow pact - which covers only government action - could inspire tougher rules in the voluntary market, he noted, but warned it “continues to leave the responsibility about what to do with the companies themselves”.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 firms worldwide, including Amazon, Royal Dutch Shell and Nestle, have set net-zero emissions goals.</p>
<p>Investing in forest protection to help meet those goals is attractive, both because customers like the idea and because trees naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow.</p>
<p>Voluntary carbon markets are on track to exceed US$1 billion in trades for the first time in 2021, according to an annual report from Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace.</p>
<p>Prices on a futures market for nature-based climate solutions covering forestry, agriculture and other land uses, known as N-GEO, have risen to more than US$14 per tonne of carbon this month, up from about US$8 a tonne in October.</p>
<p>The coming year looks set to be crucial in the push to develop tighter standards, observers say.</p>
<p>Among groups working to that end are the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative with participants from non-profits to governments, and a task force on scaling up voluntary carbon markets set up by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.</p>
<p>“The new sets of guidance are going to really help separate the wheat from the chaff,” Kelley Kizzier, previously the European Union's lead climate negotiator for markets, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
<p>By the next UN climate summit in Egypt in November 2022, “we should have a clear idea of what 'good' looks like” in terms of carbon credits, said Kizzier, now vice president for global climate at the US-based Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
<p>Responsible companies want strong rules to prove that they are safeguarding forests.</p>
<p>But less rigorous investors have often been accused of “green-washing” – making investments that look good in a glossy company brochure but with scant effect in reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Kizzier praised the progress made at COP26, noting that "a win for carbon markets is a win for forest carbon markets".</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> Who will be the judge of countries' climate plans? </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The rules also allow emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil to carry over some credits for emissions reductions earned from 2013 to 2020, for things like building hydropower and solar plants, into the new Paris Agreement regime.</p>
<p>But, Kizzier noted, there was no COP26 bonanza for forest nations because the new carbon-market rules ban carrying over pre-2020 credits for planting trees and reforestation, which cannot be used to meet emissions targets set in the NDCs.</p>
<p>Hugh Sealy, an expert on voluntary carbon markets at the University of the West Indies in Barbados, said the Glasgow deal sent "a strong, strong signal that the world wants to use markets, but ... with high integrity”.</p>
<p>“There’s no stick we can wave – the market must want this (integrity) to happen," he told an online briefing this month.</p>
<p>Under the rules set in Glasgow to prevent double-counting by governments, the United States could pay to plant forests in Brazil to soak up 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions, and it would be recorded as a cut in US emissions - not Brazil's.</p>
<p>But the COP26 deal leaves the door open to a different system for “other international mitigation purposes”, such as those of private firms or investors rather than countries.</p>
<p>That means a US company investing to protect Brazilian forests could claim the carbon credits towards reducing its corporate emissions while Brazil also counts the reductions towards its national target under the Paris pact, Kizzier said.</p>
<p>Critics, such as environmental group Greenpeace, say this system will allow companies to avoid making deep cuts in their own emissions and instead merely pay others to act.</p>
<p>Backers, however, say it can boost investments in a more nimble, co-operative system to help lower emissions overall.</p>
<p>They argue it would not qualify as double-counting under the Paris Agreement as long as the emissions cuts are registered in only one country's NDC.</p>
<p>Verra, a body that helps set standards for certifying carbon credits, welcomed Glasgow's clarification that Article 6 “does not regulate the voluntary market”.</p>
<p>Verra said it would clearly label projects whose credits are traded on the voluntary market to show the carbon accounting methods used.</p>
<p>“Some countries may want to leverage the private finance provided by voluntary carbon markets to further their own climate action, which is something many buyers will want to contribute to,” it noted. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Sea turtles return to Thailand's shores during pandemic </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PHUKET: After laying eggs on a deserted Thai beach, a green sea turtle dives back into the turquoise-coloured waters of the Andaman Sea - a welcome sight for biologists who say the absence of tourists spurred the marine animal's return.</p>
<p>The turtle's nesting was spotted in November by scientists. In about two months, the 100 eggs will hatch and babies will slide towards the sea, guided by the moonlight.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, millions of tourists thronged to the white sand beaches of southern Thailand, ferried to the islands by tour boats which dissuaded the skittish creatures from venturing ashore.</p>
<p>But with almost 20 months of COVID-19 travel restrictions in place, several different species of sea turtles have returned to nesting around Phuket, an ultra-popular beach destination before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Between October 2020 and February 2021, 18 nests of leatherback turtles - which can grow up to 400kg as an adult and are the largest species of sea turtles - were found in Phuket.</p>
<p>"Their nesting has improved in the last two years thanks to the absence of tourists, noise and light pollution," Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center, told AFP.</p>
<p>"We had never seen such a number in 20 years."</p>
<p>Although chances of survival are very low - about one egg hatched out of 1,000 will reach adulthood - Kongkiat said the increase in nesting is a positive sign for efforts to preserve endangered species.</p>
<p>A nest of the olive ridley sea turtle was also spotted - the first time in two decades.</p>
<p>Other species that live in the warm waters around Thailand include leatherback, hawksbill, green and loggerhead turtles.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> Pakistani wildlife team cradles green turtle babies from beach to sea </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But as Thailand tentatively begins to reopen its doors to fully vaccinated international tourists, scientists have tempered their optimism.</p>
<p>"The pandemic may offer sea turtles a welcome break," Thon Thamrongnawasawat from Kasetsart University in Bangkok said.</p>
<p>"But they live long and are a highly migratory species. Without effective policies to protect them, we can't expect many long-term benefits to population recovery."</p>
<p>In Thailand - as in many other countries - the marine animal's future is threatened by global warming, which harms coral reefs and increases temperatures of waters.</p>
<p>The hotter conditions could in turn disrupt turtle species' populations: Studies have shown that warmer sands where they nest leads to more female hatchlings relative to males.</p>
<p>Pollution is also a problem.</p>
<p>At the moment, plastic and discarded fishing lines and nets remain the primary cause of disease and death.</p>
<p>"In 56 per cent of the cases, the turtles that are brought to us have ingested marine waste or become trapped in it," said Dr Patcharaporn Kaewong from the Phuket Marine Biological Center.</p>
<p>Currently, 58 turtles are being treated there. Some need operations, amputation or prosthetics before they are released back into the wild.</p>
<p>At the moment, scientists and local authorities are on high alert for nesting season, which runs until February.</p>
<p>After a female turtle lays a nest, the authorities will act quickly - either moving them to a safe place if they are too close to the water or surrounding it with bamboo fences and security cameras.</p>
<p>"After hatching, we take care of the weak turtles until they are strong enough to go to the sea," Patcharaporn said.</p>
<p>She added that educating the public about conservation is also important.</p>
<p>Up until a few decades ago, eating turtle eggs was a common custom in Thailand, but gathering them was banned by the Thai government in 1982.</p>
<p>Illegally possessing or selling leatherback turtle eggs is now punishable by three to 15 years in prison, and carries fines of up to US$50,000.</p>
<p>Some marine protection NGOs are also financially rewarding locals who report a nest, while technology - like microchipping a turtle - also plays a part in long-term monitoring.</p>
<p>"Thanks to satellite tracking, we have observed that they can migrate much further than we thought," Kongkiat said, adding that some have gone as far as Australia.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Belgium commits to phasing out existing nuclear power plants </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>“It would not be smart not to have a safety net,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said, indicating that two plants could remain open, if need be.</p>
<p>While the government is pushing for the elimination of nuclear plans built with 20th-century technology, it also committed to invest in research for small modular nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>“We say goodbye to the old nuclear reactors and look to nuclear energy of the future,” said De Croo.</p>
<p>A political commitment to phase out nuclear energy dates back to 2003, but successive Belgian governments have waffled to seal the deal. The anti-nuclear Greens are part of the current governing coalition and insistent on seeing action taken.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants release few pollutants into the air, which have made them an option as nations around the world seek clean energy to meet climate change targets. However, their construction and demolition produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Opponents have for decades cited the challenges involved with processing long-lived radioactive waste to lobby against new plants. Climate activists also say that relying on nuclear power risks slowing the rollout of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Belgium’s ambivalence toward nuclear energy is reflected in a broader European Union debate that has pitted Germany against France.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Tickets for the first leg of the AFF Suzuki Cup final go on sale from 9am on Monday (Dec 27), the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) said in a media release on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Thailand are set to face each other on Dec 29 in the first game of the two-legged final.</p>
<p>The tickets, priced at S$25 for adults and S$15 for children aged 12 years and below, can be purchased <a>online</a>, or via the Ticketmaster hotline (+65 3158 8588) from 10am onwards.</p>
<p>Sales for the second leg, which is on Jan 1, 2022, will start on Thursday, Dec 30 from 12pm, FAS added in a media release.</p>
<p><a>Thailand booked their place in the AFF Suzuki Cup final</a> after they held defending champions Vietnam to a goalless draw on Sunday in the second leg of the semi-finals to complete a 2-0 aggregate victory.</p>
<p><a>Indonesia defeated Singapore</a> 4-2 on Saturday to claim their place in the final.</p>
<p>Both legs of the final will kick off at 8.30pm at the National Stadium.</p>
<p>“Gates will open two hours before and fans are advised to make their way to the stadiums early to avoid any delays for entry,” said FAS.</p>
<p>Similar to the group stage games and semi-finals, spectators will continue to be issued a coloured wrist tag for identification that allows re-entry, after showing proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 and completing the mandatory bag checks.</p>
<p>“Refunds will not be issued to those who fail to provide proof of vaccination,” FAS added.</p>
<p>Children who are exempted from vaccination must be accompanied by an adult aged 21 years and above. All children aged three and above will need a ticket to enter.</p>
<p>Strict safe distancing measures will be maintained, with seating in groups of two and one-metre safe distancing between each group. Food and drinks are not permitted in the stadiums and fans are required to wear their masks at all times.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Australia put one hand on Ashes after England collapse </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: Australia's pacemen crashed through England's top order with four wickets in a thrilling final hour on day two of the third Ashes test on Monday (Dec 27) to all but crush the tourists' hopes of keeping the series alive.</p>
<p>Captain Root was 12 not out, with Ben Stokes on two, the pair left to mount an improbable rescue mission at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>Even accounting for the fragility of England's top order the pace onslaught by Starc, Boland and Pat Cummins with the new ball was breathtaking.</p>
<p>"What they did again for the last hour tonight was unbelievable," said opener Marcus Harris, who top-scored for Australia with 76.</p>
<p>"I can’t see (the pitch) getting a whole lot easier to bat on ... There’s enough there for the bowlers and if you’re willing to occupy the crease there’s runs there as well."</p>
<p>It was a dramatic end to a rollercoaster day which started with a COVID-19 scare in the England camp as two support staff and two family members tested positive and were forced to isolate.</p>
<p>England's players were cleared after rapid antigen tests and the match got back underway after a half-hour delay.</p>
<p>However, the team face an anxious wait to see if they will be cleared after more thorough PCR tests on Monday night.</p>
<p>Whatever the results, England finished day two on life support after their batsmen again crumbled under pressure a day after being skittled for 185.</p>
<p>Starc had opener Zak Crawley caught behind for five and number three Dawid Malan lbw for a duck in successive balls.</p>
<p>The hat-trick ball whistled past the outside edge of Root's bat, drawing a gasp from the terraces.</p>
<p>Home bowler Boland then triggered pandemonium in the stands when he had the hapless Haseeb Hameed caught behind for seven and nightwatchman Jack Leach bowled for a duck in the same over.</p>
<p>It was a bitter pill to swallow for James Anderson and the other England bowlers, who had battled hard to drag their team back into the contest after Australia resumed on 66 for one in the morning.</p>
<p>Even at 39 Anderson showed he has lost little of his brilliance, finishing with 4-33 after dismissing Steve Smith (16), Harris and Cummins (21) on day two after removing opener David Warner on day one.</p>
<p>"I thought firstly on the bowling front we did really well to stick at our task throughout the day," Anderson told reporters.</p>
<p>"We know that that last 12 overs was going to be tough with that new ball but even so, to lose four wickets was really disappointing."</p>
<p>Ollie Robinson and Mark Wood grabbed two wickets each, while recalled spinner Leach bounced back from his Gabba horror show with probing spells and was rewarded with the wicket of Cameron Green, trapped lbw for 17.</p>
<p>With holders Australia up 2-0 in the series and needing only to draw the match to retain the urn, Root needed his batsmen to hold on for that final hour.</p>
<p>But once again the skipper found himself strolling out to the middle after only a handful of overs, this time with England's Ashes hopes on the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>Hanyu, who won Olympic figure skating gold at Sochi and Pyeongchang, last competed at the World Team Trophy in April after missing the Grand Prix season due to a right ankle injury.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old grabbed the lead in Saitama by scoring 111.31 in the short programme on Friday before posting 211.05 in his free skate on Sunday for a 322.36 total.</p>
<p>Pyeongchang silver medallist Shoma Uno was again runner-up, finishing with a personal best of 295.82 while 18-year-old Yuma Kagiyama scored 292.41 to finish third.</p>
<p>Hanyu attempted a quadruple axel in competition for the first time but landed on two feet and the jump was downgraded to a triple axel. He said he was pleased with his performance, which included three other quad jumps.</p>
<p>"I'm honestly relieved," Hanyu was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency.</p>
<p>"I felt as though I was about to cry even before the six-minute warm-up."</p>
<p>Six-times national champion Hanyu said he would keep practising the quadruple axel with the aim of landing it in competition after nailing it in training last week.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> American football-Two more college bowl games called off due to COVID-19 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p> Two more college American football bowl games have been called off due to COVID-19 cases at the Boston College and University of Virginia programs, the teams said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Military Bowl, featuring Boston against East Carolina, and the Fenway Bowl, which pitted the Virginia Cavaliers against the Southern Methodist Mustangs, were the latest games to be affected.</p>
<p>The Hawaii Bowl, scheduled to be played on Dec. 24, was also scrapped due to COVID-19, while Rutgers University had to replace Texas AM University for the Gator Bowl game against Wake Forest University on Dec. 31.</p>
<p>"In the days leading up to the team's planned departure date (Dec. 25), some UVA players displayed symptoms associated with COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the virus," the Virginia Cavaliers said in a statement.</p>
<p>"As a result, the entire team was tested Christmas morning. The completed test results ... revealed additional positive tests that prevent the team from safely participating in the game."</p>
<p>Boston College director of athletics Pat Kraft said their COVID outbreak compounded other personnel issues.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, due to cases of COVID-19 rising within our program since our arrival, along with season-ending injuries, opt outs and transfers, we just do not have enough players to field a team,” Kraft said.</p>
<p>North American sport has struggled to contain a surge of COVID-19 outbreaks amid a busy holiday season, with many elite leagues being forced to postpone games.</p>

<p> Anthony Martial has asked to leave Manchester United but there have been no offers for the French forward and the club may need to hold onto him if the squad is hit by injuries or more COVID-19 issues, interim manager Ralf Rangnick said.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old has started only two league games this season and his representative said this month he wanted to secure a move away in January to get more game time.</p>
<p>"We spoke on Wednesday, we spoke at length," Rangnick told British media. "He explained to me he's been at United for seven years and he feels it's the right time for a change, to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>"In a way this is understandable, I could follow his thoughts but on the other hand, it's also important to see the situation of the club. We have COVID times, we have three competitions in which we still have high ambitions.</p>
<p>"I told him as long as there's no club showing interest in him, and it shouldn't only be in the interest of the player it should also be in the interest of the club. So far... there's been no offer ... and as long as this is the case he'll stay."</p>
<p>Rangnick also said French midfielder Paul Pogba would require another two weeks to regain fitness following his return from Dubai, where he was nursing a thigh injury.</p>
<p>United take on Newcastle United later on Monday.</p>

<p>Chelsea secured a 3-1 win at Villa, with Lukaku coming on at half-time and Hudson-Odoi playing the full 90 minutes.</p>
<p>"It is not so easy when you have a long injury, with a body like (Lukaku) and you catch COVID-19," Tuchel told reporters.</p>
<p>"When you read the match sheet and read the names you might think, yes, everyone is there, 18 guys and it is a top squad. But if you look at the details, you see that we are struggling and taking some huge risks.</p>
<p>"Callum (Hudson-Odoi) was forced to play 90 minutes straight after COVID-19 because of injuries during the match and that's the way it is."</p>
<p>While pleased with the three points, Tuchel was concerned about the players he must pitch back into action over the busy holiday period.</p>
<p>"This is a big reaction and win. At the same time, I am always concerned in the last weeks, I'm concerned for the health and the safety of the players," Tuchel said.</p>
<p>"This is pretty challenging. It's not over just because the names are back on the team sheet. At the moment the situation is very demanding."</p>
<p>Third-placed Chelsea face Brighton Hove Albion on Wednesday, before taking on Liverpool on Jan. 2.</p>

<p> World number five Andrey Rublev is the fifth player to test positive for COVID-19 after playing at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi this month.</p>
<p>Spaniard Rafa Nadal, Canadian Denis Shapovalov, Switzerland's Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and Tunisian Ons Jabeur all tested positive after taking part in the event.</p>
<p>U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu tested positive in Abu Dhabi before the event and withdrew, while Nadal's coach Carlos Moya also contracted the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>"I am currently in Barcelona and unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19," the Russian said. "I am in isolation and following all the protocols under the supervision of doctors.</p>
<p>"As you know, I am fully vaccinated and was preparing for tournaments – ATP Cup and Australian Open. Now I have to recover and I will go to Melbourne only when it will be safe for everyone."</p>
<p>The Australian Open will be held at Melbourne Park from Jan. 17. Rublev was part of the Russian team that won the men's ATP Cup this year and had been included in the team for the upcoming edition in Sydney, which kicks off on Saturday.</p>

<p>"For sure we have to continue to improve, to exploit the confidence that is going to improve us. We know very well, I know very well, we have a big job to do. </p>
<p>"It's good to get three points, to score three goals with your three strikers. It's good to keep another clean sheet."</p>

<p>CHENNAI: A Foxconn iPhone factory in India at the centre of a mass food-poisoning incident will extend a week-long closure by an extra three days, a senior official for the state of Tamil Nadu told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last week, protests erupted after more than 250 women who work at the plant and live in one of the hostels had to be treated for food poisoning. Some of the protestors were rounded up by the police but later released.</p>
<p>The incident has thrown a spotlight on living conditions for the workers - most of them women - who reside in hostels near the factory which is located in the southern city of Chennai.</p>
<p>According to a separate government source, Foxconn has told state bureaucrats it had "ramped up production too quickly" and would gradually ensure that workers' facilities were upgraded before they go back to full capacity.</p>
<p>Representatives for Foxconn and Apple were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The gates of the factory, which is on the outskirts of the southern city of Chennai, were open on Monday morning and some vehicles were moving in and out but the area was mostly deserted.</p>
<p>The disruption comes as Apple is dealing with pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks that have hit production. In October, the company warned that the impact of these supply chain problems would worsen during the holiday quarter.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Friendships are fraying because of COVID-19 restrictions </h1>
<div> <p>Research shows that friendship networks have shrunk especially during pandemic lockdowns. An Australian sociologist advises on not only how we should reconnect, but who we should reconnect with.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Roger Patulny </a> </div> </div>
<p>WOLLONGONG, Australia: As we resume our social lives after strict COVID restrictions have lifted, many of us are finding it’s time to take stock of our friendships.</p>
<p>Recent research I’ve been involved in found friendship networks were shrinking in Australia during COVID lockdowns.</p>
<p>Some people pruned their networks, focusing on only the most important family and friends. Others lost friends through reduced recreational and community activities, falling out of the habit of socialising, and shifting to more digital interaction.</p>
<p>As we start to re-engage, the obvious question is – how do we get our old friends back?</p>
<p>We might also ask ourselves – which friends do we want back?</p>
<h2>WHICH FRIENDS DO WE WANT?</h2>
<p>There’s no one answer here – different people want different things from friends.</p>
<p>Data I have calculated from the 2015-16 Australian Social Attitudes Survey show the main form of support received from close friends in Australia is:</p>
<ul><li>Primarily, having a confidant who provides emotional support</li> <li>Followed by fun and good times</li> <li>And then, favours and advice of various kinds.</li> </ul>
<p>These results vary by background and life stage.</p>
<p>Women are much more likely to have a confidant who provides emotional support as their closest friend. Men are more likely to have friends who provide fun, good times, favours and advice – or else no regular support at all.</p>
<p>Younger people are more likely to have a confidant, emotional support, fun and good times. Older people, aged over 56, are slightly more likely to receive favours and advice, and are much more likely to lack a close supportive friend.</p>
<p>These results are indicative of what different people get from close friendships, but may not represent what they want or need.</p>
<p>The close confidants women report as friends may well alleviate emotional loneliness, which is defined as the absence of close attachment to others who provide strong emotional support.</p>
<p>However, it may still leave them with social loneliness, or the feeling of lacking quality, companionable connections with friends.</p>
<p>Conversely, male camaraderie built around fun, activities and mutual favours may alleviate social but not emotional loneliness.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests emotional loneliness has a stronger negative impact on well-being than social loneliness, so it’s important for everyone to have someone to talk to for emotional support.</p>
<p>We still need a variety of approaches and goals to suit different friendship needs nonetheless.</p>
<h2>BEATING SOCIAL LONELINESS</h2>
<p>The first way to reduce social loneliness is to reach out to those we already know, now that we can.</p>
<p>We can message old friends, organise get-togethers, or start new conversations and activities with everyday contacts including colleagues, fellow students, regulars at the local club or cafe, or neighbours.</p>
<p>That said, reconnecting may now be impossible or undesirable for several reasons. These can include physical distance, changed life circumstances, different interests, intractable arguments, or a masculine aversion to initiating contact.</p>
<p>Some people may benefit from joining support groups designed for people subject to stigma based on identity or life events, such as LGBTQI or health recovery groups.</p>
<p>Some groups help deal with the stigma of feeling lonely. This includes shared activity groups where people talk “shoulder to shoulder” rather than face to face, such as Men’s Sheds.</p>
<p>Groups focused on education, shared discussion, or exercise are particularly good for friendship and alleviating loneliness among older people.</p>
<p>While online options abound for connecting, it’s important to avoid activities which increase loneliness, such as passive scrolling, unsolicited broadcasting, or escapist substituting of digital communities for physical ones.</p>
<p>Interactive online contact and online groups that help us organise in-person catch ups (such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Meetup) are more effective.</p>
<h2>MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>To beat emotional loneliness, the focus should be on deepening existing relationships.</p>
<p>It’s essential to spend high quality, meaningful time with a few good quality friends (or even one).</p>
<p>It might mean repairing damage, and apologising in a considered and respectful manner if you did or said something wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes it just requires the effort of checking in more regularly. Organisations like RUOK provide sensitive, step-by-step suggestions on how to do this.</p>
<p>Some people may also need help from a professional psychologist, counsellor, or support group to process increased social anxiety, particularly after COVID lockdown.</p>
<p>Such support can reduce emotional loneliness by helping us process social situations more positively and be more realistic (and less anxious) about our friendship options.</p>
<h2>ENDING TOXIC FRIENDSHIPS</h2>
<p>In reflecting on our friendships, we may decide to end any that have become particularly toxic.</p>
<p>Where possible, we should be kind, explain this, and avoid ghosting, as this can be highly traumatic to those who are ghosted and de-sensitise us to others’ feelings if we do it regularly.</p>
<p>Before doing so, we should be careful we don’t just need a break to rebuild energy and habits of interactions.</p>
<p>We should be especially careful with ending long-term friendships. Quality relationships take time, shared history, and involve natural ups and downs – especially in a pandemic. We should look to renegotiate rather than end them wherever possible.</p>
<p>Take time, and seek counselling or another friend’s advice. Since listening is key to friendship, maybe ask yourself – have you heard everything they’re trying to say?</p>

<h1> Commentary: Unvaccinated populations fuel the emergence of COVID-19 variants </h1>
<div> <p>More of the coronavirus can multiply within unvaccinated people, meaning a higher chance of mutation, says Duke-NUS Medical School’s Professor Lok Shee Mei.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lok Shee Mei </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Viruses are essentially parasites. </p>
<p>In order to multiply, they must get into a mammalian cell and hijack the host machineries for reproduction. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID, humans serve as vessels for it to multiply. </p>
<p>Coronavirus has some “light” proofreading mechanism compared with other RNA viruses such as influenza virus and HIV, the causative agents of flu and AIDS respectively, and therefore mutates slower.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we are seeing a slew of SARS-CoV-2 mutants generated since its outbreak two years ago. The generation of mutants gives an opportunity for the virus to adapt and change, making them harder to exterminate. </p>
<p>When SARS-CoV-2 virus goes through numerous cycles of multiplying, mutations accumulate, and variants arise. Different mutations in different variants can be either detrimental, neutral or advantageous to their survival.</p>
<p>Then the race between variants begins. Which will reign supreme depends on their characteristics and factors such as how fast they can infect a person, how transmissible they are and how they can overcome the hosts’ pre-existing immunity.</p>
<p>An example of the mutations advantageous to the survival of virus is the current SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, which is overtaking the Delta variant. It contains 50 mutations of which 36 are on the virus surface spike protein.</p>
<p>This spike protein plays an important role to allow virus to attach and infect cells. It is also the primary protein that several vaccines including the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were based on. </p>
<p>That is how variants can partially overcome pre-existing immunity. Whether the virus will change into something more dangerous is still debatable as killing its host is not advantageous to the virus in the long run. </p>
<p>Gamma, Lambda and other less well-known variants did not lead to more outbreaks because they were very quickly taken over by other more transmissible variants.</p>
<h4> <div>Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Listen to the full conversation with Profs David Matchar and Gavin Smith on on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.</div> </h4>
<h2>UNVACCINATED POPULATIONS FUEL VARIANTS</h2>
<p>Do the unvaccinated populations fuel the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants? </p>
<p>The consensus among the scientific community is yes, they likely do. Unvaccinated people have less protection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus would allow more of the virus to multiply within them. </p>
<p>In comparison, a fully vaccinated individual has a high level of immunity and therefore presents a more hostile environment for the virus to multiply. </p>
<p>The higher rate of virus multiplication in the unvaccinated is likely to result in more possible mutations of the virus, resulting in the emergence of a larger number of variants in unvaccinated than vaccinated people.</p>
<p>The variants produced by unvaccinated people can then spread to the vaccinated. Variants that can overcome the immunity in vaccinated individuals can also emerge in this way. </p>
<p>The latest Omicron variant, seems to have mutations that can partially escape from the immunity elicited by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, suggesting that vaccinated people may also serve as a conduit for the emergence of new variants.</p>
<h2>VACCINATIONS PROTECT YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES</h2>
<p>While people who received the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have reduced protection against infection by the Omicron variant compared to the earlier variants, its protection against serious disease developing is still very high. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is important and prudent to get vaccinated. A booster shot can increase antibody levels and bring up waning immunity level which will further improve protection against Omicron. </p>
<p>Other than Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, there is a growing body of preliminary data showing that Omicron is able to escape from immunity induced by other vaccines such as those from Sinovac, AstraZeneca and JJ.</p>
<p>But this is not to encourage people to have virus parties, since there’s no crystal ball to confidently predict the outcome of the disease for a particular individual.</p>
<p>In turn, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating to increase its transmissibility and overcome vaccines and drugs. </p>
<p>COVID-19 is likely here to stay. If that happens, we will have to keep updating our vaccines and develop effective drugs and treatments to combat the new virus variants. </p>
<p>Unless SARS-CoV-2 evolves to become a mild disease-causing virus – much like the common cold viruses, we may have to keep up with the battle and stay vigilant. </p>
<p>For now, it’s probably wise to go for vaccinations including the booster shots, and continue to practise social responsibility to protect our young and old. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Water may soon be a tradable commodity on markets </h1>
<div> <p>"A globally integrated market for fresh water within 25-30 years" was predicted by this American professor a decade ago, and it is currently on track to becoming an accurate prediction.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Willem H Buiter </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK CITY: Just over a decade ago, I predicted the arrival of water as an asset class. </p>
<p>I foresaw a massive expansion of investment in the water sector, including the production of fresh, clean water from other sources (desalination, purification), storage, shipping, and transportation of water.</p>
<p>There will be different grades and types of fresh water, just the way we have light sweet and heavy sour crude oil today.</p>
<p>In fact, I believed that water would eventually be the single most important physical-commodity-based asset class, dwarfing oil, copper, agricultural commodities, and precious metals.</p>
<p>Ten years later, the future is now – though not quite what I expected.</p>
<h2>A FUTURES MARKET IN WATER</h2>
<p>In December 2020, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group created the first futures market in water. Cash-settled water futures with a maximum contract period of two years are now traded on the CME Globex electronic trading system.</p>
<p>CME Group’s futures market is based on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index, which tracks the cash price of physical water rights in California, based on transactions in surface water and in four groundwater markets.</p>
<p>Because the local and regional water supplies often are not connected, let alone fully integrated, the spot market underlying the futures market is too segmented; it does not represent a single, homogeneous commodity or asset.</p>
<p>Today’s spot markets for water and water rights thus are too illiquid and non-transparent to support an economically and socially useful futures market.</p>
<p>But there is hope. The regional and global integration of physical water supplies – and the associated spot markets for water and water rights – is making spectacular progress.</p>
<h2>NEW PROJECTS IN WATER SHOW A BRIGHTER FUTURE</h2>
<p>Two ongoing developments stand out. One is Project Greenland, created and sponsored by Thomas Schumann Capital, in partnership with North Atlantic Research and Survey.</p>
<p>The target markets are in the water-deprived Middle East and North Africa. The project is scalable and relies on established technologies and infrastructures being deployed in an innovative and disruptive manner.</p>
<p>Given time, additional technological advances, and proper spot-water pricing, icebergs from Antarctica also could become viable sources of fresh water.</p>
<p>A second fascinating entrant to the global water markets is SkyH2O’s Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG) system, a proprietary technology that extracts clean fresh water from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The business model here is flexible and scalable, because AWG capacity can be deployed in a distributed manner to reach the ultimate customers, be they governments, households, or industrial, commercial, and agricultural users.</p>
<p>Its cost effectiveness, relative to alternatives like desalination and distillation, depends on atmospheric humidity and the price of energy in the proximity of the customers.</p>
<p>Globally, over 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture, and most of this usage is either free or heavily subsidised. Households in many countries also pay but a small fraction of the long-run social marginal cost of the water they use.</p>
<h2>GROWING RECOGNITION OF FRESHWATER SCARCITY</h2>
<p>To recognise water as a scarce renewable resource, a tradable commodity, and a marketable asset is not to diminish its unique significance as a good that is essential to life and viewed by many as a gift from God.</p>
<p>While a social subsistence level of water should be provided for free or at a heavily subsidised price, all additional water usage could be priced at its full long-run social marginal cost to preserve the right incentives.</p>
<p>Water is indeed becoming an asset class. Give it another decade, and exchange-traded funds for water and water rights will be part of the new normal for investors.</p>

<h1> Commentary: That Christmas dinner may mean 12 hours of walking to burn calories </h1>
<div> <p>It is that time of the year when people overindulge and eat much more than they should, says a UK professor. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Amanda Daley </a> </div> </div>
<p>LOUGHBOROUGH, England: Overeating at Christmas time is almost like a tradition. Many of us look forward to piling our plates full of festive foods, snacking on chocolate throughout the holidays or sipping on festive drinks.</p>
<p>Even if you were trying to eat healthier, indulgent foods are often displayed more prominently in supermarkets and shops during the holidays, making it difficult to pass up on our favourite foods and drinks.</p>
<p>The British Dietetic Association estimates that on Christmas day alone people might consume around 6,000 calories – with Christmas dinner responsible for most of these.</p>
<p>But spending time with friends, work Christmas parties and New Year’s celebrations might all see us overeat in the days and even weeks before and after Christmas. It’s no wonder the average adult gains around 0.5-1 kg over the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>While that might not sound like a lot, the weight we gain during the festive season isn’t always lost in the new year.</p>
<p>This excess weight gain over the years could see some people become overweight or obese, which may increase their risk of many conditions, including cancer, diabetes, hypertension or stroke.</p>
<p>But research shows that giving people information about how many minutes of walking (or running) it will take to burn off the calories from foods or drinks can help people eat less and avoid gaining weight at Christmas.</p>
<p>So, how much walking do you need to do in order to burn off Christmas dinner?</p>
<p>For an adult weighing 84kg it will take about 12 hours of steady paced walking (around four miles or 6.4km an hour) to burn off the calories of an average Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of walking approximately 50 miles or 80km. Or, if you prefer, you could jog for about five to six hours.</p>
<p>Of course, the number of calories in your dinner will also depend on what foods you eat, how you prepare them and whether you go back for seconds.</p>
<p>For example, if you cut out the pre-dinner nibbles and appetisers, and only have a yule log for dessert alongside two glasses of wine, your Christmas dinner may only come in around 2,080 calories.</p>
<p>For someone weighing 84kg, this would only take around six and a half hours of walking to burn off.</p>
<p>The amount of physical activity you’ll need to do to burn off your dinner will also depend on many factors such as age, gender and weight.</p>
<p>Holiday weight gain does not have to be inevitable – and walking is a great activity you can do by yourself or with others.</p>
<p>While walking for 12 hours straight isn’t something anyone wants to do during the holidays, there are many easy ways you can sneak more physical activity in during the holidays each day.</p>
<p>For example, try walking to the shops instead of using your car if you can, or take a cycle around your neighbourhood with your children to look at the Christmas lights.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s hard not to indulge over Christmas since it only comes around once a year. Some other easy ways to eat fewer calories during the holidays include snacking wisely, and being cautious with your portions.</p>
<p>If you find that you have gained weight after Christmas don’t be disheartened and try to focus on reducing the treats, and setting yourself a goal to get your weight back on track as soon as you can in the new year.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Sex And The City sequel shows women’s identities not limited to wives or mothers </h1>
<div> <p>Instead of familiar sad depictions of lonely divorcees and widows, And Just Like That shows older women can form new, non-romantic bonds and explore unchartered areas of their potential, says a sociology lecturer.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kadian Pow </a> </div> </div>
<p>BIRMINGHAM, England: On the eve of release of the Sex and the City sequel, And Just Like That, I was excited. The show follows Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte as they navigate life at 50 in a world that has changed quite a lot from that in the 2000s.</p>
<p>But in recent years those representations have evolved with shows such as Grace and Frankie – and now And Just Like That. These series give us the humour of The Golden Girls but a richer landscape of the interior lives of older women.</p>
<p>There is a lot to celebrate – but for me it is Miranda’s story that resonates the most.</p>
<p>A lawyer at the top of her career with a loving husband and son, Miranda seemingly has the happy ending. But in And Just Like That she is setting herself down a new uncertain path.</p>
<p>For her, her 50s are a time for rediscovery and learning as she returns to education to retrain as a human rights lawyer. There are also hints that she might start exploring her attraction beyond men.</p>
<p>I just earned another university degree to support a change in career – and I, too, started exploring my queerness later in life.</p>
<p>Carrie’s childlessness-by-choice also resonates now in a way it did not when I was engaged to a man in the early 2000s, and naively thought having a child was an inevitable part of female adulthood and marriage.</p>
<p>Older women are often portrayed as wives and mothers. If they are childless and divorced, their stories can often be tinged with sadness or desperation.</p>
<p>Now that I am in my early 40s, And Just Like That highlights for me is that awkward fumbling is not just for teenagers. As adults we never stop awkwardly moving through life because it is always changing, and so are the rules.</p>
<h2>GETTING OLDER WITH FRANKNESS AND GRACE</h2>
<p>And Just Like That still highlights, as Sex and the City did before it, that friendships with women are relationships that deserve attention and intention.</p>
<p>We see this new hopeful take on romantic ends in the Netflix series, Grace and Frankie (2015), which is about two retired women who become unlikely friends after their husbands announce they are in love with each other.</p>
<p>Its premiere comes 30 years after NBC’s The Golden Girls (1985), which was also about how older women’s lives endure even when their marriages don’t, or their children fly the nest.</p>
<p>In their 70s, Grace and Frankie are living more boldly on TV now than Blanche and the other Golden Girls were in their 50s and 60s. That’s right, the Golden Girls were the same age as the And Just Like That characters are now.</p>
<p>Take a moment. It threw me, too since they seem so much older. More importantly, as a show that centres the friendship of two septuagenarians, Grace and Frankie represents a changing portrayal of women in this age bracket.</p>
<p>Whereas many women this age recede into the background in supporting roles roles, this series shows that older women are not just relevant, but can explore the kaleidoscope of their existence through different eras and different phases.</p>
<p>I had hoped this reboot would be more self-aware around the privileges of their whiteness and class positioning. I also really wanted Carrie and the girls to interact more meaningfully with women of colour and younger generations.</p>
<p>While it still has some work to do on this front it has fulfilled my hopes for how it represents women 40 and above.</p>
<p>Both Grace and Frankie and And Just Like That remind us that women’s identities are not limited to wives, mothers or romantic interests.</p>
<p>So what a time to be alive. To see older female characters portrayed with depth, authenticity, humour and shades of awkwardness in the ways we are now accustomed to seeing female characters in their teens, 20s and 30s.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just broaden, with frankness and grace, the focus on older women outside of the white, upper middle-class, heterosexual range, I would be grateful. Please and thank you.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Retirement is a chance to find a new purpose and identity </h1>
<div> <p>It is common to think of retirement planning as a purely financial one – to ensure you have enough. But this is only one part of the equation says an SUSS gerontology researcher.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sng Hock Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: It is safe to say that many of us yearn for the day when we are free from the day-to-day shackles of work and want to retire because it conjures up visions of a permanent vacation where we choose what we want to do. </p>
<p>George Thia, 68, is an interesting example of someone who embodies this idea. I met him when I was doing my Master of Gerontology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). We were course mates. </p>
<p>While he was on the board of Mount Alvernia Hospital, he began to develop an interest in gerontology and so after his stint, enrolled in the course at SUSS. George re-fired his life as he aged by learning new things. </p>
<h2>WHEN RETIREMENT MEANS GOING BACK TO WORK</h2>
<p>I recently met 58-year-old Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) Seoul Soh (she named herself Seoul after the city she loves) who was a homemaker before stepping out of her comfort zone to be an SDA.</p>
<p>While others her age transit from work life to retirement, Seoul went in an opposite direction – back to work since her children were grown up. </p>
<p>Seoul says she let go of her attachment towards her grown-up children and found joy devoting herself to her new role in serving others. Seoul has found a renewed sense of purpose and foresees doing this for as long as she is needed. </p>
<p>Nearly all Singapore-based respondents agree that there are benefits of working with colleagues aged 55 years and up. </p>
<h2>THE LONG ROAD AHEAD CAN BE MEANINGFUL</h2>
<p>But she decided one is never too old to pick up a new skill. She made headlines when she scored 89 marks out 100 in an official literacy test. </p>
<p>We may not live till 104 and some of us might be forced to retire prematurely due to a health scare or are made redundant. </p>
<p>Still, so long as we embrace the “re-fired” mindset, life can still be meaningful.</p>
<p>Won Tzyy-Ya, 62, was a successful manager who worked for a global trading company until heart disease forced him to slow down. But he took the opportunity to focus on his physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual health.</p>
<p>Won started brisk walking and became an active volunteer to promote brisk walking interest groups. </p>
<p>George, Seoul, Kuttiyama and Won are ordinary people who have transited successfully from their roles. Instead of retiring (permanent vacation or imminent death modes), they “re-fired” with a new purpose in life. </p>
<p>They took proactive steps based on their unique circumstances to adopt new identities and find meaning in life beyond the corporate rat race. </p>
