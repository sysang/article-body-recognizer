<div><div><p>“Bags are being more frequently loaded, unloaded, rerouted and returned, and there seem to be more opportunities for an item to become temporarily (or in some cases permanently) lost,” Moyse said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re one of the unlucky travelers dealing with damaged, lost or delayed luggage, here’s how to handle the situation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From airport WiFi to ‘juice jacking’: 7 ways to protect your data when traveling</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What you can do if your bag is lost</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>When your bag is missing, the airline is responsible for getting your items back. Thanks to airlines’ tracking systems, they should know where your bag is and when it will arrive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can track your bag through some airlines’ app or website. There is also the airline’s call center, but lately it has been difficult <a>to connect with a representative in a timely fashion</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the airline tries to find your bag, Moyse says, you should review your airline’s policies for baggage-fee reimbursement.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Our best travel advice of 2021</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What you are entitled to from the airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the very least, LaBar says, most airlines will reimburse your checked bag fee if your luggage isn’t returned within a certain time frame.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If your stuff is permanently lost or damaged, LaBar says, you will need to provide an inventory of the packed items and their approximate dollar value to get compensation.</p></div></div>
<a>airlines are liable</a> for up to $3,800 for lost, damaged or delayed bags. International flights fall under different rules; the maximum baggage liability is about $1,780. (Airlines can pay you more than that, but they’re not required to by law.)
<a>Airheart</a>, says to check with the card to see whether they have a lost luggage policy. Some cards — such as ones with travel perks — may come with that benefit.
<div><p>How to protect your travel plans from covid chaos</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Before travel, consider buying insurance</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In fact, John Rose, chief risk officer for the travel management company <a>ALTOUR</a>, says one of the most-used assistance services in a travel insurance policy is helping with missing luggage.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Remember: Buying travel insurance does not mean you will get all of your money back if something goes wrong. Insurance companies probably will not pay out the full market value of your lost belongings, Renken says.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to get refunds if your flight is canceled</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Plan travel strategically</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before you leave the house, make sure your bag is identifiable. Moyse says to put up-to-date contact information both on a luggage tag and inside the bag in case the tag rips off.</p></div></div>
<div><p>LaBar also suggests taking a photo of your suitcase before you check it; this can be helpful to reference if you need to fill out a lost luggage claim, which will request the color, make, size and additional details about your bag.</p></div>
<a>checking a bag</a> to avoid lost luggage woes. If you never hand it over to the airlines, they never have the chance to lose it. But that can be more challenging as overhead bin space becomes limited and passengers are asked to gate-check their bags.
<div><div><p>Plus, not everyone can pare down enough to make a carry-on work. If you’re going to check a bag, Renken says, you should pack valuable items and essentials such as medication in your carry-on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To take your lost luggage defense one step further, Renken recommends that travelers take a nonstop flight whenever possible. The fewer transfers you have to make, the fewer chances your bag has to get mishandled.</p></div></div>

<a>vaccinated</a> but can’t — such as
<a>people who are allergic</a> to vaccine components or had severe allergic reactions after getting a first shot.
<div><p>What to do if your flight is delayed or canceled</p></div>
<div><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether your upcoming trip is absolutely necessary, says <a>LetsGetChecked</a> chief medical officer Robert Mordkin. Can you delay a month or at least a few weeks until the current surge <a>wanes?</a></p></div>
<div><div><p>If the trip can’t wait, consider driving to your destination. You will be better able to control your environment and social distance from other people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not traveling is choice number one. Traveling by car is choice number two,” says Katie Passaretti, medical director of infection prevention of health-care company <a>Atrium Health</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California at Irvine, agrees — to an extent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The best travel advice of 2021, from By The Way Concierge</p></div>
<div><div><p>Step one: Get a good <a>mask</a> and make sure it fits correctly. Madad suggests an N95, KN95 or KN94 mask for travelers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because everyone has a unique face shape, Noymer says you may need to purchase multiple mask options from different brands to find one that seals your nose and mouth the best.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The airline lost your luggage. Now what?</p></div>
<div><div><p>While traveling, refrain from taking off the mask in shared public spaces, Madad says. If you need to eat or drink something, she recommends finding a less crowded place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passaretti also recommends booking a <a>window seat</a>, where you will be farther from passengers walking up and down the aisles, and turning on the overhead air vent to improve the air flow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These tips are, of course, in addition to coronavirus-prevention basics such as cleaning your hands often and social distancing from people when possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, it may be worth having another conversation with your doctor about your vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mordkin recommends confirming with your physician that you are still not a candidate for coronavirus vaccination, as it remains the most effective defense against severe illness or death from a covid-19 infection.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Yoha!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On a sweltry morning in early December, two cruisers were cracking up at the Miami terminal where Virgin Voyages’ Scarlet Lady was docked. They repeated the curious word and laughed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yoha!” they giggled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After catching their breath, they shared their inside joke. They pointed to a sign on a median where shuttles and taxis were dropping off passengers. The giant red letters spelled out “AHOY.”</p></div></div>
<p>“I read it from the other side, and didn’t know what ‘yoha’ meant,” one half of the traveling duo said as she clutched a coffee cup that did not contain a hot beverage. (She shook it so I could hear the citrus garnish.)</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s ahoy, not yoha!” her friend exclaimed, delivering the punchline.</p></div></div>

<div><p>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s been tough getting people to just wear masks,” she said. “We haven’t seen a lot of change.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Portland Pie Co. currently follows all Maine (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) and U.S. CDC guidance specific to restaurants,” Perkins said in a statement to the <a>Portland Press Herald</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>Texas</a> have notified their customers of closures related to positive tests and potential coronavirus exposures. In New York City — where restaurant workers and diners are required to provide proof of vaccination —
<a>many</a> restaurants are closed because of the surge.
<div><p>Restaurants are closing again as staff test positive for coronavirus amid omicron surge</p></div>
<a>data tracked by The Post</a>. Deaths and hospitalizations are up, but not at a higher rate than other states with much larger totals.
<div><div><p>With 76 percent of its population vaccinated, Maine is among the states with the highest vaccination rate in the country — and is outpacing the national rate of 62 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the statewide increase in cases, the Portland City Council voted Monday to repeal the city’s emergency order, ending a coronavirus hazard pay provision that had increased the minimum wage from $13 to $19.50.</p></div></div>
<a>Maine Beacon</a>. “And how are we adding equity as a top issue we want to tackle in Portland without actually providing financial compensation to those who need it?”
<div><div><p>The city council also voted to implement an indoor mask mandate, with an exception made for businesses that require workers to be vaccinated, according to the <a>Press Herald</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Saxon said she started working at Portland Pie Co. in August 2020, partly because of how seriously the company took pandemic precautions for its workers.</p></div></div>
<p>When she asked management what it would take to reinstitute a mask mandate, Saxon was allegedly told that Portland Pie Co. “didn’t want to deal with any blowback” of losing employees who might not want to wear masks at work.</p>
<div><div><p>“We couldn’t afford to lose people who didn’t wear masks,” she told The Post. “It was disappointing they didn’t want to do the safe thing.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some GOP leaders are scornful or silent about booster shots seen as key to fighting omicron</p></div>
<div><div><p>She noted on social media how she once asked management if the restaurant should put up a “masks recommended” sign on the door. She wrote she was told no, “because it would scare people away.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not going to be here that long — this is not how people should be treated,” Crowley, 21, told the Press Herald. “It is not worth the money.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The breaking point came Sunday, said Saxon, shortly after employees found out about another positive test and another possible exposure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a point yesterday that we were talking about it, talking to the staff and said, ‘Let’s leave, this place is ridiculous,’ ” Crowley told the newspaper.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>McAndrew hopes the place she worked at on and off for seven years does the right thing to improve safety measures, but she is uncertain about whether that will happen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Saxon said the anger from management has been overshadowed in recent days by the pride and camaraderie from the Portland Pie Co. employees who’ve taken a stand for better health measures at their workplace.</p></div></div>

<div><p>So where do things go from here? This post is our updating look at the paths to victory that remain for Trump and Biden. We will adjust these maps based on projected and likely results to show you the most likely remaining avenues.</p></div>
<div><div><p>So bookmark this page — and refresh often.</p></div></div>
<a>edged ahead in two key, outstanding states: Georgia and Pennsylvania</a>. This means he now leads in 4 of the 5 key states that remain uncalled, along with Arizona and Nevada. Trump retains a lead only in North Carolina.
<div><div><h3><div>Here’s where the race stands. </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The remaining, uncalled swing states are in yellow:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>(Official results still have Alaska undecided, but it isn’t expected to be competitive when all votes are counted.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden’s twin wins in Michigan and Wisconsin brought him close to the 270 electoral votes he would need to become president. He’s now at 253 electoral votes, meaning he needs 17 of the remaining 68 votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How Biden could win</div></h3></div></div>
<p>At this point, Biden’s paths to victory are numerous, while Trump’s are evaporating. Trump would need to carry 4 of the last 5 key states to win, with Pennsylvania needing to be one of them, but he’s ahead only in North Carolina.</p>
<div><p>Biden, meanwhile, could win just by carrying Pennsylvania or by carrying only Arizona and Nevada. He could also get to 269 votes — enough for a tie — by winning only Georgia, with any other state giving him the victory.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The current counts suggest he’s likely to win more than that, but let’s run through each scenario.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Were Biden to somehow lose Pennsylvania, he would needs some combination of 2 of the 4 remaining uncalled states: Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Nevada (6) and North Carolina (15).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what it would look like if we gave Biden these states but not Pennsylvania:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How could Trump win? </div></h3></div></div>
<a> to litigate results notwithstanding</a> — and it requires a lot of pieces coming together.
<div><div><p>Here’s what that would look like, with either Arizona or Nevada putting Trump over 270:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If Trump were to somehow pull it off, it would arguably be an even bigger assist from the electoral college than he got in 2016, when he carried three states by less than one percentage point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at this point, it’s Biden’s race to lose.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Trump appeared to try to defy Twitter’s ban by using @POTUS, and later his @TeamTrump campaign account, both of which were suspended.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Some <a>other examples</a> of how the GOP could make overturning an election easier in the future:</p></div></div>
<li>A raft of Trump-supported election-deniers — who often went quite a bit further than most other GOP elected officials in alleging voter fraud — are running for secretary of state in key states.</li>
<li>The party has supported bills giving (Republican) legislators more power to overturn a result themselves.</li>
<li>It has supported bills lowering the threshold for evidence of voter fraud.</li>
<li>It has added harsher penalties for local officials breaking election rules — including inadvertently — in a way that could be used to call results into question.</li>
<li>It has moved to unseat and otherwise push out lawmakers and election officials who stood in the way of efforts to question the 2020 election.</li>

<a>Paul Kane has dug into this</a>, including earlier this month while discussing Democratic efforts to change filibuster rules, which thus far have included no formal debate. And that’s no coincidence: According to
<a>C-SPAN data</a>, in 2021, the Senate spent just 12.5 percent of its time in session actually debating things. That’s down from over 50 percent in each Congress between 2013 and 2019.

<div><div><p>We’ve written for much of the year about <a>Republicans’ stubborn coronavirus vaccine skepticism and opposition</a>. What has gotten less attention is how it’s emblematic of a larger shift in the party.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> vaccine should be optional, but their
<a>support for childhood vaccine mandates writ large has also fallen significantly</a> — from two-thirds in 2015 to less than a majority now, according to one pollster. Some GOP-controlled states have at least
<a>back their approach</a> to promoting and mandating other vaccines. And GOP leaders’ talking points on coronavirus vaccine mandates often
<a>do little to explain why those should not be mandated when other vaccines are</a>.

<div><h1>5 takeaways from Biden’s forceful Jan. 6 takedown of Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:04 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>sarcastically saying he missed “my predecessor.”</a> Biden largely
<a>avoided mentioning Trump</a> in the following months.
<div><div><p>Below are some takeaways from Biden’s speech.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1. The Trump focus</div></h3></div></div>
<p>“For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election; he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,” Biden said. “But they failed. They failed.”</p>
<div><p>Biden added later: “He has done what no president in American history — the history of this country — has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then Biden went after Trump’s delayed response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>2. Not just targeting but goading Trump</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Much of Biden’s speech seemed aimed at not just criticizing but also goading Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He referred to Trump’s “bruised ego” over losing the 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<a>invocations of the 74 million people who voted for Trump</a>, and the idea that not further scrutinizing Trump’s baseless voter-fraud claims was tantamount to disregarding those voters.
<div><div><p>Biden also pointed to those who might otherwise be allies who clearly didn’t back up Trump’s claims.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden punctuated it all toward the end of his speech by labeling Trump what Trump fears perhaps most of all: a loser.</p></div></div>
<i>defeated </i>former president,” Biden said, emphasizing “defeated” and then repeating it — “defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.”
<div><div><h3><div>3. A recognition that being passive doesn’t work</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It might have been a special occasion, but it also seemed to mark recognition that Trump is going nowhere, and one can’t pretend otherwise.</p></div></div>
<a>did that in a late-2017 speech against Trump</a>, and on Thursday there was a word curiously missing from Biden’s remarks: “Trump.”
<div><div><p>Biden’s speech, though, was clearly targeted at one person in particular. And if you’re saying “<a>all that I mean</a>,” why not say all that you mean and make it even more explicit?</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>4. The undersold rebuke</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Toward the end, Biden referred to something that hasn’t gotten nearly enough attention: the implicit GOP idea that the presidential election was somehow stolen, but not other races.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s Biden:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cruz’s former chief of staff laid the groundwork for making that point more than a year ago. And Biden rightfully raised it Thursday. It has certainly been a selective voter-fraud crusade.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>5. What happens now</div></h3></div></div>
