<a>Putin has said</a> the country was artificially invented by former prime minister and president
<a>Nursultan Nazarbayev</a>, who
<a>founded and ruled it</a> for more than three decades as a thinly veiled dictatorship, mimicking Putin’s own model. Though still pulling strings behind the scenes, the now-81-year-old Nazarbayev has
<a>clearly lost control</a> of the situation, forcing him to run to Putin for emergency help.
<a>For the first time</a>, the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)
<a>has deployed troops</a> inside Kazakhstan, supposedly at Kazakhstan’s request, to fight regular citizens the government now calls “
<a>terrorists.”</a> It’s still early, and much is unknown, but there’s a real risk that the Kazakhstan crisis could turn into a quagmire Russia wasn’t planning for.

<div><h1>Closing schools won’t stop omicron. It’ll just hurt kids. </h1></div>
<h2>Schools aren’t the reason for the virus’s rapid spread</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Westyn Branch-Elliman</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Elissa Schechter-Perkins</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Shira Doron</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 11:22 a.m. EST</div></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic. We have ample evidence that closing schools is not an effective way to contain the virus and is, in fact,
<a>harmful to children</a>. We have better ways of keeping the community safe than robbing children of valuable in-school learning.
<a>United States started skyrocketing over the holidays</a>, while children were home for the winter break and not in school. This is due to the properties of the virus, specifically omicron’s higher
<a>contagiousness compared with earlier variants</a> and its ability to infect vaccinated people. This is also because of human behavior: People
<a>traveled around</a> and gathered indoors for the holidays.
<a>studies from the United States</a> and
<a>access to additional doses</a> that
<a>bolster their protection</a> against the worst outcomes. Additionally, although the case numbers are reaching record highs, a glimmer of hope is that omicron
<a>appears to cause milder disease</a>, possibly because of mutations that render it
<a>less able to infect lung cells</a>.
<p>If in-person learning is not driving the exponential rise in cases or increase in hospitalization rates, then switching to remote learning clearly won’t succeed in relieving the strain on the health-care system. It might even worsen it.</p>
<a>struggling with staff shortages</a> and are on the verge of implementing
<a>crisis-level staffing</a> to stay afloat. Closing schools will only exacerbate this strain; school closures may mean that at least some of the
<a>30 percent of health-care workers</a> who are also parents of young children will stay home to take care of their children, worsening the health-care staffing and burnout crisis.
<a>they hurt children</a>, and they limit our ability to keep the hospitals open. There’s no justification for putting these policy options back on the table.

<div><div><p>As the world enters 2022, public libraries are emerging as one of the bright spots — literally.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An abundance of new and newly renovated libraries have opened their doors in the past two years. In addition to being breathtakingly beautiful, many are exemplars of what great community spaces can and should be.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Indoors, they are filled with natural light. Books once packed together in dark corners are now on display on bright, welcoming shelves that could rival those in an Apple store. Some libraries have added outdoor patios and roof decks.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Call it a new golden era for public libraries worldwide. Some of what are already being dubbed “cultural masterpieces” include:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The “<a>Wormhole Library</a>" in Haikou, China, which has made numerous top architectural design <a>lists</a>. Overlooking a river, its stunning mix of windows and concrete resemble a wormhole or cloud.</p></div></div>
<p>The <a>Stanley A. Milner Library </a>in Edmonton, Alberta, which has 3-D printers, a sewing center, recording studios, and vinyl and laser cutters for special projects. The bright new interior of stairs and ramps beckons visitors to explore.</p>
<div><div><p>The Deichman Bjørvika in Oslo, which won <a>public library of the year in 2021.</a> In addition to stunning reading rooms, it has a cinema, a 200-seat auditorium, cafes, recording studios, rehearsal spaces and game rooms.</p></div></div>
<a>Fayetteville Public Library</a> in Arkansas, which offers an “art and movement” room, an event center and a teaching kitchen, among other amenities. In the heart of Manhattan, the renovated
<a>Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library</a> provides not only ample places to read but also a business center, a podcasting studio, a floor dedicated to children and teens, and a rooftop terrace.
<div><p>D.C.'s newly transformed <a>Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library</a> includes a large auditorium, conference center, rooftop terrace, cafe and music production facilities. A colorful ceiling with hanging mobiles adds to the delight.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Branch libraries are also getting makeovers. The new <a>Southwest D.C. library</a> aims to become a neighborhood gathering place, with a meeting room that can fit 100 people and an outdoor porch area.</p></div></div>
<p>Many notable renovations in recent years were funded by a combination of taxpayer money and private donations. Now is an ideal time for local governments in the United States to tap into American Rescue Plan funding to jumpstart a library project.</p>
<a>lending out laptops and WiFi devices</a>.
<div><div><p>As then-American Library Association President Julius C. Jefferson Jr. put it, "Buildings may not have been open, but libraries were never closed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Communities that invest in libraries are well prepared for whatever the next chapter brings.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Vaccinations have become such a politically charged issue in the United States that at least five red states are essentially paying people not to get vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The five states — Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas and Tennessee — are granting people unemployment aid if they lose a job because they refuse to get vaccinated. This is not how unemployment compensation is supposed to work.</p></div>
<a>urging people to get vaccinated</a> because it significantly reduces the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death. In a pandemic where
<a>more than 821,000 Americans have died</a>, political leaders should be doing everything they can to urge people to get vaccinated, not rewarding them for opting out.
<a>coronavirus</a> under control. When cases spike, people stay home and don’t spend as much money, which hurts local businesses and vacation destinations.
<a>refuse entry to the unvaccinated</a>.
<a> cut off enhanced pandemic unemployment benefits early</a> this past June and July. State Republican leaders at the time argued people needed to get back to work ASAP. Now they have had a change of heart for the unvaccinated.
<p>Giving unemployment aid to workers refusing to get vaccinated is a misguided policy by certain Republican governors and legislatures to win some partisan points. It’s not what’s best for the country — or the local workforce.</p>

<div><div><p>The decades-long incumbent-protection scheme known as redistricting is finished in Virginia, at least for now. Good riddance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The new maps — drafted by a pair of experts chosen by the court, one from each party — were enacted unanimously by the seven justices. The decision is momentous.</p></div></div>
<a>63-page memo</a> to the court, they explained their rationale for the changes in painstaking detail, including enough voting data to sate the most ardent psephologist. Not exactly a smoke-filled room.
