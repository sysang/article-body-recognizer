<div><h1>Vaccine gap between Black and White Americans narrowed, but it’s back for booster shots</h1></div>
<h2>That puts majority-Black communities such as Prince George’s County, Md., at risk amid the current coronavirus surge</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Chason</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Deneen Richmond hears a lot of confusion — and a lot of concern — about coronavirus vaccine boosters in this majority-Black suburb of Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But with the arrival of the booster, the disparity returned.</p></div></div>
<a>highly contagious omicron variant</a>. That means many of the majority-Black communities that were devastated in earlier stages of the pandemic, including
<a> Prince George’s</a>, could be especially vulnerable again.
<div><div><p>“If people don’t get boosted,” Richmond said, “our health-care system is going to be overwhelmed.”</p></div></div>
<a>34 percent of Black Marylanders </a>who were fully vaccinated have gotten a booster, compared with 46 percent of White residents;
<a>in Virginia</a>, it’s 34 percent of Black residents and 45 percent of White residents; and
<a>in D.C.</a>, it’s 21 percent of Black residents and 33 percent of White residents. That trend is echoed across the country, according to
<a>a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, although federal data is spottier because not all states and counties report the race of vaccine recipients.
<div><div><p>The good news is that the gap will probably close again, Sehgal said, but it will take work. And it could already be too late for many, he said, as the omicron variant moves through the population.</p></div></div>
<a>syphilis experiment </a>that took place in his hometown.
<a>medical tents in a parking lot at one hospital</a>. Yet when vaccines became available, the county still had one of the
<a>lowest vaccination rates in the state</a>.
<a>launched a vaccine equity task force</a>.
<a>about 85 percent Black and Latino</a>, has vaccinated 68 percent of all residents
<b> </b>— still slightly lower than some other jurisdictions in the region, but higher than neighboring D.C. and many of the majority-White jurisdictions in Maryland that once posted dramatically higher rates.
<div><p>Covid-19 is ravaging one of the country’s wealthiest black counties</p></div>
<div><div><p>Randolph estimated that about 90 percent of her regular clients have been vaccinated. Many of them, she helped persuade. But only a fraction have gotten a booster shot.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Among the concerns she hears is that the booster shot is just a way for pharmaceutical companies to make money, Randolph said. She encourages them to trust the science and reminds them that getting boosted helps keep her safe, too.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t do my job if I’m more than six feet from you,” Randolph says at her salon in Capitol Heights.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of roughly 50 people in her family, she said, about half are vaccinated. Only she and her husband are boosted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For some Prince Georgians, figuring out where and how to get the booster shot is still an obstacle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mae Grey, 82, acknowledged that she might have missed news about the booster because of health challenges she and her family members have faced recently, including a mini-stroke she suffered.</p></div></div>
<a>struggled to secure a vaccine appointment in the spring</a>. She said in an interview last week that
<b> </b>she wished this time around it was easier.
<div><div><p>“We have so many friends and families that have died from this covid,” said Grey, who lives in Capitol Heights. “You’ve got to keep going and not give up.”</p></div></div>
<a>since its creation in January</a>
<a>,</a> said officials were so pleased with how much progress on vaccine equity had been made that they considered winding down the task force when the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
<div><div><p>She is more hopeful now than last winter, because officials know that meeting people where they are actually works — eventually.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>And Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), who is vaccinated and boosted,
<a>announced recently that she had tested positive</a>.
<div><div><p>As Gregory Freeman, 73, weighed whether to get a booster shot, he thought about the long history of exploitation of Black Americans by the medical system. But he also considered the surging cases and death around him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He could only hope, he said, that friends and family would follow his lead.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Julie Zauzmer Weil</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Gregory S. Schneider</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Erin Cox</div></span></div></span></div><div>February 9, 2021 at 10:55 a.m. EST</div></div>

<div><div><p>The first precious boxloads of the frozen elixir arrived in December, bearing great promise for curtailing the pandemic that has paralyzed the region and the world.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nurses and firefighters got injections on live TV. Some of them cried. Watching at home, many hopeful people cried, too.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But in the weeks that followed, that hope was mixed with frustration, then anger, as it became clear that getting the potentially lifesaving vaccine would not be easy — not nationally, and not in the District, Maryland and Virginia.</p></div>
<div><p>Questions and answers about the vaccine in D.C., Maryland and Virginia</p></div>
<div><div><p>Again and again, officials made an initial choice about how to distribute scarce doses, then reversed course when their hastily made plans led to unforeseen problems.</p></div></div>
<p>“They say they have no appointments to schedule,” Gasaway said. Then she interrupted herself, looking at the faces of her council members in their minuscule Zoom boxes, and added, “If you are still listening to me.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>D.C.: A search for racial equity</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Most nursing home workers refused the vaccine. Facilities helped convince them.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The task of distributing vaccines was in many ways less complicated for the District than for any state — the city has only one health department and could make and enforce centralized decisions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The city booked appointment slots at La Clinica del Pueblo, one of the many health clinics enlisted in the vaccination effort, three days before the clinic had told the city it would be ready to accept patients.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The biggest problem in the District has been racial equity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Few states are accurately tracking vaccinations by race. Some aren’t at all.</p></div>
<div><p>Nesbitt said that approach would not make sense. Soon, she and council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) were shouting at each other. After the contentious meeting ended, they spoke privately, and Nesbitt agreed to look into the issue.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after, Nesbitt agreed to allow new appointment sign-ups for residents of underserved Zip codes one day a week, and then release appointments open to anyone in the city on a second day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Weeks later, vast disparities remain — and some residents are fuming at being shut out of the sign-up system once a week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You have to be intentional about warding off these disparities,” Jones said. “Because if you just let sort of equality reign the day, you don’t get equal results.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Virginia: Every county wants more doses</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The vaccine plan Virginia submitted to the federal government around Thanksgiving included a list of every location in the state confirmed to have a freezer equipped to store the vaccine doses. State leaders thought they were well-prepared.</p>
<div><div><p>Then the vials arrived.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Changes since that sluggish start have sent the state zooming up the national listings, statistically, but also have caused bitter fighting about which counties and regions should get doses first.</p></div></div>
<div><p>These states are the best at vaccinations. Their secret? Keeping it simple.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Richmond, Northam’s chief of staff, Clark Mercer, recalled a swift reaction: “That’s the guidance we’ve been asking for. That’s great. Let’s go announce it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Within 48 hours, Northam expanded eligibility. The next day, news reports revealed there was no federal stockpile to rely on. Suddenly, millions of Virginians were trying to schedule appointments that didn’t exist.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With localities around the state clamoring for doses, Northam’s team changed how it apportioned the vaccine supply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was hustling, bustling. There was music playing. . . . We were at the height of our operations, smoothly moving through. And to have that shut down was just incredibly frustrating.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Northam and Mercer both expressed dismay that anyone was surprised by the change. “It was the plan all along” to transition to the per capita allocation system, Mercer said.</p></div></div>
<p>The revised strategy is meeting the goals that Northam demanded at an emergency meeting in early January. Virginia is now administering close to 30,000 doses per day, and for a while soared ahead of Maryland in its seven-day vaccination rate.</p>
<div><div><p>Mercer said he got a call from a Maryland official after that happened, asking for advice on how the neighboring state could catch up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Maryland: Decentralized response</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While visiting a nursing home vaccination clinic a few days before Christmas, Hogan discovered something that would color the trajectory of the rest of his state’s rollout.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was much slower than we anticipated,” he said in an interview. “We were surprised at the lack of urgency, and the lack of people that were willing to get it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As many as 7 in 10 workers at the state’s hundreds of nursing homes refused a shot. Hospitals also had low vaccination rates at first. The lion’s share of doses went unused for weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, he planned to vaccinate the earliest-priority groups fully before moving on. As of Jan. 5, he said people ages 65 to 74 would probably have to wait until March.</p></div></div>
<p>Hogan soon announced that people 75 and older could get vaccinated, followed by those 65 and older a week later. That swelled the pool of eligible people from 533,000 to nearly 2.1 million, even though just 80,000 doses were available each week.</p>
<div><div><p>In Montgomery County, the state’s most populous jurisdiction, officials rejected the governor’s call in the name of racial equity, focusing on the tens of thousands of health-care workers who remained unvaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A diverse suburb’s biggest challenge: Distributing the vaccine equitably</p></div>
<div><div><p>For residents across the region who are frantic to get vaccinated, who jam websites until they crash, and wait for hours on the phone to no avail, the vaccine still feels out of reach.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Nicole Asbury</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021|Updated December 29, 2021 at 6:36 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools will require a negative coronavirus test for every student and staffer returning after the holiday break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We certainly weighed this decision and believe it’s very important to elevate our surveillance at this time,” D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools families should<b> </b>pick up rapid antigen tests at schools Jan. 3 and 4, and upload results to the <a>system’s website</a> by 4 p.m. on Jan. 4.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Students who do not meet the deadline will not be allowed to attend school when classes begin Jan. 5.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said in an interview Wednesday that the requirement was a good idea, because there’s a lot of angst over the coronavirus surge among parents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Requiring that everyone is tested begins to address that,” Mendelson said. “It’s reasonable that we want to take every step possible to reduce community spread.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. schools stayed open amid surges. Many students stayed home.</p></div>
<div><div><p>She also said that her union was happy the school system was rolling out a test-to-return program and supplying KN95 masks to all educators.</p></div></div>
<a>Fairfax</a> counties, will begin
<a>“test-to-stay” programs</a> that allow unvaccinated students exposed to the coronavirus by a classmate to get tested regularly at school to ensure they are not infected. If they test negative, they are allowed to stay in school.
<div><div><p>D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) referred to the school system’s effort to test over 90,000 students as the city’s “biggest data collection effort throughout covid.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Throughout January, we’re going to have to maintain vigilance about access to the building,” Bowser said. “And we’re going to do our part in the buildings, and we ask that families do their part.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools’ leadership will host a virtual town hall at 4 p.m. Thursday to further address questions about its return plan.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Prince George’s students return to virtual learning amid ‘stark rise’ in covid cases</h1></div>
<h2>Maryland county is first system in D.C. area to return to remote education this fall</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Donna St. George</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 5:44 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Students in Prince George’s County will switch from in-person classes to virtual learning until mid-January as coronavirus cases surge and schools in the Washington region increasingly restrict student activities.</p></div></div>
<a>have reported a significant jump in infections</a>. Earlier this week, Goldson had called the trend alarming, saying that a week earlier that the two-day total was fewer than 100 cases, compared to this week’s high of 155 cases in one day.
<div><p>As covid surges, D.C.-area schools cancel activities and go virtual again</p></div>
<div><div><p>Prince George’s previously had suspended in-person instruction at two middle schools and a charter school.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Students who have been enrolled in a virtual program throughout the fall will remain in remote mode through Jan. 31.</p></div></div>
<a>Georgetown Preparatory School</a> and
<a>Sidwell Friends</a>, have also closed classrooms.
<div><p>Reinstating indoor mask mandate ‘on the table’ as coronavirus cases surge, Bowser says</p></div>
<div><div><p>At least for now, Prince George’s is an outlier in its systemwide closure. But other Maryland counties enacted fresh restrictions this week in response to covid surges and fears of the omicron variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That move follows Howard County’s decision Wednesday to suspend its own sports contests, concerts, plays and other extracurricular activities, citing cases that were surging at an “alarming rate.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Schools have spent the past few months refining guidelines on masks, staff vaccines, quarantines and other strategies to try to limit the spread of the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ask The Post: We’re taking your questions on returning to school amid the delta variant</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here is a look at some of what’s planned in area districts:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Alexandria City Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 24 for all schools except for Samuel W. Tucker Elementary School, which started Aug. 9. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a mask mandate? Are masks required during recess or lunch?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Masks are required for everyone indoors and while in school vehicles, regardless of vaccination status. No masks are required outside for recess. Students must wear masks during lunch when they are not eating.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for staff members?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All staff members must be fully vaccinated or participate in weekly testing. But school board members <a>said recently</a> that they want a stronger vaccine mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is the school system doing testing? If so, how often and what kind?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district plans to do voluntary, “surveillance” testing of students with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a virtual option? Who is eligible?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district expects to have nearly 530 students learning through the <a>Virtual Virginia</a> program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What are the district’s quarantine rules?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said that per health and safety guidelines, quarantine is 14 days from the date of exposure for close contacts. More details are available on the <a>district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is your district preparing for a possible return to all-virtual schooling should the public health situation force it?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said that it is prepared to pivot quickly to virtual learning if needed and that the infrastructure used last year will remain in place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available <a>on the district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><p>Northam mandates masks inside all K-12 schools in Virginia this fall, even for the vaccinated</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Arlington Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school:</b> Aug. 30.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Staff members <a>are required to be fully vaccinated</a> or be tested regularly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for students?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Starting Nov. 8, high school athletes and eighth-graders <a>participating</a> in winter and spring sports must be vaccinated. Students with medical exemptions must undergo testing for the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district will test students weekly, and families will be asked to opt in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district said it is expecting 800 students to participate across all grade levels. Everyone is eligible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said it will not close school buildings and shift to full virtual instruction unless state officials order it to do so.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>D.C. Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school</b>: Aug. 30. Charter schools, which educate nearly half of the city’s public school students, have <a>varying start dates</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All students and staff members, regardless of their vaccination status, must wear a mask indoors. During lunch, everyone is asked to wear a mask when they are not eating or drinking.</p></div></div>
<a>fully vaccinated by Nov. 1</a>. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) had previously required
<a>all city employees</a> — including school staff members — to be fully vaccinated or get tested each week.
<div><div><p>Student-athletes ages 12 and older <a>must be fully vaccinated</a> by Nov. 1 to participate in school-based sports. Students who turn 12 between Sept. 20 and Nov. 1 must be vaccinated by Dec. 13.</p></div></div>
<a>automatically enroll</a> all public school students into the testing program. Families can opt out. Charter schools may opt into this program, or use a city grant to enact one of their own.
<div><p>D.C. fell short of student testing goals in the spring</p></div>
<a>approved expanding virtual learning eligibility</a> for some charter schools.
<p>The Bowser administration has remained steadfast that it intends to require in-person learning for nearly all students this academic year, and the mayor has said she is not watching for any specific coronavirus case number that could change that.</p>
<div><div><p>Other schools across the city have been prepping for another post-winter break covid-19 surge, and some will take a stricter approach than D.C. public schools’ test-recommended-but-optional approach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>KIPP DC, the city’s largest charter network, changed its plans last week: Now students will be returning to virtual instruction and learning asynchronously on Jan. 3.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Fairfax County Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 23. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a mask mandate? Are masks required during recess or lunch?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for staff members?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. All Fairfax school employees must be vaccinated by late October or submit to regular testing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Yes, for high school student-athletes. The district announced Aug. 30 that it will require <a>students who play winter and spring high school sports</a> and other activities that require a physical to show proof of vaccination by Nov. 8.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is the school system doing testing? If so, how often and what kind?</b></p></div></div>
<p>The district plans to partner with a third-party provider to administer testing, and will continue to work with the county health department to test symptomatic in-person students or staff members who are unable to access testing independently.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a virtual option? Who is eligible?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, although eligibility is limited and based on a documented health need. About 400 students are enrolled in the district’s virtual program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What are the district’s quarantine rules?</b></p></div></div>
<a>website</a> says that in the event of an exposure to the virus, it will work with the county’s health department to conduct contact tracing and determine whether quarantining is necessary. The district said
<a>protocols are in place</a> to ensure continuity of learning.
<div><div><p><b>Is your district preparing for a possible return to all-virtual schooling should the public health situation force it?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district plans to remain open unless directed otherwise by health officials or by executive order. Officials said the system has plans to ensure continuity of learning in the event of a temporary closure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available <a>on the district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Loudoun County Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 26.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. All school employees must be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1 or submit to weekly testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district is not performing testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district said that all students were welcome to apply for its distance learning program and that 533 were accepted. Additional students with serious medical conditions were then welcomed to apply off a wait list.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said state law does not allow for a return to all-virtual learning, but individual classrooms or schools may temporarily pivot based on in-school virus transmission.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Montgomery County Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school</b>: Aug. 30.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, masks are required for all. Masks are strongly encouraged but not required for outdoor recess. Students must be masked while indoors but can remove their masks while eating.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employees <a>must be vaccinated</a>. Those with medical waivers will have to submit to regular testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The school system will do pool testing for random samples of students in prekindergarten through sixth grade, as younger<b> </b>students are not yet eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Yes. The district is offering a virtual academy to accepted students. Eligible students had to show extenuating circumstances, including physical challenges, mental health needs or demonstrated academic success during virtual learning.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Only if ordered by state or federal officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Prince George’s County Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Sept. 8.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Masks are required indoors and also at recess and when students are not eating during lunch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, <a>employees must be vaccinated</a> or participate in weekly testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district will conduct coronavirus testing and screening of students and staff members as needed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>If a single coronavirus case is confirmed, the system will close the exposed area of the facility. But if multiple cases are confirmed within at least three days, the system will close the entire facility to clean and sanitize all areas.</p></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available at on the <a>district’s website.</a></p></div></div>

<p>With 1,500 students quarantined in a matter of days, Montgomery County officials said Wednesday that the school system soon will be launching a program to do rapid testing in school buildings to cut back on the number of students sent home.</p>
<div><div><p>The announcement comes amid an uproar from parents who have relayed stories of classes being quarantined after a single student coughs or struggles with a runny nose.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Classes have been in session for seven school days in Montgomery, the state’s largest school system with more than 160,000 students.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>School board President Brenda Wolff said Wednesday night that she hoped the testing would be in place by Monday. The school system has requested 40,000 tests from the state.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Once we get these tests, this will alleviate a lot of this,” Wolff said. She said she shared the frustration of parents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s outrageous to send all of these kids home for a symptom that could be the common cold or allergies,” she said.</p></div></div>
<p>School system spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said the big shift is that the county is giving the go-ahead for its employees who work in schools to administer the testing. While rapid tests have previously been available, staff had not, she said.</p>
<div><div><p>The county school board is expected to discuss the issue at its Thursday meeting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Elrich was quick to note the pitfalls.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>He said about 125 students were sent home after showing coronavirus symptoms.</p></div></div>
<p>Gayles stood by the policy, noting that if an alternative cause can be immediately linked to the symptom — such as a student with a history of motion sickness feeling nauseous after a bus ride — students will not be asked to quarantine.</p>
<div><div><p>“We agree that not every symptom is covid, and we’re doing our due diligence to separate those symptoms that are most concerning versus those that can be explained by something else,” Gayles said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>People 12 and older will be required to show proof of coronavirus vaccination to enter many businesses in D.C., including restaurants, starting in mid-January under rules that Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The change comes two days after Bowser announced a host of new restrictions to curb record-setting numbers of daily coronavirus cases that have made D.C.'s new daily case rate higher than that of any state in the nation this week.</p></div>
<b> </b>forthcoming vaccine requirement for government workers without a test-out option, and introducing at-home rapid antigen tests for residents, Bowser will now require thousands of businesses to check that patrons are vaccinated.
<div><p>Tracking coronavirus deaths, cases and vaccinations in D.C., Maryland and Virginia</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s great logic for doing this in conjunction with the District,” Elrich said. “We should have done it. Now I hope we can do it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The District’s mandate will cover businesses including restaurants, bars, nightclubs, theaters and gyms, Bowser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she hopes the impending mandate will persuade D.C. residents to get vaccinated now, before they are shut out of their favorite restaurants and entertainment venues.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The District’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration issued dozens of citations and fines this past year to establishments that serve alcohol and flouted rules around mask-wearing indoors.
<div><p><span>Dining while infectious is on the rise. Meet D.C.’s restaurant safety enforcers.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Bajaj noted that since vaccinated people can also become infected and spread the virus, he’s not even sure that an all-vaccinated restaurant will necessarily be a coronavirus-free space.</p></div></div>
<p>But she noted more optimistically that it may help restaurants overcome one of their biggest difficulties aside from supply chain problems. It’s what she calls “diner confidence,” which has affected demand at some restaurants.</p>
<div><div><p>The mandate, she said, “may be something that will help with that, as it creates these environments where diners feel more comfortable, staff feel more comfortable.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elrich said that as he weighs a similar mandate in Montgomery, he has heard from restaurant owners worried that the vaccination checks would require them to hire more staff or provoke confrontations with would-be diners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Maybe not being able to do things like going to a restaurant will finally get through to some people that if they want a normal life like the rest of us would, they should be vaccinated.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Earl Stoddard, Montgomery County’s head of emergency management, said the county would provide guidance or training to reassure business owners worried about liability if a customer presents a fraudulent vaccination card.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland reported 4,072 new cases on Wednesday and Virginia, 5,972 new cases. Fifty deaths in the region were reported Wednesday, all of them in Virginia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The jail, already beset by complaints about conditions, implemented sweeping restrictions to slow the spread. The new rules allow inmates just two hours of out-of-cell time per day, reduced from 5½ hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The department has also faced scrutiny for pandemic-related confinement measures that locked people in their cells for 23 hours a day for more than a year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Bowser’s office nor Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) responded to requests for comment on the jail outbreak.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the first day of free rapid-test distribution at eight of the city’s libraries, lines initially stretched for blocks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emani Johnson, 29, of Congress Heights came to the Anacostia library after failing to find tests in stock at drugstores.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>James Reid, 82, followed her into the library after hearing about the free tests on the news. “Anytime a disease is spreading like this you need to be able to test at home for it,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Bowser also said she plans to sign legislation that the D.C. Council passed Tuesday that will require coronavirus vaccination for children in public schools next school year. “This adds to the safety of our schools,” Bowser said.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Schwartzman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 24, 2021 at 6:04 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>A health-care “disaster” was declared at two Maryland hospitals Friday as coronavirus cases have skyrocketed more than 450 percent in the past month at the facilities, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health announced.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Hospital officials described the measure as “unprecedented” for its organization.</p></div></div>
<p>“We did not take this decision lightly,” Fermin Barrueto, an Upper Chesapeake Health senior vice president, said in a telephone interview. “The demand for our services has outstripped our resources, which includes staffing.”</p>
<div><div><p>He said the emergency measure is expected to last “days, weeks, but your guess is as good as mine.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Between the two hospitals, coronavirus cases have increased 458 percent in the past month, according to the statement. At Upper Chesapeake Medical Center alone, the caseload has increased 733 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It has been a challenge,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the region, coronavirus cases are climbing, with Maryland on Thursday reporting 6,869 new positive tests, its highest single-day count since the pandemic’s start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hogan said in a statement Thursday that he expected “record levels” of hospitalizations in coming weeks, with the unvaccinated “driving the strain on our health care system.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, D.C. has been reporting its own unprecedented number of cases, with a single-day record of 1,904 new cases on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia, which is the only one of the three jurisdictions to update numbers Friday, had 8,756 new cases. The state’s seven-day average of new cases per 100,000 is now up to 60.16, a level not seen since January’s surge.</p></div>

<div><h1>Gov. Larry Hogan tests positive for coronavirus</h1></div>
<h2>Maryland’s coronavirus data returned Monday after a cyberattack; positivity rate is 89% higher than two weeks ago </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ovetta Wiggins</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Erin Cox</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 20, 2021|Updated December 20, 2021 at 7:46 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Gov. Larry Hogan, who is fully vaccinated and received a booster, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hogan said he received a positive rapid test as part of his regular testing routine and was “feeling fine at the moment.” A more reliable polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test confirmed the earlier result late Monday.</p></div>
<p>Hogan’s positive test came as the state for the first time in more than two weeks — due to a cyberattack on the state Department of Health’s network system — reported information on its caseload, testing and positivity rate.</p>
<div><div><p>According to the latest data, Maryland is experiencing a stark rise in cases and the community spread of the coronavirus is at the highest level since May 2020. Hospitalizations are surging.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>10.27. The last time data was available, the rate was 5.43 percent. The daily positivity rate Sunday was 15 percent. Not all of the information has been updated, for example, deaths still stand at 11,022 — the number it was on Dec. 4.
<div><p>Beth Blauer, the executive director of the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University, said the lack of case rate and testing data has had “significant implications” on public health amid the holiday season.</p></div>
<b> </b>The number is similar in neighboring Virginia, where there are 1,344 confirmed covid-19 patient hospitalized. Last week most hospitals in Maryland
<b> </b>were near capacity levels, which triggered emergency measures including the cancellation of elective surgeries.
<div><div><p>Hogan is a <a>cancer survivor</a> and has been in remission since November of 2015. He was <a>diagnosed in June 2015</a> with an aggressive, late Stage 3 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hogan, 65, is immunocompromised due to his past cancer diagnosis, which means he faces a higher risk of serious illness from the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Blauer said that part of the advantage for public officials, such as Hogan, Warren and Booker, is that they receive regular, routine testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the past several days, Maryland has seen a huge bump in demand for tests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Maryland in November said it would distribute 500,000 at-home test kits statewide, but several counties have said this supply is insufficient and sought to procure their own at-home test kits from sellers — with varying results.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While masking is required in public areas of the State House, they have not been required on the second floor, where the governor and his staff work.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The D.C. region went into Christmas weekend with record-setting coronavirus case rates — and came out with even worse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rapidly spreading omicron variant is tearing through the region, leaving overturned holiday plans, <a>canceled flights</a> and sports events and performances, and scared and sick residents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C., Maryland and Virginia all set records Monday, reporting the highest seven-day averages in new cases of any point during the pandemic.</p></div></div>

<div><p>But because those areas also have higher rates of fully vaccinated residents, many of the new cases have been milder, making the impact on area hospitals less extreme than in other parts of the country, state health officials said.</p></div>

<div><p>Coronavirus cases appear to be stabilizing in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, with early signs of decline in the D.C. metro region — giving health officials hope that the area’s vigorous vaccination campaign has paid off.</p></div>

<div><h1>How to stay safe as coronavirus cases from the delta variant are on the rise</h1></div>
<h2>Why the CDC recommends that even vaccinated people wear masks in indoor public spaces in some places</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Kim Bellware</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Lindsey Bever</div></span></div></span></div><div>August 12, 2021 at 5:49 p.m. EDT</div></div>

<p>Further complicating things, federal health officials recently said that data from delta cases suggests that vaccinated people can spread infections — something that did not happen in a significant way with earlier versions of the virus.</p>
<div><p>In this summer of covid freedom, disease experts warn: ‘The world needs a reality check’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what to know:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>If I’m fully vaccinated, do I need to wear a mask indoors?</div></h4></div></div>
<a>“substantial” or “high” transmission</a>. More than 90 percent of U.S. counties met that definition by mid-August.
<a>since mid-May</a> that those who were fully inoculated did not need masks indoors or outdoors in most cases — guidance several health experts who spoke to The Post at the time said was insufficient.
<div><div><h3><div>Is attending a big outdoor gathering such as a wedding or a concert high-risk?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the spectrum of risk, an outdoor setting for fully vaccinated, masked and socially distanced people is the least risky — but may not be an ideal party situation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When you talk about outdoor weddings and parks, I think physical distancing is still a good thing because an infected person may be asymptomatic,” Ezell said.</p></div></div>
<a> linked to nearly 1,000 new infections. </a>
<div><div><p>“‘Safe’ can imply that you’re totally protected,” he said. “The goal for many people is to be at the lowest risk possible.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>I’ve had only my first dose of the vaccine. Do I have enough protection from the delta variant?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wertheim agreed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wertheim said people should get their second dose even if they’ve had an extended interval since their first shot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s no evidence to suggest that waiting longer [to get the second dose] is worse,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Have a question about the delta variant? Ask The Post’s science reporters.</p></div>
<div><div><h4><div>My children aren’t old enough to get a vaccine. How can I protect them?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>Even though children tend to have milder coronavirus cases, Landon said infections in children are following the same trend lines as adults in delta variant hot spots: States with large outbreaks are seeing more infections in children.</p></div>
<div><p>“I understand that it’s really enticing to think of covid as just another cold, but it’s not,” Landon said of virus cases among children. “It’s always best to avoid getting sick at all.”</p></div>
<a>currently those younger than 12</a> — Landon said adults and older siblings can help reduce the risk to these younger children by avoiding crowded indoor settings and wearing masks inside.
<a>recommended </a>that those who are eligible get vaccinated to protect those who are not, and urges universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff members and
<a>students older than 2</a>, vaccinated or not, in K-12 schools to help prevent the spread of the virus.
<div><div><p>And, of course, those experiencing <a>symptoms </a>should stay home and get tested for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But covid-19 is not the only concern.<b> </b>Experts also advise common-sense precautions to prevent all respiratory illnesses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We still pay attention to hand-washing — sing that ‘Happy Birthday’ song twice — we still pay attention to masking and the fit of the mask,” Ezell said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, the intensive surface cleaning that people engaged in early in the pandemic is no longer considered necessary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Can I resume working out at the gym if I’m vaccinated?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I wish there were hard numbers we could give for all of these variations to questions about risk,” Grad said. “But it’s a question of what risk you want to tolerate.”</p></div></div>
<p>Getting as much ventilation as possible in an indoor setting like a gym, where people may be breathing heavily, is one important way to reduce risk. In addition, you should wear a mask while working out if you live in a high-transmission community.</p>
<div><div><h4><div>How do I talk to loved ones who are still hesitant about the vaccine?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Give someone factual information to get them started, Ezell said, and the next person who comes along follows up by “watering,” thereby increasing the number of trusted voices who have shared sound information.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>If cases continue to rise with the delta variant, will more restrictions return?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>Restrictions such as indoor mask rules are likely to increase. Even before the CDC revised its guidance, Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous, had become among a growing number of municipalities to reintroduce mask rules.</p></div>
<div><div><p>And as previously mentioned,<a> the CDC said</a> teachers, staff members and students over the age of 2 should be masked in school buildings, regardless of their vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<a>government agencies</a>, health-care organizations and businesses from
<a>transportation services</a> are requiring employees to get vaccinated or, in some cases, submit to regular testing. Even some
<a>restaurants </a>are asking employees — as well as customers — to show proof that they have had the shots.
<div><div><p>Landon likened state-imposed measures — such as masking rules — to waging a fight with small children.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s like being exhausted and telling your kids, ‘Fine, you can have ice cream for dinner,‘ ” she said. “You don’t have the will to say ‘no’ anymore.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ezell agreed there would be resistance.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A vaccinated barber gave his vaccinated neighbor a haircut. One wore a mask. The other smiled without one.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was the first weekend in over a year with almost no coronavirus restrictions, and D.C.’s businesses were reckoning with how to keep their employees and customers safe.</p></div></div>
<div><p>One shot, free transportation and on-site child care: How groups in D.C. are working to vaccinate people in hard-hit Ward 8</p></div>
<div><div><p>At Busboys and Poets in Anacostia on Saturday morning, Kim Brooks-Rob, 48, approached the front-of-house manager, masked, and asked for a table for 13.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And little did she know that just two days earlier, restaurants were banned from seating more than 10 people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But on Saturday, Deonta Fouch, the manager, replied, “right this way,” and escorted the gaggle of young men to a table inside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They kept their masks on until they sat down, as did most people that morning. Though, per restaurant rules, they didn’t have to.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Busboys and Poets owner Andy Shallal had decided to allow his customers to wander around barefaced indoors without asking for vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His staff, however, remained masked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About 15 minutes away in Ward 7, Wayne Monk, was getting his hair cut at Street Cutts. He walked through a front door that had three signs mandating mask use.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Please wear a face mask.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Face masks required.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Wear your mask.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Monk, 55, sat in a chair barefaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s my neighbor,” said owner David Branch. “We know we’re both vaccinated.”</p></div></div>
<p>Monk, who contracted a severe case of the coronavirus in January, was just getting his sense of smell back. He clutched his mask in his hand as he explained that a shot in the arm made him feel at ease sitting in the chair without a face covering.</p>
<div><div><p>Branch kept on his mask as he trimmed Monk’s beard, as did the line of barbers on either side of him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll keep it on for a little while, until the coronavirus dies down a little more,” Branch said of his mask. “Until more people get vaccinated, too.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Branch had decided, however, to relax his appointment-only policy in light of Bowser’s new regulations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few minutes later, another customer walked in, masked, and Branch shouted, “We’re back open for business!”</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. to remove capacity, activity restrictions for most businesses on May 21</p></div>
<div><div><p>Around the corner in the noodle aisle at Menick’s Market, Joe Chau, the store’s owner, chatted with Deborah Jones, executive director of the Ward 7 Business Partnership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s still up to you, even with what the mayor said,” Jones said to Chau.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yeah, but if I tell them to wear a mask, you know what’ll happen,” Chau said. “I’ll get a whole story. Or someone will get aggressive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chau, who decided recently that he wanted to be vaccinated, spent much of the past year figuring out how to balance the threat of the coronavirus with the dangers of enforcing the mask mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So for him, Bowser’s order meant permission to let masklessness slide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would prefer that everyone wear a mask,” he said. “But now it’s their choice, and there’s not much I can say or do.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two young girls an aisle over purchased juice and gummy candies, maskless. The man in line behind them had two masks covering his face.</p></div></div>
<p>Beneath the slow and piecemeal unmasking at D.C.’s businesses on Saturday was a sense of hope, in large part reflective of the city’s falling coronavirus case rate and rising vaccination rate that made more full reopenings possible.</p>
<div><div><p>Store owners and patrons on Saturday who were once skeptical of vaccinations said they were ready to make an appointment — citing the growing number of people they knew with shots in their arms.</p></div></div>
<p>“I was unsure for a while, just listening to other people, I’d heard bad things,” Askew said. “But then people from this center called me, and they’ve done a lot for me in the past. So I said, I’m ready.”</p>
<div><div><p>“Plus,” Askew said, beaming. “I’ve got a brand new grandson, and I gotta be here for him.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>A haunting, Hollywood-style vision of Jan. 6 as a product of the Trump propaganda machine</h1></div>
<h2>Artist Andres Serrano takes denialism to an even scarier place in “Insurrection”</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Philip Kennicott</div></div>Art and architecture critic </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 3:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>There is no debating the facts of Jan. 6, 2021, but still some people debate the facts.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The debris of Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol now belongs to history</p></div>
<div><div><p>Serrano is again working with highly combustible material. His aim, he says, is a personal sense of objectivity, not condemnation.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Insurrection was always the goal.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Is this film a parody, or satire? Could its studied ambiguity be misconceived and embraced as a genuine piece of Trump propaganda?</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Peggy McGlone</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A few months after taking the reins of one of the smaller Smithsonian museums in July, Ngaire Blankenberg removed 18 Benin Kingdom Court Style works from their cases, saying their presence was harmful.</p></div></div>
<p>“We need to develop trust and transparency among our core constituents in order to build a 21st-century African art museum,” she said. “A huge impediment to that conversation is to have stuff you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<div><p>A new Smithsonian initiative aims to help America deal with the history and legacy of racism</p></div>
<div><p>The panel is examining past collecting standards through a moral rather than legal lens. The new guidelines will require Smithsonian museums to dig into the circumstances behind their acquisitions and make an effort to address any wrongs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The review will bring the entire institution in line with the practices he put in place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which <b/>opened in 2016 with Bunch as its founding director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a moment to say, ‘We can be better,’ ” Bunch said. “By accepting our troubled past, we can point to a better future.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>works stolen by Nazis from Jewish families; in the early 2000s, Italian officials used the courts to force the return of antiquities.
<div><p>Hobby Lobby’s forfeited Gilgamesh tablet is headed back to Iraq, and authorities hope it will be a warning to smugglers</p></div>
<b> </b>and protests around the country that led to
<div><div><p>The display was meant to celebrate the royal court’s rich artistic tradition of metalworks, including bronze plaques and sculptures, and ivory carvings that date to the 1300s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That historical context was not enough for Blankenberg.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My strategy is to create a space of recognition for global Africans — a place where we feel belonging, kinship and inspired by art as defined by us,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s first Black leader, on the challenge of making it ‘a place that matters’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Buyers also worked regularly with dealers and often relied on their reputations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Buyers didn’t ask that many questions before agreeing to a sale,” said Victoria Reed, curator for provenance at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. “Today, we see there is a tremendous risk to that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is giving voice to individuals, communities and institutions that have not always had a voice,” Kreamer said. “Engagement with communities will be part of curatorial practice going forward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Blankenberg, the question of legal ownership is not the central concern.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The important thing is not so much this option or that option but who gets to decide,” she said. “Is there an equitable conversation between source communities and museums to decide what happens to the objects?”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of Smithsonian-wide staff shortages related to the region’s coronavirus surge, the National Museum of African Art is open only on Saturdays and Sundays until Jan. 19.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Smithsonian is on a massive search for six new museum directors. Their work could reshape the institution for generations.</p></div>

<div><h1>The 10 weirdest celebrity apologies of 2021, from a ‘seductive’ Bible dance to making fun of Madonna</h1></div>
<h2>They flipped a double-bird on live TV. They insulted BTS fans (the nerve). They overreacted to ‘guilt-free’ snacks. Just some of the things famous people wound up saying sorry for this year. </h2>
