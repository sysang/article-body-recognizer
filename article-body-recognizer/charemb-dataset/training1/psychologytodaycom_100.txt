<h1> ‘Straight’ Men Who Have Sex With Men </h1>
<h2> Why would a man in a heterosexual relationship be sexual with other men? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Image by Fizkes on Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>pornography</a> or engaging in sex with other men – all the while insisting they’re heterosexual and love their wives.
<p>Consider this email I received from a betrayed wife (made anonymous and used here with permission):</p>
<p>After that, I asked to see his phone. Handing it over to me and knowing what I was about to find, he admitted he’d been <a>cheating on</a> me since the beginning of our relationship using hookup apps, and he was mostly cheating with men.</p>
<a>Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder</a>. Based on that, I recommended treatment for sexual compulsivity at
<a>Seeking Integrity: Los Angeles</a>, where I was able to remain directly involved in his and his wife’s healing process.
<p>Regarding his <a>sexual orientation</a>, the clinical team explained that there are many reasons why a man in a relationship with a woman might choose to act out sexually with members of the same sex. The most common are as follows:</p>
<li>He is physically attracted to other men and always has been, whether he’s admitted it or not. If so, he may be gay and using his wife as a cover. He might also be bisexual – attracted to both his wife and the men he acts out with.</li>
<li>His use of pornography has uncovered a latent sexual interest in men, and now he is acting on that. (I wrote about this phenomenon several months ago. You can find that article at <a>this link</a>.)</li>
<a>marriage</a> vows and no longer keeps secrets.
<a>decision-making</a> based on that honesty. Without that, both the individuals and the relationship will continue to suffer.

<p>When Seasonal Meets Situational…</p>
<p>SAD symptoms are usually mild to moderate, but they can become severe. The most common symptoms of SAD include:</p>
<li>Loss of interest in normally pleasurable activities (hobbies, socialization, etc.)</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Sleep issues (inability to fall asleep, difficulty waking up, etc.)</li>
<li>Thoughts of death or <a>suicide</a></li>

<p>Self-Care: The onus for improved self-care is on the client (often with help from the client’s family). This may include (but is hardly limited to) the following:</p>
<a>Omega-3</a> fatty acids such as those found in salmon and other fish and in certain nuts and grains can also help with symptoms of depression.
<p>Medication: <a>Antidepressant</a> medications can be useful in the treatment of depression, especially when used in conjunction with talk therapy.</p>

<h1> Classical Conditioning, Operant Conditioning, and Porn </h1>
<h2> Is compulsivity with pornography a learned behavior? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: AlexLMX on Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>trauma</a>-driven) compulsive person. (See my post,
<a>Pavlov’s Porn</a>.) I have chosen to refer to this new and emerging category as conditioned compulsivity. But what, exactly, do I mean when I use the word conditioned.
<a>classical conditioning</a>, and operant conditioning. Neither fully explains the human condition, which is also influenced by
<a>genetics</a>, free-will, environmental impacts, and a host of other issues. That said, both classical and operant conditioning are clearly in play when it comes to porn usage.
<p>Classical conditioning is learning through association. Stated simply, two unrelated stimuli are paired to produce a new (learned) response.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Alain Lacroix on Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Rats are not stupid. In fact, they learn through operant conditioning rather quickly.</p>
<ul><li>Green Light + Lever = Food</li> <li>Red Light + Lever = Pain</li> </ul>
<p>People are similar in this regard. If we’re rewarded for a certain behavior, we remember it. If we’re punished for a certain behavior, we remember that as well.</p>
<p>Schedules of Reinforcement</p>
<p>Skinner referred to these concepts as the response rate and the extinction rate.</p>
<ul><li>Response Rate: The rate at which the lever is pressed.</li> <li>Extinction Rate: The rate at which lever pressing dies out.</li> </ul>
<p>What he found was that random reward disbursement had the highest response rate and the lowest extinction rate. Apparently, the uncertainty of the reward adds to the excitement of receiving it.</p>
<p>Continuous reinforcement (getting a reward every time the condition is met):</p>
<ul><li>Response Rate – Slow </li> <li>Extinction Rate – Fast</li> </ul>
<p>Fixed ratio reinforcement (getting a reward after meeting the condition a set number of times)</p>
<ul><li>Response Rate – Fast </li> <li>Extinction Rate – Medium</li> </ul>
<p>Variable ratio reinforcement (behavior is reinforced at an unpredictable rate)</p>
<ul><li>Response Rate – Fast </li> <li>Extinction Rate – Slow</li> </ul>
<p>Interestingly, the extinction rate with variable ratio reinforcement is not just slow, it’s almost nonexistent. If we know that a reward might come at any time, we find it hard to walk away.</p>
<a>fear</a> every time he hears a bell – a combination of classical and operant conditioning.
<p>OK, so what does this have to do with porn?</p>
<p>Why did people get so swept up in Pokémon Go? Three words: variable ratio reinforcement. As stated above, when our behavior is randomly reinforced, our response rate is fast (we play) and our extinction rate is slow (we keep playing).</p>
<a>orgasm</a>, more reinforcement.

<h1> Understanding Users of Child Pornography </h1>
<h2> Why do some men look at child pornography? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Stenko Vlad/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>sexual</a> offense is likely to be committed. Moreover, many (though not all) of the men who look at child porn, once they enter treatment, tend to respond positively to therapeutic intervention with a minimal likelihood of relapse.
<p>To illustrate the difference between those who are likely and unlikely to respond to treatment, consider the examples of James and Robert.</p>
<p>James, a 26-year-old male, was arrested after the IT department at his work found around 20 underage images and videos on his company-issued laptop. The IT department also found hundreds of legal images and videos, mostly depicting adult women.</p>
<p>Types of Child Porn Users</p>
<p>Clinicians who are skilled with issues related to child pornography have identified three primary typologies, each of which presents unique risks and potential for recovery and healing.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>, and the like. Unfortunately, as with other addictions, sex/
<a>porn addiction</a> tends to escalate. In the same way that a substance abuser might escalate from
<a>addiction</a> recovery, where short-term
<a>relapses</a> are relatively common.
<p>Regardless of typology, factors that can complicate or hinder treatment include:</p>
<li>Child porn is merely one aspect of a larger antisocial or criminal lifestyle.</li>
<li>Porn use includes bizarre or ritualistic acts, like extreme <a>bondage</a> or enemas.</li>
<li>The offender denies the offense occurred or tries to blame someone else.</li>
<li>Child porn use is secondary to an unremitting condition of serious mental illness or mental disability.</li>
<p>Although the above factors can complicate and hinder treatment, they do not automatically signal that an offender is untreatable.</p>

<a>genetics</a>, various environmental factors, and a person’s susceptibility to

<a>alcoholism</a> (addiction to alcohol), but others have extended the findings to other addictions.

<a>indirectly impact the risk for addiction</a>. For instance, genetics are a factor with numerous psychological disorders like
<a>identical twins</a> who were separated at birth and raised by different sets of parents). In this way, the relative influence of genetic risk factors versus environmental risk factors can be measured.
<a>Adoption</a> studies typically ask: What happens to the biological children of addicts if they’re adopted into a family where neither parent is addicted?
<p>One well-known <a>study</a> tells us that survivors of chronic <a>childhood</a> <a>trauma</a> (defined as four or more significant trauma experiences prior to age 18) are:</p>
<li>1.8 times as likely to smoke cigarettes</li>
<li>1.9 times as likely to become obese</li>
<li>2.4 times as likely to experience ongoing anxiety</li>
<li>3.6 times as likely to be depressed</li>
<li>3.6 times as likely to qualify as promiscuous</li>
<li>7.2 times as likely to become alcoholic</li>
<li>11.1 times as likely to become an intravenous drug user.</li>

<li>DO learn everything you can about infidelity. This educational process helps you to better understand your partner and his or her betrayal and to make healthier decisions in the future.</li>
<a>intuition</a>. If you don’t see your partner doing what he or she needs to do to make things right, that probably means that things are not getting better.
<a>therapy</a> if you want to work things out. It is likely that you want a full accounting of your cheating partner’s behavior. This type of

<li>Does chatting on social media count as infidelity? What if that chat takes on a romantic or <a>sexual</a> tone?</li>
<li>What about chatting on dating/hookup apps? Does it matter if you don’t (and never plan to) meet in person?</li>

<li>Is chatting with an ex on social media or apps a form of cheating?</li>

<h1> Are You Curious About BDSM? </h1>
<h2> BDSM is not for everyone. But you’re not everyone… </h2>

<p>Wait a second. Pleasure through pain? Really?</p>
<p>Those who practice BDSM say they experience the same intense pleasure/pain response.</p>
<h3>50 Shades of Sexuality</h3>
<a>sexuality</a>—don’t do much to clear things up. So, for the curious (and perhaps adventurous), I’ve provided a basic primer on BDSM terminology and behaviors.
<li>Scene: This is where the action takes place—a dungeon, a sex club, a rubber room, etc. </li>
<li>Play: This refers to the acts that take place in a scene. Play ranges across a wide spectrum, from light tickling with feathers to hot wax to flogging to just about anything else you can think of.</li>
<p>As long as the action is safe, sane, and consensual, pretty much anything goes with BDSM. That said, some scenes and types of play are more common than others.</p>
<li>Bondage Play: Bondage involves one or more people getting tied up, handcuffed, suspended, or otherwise restrained.</li>
<li>Sensation Play: Sensation play involves the creation of intense physical sensations (everything from tickling to the infliction of pain). Sensation play could involve the use of feathers, sex toys, pinching, whips, nipple clamps, hot wax, etc.</li>
<li>Roleplay: Roleplay involves a power dynamic of some sort. Often, this power dynamic is taboo if it were played out in real-life—teacher and student, master and slave, nurse and patient, etc.</li>
<li>Fetish Play: Fetishes are the intense sexualization of objects, body parts, or certain actions—high heels, leather, masks, bare feet, diapers, and the like. The variety of fetish play is endless.</li>
<a>intimacy</a> with a mutually consenting partner (or partners). The goal of sexual behavior is not to be like everyone else; the goal is finding ways to mutually fulfill your and your partner’s (or partners’) needs and desires.

<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kittyfly/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>If you’ve been cheated on, it’s highly likely your partner gaslighted you to some degree. If you think that didn’t happen, you might want to think again. Consider the following lies and shifts of blame:</p>
<li>“I never said I’d be home by eight. I don’t know why you would think that.”</li>
<li>“She’s just a co-worker. When she calls here, it’s because we have a project to finish. Why are you always so <a>jealous</a>?”</li>
<li>“Why do you keep asking me if something is going on? You’re completely paranoid. It’s really annoying.”</li>
<li>“I told you I had to work late tonight. Obviously, you weren’t listening.”</li>
<li>“I wasn’t looking at her; I was looking over her shoulder to signal the waiter.”</li>
<li>“I told you at least three times that I might have to go out of town. When you don’t listen like this, it feels like I don’t matter to you. Why do you do this to me?”</li>
<li>“I was working late at the office, closed my eyes for a minute, and fell asleep. I can’t believe you’re angry with me just because I forgot to call. How could I call when I was asleep?”</li>
<li>“Who are you going to believe? Your jealous sister or your loving husband?”</li>
<li>“I only work these late hours for us. So we can have a better life. It’s ridiculous that you think I’m cheating.”</li>
<li>“I would never do that. I don’t even look at other women. You’re just being crazy, and it really upsets me that you don’t trust me.”</li>
<p>Do any of these statements sound familiar? I’m guessing that at least a few of them do. Even if you didn’t hear these exact lies, you probably heard similar whoppers.</p>

<h1> After Infidelity: Should You Stay, or Should You Go? </h1>
<h2> Before you decide, ask yourself these 14 questions. </h2>
<li>Many relationships are worth saving, despite infidelity, but the restoration of trust is paramount.</li>
<li>Since partners will never be 100 percent in alignment, it's important to set realistic expectations.</li>
<li>Asking these questions can help partners decide whether the relationship can recover, or if they are better off going their separate ways.</li>
<a>infidelity</a>, with couples sometimes developing more vulnerability and
<a>intimacy</a> than ever. Other times, however, trust and relationship safety cannot be restored, the pain of betrayal is simply too much to overcome, or the relationship just wasn’t that great to begin with.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Fizkes/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But how do you know where you and your relationship fall on the “stay or go” spectrum? Answering the following 14 questions can help you gain some clarity.</p>
<h3>1. Do you enjoy spending time together?</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons for being in a long-term romantic partnership is that it’s fun and enjoyable. If you have come to genuinely dislike (or no longer appreciate) time spent with your partner, that’s an obvious red flag.</p>
<h3>2. Do you trust each other?</h3>
<h3>3. Do you play well together?</h3>
<h3>4. Do you share core values and beliefs?</h3>
<a>education</a>, and raising kids.
<p>Children are not the only reason to stay in a relationship, but they’re a darn good one. After all, no matter how much you struggle with your partner, you’re going to love your children, and you will always keep their welfare in mind.</p>
<h3>6. Do you and your partner usually find a way to resolve disagreements?</h3>
<a>empathy</a>, and new ways of thinking and relating.
<h3>7. Are you free to be your own person?</h3>
<h3>8. Do you respect each other?</h3>
<h3>9. Do you still enjoy sex with each other?</h3>
<a>attraction</a> to your partner and if you enjoy the physical intimacy that the two of you still have (or that you were having before the discovery of the cheating).
<h3>10. Does your partner support you emotionally?</h3>
<a>goals</a>, desires, or activities (aside from your sexual infidelity), that’s a definite red flag.
<h3>11. Does your relationship roll with the punches?</h3>
<h3>12. Are your relationship expectations realistic?</h3>
<h3>13. Have you done this before?</h3>
<p>Do you have a history of ending relationships because of cheating? If so, no matter how you feel about your current partner, it’s probably time to take a look at your thoughts and behaviors regarding long-term commitment.</p>
<h3>14. Are you both invested in saving the relationship?</h3>

<h1> Porn-Induced Erectile Dysfunction </h1>
<h2> Can pornography impact male sexual performance? </h2>
<li>The amount of porn a man watches is linked to ED. More porn equals more ED.</li>
<li>Heavy porn use is linked to dissatisfaction with real-world sex.</li>
<li>The constant fantasy/satisfaction cycle with heavy porn use leads to emotional and psychological disconnection with live partners.</li>
<li>In many males, heavy porn use leads to sexual dysfunction with their in-the-flesh partners.</li>

<li>90% of men fast-forward to watch the most arousing pornographic scenes—i.e., the scenes most likely to be neurochemically rewarded with an intense <a>dopamine</a> and adrenaline rush.</li>
<li>Heavy porn users take significantly longer than other men to reach orgasm with a real-world partner.</li>
<li>23% of the men under age 35 (i.e., in their sexual prime) reported some level of ED when having sex with a real-world partner.</li>
<li>Heavy porn use is also linked to dissatisfaction with real-world sex.</li>
<li>20% of male porn users find that over time they need to watch more extreme porn to achieve their desired level of arousal.</li>

<p>The most common signs of porn-induced male sexual dysfunction include:</p>
<li>A man is able to achieve erections and orgasms with pornography, but he struggles with one or both when he’s with a real-world partner.</li>
<li>A man is able to have sex and achieve orgasm with real-world partners, but reaching orgasm takes a long time and his partners complain that he seems disengaged.</li>
<li>A man is able to maintain an erection with real-world partners, but he can only achieve orgasm by replaying porn clips in his mind.</li>
<li>A man increasingly prefers pornography to real-world sex, finding it more intense and more engaging.</li>

<h1> How Partners Can Cheat Without Cheating </h1>
<h2> Is it possible to cheat without actually cheating? </h2>
<li>Some define "cheating" as the breaking of trust that occurs when you keep intimate, meaningful secrets from your primary romantic partner.</li>
<li>The term "micro-cheating" usually refers to small, seemingly innocuous behaviors that straddle the line between faithfulness and cheating.</li>
<li>Cheating, micro or otherwise, is less about the behavior and more about lies and the keeping of secrets and how they impact your partner.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: giggsy25/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In my book Out of the Doghouse, I define cheating (infidelity) as “the breaking of trust that occurs when you keep intimate, meaningful secrets from your primary romantic partner.”</p>
<a>sexual</a> or romantic acts. Having affairs, using
<a>porn</a>, frequenting strip clubs, downloading hookup apps, and other sexual and romantic behaviors are not listed because this definition focuses on what ultimately matters most to a betrayed partner—the loss of relationship trust.
<a>lying</a>, the secrets, and the manipulation. The loss of trust is, for betrayed partners, both emotionally and psychologically devastating.
<p>But what about “micro-cheating”?</p>
<a>TIME Magazine</a> defines micro-cheating as “a set of behaviors that flirts with the line between faithfulness and unfaithfulness.”
<a>Cosmopolitan</a> defines it as “small things you do that could have whispers of infidelity—without actually being physically unfaithful.”
<p>Behaviors that many people would consider micro-cheating include:</p>
<li>Dressing differently if/when you know you will see a particular person</li>
<li>Texting with an attractive person who is not your primary partner</li>
<li>Chatting on webcam or social media with an attractive person who is not your primary partner</li>
<li>Socializing with an attractive coworker</li>
<li>Liking and positively commenting on a person’s Instagram or other social media pics</li>
<li>Having a hookup app profile (even though you never actually hook up)</li>
<p>This is true even if you have no sexual or romantic interest whatsoever in your coworker.</p>
<p>Cheating, micro or otherwise, is less about the behavior and more about lies and the keeping of secrets and how those lies and secrets impact your partner.</p>
<a>attention</a> from people other than our primary partner. And the fact that we respond in kind when someone blatantly (or subtly) flirts with us is not a reflection of the strength and quality of our primary relationship.
<a>intimacy</a>. The more open and honest a couple is, the more intimacy and connection they will have.
