<h1> How to Avoid 3 Major Time Traps </h1>
<h2> Feeling super busy? These biases steal our time and, in effect, our happiness. </h2>
<p> Posted September 9, 2021 </p>
<li>Having more time often makes people happier than having more money, but cognitive biases cause people to undervalue time.</li>
<li>Because people expect to have more time later, they often overcommit themselves in the future and regret those decisions.</li>
<li>People also lose time through technology interruptions, such as texts and emails, and by working on urgent, unimportant tasks first.</li>

<a>scarcity dominates our attention</a>, disrupts our
<a>cognition</a>, and depletes our emotional resources. Unfortunately, there is no time lottery we can win, so unless we proactively do something to free up our time, there’s no magic fix for time poverty.

<h3>What Makes the Social Belonging Intervention Effective?</h3>

<h3>Using Social Belonging Interventions on Campus</h3>
<a>Project for Education Research that Scales (PERTS)</a>.
<a>stress reappraisals</a> that encourage college students to interpret academic struggles as challenges instead of threats can be translated to social struggles.
<a>self-affirmations of students’ most important values</a> can protect a sense of belonging in the face of stressful, daily adversities. Finally,
<a>difference-education interventions</a>, which explicitly acknowledge how different students (e.g., first-generation vs. continuing-generation) experience college very differently, can reframe social identities as a source of
<a>resilience</a> rather than a reason to question one’s place in college.
<p>Consider all of these techniques as tools you can employ to ensure that all students feel like they belong at your college regardless of their social identities.</p>

<li>Nudges to encourage resource use should leverage behavioral science, personalization, and two-way communication to the extent possible.</li>

<a>sibling</a> got sick, or they got

<h3>Shocks cause students to change plans to help the family.</h3>
<p>At Persistence Plus, I often hear from students about their responsibility to care for the family. Students have shared hundreds of stories of how they must balance college with <a>caretaking</a> and work:</p>
<li>“Being a single mother of four and going to school has been a hard balance, but I am determined to give them the best life I can.”</li>
<li>“I’m really struggling with keeping a work/study balance. My job is very draining, and I work long hours, but it is necessary for me to pay for the bills and rent at home.”</li>
<li>“I have to go back to work full time in January. I live with parents, and one got laid off.”</li>
<h3>Changing plans in response to a death</h3>
<a>trauma</a> of death can also just be too much to bear. Tiara, a community college student who had to arrange a funeral for her cousin, withdrew because college is not structured to accommodate
<p>Again, so many students have shared tragic stories via Persistence Plus about trying to focus on college while grieving loved ones, especially since COVID-19 began ravaging their families and communities:</p>
<li>“I’ve had a few deaths in the family. I have not been able to focus on the two classes I have to do on my own.”</li>
<li>“I had a death in the family that was very hard and distracting, but I’m learning to refocus and manage my time better. I’ve missed some assignments in my math [class], and I’m recovering now.”</li>
<li>“I had another death in my immediate family for a total of three this semester. I am having a hard time dealing with all of it.”</li>
<h3>Designing colleges that anticipate shocks</h3>
<a>confidence</a> that they can finish college in a reasonable amount of time—if ever—making a short-term certificate the safer bet. In some cases, youth aren’t even sure

<p>Anxiety disorders are complex and result from a combination of genetic, behavioral, developmental, and other factors. Risk factors for GAD include a family history of anxiety and recent or extended periods of <a>stress</a>. </p>
<a>twins</a> and families suggest that
<a>genes</a> play a role in the origin of anxiety disorders.
<a>Childhood</a> adversity and parental overprotection have both been associated with the later development of GAD. It is important to rule out medical causes of anxiety, such as thyroid disorders, before a diagnosis is made.
<div> <h3> How common is generalized anxiety disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is anxiety rising among youth? </h3> </div>
<a>teenagers</a>. The percentage of those 6 to 17 years old who have been diagnosed with anxiety
<a>increased</a> from 5.5 percent in 2007 to 6.4 percent in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
<a>Research</a> from 2021 suggests that 20 percent of children and adolescents have experienced clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety. Many factors may be

<p>Psychotherapy involves talking with a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor to learn how to deal with problems like anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</p>
<p>CBT is very useful in treating anxiety disorders. The cognitive dimension helps people change the thinking patterns that support their fears, and the behavioral dimension helps people change the way they react to anxiety-provoking situations.</p>
<p>For many people, the best approach to treatment is medication combined with therapy. </p>

<p>Certain conditions seem to make individuals more likely to experience insomnia. Examples of these conditions include:</p>
<ul><li>Advanced age (insomnia occurs more frequently in older adults)</li> <li>Occurs more frequently among females</li> <li>Having a history of <a>depression</a></li> </ul>
<p>There are a number of possible causes of insomnia:</p>
<li>Jet lag or other sleep-wake disturbances</li>
<li>Poor sleep conditions, such as a bed or bedroom not conducive to sleep</li>
<li>Medications or illicit drugs</li>
<li>A change in medication</li>
<li>Excessive daytime sleep</li>
<li>Excessive stimulation at bedtime, physical or intellectual</li>
<li>Conditions that impair breathing</li>
<li>Arthritis or other <a>chronic illness</a></li>
<li>Heartburn or other gastrointestinal condition</li>
<li>Co-occurring disorders or medical illness</li>
<p>Episodic or situational insomnia generally occurs in people who are temporarily experiencing one or more of the following. These can often be resolved on their own.</p>
<ul><li>Stress</li> <li>Environmental disturbances, such as noise</li> <li>Change in environment</li> <li>Extreme temperatures</li> <li>Jet lag or other sleep-wake disturbances</li> <li>Medication side effects</li> </ul>
<p>Some behaviors can exacerbate insomnia, or they may cause the sleep difficulty in the first place:</p>
<ul><li>Worrying about difficult sleep</li> <li>Excessive caffeine</li> <li>Alcohol intake before bedtime</li> <li><a>Smoking</a> cigarettes before bedtime</li> <li>Excessive afternoon or evening naps</li> <li>Sleep-wake disruptions</li> </ul>
<p>Situational or episodic insomnia, from jet lag for example, normally does not require treatment as episodes last only a few days or weeks. In these instances, the individual’s sleep cycle may return to normal without treatment. </p>
<p>There are behavioral techniques that can alleviate insomnia, including relaxation therapy, sleep restriction, reconditioning and <a>psychotherapy</a>. </p>
<p>Reconditioning or Stimulus Control: Reconditioning the individual into associating the bed with sleep can be a useful technique. In this case, the bed is used for sleep and <a>sex</a> and no other activities. The recommendations for this include:</p>
<ul><li>Go to bed only when sleepy</li> <li>If the individual is unable to sleep, he or she should get up</li> <li>Stay up until sleepy</li> <li>Avoid napping</li> <li>Stick to a schedule; wake up and go to bed at the same time daily</li> </ul>
<a>antidepressant</a> medication and CBT proves effective.
<p>Tips for a Good Night's Sleep:</p>
<li>Go to bed at a set time each night and get up at the same time each morning.</li>
<li>Physical activity: Get regular exercise of 20 to 30 minutes daily</li>
<li>Limit caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening hours</li>
<li>Avoid heavy meals before bedtime</li>
<li>Set a bedtime routine, such as a warm bath, reading or another relaxing routine</li>
<li>Don't lie in bed awake</li>
<li>If unable to sleep, get up and read or listen to music until sleepy</li>
<p>Control your bedroom environment:</p>
<ul><li>Avoid bright lights before bedtime</li> <li>Use comfortable bedding</li> <li>Limit noises and distractions: TV, computer, or a pet. </li> <li>Keep the bed for sleep and sex</li> <li>Set a cool and comfortable temperature</li> </ul>
<p>See a primary care physician if sleeping difficulties continue. A sleep specialist may be recommended. Most sleep disorders can be treated effectively.</p>

<a>childhood</a>. Women are more likely to develop the disorder than men, and there is some evidence that it may run in families. PTSD is frequently accompanied by
<a>depression</a>, substance use disorder, and
<a>anxiety</a> disorders. When other conditions are appropriately diagnosed and treated, the likelihood of successful treatment increases.
<a>politics</a> around the war, where it's fought, and the type of enemy faced. Another cause of PTSD in the military is military
<a>sexual</a> trauma (MST) or sexual harassment or assault that occurs in the military. MST happens to men and women and can occur during peacetime, training, or war. Among veterans using VA health care, about 23 percent of women reported
<a>sexual assault</a> while in the military, 55 percent of women and 38 percent of men have experienced sexual harassment when in the military.
<p>In addition to military combat, many different traumatic experiences can lead to the development of PTSD, including physical attacks, sexual assaults, car crashes, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters.</p>
<a>PTSD</a> tend to re-experience aspects of the
<a>guilt</a>, sadness, irritability, outbursts of anger, and dissociative experiences. Many people with PTSD may try to avoid situations that remind them of the ordeal. When symptoms last more than one month, a diagnosis of PTSD may be relevant.
<p>Symptoms associated with reliving the traumatic event:</p>
<li>Having bad <a>dreams</a>, or distressing memories about the event</li>
<li>Behaving or feeling as if the event were actually happening all over again (known as flashbacks)</li>
<li>Dissociative reactions or loss of awareness of present surroundings</li>
<li>Experiencing intense emotions when reminded of the event</li>
<li>Having intense physical sensations when reminded of the event (heart pounds or misses a beat, sweating, difficulty breathing, feeling faint, feeling a loss of control)</li>
<p>Symptoms related to avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event:</p>
<ul><li>Avoiding thoughts, conversations, or feelings about the event</li> <li>Avoiding people, activities, or places associated with the event</li> </ul>
<p>Symptoms related to negative changes in thought or mood:</p>
<li>Having difficulty remembering an important part of the original trauma</li>
<li>Feeling numb or detached from things</li>
<li>Lack of interest in social activities</li>
<li>Inability to experience positive moods</li>
<li><a>Pessimism</a> about the future</li>
<p>Arousal and reactivity symptoms:</p>
<ul><li><a>Sleeping</a> difficulties including trouble falling or staying asleep</li> <li>Irritability and outbursts of anger</li> <li>Difficulty concentrating</li> <li>Feeling easily startled</li> <li>Excess awareness (hypervigilance)</li> </ul>
<p>Other symptoms related to depersonalization (feeling like an observer to one's body and thoughts/feelings) or derealization (experiencing unreality of surroundings) may also exist for some individuals.</p>
<div> <h3> What is complex PTSD? </h3> </div>
<a>Complex PTSD</a> (CPTSD) refers to severe and repeated trauma, often experienced in
<a>childhood</a>, leading to additional challenges of
<a>emotional regulation</a>, interpersonal difficulties, and negative
<a>self-concept</a>. It is a diagnosis in the newest revision of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases.

<a>stress</a>. It affects the stress
<div> <h3> How common is PTSD among trauma survivors? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Not everyone who experiences a trauma develops PTSD; the disorder emerges in just 10 to 30 percent of trauma survivors. With support and care, <a>distressing symptoms often abate</a> within a month.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Which brain regions are involved in PTSD? </h3> </div>
<a>Key brain regions involved in PTSD</a> are the amygdala, which regulates emotion and processes fear; the hippocampus, which stores and retrieves memories; and the prefrontal cortex, which governs planning and
<a>decision making</a>. A traumatic event can disrupt communication among these three regions; the brain fails to properly process and control memories of the trauma.
<a>depression</a>, substance use disorder, and those who feel
<a>suicidal</a>, may need treatment to focus on those conditions as well.
<p>Other strategies for treatment include:</p>
<li>Exposure to the event via imagery allows the survivor to re-experience the event in a safe, controlled environment. A professional can carefully examine reactions and beliefs in relation to that event.</li>
<li>Examining and resolving strong feelings such as <a>shame</a>, anger, or guilt, which are common among survivors of trauma.</li>
<li>Headaches, which usually go away within a few days.</li>
<li>Nausea, which usually goes away within a few days.</li>
<li><a>Sleeplessness</a> or drowsiness, which may occur during the first few weeks but then goes away. Sometimes the medication dose needs to be reduced or the time of day it is taken needs to be adjusted to help lessen these side effects.</li>
<li>Agitation or feeling jittery.</li>
<li><a>Sexual</a> problems, which can affect both men and women, including reduced sex drive, and problems having and enjoying sex.</li>
<a>Antipsychotics</a> may be prescribed to people who experience more severe agitation, suspiciousness, or
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, has been found to be quite effective in treating PTSD. There are several parts to CBT, including:</p>
<a>memory</a> of the trauma they experienced in a safe way. It uses
<a>mental imagery</a>, writing, or visits to the place where the event happened. The therapist uses these tools to help people with PTSD cope with their feelings.
<p>There are also other types of treatment that can help people with PTSD and a client may want to discuss with their therapist about therapy options and treatment focus that may include:</p>
<li>Learning about trauma and its effects</li>
<li>Using relaxation and <a>anger management</a> skills</li>
<li>Improving sleep, <a>diet</a>, and exercise habits</li>
<li>Identifying and dealing with guilt, shame, and other feelings about the event</li>
<li>Focusing on our reactions to PTSD symptoms—for example, therapy helps people visit places and people that are reminders of the trauma</li>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy, combined with techniques (sounds, eye movements, hand taps) that create an alteration of
<a>attention</a>. There is some evidence that the therapeutic element unique to EMDR, attentional alteration, may be helpful in accessing and processing traumatic material.
<a>empathic</a> counselor, the survivor achieves a greater sense of
<a>grief</a>, guilt, and anxiety related to the trauma enables many survivors to cope with their symptoms, memories, and lives.
<div> <h3> Can psychedelics treat PTSD? </h3> </div>
<a>ketamine</a> show tremendous promise in the
<a>quest to cure PTSD.</a> Research shows that these psychedelics, delivered in a therapeutic context, can reduce symptoms of PTSD. They can help survivors process and reframe their memories, derive meaning from their experiences, and begin to heal.

<a>sexual</a> violation. Symptoms begin or worsen after the trauma occurs and can last from three days to one month. If symptoms persist after one month, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is given.
<p>It is estimated that between 5 and 20 percent of people exposed to a trauma such as a car accident, assault, or a mass shooting develop acute stress disorder; and approximately half of these people go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<a>stress</a> disorder is diagnosable when symptoms persist for a minimum of three days and last no more than one month after a
<a>traumatic</a> experience. If symptoms persist after a month, the diagnosis becomes post-traumatic stress disorder.
<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a>, acute stress disorder symptoms fall into five categories. A patient is diagnosed with the disorder when he or she has nine or more symptoms:</p>
<p>• Intrusion symptoms—involuntary and intrusive distressing memories of the trauma or recurrent distressing dreams</p>
<p>• Negative mood symptoms—a persistent inability to experience positive emotions, such as happiness or love</p>
<p>• Dissociative symptoms—time slowing, seeing oneself from an outsider's perspective, or being in a daze</p>
<p>• Avoidance symptoms—avoidance of memories, thoughts, feelings, people, or places associated with the trauma</p>
<p>• Arousal symptoms—difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritable behavior, or problems with <a>concentration</a></p>
<a>guilt</a> about not having been able to prevent the trauma, or for not being able to move on from the trauma more quickly. Panic attacks are common in the month following a trauma. Children with acute stress disorder may also experience
<a>anxiety</a> related to their separation from caregivers.

<div> <h3> How does the vagus nerve influence mind-body interaction? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What role does the vagus nerve play in the gut-brain axis? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the role of the vagus nerve in stress? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does the vagus nerve influence states of threat and safety? </h3> </div>
<a>memory</a>— the body responds the same way, activating many organ systems, turning up alertness in the brain, turning off high-powered cognitive and
<a>executive functions</a> (they consume energy needed for potentially lifesaving physical action) and our capacity for social connection, creating negative expectations, and generally establishing a sense of unease.
<a>The level of safety we experience determines our ability to recover and heal and our level of wellness and health.</a>
<div> <h3> How does the vagus nerve influence feelings of pain? </h3> </div>
<a>chronic pain</a>. Stimulating the vagus nerve can influence the pain of
<a>migraine</a> and arthritis, as well as subdue many sources of visceral pain. It is considered a promising add-on treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.

<h2> The Mind-Body Highway </h2>
<div> <article> </article> <div> <p>As a large neural pathway between much of the body and the brain, the vagus nerve operates automatically to control many functions. It is also susceptible to influence in multiple ways. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What role does the vagus nerve play in physical health? </h3> </div>
<p>Breathing. Heart rate. Blood pressure. Digestive functions including movement of food through the gut. All are controlled by the vagus nerve.</p>
<div> <h3> What role does the vagus nerve play in mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>self-esteem</a>. They believe that they lack control over events. And they lose
<a>confidence</a> in their ability to solve problems. Responding to unease with worry sets off a downward spiral of distress from which it is often difficult to escape.
<h2> Stimulating the Vagus Nerve </h2>
<div> <h3> What does stimulating the vagus nerve do? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does vagus nerve stimulation reduce stress? </h3> </div>
<a>meditation</a> traditions. Yoga long ago incorporated the power of respiration—bellows breath is one exercise—to change physical and mental states. The ancients knew that it worked; they just didn’t know how it did.
<div> <h3> How can vagal stimulation regulate the gut-brain axis? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does vagal stimulation control depression and epilepsy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do you stimulate the vagus nerve? </h3> </div>
<p>• Take long, deep breaths</p>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapies typically have a breathing component.
<p>• Engage "vagal maneuvers"</p>
<p>• Sing loudly, or hum </p>
<p>Because the vagus nerve serves the vocal cords, it can be stimulated by making emphatic sounds. Singing works. Singing with others works even better. Regularly singing with a chorus stimulates the vagus nerve by both physical and social routes.</p>
<p>Gargling requires that you contract the muscles at the back of the throat, which are fed by the vagus nerve. When you gargle the muscles close the throat, which activates the vagus nerve .</p>
