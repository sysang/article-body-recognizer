<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Karla Adam</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021|Updated December 17, 2021 at 4:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>LONDON — Boris Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party lost a seat Friday that it had safely held for almost 200 years, in a fresh blow to the British prime minister that renewed questions about his leadership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The loss is certain to boost Johnson’s critics in the Conservative Party, which in particular is known for deposing leaders it sees as not winning elections.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Boris Johnson sees record rebellion from his own Conservative Party on covid policies</p></div>
<div><div><p>It’s just one seat of 650 in a Parliament that the Conservatives handily dominate, but it has received national attention as a test for the embattled prime minister, who has endured weeks of bad headlines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The seat became vacant after Conservative lawmaker Owen Paterson, an ally of Johnson’s, stepped down for breaking lobbying rules.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson took personal responsibility for the loss and acknowledged that voters were frustrated and unaware of all his government’s recent achievements.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’ve got to put my hands up and say, ‘Have I failed to get that message across in the last few weeks? Has it been obscured by all this other stuff?’ Yes, I’m afraid it has,” he told broadcasters.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the latest election shows the “the shine was coming off with voters,” Surridge said.</p></div></div>
<a>sudden ruthlessness</a> that surprised Britons.
<div><div><p>But Johnson is no stranger to controversy and has bounced back, repeatedly, from scandals and setbacks. And while talk of regicide is easy, there are no reports of a deluge of letters of no confidence flooding in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Daniel Wincott, a politics expert at Cardiff University, said Johnson has long had a reputation as a “Teflon politician on whom things seem to slide.” But lately, less has been sliding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson is battling fires on many fronts: a surging omicron variant, rebellious lawmakers, tanking approval ratings.</p></div></div>
<a>Christmas parties</a> last year at a time when such gatherings were banned. The “sense of hypocrisy does start to stick,” Wincott said.
<div><div><p>Johnson is in trouble, said Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, a pollster. “He’s made a series of self-inflicted wounds, and if he continues on the same track, then all bets are off.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The annual address was recorded in advance last week in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, where the queen is staying through Christmas.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Armed intruder apprehended on Windsor Castle grounds as queen celebrates Christmas</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of a spike in coronavirus infections, Elizabeth didn’t host family members at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England, for the second year. Confirmed cases hit record highs in Britain this past week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In her speech, Elizabeth paid tribute to her late husband, Prince Philip, who <a>died in April</a> at age 99.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There was “one familiar laugh missing this year,” she said of Philip, whose “mischievous inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Although it’s a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones,” she said. “This year, especially, I understand why.”</p></div></div>
<p>She said she empathized with others who had lost loved ones and acknowledged the ongoing impact of the pandemic. As usual, she commented on some of the news from the royal family over the past year, including the births of four great grandchildren.</p>
<a>COP26 climate conference</a> in Glasgow, Scotland.
<p>Unsurprisingly, she skipped over the <a>controversies</a> that hit the family in 2021, including Prince Harry and Meghan’s <a>Oprah interview</a> and the allegations that <a>Prince Andrew</a> engaged in sexual abuse, which he denies.</p>
<div><div><p>The intrusion had no impact on the queen’s broadcast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an era of fragmented media, huddling around the telly to watch a nonagenarian monarch deliver a five-minute speech is still surprisingly popular. Last year, it <a>topped the TV ratings</a> on Christmas Day.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>She has continued to meet with ambassadors and dignitaries, but those meetings have taken place by video or inside palace walls.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It was not her health but coronavirus concerns that were mentioned when the queen canceled her customary pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace, as well as her trip to Sandringham, where the royals usually assemble for Christmas.</p></div>
<div><div><p>British media reported that William was spending the holiday in Norfolk with his wife, children and in-laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The queen, meanwhile, was joined at Windsor by Prince Charles, his wife, Camilla, and a handful of others.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In other words, the queen had her Christmas plans upended, like so many other Britons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But for many of her subjects, at least for a few minutes in a televised broadcast on Christmas Day, the queen was also offering a sense of stability in unstable times.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“While covid again means we can’t celebrate quite as we may have wished,” the queen said, “we can still enjoy the many happy traditions.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>LONDON — British police on Monday said they were assessing a video posted on social media of a masked man clutching a crossbow saying he wanted to “assassinate the queen.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>British tabloids have linked the video to the armed intruder arrested on Christmas Day on the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II was celebrating Christmas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for the London Metropolitan Police said Monday that “following the man’s arrest, detectives are assessing the video.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The queen was home at the time.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The man has since been detained under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals, police said in a statement on Sunday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The newspaper said the video was posted on a Snapchat account on Christmas morning, less than half an hour before police officers arrested a man who was carrying a crossbow.</p></div></div>
<p>Police said the investigation would be transferred from the local force that covers Windsor to the London Metropolitan Police specialist operations as “inquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are being progressed.”</p>
<div><p>Several British tabloids, citing unnamed sources, reported over the weekend<b> </b>that the intruder used a rope ladder to scale a fence. “Queen’s Xmas Crossbow Horror,” read a front-page headline in the Sunday Mirror.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Claire Parker</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 12:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Anyone convicted of consensual same-sex sexual activity under abolished laws in England and Wales will soon be eligible to be pardoned and have their records wiped, the BritishHome Office said in a news release Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is only right that where offences have been abolished, convictions for consensual activity between same-sex partners should be disregarded too,” British Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<p>“I hope that expanding the pardons and disregards scheme will go some way to righting the wrongs of the past and to reassuring members of the LGBT community that Britain is one of the safest places in the world to call home,” Patel said.</p>
<div><div><p>Since 2012, people convicted under a narrower set of repealed offenses — including sodomy and gross indecency between men — have been eligible to apply to have their convictions disregarded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The amendment would apply to civilians in England and Wales and people convicted of military offenses anywhere in Britain. Northern Ireland and Scotland have separate disregard and pardon schemes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The plan will also grant a posthumous pardon to anyone who has died before the amendment comes into force or as many as 12 months afterward. The Home Office statement said the government would confirm the plan this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People must still go through an application process to have their records wiped, and any party involved in the activity in question must have been 16 or older and the sexual activity must be legal today.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The move follows a years-long campaign led by House of Lords members Michael Cashman and Alistair Lexden and sociologist Paul Johnson of the University of Leeds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The repealed laws largely targeted gay men, prohibiting a wide range of same-sex activity among civilians and in the military. Britain began decriminalizing homosexuality in 1967.</p></div></div>
<a>Alan Turing</a>, considered the founding father of the modern computer, became a famous example of the laws’ toll. Turing was convicted of same-sex activity in 1952, forced to undergo chemical castration and died in an apparent suicide in 1954.
<p>Then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown offered Turing a national apology in 2009, and Queen Elizabeth II <a>pardoned him in 2013</a>. Legislation named for Turing and passed in 2017 granted posthumous pardons to thousands of gay and bisexual men.</p>
<div><div><p>Sasha Misra, associate director of communications and campaigns for Stonewall, a Britain-based LGBTQ rights organization, hailed the government’s plan in a statement Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Alan Turing, a founding father of computer science, revealed as new face of British 50-pound note</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Claire Parker</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In France, advertisements urging people to buy the latest Peugeots or Renaults will soon come with a caveat urging viewers or listeners to walk or bike instead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under a new regulation slated to take effect in March, French automakers will be required to include messages on car advertisements that encourage viewers to seek more environmentally friendly travel alternatives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The requirement is to apply to ads distributed on radio, television, in theaters, on the Internet and on big screens as well as to print ads. If advertisers fail to include the message, they can be fined up to about $56,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similar measures are already in place in France for food advertisements, which instruct French consumers to cut back on junk food and eat more fruits and vegetables.</p></div></div>
<a>French newspaper Le Monde reported</a>. Ads for the highest-polluting vehicles will be banned beginning in 2028.
<div><div><p>Transportation-related emissions <a>make up a quarter</a> of the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the European Environment Agency.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carmakers aired mixed reactions in French media to the upcoming advertising requirements. Volkswagen <a>told French media</a> it would follow the regulations, as did Hyundai’s French division.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am taking note, we will adapt,” Lionel French Keogh, chief executive of Hyundai in France, told Agence France-Presse. “Zero-emission transportation is the future.”</p></div></div>
<p>But he complained that the measure “stigmatized the automobile” and was “a bit counterproductive” since it does not distinguish between types of cars, even as the government tries to incentivize the use of electric vehicles.</p>
<div><div><p>Major automakers Renault and Stellantis, which sells the Peugeot brand, and U.S. carmaker Ford, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Europe’s hottest summer on record would have been ‘almost impossible’ without human-induced climate change</a></p></div></div>

<div><h1>Harnessing the energy of the ocean to power homes, planes and whisky distilleries</h1></div>
<div><p>The tides turn. You can set your watch to them.</p></div>
<div><p>In the far north of Scotland, an audacious experiment is underway on a stormy archipelago.</p></div>
<div><p>Inventors dream of a tomorrow powered by waves and tides.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By William Booth</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Nov. 9, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>KIRKWALL, Scotland — Ocean boosters like to compare the kinetic energy stored in the sea to a ginormous oil reserve that’s never going to run dry.</p>
<p>When you first look at the ideas for ocean-energy devices, the whole thing does look a little … <i>sci-fi. </i>Underwater corkscrews. Oscillating hydrofoils. Tidal kites? Seriously.</p>
<p>And it gets more out there.</p>
<p>In Scotland, they want to plug this ocean energy into shoreside electrolyzers, which separate water (good old H20) into oxygen and green hydrogen, and use the gas bubbles to power … whisky distilleries.</p>
<p>And maybe someday to heat homes and schools — and power passenger ferries and planes that hop between islands.</p>
<p>It’s all hopeful and ingenious — and the world certainly needs some hope, as the COP26 climate summit winds down in Glasgow, Scotland, and we wait to see if there’s enough ambition to avoid potentially catastrophic warming.</p>
<p>It’s worth knowing, though, that the sea here is also a graveyard, with once-pioneering ocean energy prototypes now turning to rust, after much-hyped start-ups were liquidated in bankruptcies.</p>
<p>But after two decades of trial and error, the sector’s backers say marine energy is getting there. They say tidal machines could begin to work alongside far more developed energy systems, based on solar and wind power, within the decade.</p>
<p>The basic concept? Imagine taking an offshore wind turbine, with its rotor blades spun by moving air, and turning the thing upside down, dunking it into the sea, and letting the tidal currents turn the blades.</p>
<div><p>240 feet long, with a 200-foot wingspan, the turbine is the size of a Boeing 747.</p></div>
<div><p>Once in place, the turbine anchors itself to the channel bottom and lowers its wings.</p></div>
<div><p>The turbine’s blades turn in the tidal flow, powering the generators on the wings.</p></div>
<div><p>As the tide turns, the rotors simply reverse, drawing power from the flow constantly.</p></div>
<div><p>The wing generators produce electricity that charges the turbine’s large batteries.</p></div>
<div><p>The electricity also flows from the turbine to onshore power distribution centers through a large cable.</p></div>
<p>The idea is simple; execution, less so. These devices — and their computers, turbines and hydraulics — must survive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth.</p>
<p>Neil Kermode, managing director of the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), says tidal energy is poised to help Britain deliver on its promise to go net-zero on carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“The RD has shown it works and industry has shown it can do this,” he wrote in an appeal to the electricity regulators to adapt to new technologies like ocean power.</p>
<p>“This opportunity is right here,” he said, “right now.”</p>
<p>But the Orkney Islands have hosted 34 experimental marine energy devices, more machines than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Over the years, the sea passages between the islands have seen wave and tidal machines that bring to mind steel manta rays and undulating sea snakes. One early device looked like a giant propeller riding an elevator.</p>
<p>They had cool names, like the “Oyster 800” and “Penguin” and “OpenHydro.”</p>
<p>Some couldn’t keep water on the right side of the hull, and sank. Other developers proved their concepts but ran out of money before they could make the leap from experimental to commercial.</p>
<p>There are three machines in the Orkneys today.</p>
<div><div><p>FROM TOP: The Magallanes Renovables ATIR installation. (Colin Keldie/Ocean 2G); Orbital O2. (Hoy Drone, courtesy of FloTEC); The Blue X by Mocean Energy. (Colin Keldie)</p></div></div>
<p>In 2019, Magallanes founder Alejandro Marques took a Washington Post reporter out to the ATIR to scramble up on the deck and down below, as the machine bucked in the waves.</p>
<p>“Basically, what you see is something that looks like a boat, yes?” Marques said. “But with a big windmill hanging off the bottom.”</p>
<p>“And this boat isn’t moving. It’s anchored to the seafloor. What is moving,” and here he paused, “is the ocean.”</p>
<p>The latest tidal machine to arrive in Orkney is Orbital O2 — 240 feet long, weighing 650 tons, as big as a floating jumbo jet. The thing looks like the Beatles’ yellow submarine.</p>
<p>On the O2, the turbines are hung on a pair of sea wings, which carry pitched rotor blades, with a huge 65-foot diameter, that can capture the tide as it runs in both directions.</p>
<p>The wings and turbines can be raised to the surface for maintenance, so repairs don’t require ocean divers, submersibles or a tow back to the dock. Basic maintenance can be done between the tides, its designers say.</p>
<p>In May, Britain’s Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, were shuttled out to visit the O2 — courtesy of the Royal Navy — and christened the device with a splash of Scapa whisky.</p>
<p>Wragg imagined what it would look like to see hundreds of the devices arrayed together in the seaway, just as offshore wind farms are today.</p>
<p>Nailing down comparative costs of generating a megawatt hour of electricity is complex, but Wragg estimated that once a few hundred tidal machines were out at sea, the blue energy might be cheaper than nuclear power.</p>
<p>The British government is intrigued. Orbital was one of 12 companies invited to an investment summit hosted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in October, designed to showcase the most innovative green technologies operating in Britain.</p>
<p>Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is already widely used. Green hydrogen is an industry still in its infancy.</p>
<p>These bubbles of clean green hydrogen gas can be — and already are in pilot programs — stored in fuel cells or tubes, which can be transported by delivery truck.</p>
<p>One of the first projects aims to launch a 350-mile hydrogen-electric test flight of a 19-seat piloted aircraft — set for sometime in 2023.</p>
<b> </b>flexibility to explore new technical and structural solutions.
<p>Asked for the prime minister’s reaction to that, Davies told The Post. “I think he was surprised.” He added, “And inspired, too, by the ambition.”</p>

<h1>Toronto is home to the world’s largest lake-powered cooling system. Here’s how it works. </h1>

<p>With just minutes left in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA finals, the Toronto Raptors drained a 16-foot jumper to pull ahead by six points. Hardly a soul was sitting down or silent as fans cheered the team toward Canada’s first basketball championship.</p>
<p>“People bring with them a lot of body heat,” said Kyle Lamkey, director of engineering for the arena. “Cooling is probably one of the most critical parts of our building.”</p>
<p>But unlike other sports venues, Scotiabank Arena doesn’t keep its temperatures in check using air conditioners. Toronto is home to the world’s largest deep lake water cooling (DLWC) system.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the technology is relatively simple. Instead of relying on energy-intensive compressors and chillers to dissipate heat from buildings, DLWC uses water from nearby Lake Ontario to whisk away the warmth.</p>
<p>The system launched in 2004 with only a handful of customers in the city, but it now cools over 100 downtown buildings, ranging from City Hall and Toronto General Hospital to hotels and even a brewery.</p>
<p>“It’s a big investment,” said Carlyle Coutinho, president of Enwave, of the upcoming (CAD) $100 million project. But he said, “it would be challenging to keep growing commercially without increasing the baseload.”</p>
<p>Traditional commercial water-cooling systems often involve towers that evaporate water as a means of expelling heat. DLWC avoids that evaporation, and Enwave estimates that the Toronto system saves roughly 220 million gallons of water annually.</p>
<p>Another way the Toronto system saves is by using largely passive heat exchangers, rather than energy-intensive air conditioners and chillers.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the lake does the job.</p>
<p>Finding suitable conditions for a DLWC system isn’t always simple.</p>
<p>To commemorate, Coutinho made T-shirts with the Raptors’ claw-mark logo splashed across the front with the words: “Chillin’ the Champs.”</p>

<p>When it comes to heat, the human body is remarkably resilient — it’s the humidity that makes it harder to cool down. And humidity, driven in part by climate change, is increasing.</p>
<b> </b>wet wick around the bulb of a thermometer. Scientists are using this metric to figure out which regions of the world may become too dangerous for humans.
<p>A term we rarely hear about, the wet-bulb temperature reflects not only heat, but also how much water is in the air. The higher that number<b> </b>is, the harder it is for sweat to evaporate and for bodies to cool down.</p>
<p>[Wet-bulb temperature is important, climate experts say. So what is it?]</p>
<p>At a certain threshold of heat and humidity, “it’s no longer possible to be able to sweat fast enough to prevent overheating,” said Radley Horton, a professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p>
<p>Scientists have found that Mexico and Central America, the Persian Gulf, India, Pakistan and Southeast Asia are all careening toward this threshold before the end of the century.</p>
<b> </b>could make things worse. As warming temperatures cause the water to evaporate, it adds humidity to the air.
<p>“If you’re sitting in a city along the Persian Gulf, the sea breeze could be a deadly breeze,” he said.</p>
<p>To better understand why these places are becoming too hot and humid for humans to endure, you have to first understand how the body cools itself.</p>
<div><p>As the sun heats up the air, the ground, objects and people, the human body will react in an effort to cool itself.</p></div>
<div><p>The skin sweats. Evaporation of this water cools the body — as long as the surrounding humidity levels allow the evaporation to take place.</p></div>
<div><p>If the hot air is too humid, that heat exchange is blocked and the body loses its primary means of cooling itself.</p></div>
<p>“Extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979,” the study’s authors wrote.</p>
<p>These conditions are reaching that deadly threshold in places like South Asia and the Middle East and could regularly cross it by 2075, scientists say.</p>
<p>Horton and his colleagues found that parts of the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have each passed the 95 degree mark for one or two hours more than three times since 1987.</p>
<p>“Just increasing 1 or 2 degrees Celsius can be the tipping point for changing the impact,” Cavazos said.</p>
<p>The blistering heat is resulting in difficult living conditions, especially for communities that lack resources to provide relief.</p>
<p>[What questions do you have about climate change? Ask The Post.]</p>
<h3>Why some will survive while others die</h3>
<div><p>As your body works to cool down, the heart works harder in an effort to pump blood up just below the surface of the skin, where it can get cooler.</p></div>
<div><p>The kidneys work harder to conserve your body’s water.</p></div>
<div><p>When your body temperature gets too high, it will ultimately cause your body’s proteins to break down, its enzymes to stop regulating your organs’ functions and your organs to start shutting down.</p></div>
<div><p>This is a heat stroke: Your body essentially cooks to the point where you have multi-organ failure.</p></div>
<p>In heat waves, many deaths are due to health problems exacerbated by the extreme conditions.</p>
<p>[How to cool your home without relying on air conditioning]</p>
<p>During heat waves there are some simple ways to take care of your body.</p>
<div><p>If you have air conditioning, the solution is simple: Go inside.</p></div>
<div><p>If you don’t have those resources, hydrate. Drinking water can ease the load on the heart, kidneys and other organs.</p></div>
<div><p>Take a break: Even moderate physical exertion such as walking greatly increases the heat your body’s muscles will generate.</p></div>
<p>Protecting yourself from such stress is inextricably tied to socioeconomic status and resources.</p>
<p>“The poorest people are the most vulnerable, and they are already suffering,” Cavazos said, noting that Sonora depends on farming, meaning a lot of people have to engage in physical labor in the dangerous heat.</p>
<p>In 2019, the United Nations warned that during the four hottest months of the year, outdoor laborers in Qatar were working under “significant occupational heat stress conditions.”</p>
<p>“As humans, we have learned to adapt,” Cavazos said. “The problem is the cost. Some will not survive.”</p>

<div> <div> <p><b>Sonnblick Observatory</b> sits perched on a frigid summit in the Austrian Alps, 10,000 feet above sea level. It is one of the highest weather stations in Europe where meteorologists still live on the premises.</p> </div> </div>
<p>For all the ice and snow blanketing the observatory, <b>it used to be much colder here</b>. The station’s temperature records show a warming of 2.1 degrees Celsius (3.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since it opened in 1886, double the global average.</p>
<p>Back then, local gold miners trudged through waist-high snow drifts to carry construction materials up the mountain. The meteorological rock tower of the original observatory, fitted with key recording instruments, is <b>still in use</b>.</p>
<div> <div> <p>To reach the observatory, the crew hops on a cable car for a 10-minute ride up the mountain.</p> </div> </div>
<b>Rising temperatures are melting the mountain’s permafrost</b>, said Elke Ludewig, who heads the observatory. “And that’s why we had to put a lot of steel into the top peak, to save it from falling apart.”

<div> <div> <p> Sonnblick Observatory opened and began recording the weather in 1886, a technological wonder that measured how wind, barometric pressure and temperatures changed at upper altitudes, and during storms. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Click any temperature underlined in the story to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit </p> </div> </div>
<p> Although the alpine station was advanced for its time, it was inspired by a compulsion as old as humanity itself: the need to monitor the weather, to understand it and to learn when to avoid it.</p>
<p>“Much like what happens today, what prompts people to be interested in weather data?” said Jon Nese, a meteorology professor at Penn State. “Disasters.”</p>
<p>How can that be known? How can it be possible to take Earth’s temperature, not just for this week or this year, but for decades and centuries? </p>
<p>The answer begins with nearly 1,500 weather stations already operating by the time Sonnblick began recording. The telegraph allowed all those readings to be collected and analyzed to show weather patterns. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>A worldwide web — of weather stations</h3> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> Station density is key in a weather network. The closer the stations are to one another, the more comprehensive the weather records are. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div>2018</div> <div>Distance from nearesttemperature observation</div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>If Sonnblick were the only station on this map, meteorologists would not be able to accurately forecast the weather in places such as Paris or Berlin.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>But Sonnblick is part of a <b>dense network</b> across western Europe, making it relatively easy to determine the continent’s temperature now, and over time.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>These are all the <b>stations on land</b> that transmit data to the voluminous compilation of meteorological observations maintained by Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit research group.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The <b>first land temperature observations</b> in Berkeley Earth’s data set come from a Berlin station in 1701.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The first entry in <b>North America</b> is from Boston. That same year, the first weather reports in <b>Russia</b> come from St. Petersburg.</p> </div> </div>
<p>The other critical source of historical records comes from ships. Each of these points across the ocean shows where <b>Benjamin Franklin recorded sea temperature</b> as part of his study of the Gulf Stream, on his final Atlantic crossing, in 1785.</p>
<div> <div> <p>Starting in 1850, there are enough observations to produce accurate estimates of <b>the planet’s average temperature</b> for that year, and all subsequent years.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Five decades later, the network spans the world, although vast areas of <b>South America</b> and <b>Africa</b> still have far fewer stations.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Today, observations from more than 20,000 land-based stations, along with millions of readings from ships and buoys, <b>feed into global temperature data sets</b>.</p> </div> </div>
<p>With that information, climatologists at independent and government agencies, such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, map temperature patterns from the past to the present.</p>
<p>There are complications. Older measurements were “taken in any number of weird or wonderful ways,” said Peter Thorne, a climate researcher at the National University of Ireland at Maynooth.</p>
<p>[Extreme climate change has arrived in America]</p>

<div> <div> <p><b>Extreme climate change is here, but it isn't distributed evenly</b>. In Central Europe, Sonnblick Observatory lies in one of the fastest-warming areas of the world.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><b>Off the coast of Uruguay, an ocean temperature spike has disrupted fisheries</b> and nearly decimated populations of a seafood delicacy, the yellow clam.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The strong warming in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, amid the Canadian Maritime provinces, is rapidly melting the sea ice, and <b>the Magdalen Islands there are crumbling into the ocean</b>.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>On Alaska’s North Slope, the town of Nuiqsut has warmed 4 degrees Celsius (7.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century. <b>It is among the fastest-warming places on Earth</b>. Spin the globe to explore.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h3>What if it’s even hotter?</h3> </div> </div>
<p> What could alter the overall level of warming, however, and show that the planet has heated up even more than we now know, are records from more than a quarter-million ship logs and weather diaries stored in archives worldwide. </p>
<p>“There are literally billions of observations which are still in paper format in various archives and libraries all over the world,” says Ed Hawkins, a climate researcher at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. </p>
