<h1>How much does a $300,000 mortgage cost and how can I get one?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>The total cost of a $300,000 mortgage depends on several factors, including your interest rate, down payment amount, and loan term. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Here’s how to get a $300,000 mortgage and what to know about what your monthly mortgage payment could look like. </p>
<h2>What’s the monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage?</h2>
<a><u>monthly mortgage payment</u></a>, you have to factor in your interest rate, home price, loan term, down payment amount, and whether you need to pay private mortgage insurance, or PMI.
<p>For example, a lower interest rate or higher down payment could lower your monthly payment. But if you take out a larger loan or receive a higher interest rate, this could increase your monthly note.</p>
<a><u>mortgage payment calculator</u> </a>to easily get an idea of how much your monthly payment might be on a $300,000 mortgage. Here are two examples.
<h3>30-year mortgage example</h3>
<p>A 30-year mortgage is the most popular option because it typically gives you the lowest monthly payment. But the downside is that you’ll pay more interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<h3>10-year mortgage example</h3>
<p>Shorter repayment terms generally come with lower interest rates. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, these examples don’t <a><u>factor in additional expenses</u></a>, such as your closing costs or down payment amounts. </p>
<p>You can <a><u>learn more about your mortgage options</u></a>, and compare rates from multiple lenders, with Credible.</p>
<h2>What are the parts of a mortgage payment?</h2>
<p>A mortgage payment includes principal and interest, and sometimes additional costs are rolled into the loan.</p>
<li>Escrow costs — If you choose to <a><u>use an escrow account</u> </a>or your lender requires it, your property taxes and insurance premiums (such as homeowner’s insurance or mortgage insurance) will be included in your mortgage payment.</li>
<p>The <a><u>amount you pay</u></a> is based on a percentage of your loan and is added to your mortgage payment, paid upfront, or a combination of both options.</p>
<h2>How much interest will I pay on a $300,000 mortgage?</h2>
<p>Your interest rate and loan term have a huge impact on how much interest you’ll pay over the life of a mortgage. </p>
<p>To calculate the interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan, follow these two easy steps.</p>
<ol><li>Calculate the total cost of the loan by multiplying your total monthly payments by the total number of months.</li><li>Subtract the principal balance from the total cost of the loan.</li></ol>
<p>Here are some examples that demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Total amount of interest paid: Around $155,400</p>
<p>Total amount of interest: Around $66,480</p>
<ul><li>10-year, $300,000 loan at 2% interest — Based on this scenario, your monthly payment would be $2,760. To find the total number of multiple payments, multiply 12 by 10 to get 120. Then, multiply 120 by $2,760 for a result of $331,200.</li></ul>
<p>Total amount of interest: Around $31,200</p>
<h2>How to get a $300,000 mortgage</h2>
<p>These nine steps can help you get a $300,000 mortgage and buy a home.</p>
<u>determine whether you qualify for a mortgage</u>
<a><u>get a pre-approval letter</u></a> for a loan from several lenders. This letter gives you an estimate of how much you may qualify to borrow and shows sellers (and real estate agents) you’re a serious buyer.
<li>Compare mortgage rates and offers. Comparison shopping for a mortgage can help ensure you get the best deal available to you. Be sure to compare key factors, such as fees, APRs, closing costs, and mortgage insurance.</li>
<li>Search for and make an offer on a home. When you find the home you’re looking for, place an offer on it based on comparable homes in the area. Hire a real estate agent in your area if you need help.</li>
<li>Apply for a mortgage. If your offer is accepted, complete and submit your lender’s mortgage application. Be prepared to submit important documents, such as W-2 forms, bank statements, tax returns, and more.</li>
<li>Wait for approval. A lender will review your documents and information to determine if you’re eligible. If you meet its eligibility requirements, an appraisal will be done to determine how much the home is worth.</li>
<li>Close on your loan. Attend the closing meeting, sign the required paperwork, and transfer funds for your down payment and closing costs to receive the keys to your brand new home!</li>
<p>Credible makes it easy to compare rates from multiple lenders and find the <a><u>best mortgage lender</u> </a>for your needs.</p>
<h2>Where to get a $300,000 mortgage</h2>
<p>If you choose to apply with a credit union, you may get a good deal since they’re member-owned, not-for-profit institutions. To apply for a mortgage from a credit union, however, you must be a member — and you’ll need to meet membership criteria.</p>
<p>Finally, you may <a><u>qualify for a lower mortgage rate</u></a> with an online lender versus a traditional bank because they have lower overhead costs. But if you prefer face-to-face customer service, this won’t be your best option.</p>
<p>Before you make a decision, research and compare loan offers from multiple lenders to find the best deal for your unique financial situation.</p>

<h1>How to take out a student loan: A step-by-step guide</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>Start by filling out the FAFSA for federal student loans before you turn to private loans to pay for college. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>A private nonprofit four-year college or university can cost more than $37,000 per year. And neither of those figures includes room and board, books and supplies, transportation and other personal expenses. </p>
<p>It’s not surprising that many students apply for student loans, which, unlike scholarships and grants, must be paid back with interest. Not sure how to take out a student loan? You can do this. Just follow these steps.</p>
<h2>What to do before your loan application</h2>
<p>Before applying for a student loan to fund your college education, ask yourself these questions.</p>
<li>What’s the real cost of attending college? Beyond tuition and fees, add up all costs, like room and board if you live on campus, meal plans, books and supplies, transportation to and from campus and any personal expenses you’ll owe.</li>
<li>Will you work while attending college? Getting a job can help <a>offset the cost of college</a>. Some employers offer tuition reimbursement. Consider a work-study program if your school offers one.</li>
<a>help pay for college</a>. Unlike student loans, you don’t have to pay them back unless your enrollment status changes or you withdraw early from a program. Grants are usually need-based, while scholarships can be merit- or need-based.
<h2>How to take out federal and private student loans</h2>
<p>If you’re like most students, you’ll need to apply for either federal or <a>private student loans</a> — or a combination of the two — to pay for your education. It’s important to understand your student loan options and the steps to take to apply.</p>
<p>Credible makes it easy to <a>research your private student loan options</a> and compare rates from multiple lenders.</p>
<a>starting on Oct. 1</a> for the following school year.
<a>Filling out the FAFSA</a> is the first step in applying for student loans and the only way to be eligible for federal student loans.
<ul><li>Scholarships and federal grants</li><li>Federal student loans</li><li>Federal work-study programs</li><li>State-based aid</li></ul>
<p>The easiest way to submit your FAFSA is <a>online</a> with the <a>myStudentAid mobile app</a>. You can also print out a <a>2021-22 FAFSA PDF</a> and mail it in. </p>
<h2>Review your financial aid offer</h2>
<p>After you submit your FAFSA and get approval for financial aid, each school that accepts you will send a financial aid award letter. This is what you’ll find in each offer.</p>
<li><a>Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</a>: This is used to determine how much financial aid you’ll receive.</li>
<li>College grants and <a>scholarships</a>: Grants are usually need-based, but scholarships can be merit- or need-based. Neither has to be paid back.</li>
<li>Federal work-study programs: These programs give you a job, on or off<a>-</a>campus, and a paycheck.</li>
<li>Federal student loans: Direct student loans may be subsidized (the government pays the interest while you’re in school) or unsubsidized, and you’ll have to pay them back when you leave school.</li>
<p>When you decide where you’d like to attend, you’ll need to call the school's financial aid office and let them know which loans you want to accept or decline. </p>
<h2>Take out federal student loans</h2>
<a>government backs federal loans</a>, they’re often less expensive than private loans, don't require a credit check and have income-driven repayment plans and fixed interest rates.
<p>Federal loans can be eligible for <a>loan forgiveness</a> so if you’re struggling to make your payments, you have more relief options than with private loans. </p>
<ul><li>Only for undergraduates</li><li>Need-based requirement</li><li>Lower borrowing limits</li><li>Interest is subsidized during deferments</li></ul>
<ul><li>Undergraduate and graduate students are eligible</li><li>No need-based requirement</li><li>Higher borrowing limits</li><li>Interest is not subsidized during deferments</li></ul>
<p>There are three main types of federal student loans: Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized and Direct PLUS loans.</p>
<h3>Direct Subsidized Loans</h3>
<p>Direct Subsidized Loan award limits: up to $5,500 annually (subject to change)</p>
<h3>Direct Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
<p>Direct Unsubsidized Loan award limits: up to $20,500 per year, minus any subsidized loans you might receive over the same time period (subject to change)</p>
<p>Direct PLUS Loan award limits: cost of attendance (as determined by the school) minus any other financial aid received </p>
<p>It’s no secret that students who need a loan to pay for all or part of their education are more likely to get better rates and terms <a>if they have a cosigner.</a> </p>
<p>Borrowers who checked rates with a cosigner prequalified for loans at interest rates that were 2.36 percentage points lower, on average, than those available to borrowers without cosigners, according to a <a>data analysis by Credible</a>.</p>
<p>Although you typically don’t need a cosigner to get a federal student loan, having one could help you secure a better interest rate. </p>
<h2>Compare private student loans</h2>
<p>Before taking out a private student loan, it’s best to exhaust all federal loan options, scholarships and grants, and work-study programs before applying. Interest rates are generally higher for private student loans than for federal student loans. </p>
<p>With Credible, you can <a>compare private student loan rates</a> from multiple lenders.</p>

<h1>How student loans work</h1>
<h2>Federal and private student loans are available to help cover the costs of earning a college degree, but there’s a lot you need to know before applying.</h2>
<div> <div><div> <p>Student loans can help fund your college education. Learn more about how student loans work in this guide. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Navigating the world of student loans can be tricky, but many students use student loans to help fund their education every year. While student loans are a helpful tool, there are also important details you need to know before applying for a loan. </p>
<p>This guide will go over how student loans work and help you navigate your student loan journey.</p>
<h2>What types of student loans can I get?</h2>
<p>Student loans fall into two categories — federal loans and private loans. The type of loan you should get depends on your situation and whether or not you qualify.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has several different loan types available, each with its own criteria:</p>
<li>Direct Unsubsidized Loans — Unsubsidized Loans aren't need-based and are available to eligible undergraduate, graduate and professional students. Students are responsible for paying the interest on Unsubsidized Loans.</li>
<li>Direct PLUS Loans — PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, as well as parents of undergraduate students. These loans are the only federal student loans that require a credit check.</li>
<li>Direct Consolidation Loans — A Direct Consolidation Loan allows students to combine multiple federal student loans into one loan with one loan servicer and one monthly payment.</li>
<a><u>use a cosigner to secure a loan</u></a> if you don't qualify for a private loan on your own. Private student loans can come with fixed or variable interest rates.
<p>Credible lets you <a><u>compare rates on private student loans</u></a> from various lenders in minutes.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons of federal student loans</h2>
<p>Federal student loans have helped many students <a><u>pay for college expenses</u></a>, but they have both benefits and drawbacks. </p>
<li>No credit check needed — There are no credit history requirements to qualify for a federal student loan, except for PLUS Loans.</li>
<li>No cosigner required — Unlike many private loans, a cosigner isn't required to secure a federal student loan.</li>
<li>Income-driven repayment plans — Federal loans offer several payment plan options, including plans based on your income and family size. If you're just launching your career, your payments are likely to be lower in the beginning.</li>
<li>Borrowing limits — Most federal student loans have a maximum annual and total loan limit. The amount received through federal loans may not be enough to cover all your education expenses.</li>
<li>Origination fees — Federal student loans have origination fees. These fees are a percentage of the loan total, so you'll receive less money to pay for school expenses than you borrow.</li>
<li>Loan default — If you default on your loan, the government could garnish wages from your paycheck. The government could also garnish your tax return and Social Security benefits in some cases.</li>
<h2>Pros and cons of private student loans</h2>
<p>Private student loans also have pluses and minuses. </p>
<li>Not need-based — Private loans are based on your or your cosigner’s credit, so there's no need to prove financial need to qualify for a loan.</li>
<li>Higher borrowing limits — Private lenders often let you borrow up to the cost of attendance, while most federal loans have stricter borrowing limits.</li>
<li>Potentially lower interest rates — You can potentially score a lower interest rate if you have excellent credit and meet the lender's other underwriting requirements.</li>
<li>May require a cosigner — Unless you've established good credit, you'll probably need the help of a cosigner with good to excellent credit to qualify for a private student loan.</li>
<li>Variable interest rates — Some <a><u>private student loans have variable rates</u></a>, so there's a chance your interest rate could increase during payoff.</li>
<li>Don’t offer the same benefits and protections — Private loans aren't eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs or income-driven repayment plans. They’re often less flexible if you face hardship.</li>
<p>When borrowing money for school, you should only borrow enough to pay for school and other educational expenses. The amount you can borrow depends on the type of loan you take out. </p>
<h3>How much can I borrow in federal student loans?</h3>
<li>Direct PLUS Loans — Up to the cost of attendance minus any other aid received. Schools determine the cost of attendance. Dependent students whose parents don't qualify for a Parent PLUS Loan may qualify for extra funding.</li>
<h3>How much can I borrow in private student loans?</h3>
<p>Private student loan amounts vary by lender but maximums are typically the cost of attendance. In some cases, lenders may set minimum lending requirements on student loans. </p>
<p>Credible makes it easy to <a><u>compare private student loan rates</u></a> from multiple lenders.</p>
<h2>How much will I have to pay in interest on a student loan?</h2>
<p>The amount of interest you pay on a student loan varies depending on whether you have a federal or private loan, along with other factors. Federal student loans have fixed interest rates, set by Congress, that won't change for the life of the loan. </p>
<p>Interest rates on private student loans vary depending on the lender and your credit. Some private student loans come with variable interest rates, so the amount paid each month could change over time. Other factors that affect interest include: </p>
<li>Loan amount — The higher your loan amount, the more interest you’ll pay each month.</li>
<u>the longer your loan term</u>
<h2>When do I repay my loans?</h2>
<p>At some point, you're required to start repaying your student loans. The exact timing of when repayment begins depends on the type of loan you took out.</p>
<h3>Repaying federal student loans</h3>
<p>The Department of Education offers several repayment plans based on your needs and the type of loans you have: </p>
<li>Standard Repayment Plan — This is the default repayment plan for federal loans. It comes with set monthly payments for 10 years, or up to 30 years for Consolidation Loans.</li>
<li>Graduated Repayment Plan — Payments on this plan start lower and increase every two years for up to 10 years, or up to 30 years for Consolidation Loans.</li>
<li>Extended Repayment Plan — Loan payments are extended up to 25 years. Payments can either be fixed or graduated, and you must have more than $30,000 in Direct Loans to qualify.</li>
<li>Income-Sensitive Repayment Plan — Monthly loan payments are based on your annual income, and the balance must be paid in full within 15 years.</li>
<h3>Repaying private student loans</h3>
<p>Private lenders set their own repayment terms. Depending on the lender, you may have the option to choose your repayment term, opting to start payment immediately or defer payments. </p>
<p>Interest begins to accrue immediately on private student loans. Common payment plans for private student loans include: </p>
<li>Deferred repayment — With this plan, you defer all your principal and interest payments until after graduating or leaving school.</li>
<li>Interest-only repayment — You can choose to pay interest charges while in school to keep them from accruing and capitalizing on your loan balance.</li>
<li>Fixed repayment — Borrowers can pay a fixed amount each month until they graduate or leave school.</li>

<p>“Once a federal loan is refinanced with a private lender, it is no longer a federal student loan and, therefore, private loan terms will apply,” he said.</p>
<p>Federal student loans always have fixed interest rates, but private loan lenders offer both <a>variable and fixed rates</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Check your credit score</h3>
<a>check your credit score for free</a> through the three credit reporting bureaus.
<p>“Consumers should see where their credit needs improvement before deciding to refinance and also inquire with a bank about the process to have an idea where they stand in the loan process,” Tayne said.</p>
<p>Determining your credit score prior to applying for a loan gives you an idea of the terms that are available.</p>
<p>“Knowing this will help you determine if the refinancing offer is appropriate for your level of credit and would provide any savings to make refinancing worthwhile,” Coleman said.</p>

<h1>How to refinance student loans with a cosigner</h1>
<h2>A cosigner can help you refinance your student loans and potentially get a lower interest rate. But before you refinance, consider the pros and cons.</h2>
<div> <div><div> <p>If you have student loans but don’t have the best credit history, you can refinance with a cosigner to potentially get a lower interest rate. Learn more. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>When you refinance your student loans, you typically get a lower interest rate. But it can be difficult to get approved on your own, especially if you have no credit or bad credit. This is where a cosigner can help. </p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about refinancing student loans with a cosigner. </p>
<p>With Credible, you can <a>compare student loan refinancing rates</a> quickly and easily.</p>
<p>A cosigner is someone who applies for a loan with the primary borrower, usually a friend or family member. If your cosigner has a strong credit score and solid income, they can help you get approved or land a lower interest rate or better terms. </p>
<p>But being a cosigner carries some risks. If you default on your loan and are unable to make payments, your cosigner will be responsible for repaying the loan.</p>
<h2>Cosigner vs. co-borrower</h2>
<p>Even though cosigners and co-borrowers both have a legal responsibility to pay back a loan, they’re not the same. A <a>cosigner helps a primary borrower qualify for a loan</a> and only agrees to repay it if you default. </p>
<h2>What lenders look for in a cosigner</h2>
<p>While each lender has its own unique requirements, most look for the following in a cosigner:</p>
<li>Strong credit profile — Lenders prefer cosigners with a good or excellent credit score, typically between 670 and 850.</li>
<li>Low debt-to-income ratio — A debt-to-income ratio (your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income) of no more than 36% will make your cosigner stand out.</li>
<li>Sufficient income — It’s important that cosigners have enough income to repay a loan if the primary borrower fails to do so.</li>
<li>Steady employment — Lenders like to see cosigners with a solid track record of employment, as it can be a sign of consistent, sufficient income.</li>
<li>Stable residence — Some lenders view cosigners who have lived in the same place for several years more favorably than frequent movers.</li>
<h2>How to refinance student loans with a cosigner</h2>
<p>The process to refinance student loans can also vary by lender. Typically, you’ll need to follow these steps: </p>
<li>Do your research. Lenders vary, so be sure to compare rates, terms, fees and cosigner eligibility so you can make the best decision for your particular situation. Not all student loan lenders allow cosigners.</li>
<li>Gather the necessary documents. You’ll need to provide the lender with personal and financial documents for both you and your cosigner. These may include government IDs, W-2 tax forms and pay stubs.</li>
<li>Fill out the application. Next, apply for the refinance. Make sure all the information you provide for you and your cosigner is complete and accurate, and submit all requested documents.</li>
<li>Repay your refinanced student loans. Keep in mind that while your cosigner accepts responsibility for your loans, ideally you’ll repay them without their help.</li>
<h2>Is refinancing my loans right for me?</h2>
<p>You may want to <a>consider student loan refinancing</a> for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<li>You can potentially land a better interest rate and terms, which can make it easier for you to pay off student loan debt.</li>
<li>If your finances have improved because you paid off other debts or got a raise, for example, refinancing may make sense.</li>
<li>Refinancing might be worth it if you have a student loan with a variable interest rate and you’d like to refinance to a fixed rate so your payments are more predictable.</li>
<p>If you’ve decided that refinancing with a cosigner is right for you, check out Credible to <a>compare refinancing rates</a> from various lenders in minutes.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons of having a cosigner</h2>
<p>Before you refinance your student loans with a cosigner, consider these benefits and drawbacks. </p>
<h3>Pros of refinancing with a cosigner</h3>
<li>Higher chance of approval — If you don’t have the best credit, a cosigner can increase your likelihood of getting approved for refinancing.</li>
<li>Better rates and terms — With a cosigner, you may be able to secure more favorable rates and loan terms than you qualify for on your own.</li>
<li>Build your credit score — A <a>cosigner on a private student loan</a> may help you build your credit history, as long as you make your student loan payments on time and in full.</li>
<h3>Cons of refinancing with a cosigner</h3>
<li>Can damage your cosigner’s credit — If you miss your loan payments, your cosigner’s credit may take a hit.</li>
<li>May damage your relationship with your cosigner — You might tarnish your relationship with your cosigner if you fail to repay your loan and put the responsibility on them.</li>
<li>Cosigner release isn’t always available — Since not all lenders offer a cosigner release option, your cosigner may be tied to your loans for the full repayment term, unless you refinance them with another lender on your own.</li>
<h2>Can I release my cosigner?</h2>
<p>With cosigner release, you can eventually remove your cosigner from your loan. Whether or not this option is available to you depends on your lender. </p>
<p>Credible lets you <a>compare student loan refinancing rates</a> in minutes.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to having a cosigner</h2>
<p>If you can’t find someone open to cosigning or you don’t want to go this route, here are some alternatives to consider: </p>
<a>build or strengthen your credit</a>. You can open accounts, make payments on time, keep debt to a minimum and limit hard inquiries. You can also request your credit reports from the three main credit bureaus at
<li>Look for nontraditional lending options. Ask your friends and family if they’d be willing to loan money to you. This could potentially offer an interest-free solution.</li>
