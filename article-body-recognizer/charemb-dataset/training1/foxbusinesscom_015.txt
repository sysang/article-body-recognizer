<h1>Psaki says Biden approval ratings low because people 'tired of fighting' the pandemic he vowed to shut down</h1>
<h2>Psaki pressed on Biden's plummeting approval ratings, blames pandemic he vowed to 'shut down'</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a><u>House</u></a> press secretary Jen Psaki said
<a><u>President Biden's</u> </a>approval ratings are so low because people are "tired of fighting" the coronavirus pandemic, which Biden promised to "shut down" during the 2020 campaign.
<p>A reporter asked Psaki during the White House's Friday press conference why the president's approval ratings have plummeted.</p>
<p>Psaki claimed to the reporter that Biden's approval is slipping due to pandemic fatigue – the same pandemic Biden promised on the campaign trail to end.</p>
<p><a><u>BIDEN HAS LOST MORE APPROVAL AT START OF TERM THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT SINCE WORLD WAR II, POLL FINDS</u></a></p>
<p>"A lot of people in this room work for organizations that have done polls and there’s a lot of underlying data in them. And sometime it differs," Psaki said.</p>
<p>"I would just go back to what our view is, is that we’re still going through a hard time in this country," she continued. "And people are tired of fighting the pandemic, they’re tired of the impact on their lives."</p>
<p>Psaki then continued the Biden administration's strategy of <a>blaming others</a>, specifically the unvaccinated, for the president's dismal approval ratings.</p>
<p>"Some of them are sick and tired of people who won’t get vaccinated, who they feel are impacting their ability to live life in a normal way," Psaki said. "Some people are still fearful for loved ones."</p>
<p>"And we all thought it would be over at this point in time," Psaki added.</p>
<p>Psaki made the claim at the White House’s Friday press conference as Biden’s approval ratings plummet the furthest than any president since World War II.</p>
<p>New polling from Gallup shows that Biden’s approval rating dropped from 56% in Q1 to 44.7% in Q3 which represents an 11.3% drop that has not been experienced by any president since World War II.</p>
<p>The president’s approval fell even further in September after his chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and left Americans behind, despite promises from his administration that wouldn’t occur.</p>
<p>Biden repeatedly promised during the <a>2020 presidential campaign</a> that he would "shut down" COVID-19 if elected. "I'm not going to shut down the economy," the president told supporters. "I'm going to shut down the virus." </p>

<p>Monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the U.S. on average was up 10.59%, to $1,690, the <a>study</a> found, and two-bedroom units went up 11.88%, to $2,050. </p>

<h1>Biden still blameless on COVID in the eyes of our liberal media</h1>
<h2>Some liberal journalists continue to refuse to assign any responsibility for America's haphazard COVID strategy to our president</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>The COVID fear-mongering from Biden administration has to stop: Jason Chaffetz</a></h4> <p>Chaffetz says that Biden must fire Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci on 'Ingraham Angle'</p></div></div>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>As the bad news surges and throbs again about the coronavirus, you can easily sense the lack of political vitriol for this president. Joe Biden gets a free pass.</p>
<a>San Francisco</a>. Roughly 1,200 Americans still die daily from the virus." Nobody blamed Biden.
<p><a>CRITICS SLAM 'HYPOCRITE' BIDEN FOR CLAIMING 'NO FEDERAL SOLUTION' TO PANDEMIC AFTER VOW TO 'SHUT DOWN' COVID</a></p>
<p>Some journalists explicitly held Biden blameless. On MSNBC, John Heilemann proclaimed, "We know the president is not responsible for this ... We know presidents get blamed for things that they don't deserve to get blamed for."</p>
<p>BIDEN SAYS HE AGREES WITH GOP GOVERNORS: THERE'S ‘NO FEDERAL SOLUTION’ TO PANDEMIC</p>
<p>They threw this assumption at Biden. On March 29, NBC's "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd asked, "Do you think there is blood on the president's hands, considering the slow response?"</p>
<p>Two days later, disgraced MSNBC anchor Brian Williams repeated: "What is President Trump's level of culpability, what's his level of responsibility, say, toward the illness and fatalities we're witnessing every few minutes these days?"</p>
<p>Biden deferred but did not critique the questioners for this super-softball, with its echo of, "Can't you do better than this disastrous dolt?"</p>
<p>Jonathan Alter offered this extravagant Trump take on MSNBC: "He's a public health menace, and he has rivers of blood on his hands."</p>
<p>Joe Scarborough was especially rabid: "Nobody's ever done so much to kill so many people." Just a few weeks ago, as the death toll passed 750,000, Smeary Scarborough was still blaming Trump for everything.</p>
<p>Even just a few weeks ago, MSNBC regular Steve Schmidt was still blaming Republicans alone: "They have killed hundreds of thousands of people with the lies about a pandemic, about a disease that can be controlled."</p>
<p>That is not a factual judgment. That is pure spin. Benjamin has routinely donated to Democrats, including Barack Obama and Martin O'Malley.</p>
<p>Leftist media outlets such as MSNBC spent 2020 treating COVID like it was easily fixable -- if voters simply put Democrats in charge. Their complete lack of humility demonstrates that this was always politics first, science later.</p>

<p>President Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin for a top role at the <a>Federal Reserve</a> as part of a slate of three nominees for central bank board seats, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<a>economists</a> for other Fed board seats that will soon be vacant: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University; and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.
<a>Democrats</a>, some of whom opposed Mr. Biden’s decision in November to offer a second term to Fed Chairman
<a>Jerome Powell</a>, a Republican first chosen for the top job by former President Donald Trump. They have called for the Fed to take a tougher stance in regulating big banks and a bolder approach in addressing financial risks posed by climate change.

<p>STOCKS IN 2022 FACE BUMPY RIDE AS SP SITS AT RECORD</p>
<p>While serving as a Fed governor from 2010 to 2014, Ms. Raskin was deeply involved in behind-the-scenes work to write rules implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul.</p>
<p>Since leaving the government, Ms. Raskin has spoken out on the need for the Fed and other federal financial regulators to more proactively address growing threats from climate-related events such as natural disasters and wildfires.</p>
<p>With a closely divided Senate, Mr. Biden needs either universal support of Democrats to confirm his nominees or support from some Republicans to overcome holdouts from his own party.</p>
<p>"The decisions the Fed makes on our behalf should build toward a stronger economy with more jobs in innovative industries—not prop up and enrich dying ones," she wrote.</p>
<p>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, on Tuesday took to Twitter to criticize Ms. Raskin’s potential nomination, saying she "advocated cutting off capital for energy destroying millions of US jobs."</p>
<p><a><u>JOB OPENINGS, CONSUMER PRICES, COSTCO AND GAMESTOP EARNINGS TOP WEEK AHEAD</u></a> </p>

<h1>Blackstone co-founder Peter Peterson dies, aged 91</h1>

<p> Billionaire Wall Street financier Peter Peterson, who co-founded private equity firm Blackstone Group LP <BX.N> and served as U.S. President Richard Nixon's commerce secretary, died on Tuesday of natural causes, his family said. He was 91. </p>
<p>"As a first-generation American born in Kearney, Nebraska, Pete exceeded all of his expectations in becoming a successful businessman, statesman and philanthropist," the Peterson family said in a statement.</p>
<p>The son of Greek immigrants who operated a diner in Kearney, Peterson founded Blackstone in 1985 with Stephen Schwarzman, with an initial investment of $200,000. </p>
<p>The firm, which is still led by 71-year-old Schwarzman, now manages more than $400 billion in assets and went public in 2007. Forbes estimated Peterson's net worth at $2 billion. </p>
<p>Peterson and Schwarzman settled on the Blackstone name by combining the German meaning of 'schwarz', which is black, with the meaning of 'petros' in Greek, which translates as stone. </p>
<p>"Pete led an incredible life, leaving a lasting mark on both Blackstone and the broader world. On behalf of the firm and its more than 2,000 employees, we extend our deepest condolences to the Peterson family," Schwarzman said in a statement. </p>
<p>Peterson received an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in 1947 and an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1951.</p>
<p>He joined the Nixon administration in 1971, serving as assistant to the president for international economic affairs and then commerce secretary from 1972-73.</p>
<p>From Washington he went to Wall Street and was chairman and chief executive at investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he worked until 1983. </p>
<p>In his later years, Peterson focused more on philanthropy and in 2008 established the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. </p>
<p>In 2010, he signed The Giving Pledge, an initiative by investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to encourage the world's billionaires to give away at least 50 percent of their wealth to charity.</p>
<p>Peterson is survived by his wife, five children and nine grandchildren.</p>

<p>Nearly four months after the Supreme Court <a>rejected</a> the Biden administration’s moratorium aimed at protecting <a>renters</a> nationwide, evictions are once again steadily on the rise, housing advocates say. </p>
<p>According to <a>data</a> from Eviction Lab at Princeton University, evictions have been rising in more than 30 major cities and six states where it collects data. </p>

<p>HOME PRICES RISE, AND SINGLE PEOPLE ARE RUNNING OUT OF HOUSES TO BUY</p>
<p>Overall numbers, however, still remain below pre-pandemic levels because of an infusion of federal rental assistance and other pandemic-related assistance like expanded child tax credit payments. But those too are set to end. </p>
