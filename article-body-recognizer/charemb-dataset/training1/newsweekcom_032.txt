<h1>Human Rights Expert: What the Mental Health Industry Gets Wrong About Suicide Prevention</h1>
<h2>To better support people in the U.S. and around the world, it's time to toss out the old approach and do something different based on real data.</h2>

<div> Experts <a>Mental health</a></div>
<a> come to fruition</a> overall, the virus pushed the need for good mental health care and suicide prevention strategies to the forefront. Now, the question about whether what we're currently doing works or is reliable is under a new microscope.
<h3>A Faulty Perception of Predictability and No Clear Answers</h3>
<a>suicide rates</a> among children have steadily gone up, not down.
<a>some professionals </a>doubt that certain mental disorders are disorders at all. They assert that conditions like depression are merely responses to adversity rather than the result of chemical imbalances or other biological problems.

<h1>How To Effectively Use Your Winter Downtime</h1>
<h2>Open hours are one of the best and rarest assets an agency can have. Let them pass by at your own risk.</h2>

<div> Experts <a>Leadership</a></div>
<p>Here are three ways I suggest you spend the slow season.</p>
<h3>Give Your Company a Facelift</h3>
<p>Be honest: How long has it been since you've updated your branding? How long has it been since you saw the backend of your website?</p>
<p>Internet aesthetics move fast and prospective clients will be able to tell if you haven't been tending to your own garden.</p>
<p>These updates are essential not just for appearances, but also for positioning. The way you project yourself online will be the difference between being seen as a digital expert and problem solver or just a content mill.</p>
<h3>Add Value to Your Campaigns</h3>
<p>Take this time to develop the skills and offerings that will set you apart. Here are just a few value-adds that you can start investing in:</p>
<p>• Up your game on TikTok, <a>Snapchat</a> and <a>Instagram</a> Reels so you become known as an agency that can execute attractive, engaging and highly viral content.</p>
<p>• Rethink your LinkedIn approach and how you can position your client's professional profiles as thought leaders. LinkedIn is becoming a creator-driven space, and now is the time to start standing out.</p>
<p>Stagnation, or allowing themselves to be "buried under work," is what causes even good digital marketing firms to become known for producing average work. Let their failure be your advantage.</p>
<h3>Set Up Your Selling Power</h3>
<p>The purpose of owning a business is to grow it, scale it and make more money for you and your employees year after year. If you're not continually finding new ways to sell your services, you're going to plateau quickly.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: If your revenue is just "billable hours," the only way you can scale your business is by constantly increasing your client roster, keeping you perpetually trapped in as a high-volume, low-margin business.</p>

<h3>What Will It Take to Make Wearables Mainstream?</h3>
<p>It's clear that wearables are a good thing — mostly. As with any technology, healthtech wearables come with their own challenges, primarily associated with privacy, access and cost.</p>
<a>risks of data collection outweigh the benefits</a>, a necessary hurdle to overcome for wearables to be implemented in a meaningful way.

<a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> announced new recommendations. The NHL also said that it is navigating the differences in U.S. and Canadian rules the best that it can.
<p>The NHL has had to do a balancing act between the stricter Canadian COVID-19 regulations and the looser U.S. regulations after it moved its season into Canada six months ago.</p>
<p>"We have always had the issue of differing rules in different jurisdictions, so it's not a new challenge," Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told the Associated Press in an email.</p>
<p>"(We are) navigating choppy waters the best we can," Daly added.</p>
<p>The NHL decided to review COVID-19 protocols after the CDC recommended cutting quarantine time in half from 10 days to five. However, it doesn't seem like Canada is ready to adopt the looser regulations just yet.</p>
<p>Some hockey players expressed frustration with the NHL for not adopting the relaxed U.S. regulations that other sports agencies have adopted, especially in reducing the mandatory 10-day absence if someone has COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>"It seems like it's always Canada that's the reason that a lot of things don't happen, so I don't know if we're going to be able to do that," said Alex Killorn, who plays for the Tampa Bay Lightning.</p>
<p>"But it seems reasonable that we would do that and implement it as soon as possible," Killorn added.</p>
<p>Provinces in Canada clamped down on crowd sizes and imposed additional restrictions after an increase in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Lightning player Steven Stamkos on Monday said it was a fine line, while acknowledging discussion about testing less is happening around NHL locker rooms.</p>
<p>Veteran executive Lou Lamoriello said Sunday the league and union are doing the best they can without being able to control Canadian federal and provincial rules.</p>
<p>That comes with the acknowledgement that it's more difficult for the teams in Canada to avoid lengthy absences.</p>
<p>One option is having different testing and isolation requirements for the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>"There's arguments on both sides," Howson said. "You want the level playing field, but for us, the 26 teams that could have a less restrictive system, why should they be punished?"</p>
<p>As for Canada following the U.S. strategy of living with the virus, LeVasseur does not expect that shift for at least two more weeks while health officials monitor case and hospitalization numbers.</p>

<div> Sports Football <a>NFL</a></div>
<p>Football legend John Madden has passed away at the age of 85, the National Football League (<a>NFL</a>) announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We all know [John Madden] as the Hall of Fame coach of the Oakland Raiders and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather," said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>
<p>A cause of death has not been released, but the NFL said that Madden died "unexpectedly."</p>
<p>He also became one of America's most prominent pitch men. Brands found Madden's high-energy style and mix of folksiness an alluring combination for alcohol and food commercials.</p>
<a>ABC</a>. His pricey move to Fox after the then-startup cable news operation wrangled NFL broadcasting rights from CBS signaled the company's level of seriousness when it came to delivering the NFL to viewers.
<p>In the aftermath of Madden's death, many football fans and NFL personalities alike paid tribute to the titan of the game.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who reportedly considered Madden "a dear friend," released a statement saying that he had created a "legacy of love."</p>
<p>"There is no one who lived a more beautiful football life than John Madden," Jones added.</p>
<p>The former Oakland Raiders, the team Madden coached to greatness, released a statement saying that they were "saddened" by his death.</p>
<p>"Few individuals meant as much to the growth and popularity of professional football as Coach Madden, whose impact on the game both on and off the field was immeasurable," the team, now known as the Las Vegas Raiders, stated.</p>
<p>In the past, the NFL has often recognized Madden's achievements, and continued to do so even after his retirement from broadcasting in 2009.</p>
<p>Madden is survived by his wife, Virginia, and two sons, Joe and Mike.</p>
<p>The NFL informed teams of updated COVID protocols Tuesday, aligning with the <a>CDC</a>'s new five-day isolation recommendation followed by masking after a positive COVID test.</p>
<p>The previous policy required anyone who tested positive to be removed from team activities and games for 10 days, or until they returned consecutive negative COVID tests.</p>
<p>The NFL sent a memo to teams that the policies were agreed to by the league and the NFL Players Association. The memo was obtained by <a>The Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>According to the reporting from the AP, NFL players and other essential personnel can return to the team under these conditions:</p>
<p>— Five days have passed since a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>— At least 24 hours have passed since the individual last had a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
<p>— Other symptoms, including a cough, have resolved or improved.</p>
<p>— Any local regulations or requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p>Those who are fully vaccinated can continue to return from isolation sooner than five days assuming they return negative tests, and under the new policy can stop testing after five days and return if they meet the conditions listed above.</p>
<p>The changes could allow Colts quarterback Carson Wentz to return for Sunday's key game against Las Vegas after Indianapolis placed him on the reserve/COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Wentz tested positive for the virus or was deemed a close contact to someone else who had tested positive. However, if Wentz has no symptoms, he could be cleared to play.</p>
<p>Masks must be worn on the sideline and at all times except when playing and practicing for five days after return.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians has tested positive for COVID-19 and is currently isolating at home.</p>
<p>The team said Tuesday that assistant head coach/run game coordinator Harold Goodwin will serve as interim head coach in Arians' absence. The reigning Super Bowl champions visit the New York Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bucs also placed cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That increases the number of Tampa Bay players on the list to five.</p>
<header><div> Sports</div><h1>John Madden: The Best 'Madden NFL' Games of All Time, According to Critics</h1><div> By Harrison Abbott <time>On 12/29/21 at 7:37 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>While he is best known to sports fans as a Hall of Fame coach for the Oakland Raiders and a prolific commentator, the late John Madden also left his mark on the world of video games.</p>
<a>National Football League</a> (
<a>came out in August</a> and was heavily criticised for its abundance of glitches and the outdated-feeling game engine.
<p>While the series has been going through a bit of a rough patch lately (having been subjected to poor reviews and meta-bombing) it still holds a special place in the hearts of many fans and has delivered some classics in the genre.</p>
<p>With that in mind, <a>and to commemorate the passing of a sports legend</a>, Newsweek has rounded up the high points in the Madden NFL catalog. According to the Metacritic aggregate ratings, here are the franchise's top 5 entries.</p>
<a>published by GameSpot</a>, called it "the best iteration" of the sports game yet, praising its wealth of new features, the polished visuals and realistic simulations (although they did find fault with the sluggish controls).
<p>Echoing these sentiments, <a>IGN contended</a>: "This series is the granddaddy of virtual football and for all intents and purposes, this version of the game is the finest of the entire bunch."</p>
<p>While Madden NFL 2001 was generally agreed upon to be the franchise's greatest outing at the time, the next few years would only see things improve even further.</p>
<p>Madden NFL 2005 is certified as a "Must Play" title on Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 91 out of 100.</p>
<p>It was a bit like an <a>Uber</a> Star rating (albeit 5 years before those existed), and it helped to foster a more enjoyable online community.</p>
<p>Summing up Madden NFL 2005, GameSpy wrote: "There's very little not to like [...] Its amazingly deep, well thought out franchise mode is the best I've ever seen, while the basic gameplay still can't be beat [You] won't be disappointed."</p>
<p>You might detect that a bit of a pattern is emerging here, as Madden was clearly on a roll in the early noughties.</p>
<p>IGN noted that EA admirably refused to rest on their laurels with this sequel (which is not what you would expect from the company nowadays) and made "key improvements in every single facet of the game".</p>
<p>Specifically, the outlet praised the developers for adding new content (like the fun drill mode) and refining the campaign. There was also an enhanced create-a-player feature, a better fantasy draft option and various quality of life improvements.</p>
<p>According to Metacritic, Madden NFL 2003 is the 59<sup>th</sup> most acclaimed video game release ever. Hailed by many as being the complete package, it had refined gameplay, authentic integration with the NFL, and a suite of extras.</p>
<a>which was a revelation for the series. </a> Maxim cited this as a key strength in their 5-star write-up, as did
<a>GameSpot</a>. For the first time in Madden history, you were able to play with your friends without having to organize an in-person get together and it totally changed everything about sports games from then on.
<p>Reflecting on this ground-breaking innovation the time, IGN said: "The idea that you can finally sit in front of the television and play some other guy a thousand miles away is awesome."</p>
<p>NHL players, coaches and team staff who test positive can return to their teams after five days if they are asymptomatic or return a negative PCR test, or two negative rapid tests taken over two hours apart.</p>
<p>The changes in the <a>NHL</a> apply to the 25 teams in the U.S., but not the seven Canadian teams because Canada's health department still recommends 10 days.</p>
<p>Tuesday, nine NHL games were postponed in Canada because of COVID issues and attendance limits from local governments.</p>
<p>The new protocols will remain in effect for 14 days, after which the league and NHL Players Association will review how the protocols have worked so far and discuss future adjustments.</p>
<a>National Basketball Association</a> and
<p>Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly confirmed the new protocols, which were first reported by Daily Faceoff.</p>
<p>The 10-day isolation requirement remains in Canada.</p>
<p>Hockey players this week had expressed a desire for shorter isolation times. Daily testing and enhanced protocols, including mask-wearing at team facilities unless on the ice for games or practices, are in effect through at least January 7.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>

<p>The Tragedy of Macbeth is set to be released on Apple TV+ on January 14, 2022, with the film receiving a limited theatrical release from Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Adapting the Shakespearean play, Joel Coen directed the film starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, respectively.</p>
<p>It is shot entirely in black and white with the actors working on sound stages rather than filming on location in Scotland, as was originally planned.</p>
<p>The film's cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel spoke with Newsweek about why he and Coen chose to shoot the play adaptation like this.</p>
<h2>Filming 'The Tragedy of Macbeth' in Black and White</h2>
<p>Looking back, Delbonnel said he and Coen felt it was an "obvious" thing to do when the director had decided—because of the COVID pandemic—to shoot the film on sound stages.</p>
<p>He said: "When we first discuss[ed] it with Joel it was kind of obvious, I mean when we decided not to shoot in Skye in Scotland, which was Joel's decision, everything [was going to be] on stage.</p>
<p>"So, it raised the question of, what are we going to build? And what is it going to be? And suddenly black-and-white became obvious because then people don't relate to anything, any colors or [anything], the wall are just walls."</p>
<p>He added that his decision to use light to switch between night and day with ease was because of the vagueness of the play.</p>
<p>"It's never clear if it's day or night, or anything like that," Delbonnel explained. "And as the movie started it's like we were looking up but, in fact, we're looking down so Joel wanted to play with this kind of ambiguity.</p>
<p>"And suddenly black-and-white was a perfect tool, and the moving light was helping to go from night to day, or day to night, in a single shot and playing with that."</p>
<h2>On the Importance of Playing With Light</h2>
<p>When asked if the use of light and dark represented the main characters' plight, he admitted: "I mean as a cinematographer I don't go this deep. It's more about trying to build a score, as if it was a musical score.</p>
<p>"So, in the beginning it's all grey, there's no black, there is no white, and then that's when everything shifts into night. It's then black and white, and there is less grey.</p>
<p>"I was kind of trying to follow the musicality of the language, which, by the way, I had a hard time to understand!</p>
<p>The French cinematographer previously worked with Coen and his brother Ethan on Inside Llewyn Davis, and the fact this was Coen's first directorial effort without his brother meant they were able to collaborate more, he said.</p>
<p>Delbonnel describes the Coen brothers as "a pair, a single person divided," which is something that made them "easy" to work with, but, even without Ethan, it was much the same on The Tragedy of Macbeth.</p>
<p>The cinematographer explained: "On Macbeth it was easy as well, but much more [collaborative].</p>
<p>"We went further in our collaboration on Macbeth because Ethan was not there, so all the questions he would have asked Ethan he asked me. I had the privilege to be included because I'm not as bright or as intelligent as Ethan."</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Macbeth is out in theaters in the U.S. on Saturday, December 25, and it will be released on Apple TV+ on Friday, January 14.</p>
<p>The new Netflix film Don't Look Up contains a far-fetched, but very serious warning about why we should trust scientists.</p>
<p>The movie tells the story of a comet heading directly towards earth, and the scientists who struggle to convince the rest of the world that it's not a hoax.</p>
<p>Dr. Mainzer spoke to Newsweek about the scientific accuracy of the movie but also about the unfortunate parallels she feels when it comes to people believing scientists.</p>
<p>Discovering comets isn't an astronomically rare occurrence, but only around 3600 comets have ever been discovered so it's not an every day event.</p>
<p>Dr. Mainzer not only made sure the script was airtight when it came to making the science plausible and believable, she also coached the movie's two leads, DiCaprio and Lawrence on how to play convincing scientists.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, just a more fundamental point that the movie is making is that you really do have to pay attention to science. And you can not pay attention to science, but you do so at your peril," Dr. Mainzer said.</p>
<p>Dr. Mainzer surmises, "You can ignore science but science isn't going to ignore you."</p>
<p>Don't Look Up is available to stream on Netflix now.</p>
<p>Super Bowl champ, NFL Hall of Famer and the ultimate American Underdog, Kurt Warner brings part of his life story to the big screen this Christmas.</p>
<p>Zachary Levi plays Warner in the sports biopic, alongside Anna Paquin and Dennis Quaid. Turned into a movie by brothers Jon and Andrew Erwin, American Underdog is out in theaters now.</p>
<p>Warner's journey from NFL reject to two-time Super Bowl MVP took some interesting stops along the way, including a job at a grocery store and a stint in the now-defunct Arena Football League.</p>
<h2>Kurt Warner's makeshift football jersey</h2>
<p>The opening scenes of American Underdog show a young football-loving Kurt Warner playing in his backyard. He doesn't have his name officially printed across the back of his jersey, instead he uses duct tape to spell out "WARNER" across the back.</p>
<h2>Benched during college football</h2>
<p>The coach who finally takes a chance on Warner, Terry Allen, is played by Levi's former Chuck co-star Adam Baldwin.</p>
<h2>Meeting Brenda Warner while line-dancing</h2>
<p>During college, Kurt met his future wife Brenda while line-dancing in Iowa. Kurt assures Newsweek this really happened, so not only did Levi need to convincingly play football, he needed to dance too.</p>
<h2>Rejected from the Green Day Packers</h2>
<p>Just like in American Underdog, Warner went undrafted after he left college, but he was given a second chance by the Green Bay Packers. In the movie he's brutally cut after being told he's not ready for the opportunity by his coach.</p>
<h2>Working in a grocery store</h2>
<p>Unbelievably, Kurt Warner did work in a grocery store after he was rejected from the Green Bay Packers, and before he managed to realize his dream of playing in the NFL.</p>
<p>He may not have been throwing loaves of bread around the store as depicted in American Underdog, but Warner did have to take a $5.50 job at the Hy-Vee grocery store in Cedar Falls.</p>
<p>In American Underdog, Warner seems reluctant but he does eventually join the Arena Football League (AFL) as the starting quarterback for the Iowa Barnstormers.</p>
<p>Starting off slow, Warner spent three years with the team, being named in the AFL's First-team All-Arena in '96 and '97. His success for the Barnstormers led to his eventual recruitment back to the NFL.</p>
<h2>Relationship with Brenda and her children</h2>
<p>Due to various fortuitous circumstances, he found himself as the starting quarterback the next season, and led the St. Louis Rams to Super Bowl victory on January 30, 2000.</p>
<p>Levi told Newsweek how he reminisced about watching that Super Bowl when he was young to prepare himself. He said: "I knew Kurt's story. I saw it in real time when I was a slightly younger man and when he was a slightly younger man.</p>
<p>American Underdog is available to watch in movie theaters now. </p>

<header><div> Culture</div><h1>'Is This Even Legal?': Redditor Claims They Were Asked to Bring Doctor's Note to Interview</h1><div> By Catherine Ferris <time>On 12/28/21 at 11:36 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>It may be common practice for some companies to ask an employee to bring in a doctor's note when they miss work, but a Redditor shared in a viral post that they were asked to bring one when they weren't able to make a job interview.</p>
<p>"They told me to bring them a doctor's note with me to my interview which they scheduled for the next day, same time," the Redditor wrote. "Is this even legal? I think I'm going to the interview and ask them what their deal is."</p>
<p>u/p-heiress added that the interviewer asked if it was possible for them to reschedule their doctor's appointment.</p>
<p><a>According to the Society for Human Resource Management</a>, the protocol for employers for a doctor's note is generally acceptable, but it may depend on the circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, an employer can request a doctor's note as part of the company's sick leave or attendance policy, but the note should not include a diagnosis. Instead, it should simply verify an employee was seen by a doctor.</p>
<p>When it comes to other instances, like workers' compensation, asking for a doctor's note or release to return to work after an injury while on the job is acceptable.</p>
<p>Many commenters wrote that u/p-heiress should reconsider participating in the job interview.</p>
<p>"'If you already have issues trusting me in this process, what is my day to day workplace experience expected to be?'" u/againsterik wrote as a question the Redditor should keep in mind.</p>
<p>Another commenter, u/Kurtcobangle, commented that u/p-heiress should go to the interview to ask that very question to "waste their time arguing about it."</p>
<p>u/Fonalder urged the Redditor to not interview at all.</p>
<p>"They acting like they own you just because you applied," the commenter wrote. "Imagine what they'll do if you sign on the dotted line."</p>
<p>Some shared their personal experiences with job interviews gone wrong.</p>
<p>"This interaction told [me] everything I needed to know about the job I had applied for," u/campfire_vampire concluded.</p>
<p>In an update, u/p-heiress wrote they ultimately decided to skip the interview but called their corporate offices to inform them of what happened.</p>
<p>"I looked into it and while it's not illegal, it's definitely not required and a very odd thing to ask of someone who only applied," the Redditor wrote.</p>
<p>Although a frustrating situation, the Redditor said it was a pleasant surprise to find many commenters agree that it was a "strange" ask to provide a doctor's note at an interview.</p>
<p>The experience gave the Redditor something to think about for future job interviews.</p>
<p>"I hope to be more bold in my decisions when it comes to stating my availability," u/p-heiress told Newsweek. "And not offering up this much information as many people stated is unnecessary."</p>
<p>Updated 12/29/2021, 4:08 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with comments from Redditor u/p-heiress. </p>
<header><div> Tech Science</div><h1>Bizarre Ice Formations Pictured Near Yellowstone's Hot Springs</h1><div> By Ed Browne <time>On 12/29/21 at 6:13 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Freezing temperatures at Yellowstone National Park have led to the formation of intriguing ice formations.</p>
<p>Another photo shows similar build-ups of ice on the needles of a tree along the Gibbon River.</p>
<p>Ice of this type is known as rime ice, a well-known phenomenon. Rime ice occurs when water droplets in the air quickly freeze when they come into contact with a surface.</p>
<p>Over time these water droplets will freeze on top of one another, resulting in a build-up of ice that gets larger. These build-ups face towards the wind, Yellowstone National Park stated.</p>
<p>Rime ice tends to occur when the air is cold and moist, and a light wind also helps.</p>
<p>In Yellowstone, a good place to find rime ice is near thermal basins where hot springs put water vapor into the air. Another good place to see rime ice is near rivers, where mists above the water can freeze into rime ice structures along the bank.</p>
<p>Rime ice can be an issue for pilots when it forms on planes. Build-ups of rime ice on the surface of an aircraft, such as the wings, can alter its aerodynamics and reduce lift whilst increasing drag, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
