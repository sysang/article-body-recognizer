<p>Zeleny noted Biden said he wished he had acted faster, but that, so far, there wasn't any sense that the administration would be sending out the ordered tests in early January as the latter suggested in the interview.</p>
<p>Biden has faced <a>criticism</a> over the lack of testing, with some blasting him as being "behind the times," considering the increasing rate at which the virus has spread in recent weeks.</p>

<h1>White House turned down plan in October to boost COVID testing: report</h1>
<p>The <a>White House</a> in October turned down a proposal that would have added more than 730 million at-home <a>COVID</a> tests to the market per month, according to a report this week.</p>
<p>But the White House rejected the Oct. 22 bid and three days later announced it would seek to bolster rapid home testing through the "FDA’s regulatory approval process."</p>

<p>An administration official present at the October meeting told the publication that the decision was based on the fact that the U.S. "did not have capacity to manufacture over-the-counter tests at that scale."</p>
<p>The problem with bolstering at-home testing was down to the fact that the FDA had only approved a handful of testing kits and the ability to drastically increase manufacturing of the kits was reportedly limited. </p>
<p>But the announcement by President Biden earlier this week shows a change in the administration’s priority as COVID cases are again on the rise nationwide.</p>
<p>Starting in January 2022, the White House will launch a website that will allow Americans to order free at-home testing kits. </p>
<p>The move is in response to recent shortages in at-home testing kits and long lines to get tested during the holiday season. </p>
<p>"I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion [tests] two months ago, before COVID hit here," Biden said during a Wednesday interview with ABC News.</p>

<p>PSAKI ASKED 'WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK' TO ORDER COVID TESTS EARLIER, BLAMES LACK OF DEMAND EARLIER THIS YEAR</p>
<p>But comments made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki earlier this year suggest the administration had prematurely dismissed the idea. </p>
<p>"Should we just send one to every American?" she scoffed from the podium in answer to questions over increased access to testing kits.</p>
<p>"Then what happens if you—if every American has one test? How much does that cost, and then what happens after that?" she added. </p>
<p>But following the president’s announcement, Psaki indicated she regretted her comments.</p>

<p>"I would say there's not a day that goes by that I don't leave this podium and wish I would have said something with greater context or more precision or additional information," she said earlier this week.</p>
<p>"Going back, I wish I would have done that," she added. </p>

<h1>Miami stumbles behind rest of Florida in economic reopening</h1>
<p>MIAMI –– With many Floridians back in business, a sense of normalcy has returned for some restaurant owners, including George Yiannikakis.</p>
<p>“Like the rest of the restaurants, we got hit pretty bad in the sense that there was not much we could do. For us, the priority is to fill the existing capacity,” said Yiannikakis, the owner of Amaranthine restaurant in Miami Shores.</p>
<div> <div><p> With many people back in business, the state's reopening brought a sense of normalcy back to restaurant owners like George Yiannikakis in Miami. (Elina Shirazi)</p></div></div>
<p>Yiannikakis said the slow reopening is straining revenue for small-business owners.</p>
<p>“If there would be an official mandate for the restaurants to open to 100 percent, people would feel that things are very safe. It is like giving people the green light to go out,” Yiannikakis said.</p>
<p>Health officials insist that holding off on reopening is the right approach</p>
<p>“Just in three weeks in the state, we've gone from 175 cases per day to 2,200 cases per day,” said Dr. Charles Lockwood, the senior vice president at the University of South Florida Health.</p>
<p>Lockwood blames the spike on two factors.</p>

<p>A <a>New York</a> painter who suffered from a rare facial deformity has gotten a new nose for <a>Christmas</a> thanks to the generosity of a plastic surgeon who operated on him free of charge. </p>
<p>Conrado Estrada, 57, who is originally from <a>Guatemala</a>, had a large, disfigured nose caused by rhinophyma. Its causes are not known, but it’s been classified as a type of skin inflammation. </p>
<div> <div><p> Conrado Estrada suffered from a rare facial deformity called rhinophyma. (Dr. Thomas Romo)</p></div></div>
<p>Dr. Thomas Romo, a plastic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, likened Estrada's nose to a "male appendage." He told Fox News that Estrada caught his attention in late August when the 57-year-old was working on the doctor’s Bronxville home. </p>

<h1>Fauci says mandating vaccine for domestic travel is something that should be considered</h1>
<h2>the Biden administration has balked at imposing such a mandate</h2>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief science adviser on the COVID-19 response, said in an interview Monday that the U.S. should consider a vaccine requirement for domestic air travel.</p>
<p>Fauci told MSNBC that vaccine requirements are added incentive for people to roll their sleeves up for the jab. </p>
<p>"If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that’s something that seriously should be considered," he said.</p>
<p>The Associated Press pointed out that the Biden administration has balked at imposing such a mandate. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.</p>

<h1>Flu season resurges in US as omicron cancels flights, stokes NYE fears</h1>
<h2>Thousands of flights have been called off due to bad weather and sick staff</h2>
<p>As <a>travelers</a> across the U.S. have been surprised to find their flights canceled this week amidst the <a>holiday season</a>, cases of the <a>omicron variant of the coronavirus</a> and <a>flu hospitalizations</a> are on the rise. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 flights around the country were called off because crews were sick with COVID-19 – and recent storm fronts created additional chaos. </p>
<p>Flight tracker FlightAware showed that U.S. airlines canceled more than 4,000 flights, both domestic and international.</p>
<p><a>FAUCI SAYS MANDATING VACCINE FOR DOMESTIC TRAVEL IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED</a></p>
<p><a>United Airlines said</a> it canceled 115 flights on Monday due to crews with coronavirus and Delta Air Lines was expected to nix more than 200 flights after scrapping more than 370 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) <a>shows</a> that the number of passengers screened climbed significantly from last year, but was still generally short of 2019 levels. </p>
<p>The agency has forecast that the Monday after New Year's will be one of the busiest days of the season and new quarantine guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could aid airlines and travelers alike. </p>
<a>the CDC shortened</a> the isolation restrictions for people who have the virus from 10 to five days. A call from airlines for the
<a>Biden administration</a> to shorten the quarantine period had been disputed by the union for flight attendants.
<p>In addition, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director <a>Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday</a> that the nation should seriously consider a vaccination mandate for domestic travel.</p>
<p>Fauci warned that omicron would "get worse before it gets better," and while much still remains unknown about the variant, infections have jumped around the world. </p>
<p>In Britain, <a>hospital admissions were up more than 70% on Christmas</a> from a week earlier and other European leaders announced stringent measures in an effort to curtail the spread. </p>
<p>Greece recorded its highest-ever one-day total of new infections.</p>
<p><a>TIMES SQUARE'S 2022 NEW YEAR'S EVE BALL DESIGN REVEALED BY CRYSTAL MAKER</a></p>
<p>New York City's iconic Times Square New Year's Eve celebration will be scaled back this year, hosting approximately 15,000 people down from 58,000. </p>
<p><a>In a press release</a>, Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said last week that visitors won't be allowed entry to the area until 3:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>All of this comes as the 2021 flu season has arrived on schedule, with two child deaths reported. </p>
<p>The most intense flu activity was in Washington, D.C., <a>according to the CDC</a>.</p>

<h1>Record-setting COVID-19 cases in DC, Maryland, Virginia over holiday: report</h1>
<h2>CDC data shows omicron accounted for 59% of new cases in the U.S. for the week ending Dec. 25</h2>
<p>As the <a>omicron variant of the coronavirus</a> rapidly spreads across the country, <a>Maryland</a>, <a>Virginia</a> and <a>Washington D.C.</a> all reported record-setting numbers of COVID-19 cases over the three-day <a>Christmas</a> weekend. </p>
<p>According to a report from The Washington Post, on Monday the nation's capital and its neighboring states reported the highest seven-day new case averages of any point during the pandemic. </p>
<p><a>FLU SEASON RESURGES IN US AS OMICRON CANCELS FLIGHTS, STOKES NYE FEARS</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maryland's Baltimore County declared a <a>state of emergency</a> Monday on Monday and northern Virginia counties have also seen an increase in transmission over the past two months.</p>
<p><a>Recent data</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows a 7-day positivity rate of 15-19.9% in Maryland, Virginia and Washington. </p>
<p>The cases in the last week in D.C. total nearly 8,350, almost 40,550 in Virginia and close to 42,200 in Maryland. </p>
<p><a>Beginning in January</a>, D.C. residents over the age of 12 will have to show proof of vaccination to enter any restaurant, bar, nightclub or gym. </p>
<p>All District of Columbia students must be fully vaccinated by March 1.</p>
<p>"I don't make any of these types of decisions lightly," Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters earlier this month, after bringing back an <a>indoor mask mandate</a>.</p>
<p>She said crises like the pandemic are "the exact time when the government needs to make some decisions for the whole society."</p>
<p>CDC data shows omicron accounted for 59% of new cases in the U.S. for the week ending Dec. 25, up 23% from the previous week.</p>
<p>While much about the variant of concern remains unknown – like whether it causes more or less severe illness – scientists say it spreads more easily, especially among the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>At a <a>White House</a> COVID-19 Response Team <a>call with governors</a> on Monday, President Biden said omicron is a source of concern but "should not be a source of panic."</p>
<p>The president noted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had already deployed emergency response teams to Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Mexico and was ready to provide more hospital beds, as well.</p>

<h1>COVID-19 cases: NYC sees 4-fold increase in children hospitalized</h1>
<h2>Adolescents age 16 and older are now eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose</h2>
<a>health</a> officials are warning about the risks of
<a>children</a> after the department identified four-fold increases in coronavirus-related hospitalizations for children 18 and under beginning the week of Dec. 5 through last week.
<p>According to WNBC, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday that hospitalizations from the <a>virus</a> have soared to late February highs.</p>
<p><a><u>FLU SEASON RESURGES IN US AS OMICRON CANCELS FLIGHTS, STOKES NYE FEARS</u></a></p>
<p>The leader urged parents to use the school holiday break to get kids <a>vaccinated</a>. </p>
<p>"Please do this for them," <a>she pleaded</a>. "Using this time to get this done is really smart."</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the New York State Department of Health <a>issued an advisory</a> to healthcare providers regarding the worrying pediatric trend – particularly in <a>New York City</a>.</p>
<p>The news was based on data reported to the department through the Health Electronic Response Data System (HERDS). </p>
<p>Additionally, the department highlighted that for the week beginning on Dec. 19, statewide, no 5-11 year-old who was admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 was fully vaccinated.</p>
<p><a>CHILDREN'S COVID-19 CASES UP 32% FROM TWO WEEKS AGO, PEDIATRICIANS REPORT</a></p>
<p>Over that same time period, only one-fourth of 12-17 year-olds who were admitted to the hospital were fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Adolescents age 16 and older are now eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. </p>
