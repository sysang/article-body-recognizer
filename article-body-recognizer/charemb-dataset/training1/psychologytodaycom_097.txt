<h2> Menopause and Mental Health </h2>
<div> <h3> What should I do about menopause “brain fog”? </h3> </div>

<a>Any woman undergoing menopause</a> who feels persistently irritable, sad, or
<a>anxious</a> for more than two weeks should talk to her doctor.

<a>Postpartum Depression</a> (PPD) and is a serious mental health concern.
<a>Anxiety</a> and Maternal Depression. Science tells us that PPD often goes unrecognized because changes in sleep,

<a>guilt</a> and worry. I felt extremely fragile, which was different from my previous depressive experiences.
<p>Symptoms of Postpartum Depression</p>
<p>Postpartum Depression can present in physical, emotional and cognitive ways. Here's a list of some of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Afraid to be left alone with your baby Anxiety, feelings of dread and worry</p>
<p>Difficulty remembering things Feeling disconnected from others</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed Frequent crying, about little things</p>
<p>Guilt about not being able to cope Helplessness and hopelessness</p>
<p>Irritability, agitation Looping of unwanted thoughts</p>
<p>Loss of energy, fatigue Loss of interest in self-care</p>
<p>Loss of interest in doing things Not capable of caring for your baby</p>
<p>Not feeling up to doing tasks Panic, shortness of breath</p>
<p>Persistent sadness Poor <a>concentration</a>/indecisiveness</p>
<p>Recurrent thoughts of death/<a>suicide</a> Significant appetite changes</p>
<p><a>Sleeping</a> difficulties Worried about your future</p>
<p>What Causes Postpartum Depression?</p>
<a>intense hormone fluctuations</a>,
<a>decreased serotonin levels</a>,
<a>immune system dysregulation</a>,
<a>lower levels of oxytocin</a> play a role in the development of PPD.
<a> before getting pregnant,</a> you have a significantly higher risk for developing PPD.
<a>evidenced based</a> methods to help mothers gain recovery. For Postpartum Depression, the treatments of choice include antidepressant medications and
<a>psychotherapy</a>. In addition, holistic treatments can bolster traditional treatments, many of which I recommend.
<a>evidence based treatments</a> for PPD, has the techniques, and a network of PPD support systems to help you recover.
<a>Transcranial Magnetic Therapy</a> can help bring about restorative sleep patterns. Listening to
<a>Delta-Embedded</a> music can induce sleep too. I recommend downloading Deep Theta Music and suggest you check out composer
<a>Omega-3</a> DHA, Vitamin B-12, complex carbohydrates and
<a>ancient grains</a>. Indulge in your favorite comfort foods every once in a while, and don't forget to stay
<a>hydrated</a> with water. Again, this is where you can call on others to help as you heal from PPD. Ask for family or friends to cook for you, and shop for you, so you can have healthy foods and snacks on hand.
<a>Bright Light Therapy (BLT)</a> to help offset PPD. It’s recommended to use Bright Light Therapy for 20 to 30 minutes within 10 minutes of when you wake up in the morning.
<a>interpersonal touch</a> helps reduce depression, lower cortisol and increase the feel-good hormone
<a>oxytocin</a>. Holding your baby, your partner or a pet are wonderful ways to get the benefit of touch. If you find yourself feeling disconnected to your baby or your partner, you can look into a more formal kind of touch specifically for moms called
<a>exercise </a>significantly reduces stress and depression.

<p>And as a mom, myself, who’s gone through Postpartum Depression, knowing its darkness, its crushing chaos, the numbing detachment and feelings of inadequacy, it will end.</p>
<p>And you will bond with your baby.</p>

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>OCD</h1> <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</p> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>From hoarding to handwashing to forever checking the stove, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) takes many forms. It is an anxiety disorder that traps people in repetitive thoughts and behavioral rituals that can be completely disabling.</p>
<p>For more on causes, symptoms and treatments, see our Diagnosis Dictionary.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Signs and Symptoms </li> <li> Causes and Risk Factors </li> <li> Treatment and Recovery </li> </ul> </div>
<p>Sufferers may understand the uselessness of their obsessions and compulsions, but that is no protection against them. OCD can become so severe that it interferes with their work or relationships, or even keep them from leaving their home.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the criteria for an OCD diagnosis? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between physical compulsions and mental compulsions? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the different types of OCD? </h3> </div>
<p>The obsessions and compulsions that characterize OCD can center around different themes. Five common categories of obsessions include:</p>
<p>1. Fear of contamination (germs, viruses)</p>
<p>2. Fear of harm (unlocked doors, electrical outlets catching fire)</p>
<p>3. Excessive concern with order or symmetry (even picture frames, general neatness)</p>
<p>4. Obsessions with the body or physical symptoms (breathing, swallowing)</p>
<p>5. Unwanted, intrusive thoughts (going to hell, harming family members) </p>
<p>People suffering from OCD therefore carry out compulsions such as washing hands or checking locks because they believe those actions will stop those bad outcomes from happening.</p>
<div> <h3> I want everything to be neat and clean. Do I have OCD? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Causes and Risk Factors </h2>
<p>OCD likely results from a confluence of factors—a biological predisposition, environmental factors including experiences and attitudes acquired in childhood, and faulty thought patterns.</p>
<p>The fact that many OCD patients respond to SSRI antidepressants suggests the involvement of dysfunction in the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Ongoing research suggests there may be a defect in other chemical messenger systems in the brain.</p>
<p>OCD may coexist with depression, eating disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and it may be related to disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, and hypochondria, though the nature of the overlap is the subject of debate.</p>
<div> <h3> What can trigger the onset of OCD? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Which brain regions are involved in OCD? </h3> </div>
<p>One region thought to play a role in OCD is the basal ganglia, a collection of structures underneath the cortex that help coordinate movement; when the basal ganglia malfunctions, unwanted, involuntary movements can result.</p>
<div> <h3> Can OCD be contracted through a viral infection? </h3> </div>
<a>compulsive behaviors</a>. This suggests that this
<a>rare route for OCD is transmissible</a>.
<div> <h3> Has OCD increased due to COVID-19? </h3> </div>
<a>COVID-19 has not created an “epidemic of OCD.”</a> A key distinction is that the fear of contracting or transmitting
<a>COVID-19</a> is genuine cause for concern, whereas the intrusive thoughts characteristic of the disorder are not. In most cases, extra hand-washing and sanitizing also hasn’t led to impairment or dysfunction in daily life.
<a>By contrast, someone with OCD</a> might begin to wash their hands so many times that they become raw or bloody.
<h2> Treatment and Recovery </h2>
<p>Either psychotherapy or medication, or both, may be prescribed for OCD, and research suggests that a combination of the two is often the most successful approach, especially for young people. </p>
<div> <h3> How can I help someone who has OCD? </h3> </div>
<a>myths about OCD.</a> Instead, research the condition and recognize that
<a>OCD is treatable with therapy and medication</a>, and there are secondary options if the first attempt at treatment isn’t effective. You can then gently but firmly begin a discussion about seeking help.
<div> <h3> How does Exposure and Response Prevention work? </h3> </div>
<a>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a frontline treatment for OCD.</a> ERP is a form of
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy, and it involves safely exposing the patient to the feared stimuli (exposure) and preventing the typical ritual they would perform in response (response prevention).
<div> <h3> How can you prevent obsessive thoughts? </h3> </div>
<p>Simply trying to suppress distressing thoughts doesn’t work. In a well-known experiment, psychologist Daniel Wegner asked study participants not to think about white bears—and naturally white bears were all they could think about.</p>
<div> <h3> Can you fully recover from OCD? </h3> </div>
<a>, lead to a full recovery.</a> While obsessions and compulsions
<a>do not completely disappear</a> for many others, treatment still allows them to lead a fulfilling life. And having realistic expectations for recovery can help; people who
<div> <h3> Has the pandemic changed OCD treatment? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can you prevent a relapse? </h3> </div>
<a>stress</a>, life transitions, or new environments that evoke an obsession. But lapses don’t have to lead to a full relapse. To avoid
<a>relapses</a>, people can identify what triggered the setback and develop a plan to navigate that situation in the future. Continuing to practice CBT and/or ERP is key to maintaining recovery as well.
