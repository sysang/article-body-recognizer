<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Lily Radziemski</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 1, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Fast-forward to August of this year. When I ended up in the south at the last minute in a sort of prodigious gift from the universe, I set off on a mission to Saint-Paul de Vence.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Monet’s ‘other’ masterpiece: His gardens at Giverny</p></div>
<div><div><p>In his life behind the canvas, Chagall was often on the move — first driven by his artwork, later by war. After having left Russia for good in the 1920s, he later fled to the United States when France fell to the Nazis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reflecting on Chagall, Maeght — in a matter-of-fact drawl — describes how “he was a very simple man in his daily life, and he painted with formidable power.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 1966, Chagall moved from Vence to Saint-Paul de Vence. The new house, named La Colline, was built for him by architect André Svetchine a few hundred yards up the road from the foundation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A quick offseason visit to the Loire Valley, birthplace of the French Renaissance</p></div>
<div><div><p>The museum was built to feel like home, surrounded by a garden in green, white and blue — Chagall’s color (he was known to say, “Je suis bleu”) — to let the colorful paintings inside shine.</p></div></div>
<p>Dopffer recounts how Chagall was extremely involved in the creation of the museum and how he decided himself on which pieces would be included and where they would be placed. They haven’t been moved since. The frames, though, had to go.</p>
<div><div><p>Chagall worked until the last day of his life, March 28, 1985, when he died of a heart attack in his home. He was 97 years old.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, Meyer describes how “because he was working continuously, he never thought of his life ending. Therefore, nothing was prepared,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mayor offered a place for Chagall in the village cemetery, which the family accepted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a choice, because he was a citizen of the world,” she said. “He looks and belongs to the sky.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Among the lesser-known offerings in the average French pastry case, near the piles of croissants, stacks of brioche and rows of eclairs, is the bostock.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A great panettone, airy and golden, needs no accompaniment — and will probably be eaten within hours. This recipe is for the lackluster loaves with dense or dry interiors.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to transform leftover bread, cake and cookies into exciting new treats</p></div>
<div><div><p>Next, make the frangipane. Any nut works just fine in this recipe, including almonds, which are classic. Pecan and walnut frangipane is especially rich; pistachios produce a faintly green frangipane.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spread the frangipane onto the moistened slices of panettone and bake them as-is, or dress them up with pieces of fruit or a sprinkle of nuts.</p></div></div>
<div><p>This cranberry custard trifle uses leftover panettone instead of cake</p></div>
<div><div><p>For the prettiest presentation, cut a loaf of panettone across its equator to get large, round slices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For best results, avoid panettone that contains a lot of chocolate, as it can burn during baking.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If your loaf is still quite moist, dry slices out in a 300-degree oven for 10 to 20 minutes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make Ahead</b>: The syrup and frangipane can be made up to 2 days in advance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Storage Notes</b>: Extra syrup and frangipane can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Leftover syrup may be strained and used to sweeten tea or other beverages.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Where to Buy</b>: Panettone is available online or at well-stocked grocery stores around the holidays.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>NOTE:</b> Almonds, pistachios, pecans, pine nuts, hazelnuts, cashews and macadamia nuts will all work. Nuts may be roasted or raw.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>There are many ways to use miso in everyday cooking.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Indeed, it’s “a seasoning powerhouse with tons of range,” as my colleague Aaron Hutcherson wrote in his recent guide to miso.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But to appreciate miso in perhaps its purest expression, consider miso soup.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sipped out of a small bowl, misoshiru is an essential part of many Japanese meals.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Miso paste packs a major umami punch. Here’s how to use it.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Keep seasonality and simplicity in mind when you decide what to add to your miso soup. It’s meant to “whet your appetite, and that first sip will bring you the taste of the season,” Sakai writes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A summery miso soup might feature tomatoes and corn; in the winter, dried mushrooms and root vegetables could be added.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Miso Soup</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>This recipe is for a very basic miso soup. Here are ways to adapt it to your tastes, using what you have on hand. The only essential ingredient here is miso.</p></div></div>
<li>Want to make the dashi vegan, or just don’t eat fish? >> Omit the bonito flakes.</li>
<li>Can’t find kombu? You can order it online >> or use any kind of store-bought or homemade stock as the base for your miso soup.</li>
<li>The miso is a must >> but if you are sensitive to salt, start with half as much, and then taste the soup, adding more as needed.</li>

<div><div><p>In fact, I’d say that there’s no way to make true pollo a la brasa — unless you own a rotisserie contraption for your oven or grill — though there are ways to capture the same combinations of flavors.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Pollo a la brasa two ways: Peruvian and American</p></div>
<div><p>Washington's best Peruvian chicken spots</p></div>
<div><div><p>Dip each forkful in the punchy aji verde, a creamy sauce that takes minutes to make in a blender and pairs well with so many savory dishes, whether they were roasted on a spit or not.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Pollo a la Brasa With Aji Verde</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Not a meat eater? >> Try this with a head of cauliflower, cleaved in half. Supplement the meal with a pot of beans for additional protein.</li>
<li>If you are out of potatoes >> you could roast the chicken over other root vegetables, cut into similarly sized pieces, or winter squash.</li>
<li>Can’t have chiles? >> Skip them.</li>
<li>Dislike mayonnaise and dairy products? >> Use half a ripe avocado in the sauce instead.</li>
<li>Not into cilantro? >> Use fresh mint, or a combination of tender herbs, instead.</li>
<div><div><p><b>Where to buy</b>: Aji panca, aji amarillo and huacatay, can be found as jarred pastes at Hispanic markets and online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Storage</b>: Leftovers may be refrigerated in covered containers for up to 4 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make Ahead</b>: The chicken may be marinated overnight, if desired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>NOTE</b>: To cut a chicken in half, using kitchen shears, cut through its backbone, then around through its breast bone until the two halves are separate. You may also ask a store butcher to do this.</p></div></div>

<div><p>These udon noodles in a simple soy broth are simply irresistible</p></div>
<div><div><p>And there are exceptions to this rule of three okazu, one soup, one grain and pickles: All-in-one dishes, such as noodle soups and grain bowls. My favorite version of this so far? Ochazuke.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Miso soup delivers simple, warming satisfaction in a snap</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ochazuke</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Instead of salmon >> you could use any other kind of flaky fish, raw or cooked, or even roe. You could also use tofu.</li>
<li>I’ve skipped the dashi here >> but feel free to make one, or use any kind of broth as your base for the miso soup.</li>
<li>Dislike mushrooms? >> Use any vegetable instead, just be sure it’s sliced thinly enough that it will cook through quickly.</li>
<div><div><p><b>Where to buy</b>: Find miso in the refrigerated section of most supermarkets. Find surigoma and bubu arare at Asian markets or online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Storage:</b> Leftovers can be refrigerated in covered containers for up to 2 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make Ahead:</b> The rice may be made up to 4 days in advance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>NOTE</b>: Surigoma is a traditional topping of ground, roasted sesame seeds, but you can use any kind of sesame seeds. Bubu arare are tiny rice puffs; a crumbled rice cake adds a similar texture.</p></div></div>

<div><p>My last overseas trip was in 2019, when I went to Nice. On a cobblestone street lined with old wooden folding tables, accordion music twinkling up the block and the setting sun casting long shadows, I had socca for the first time.</p></div>

<p>There are many types of chickpea pancake, a versatile and nutritious food that’s found across the globe. It can be thick and pillowy or dense as a baked potato, thin and spongy or crepe-like and crisp. My favorite might be Niçoise socca.</p>
