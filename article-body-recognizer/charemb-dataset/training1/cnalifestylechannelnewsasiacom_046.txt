<h1> Top 10 TikTok beauty hacks of 2021 – from makeup to skincare to hair care </h1>
<div> <p>You had soap brows, slugging, backwards makeup, face-lifting blush and sock curls, just to name a few. TikTok sure is a strange place.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serene Seow </a> </div> </div>
<p>Everyone loves a good beauty hack. And you can count on TikTok to serve up some of the best ones. Or at least the most curious-looking ones.</p>
<p>A spillover from 2020, the soap brow continued to reign in 2021 for its laminated brow effect. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>SLUGGING</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung is said to be a huge fan of this hugely popular K-beauty trend. The fact that the 40-year-old star doesn’t look a day over 30 is persuasive enough for us mere mortals to give it a go. </p>
<p>This skincare trend, which originated from K-town where plump and dewy skin is prized, involves coating the face with Vaseline in order to prevent transepidermal water loss. Leave it on overnight and wake up to hydrated, baby-smooth skin. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>AIRWRAP BUT BETTER</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>THE RIGHT WAY TO USE DRY SHAMPOO</p>
<p>How you apply your blush will make a world of difference in how you look, and Tiktok users have been sharing lots of ways to do so, from enhancing to sculpting. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>BACKWARDS MAKEUP</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>This is a real game-changer. According to TikTok creator @sylvi.uhh, who prefers to do her makeup in a reverse sequence, translucent powder goes on right after moisturiser. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>PERFECTLY WINGED EYELINER</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The classic winged eye is arguably one of the trickiest make-up look to nail. Or is it? TikTok creator @kat_longoria dreamt up an easy alternative to perfecting the winged look. </p>

<h1> Celebrity weddings, scandals, Squid Game: Top entertainment stories of 2021 </h1>
<div> <p>To wrap up the year, CNA Lifestyle looks back at the stories that trended and got you reading and sharing. First up this week: The world of entertainment.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>If the squid was a part of the zodiac, 2021 would definitely be its year: Even if you somehow did not watch the hit drama Squid Game, we're pretty sure you couldn't go anywhere without someone bringing it up.</p>
<p>Celebrities gave us a lot to talk about this year, too: There were sweet wedding announcements and then there were ugly break-ups with a good measure of scandal thrown in.</p>
<p>And, of course, there was a historic birth this year: Our very first panda baby. All together, now: Awww.</p>
<p>CELEBRITY WEDDINGS GALORE</p>
<a>Rebecca Lim announced her surprise engagement</a> to a
<a>Desmond Tan revealed he'd gotten married</a> to his longtime girlfriend, and
<a>held a wedding in France</a>. Other celebs who got hitched this year include
<a>Suthasini Rajenderan, Kayly,</a> Jitenram Kiran Bala and Korean actress
<p>SQUID GAME WAS THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT SHOW</p>
<a>all anyone could talk about</a>. Everyone and their grandmother donned a
<a>red hoodie and mask for Halloween</a>. And it was an achievement for Asian entertainment that a Korean-language show with subtitles became one of Netflix's most-watched shows ever.
<div> <div> <div><p>CELEBRITY SCANDALS</p></div> </div> </div>
<a>ex-wife</a> Lee Jinglei kept us on the edge of our seats with their page-turner of a scandal involving accusations of
<a>marital infidelity </a>and mental health issues;
<a>bribery and blackmail</a>; and demands for public apologies. Who to believe in the big
<a>he-said-she-said</a> of it all?
<p>Only one thing's for sure: It will be quickly forgotten when the next scandal rolls in. Who even remembers the last scandal involving <a>Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha's Kim Seon-ho and his ex-girlfriend</a> who claimed he made her get an abortion? </p>
<p>A PANDA BABY WAS BORN AT LAST</p>
<a>birth of a long-awaited panda cub</a> as Jia Jia and Kai Kai welcomed their first offspring,
<a>a boy</a>. In the weeks and months that followed, we got to enjoy impossibly cute
<a>photos and videos</a> of the tiny cub and his adorably relatable mum, who seemed to be rolling her eyes at her kid's antics and more interested in snack breaks.
<div> <div> <div><p>CELEBRITIES WE LOST</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>This year, we mourned the passing of DJ <a>Chris Ho</a>, TV personality <a>Anandha Kannan</a> and Malaysian singer <a>Siti Sarah Raisuddin</a>. May they rest in peace.</p> <p>ANDIE CHEN STARTED A GAMING COMPANY</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The Singapore actor said he found his way out of financial and mental health troubles by <a>starting a blockchain gaming company</a>. Who doesn't like the idea of getting paid to play online games?</p>
<p>RONNY CHIENG, THE AH BENG IN MARVEL'S SHANG-CHI</p>
<a>Ronny Chieng plays a character that bears all the hallmarks of a classic Ah Beng</a>. The Malaysian-born, Singapore-raised comedian was equally chuffed when we pointed it out to him.
<p>KAWS: HOLIDAY OR GO HOME?</p>
<p>It was a suspenseful time when fans of the artist <a>Kaws</a> weren't sure if the <a>plug was going to be pulled</a> on the travelling exhibition KAWS:HOLIDAY. In the end, though, it <a>all turned out okay</a> and the holiday spirit prevailed.</p>
<a>Tom Daley knitted a sweater for a dog</a>. What could be more humanity-affirming?
<p>THE RUNWAY RETURN OF THE STAR AWARDS</p>
<a>at Jewel Changi Airport</a>, no less. The stars did a fashion shoot on the runway and
<a>collected their awards</a> in front of the Rain Vortex, and we got a chance to gawk at

<div> <div>100 Years</div> <h2> 100 Years: Its Mark On Modern China </h2> <div>30 Jun 2021 09:00pm</div> </div>
<div> As the Communist Party of China celebrates its 100th anniversary, we reflect on the Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping eras, and the changes the party brought to China. </div>
<p>This July marks the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>We look back at the party’s history, from the 1920’s, to the Civil War, the Great Leap Forward, the Great Famine, the Cultural Revolution and the reforms by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Did the Great Famine cost more than 15 million lives? How does the Cultural Revolution continue to shape Chinese politics today? What was capitalism like after Mao’s death?</p>
<p>Through rare and never-before-seen historical footage, expert interviews and eyewitness accounts of the Great Famine, Tiananmen incident, and the Cultural Revolution, get to know how one party has so profoundly shaped China.</p>

<p>Singapore's elderly - one of the most forgotten and overlooked group - are completely left out by the new, ultra-connected world we live in.</p>
<p>If we take the simple step of introducing them to the technology of our day – Facebook, Instagram, and even virtual reality – can they be empowered to change the world?</p>
<p>Three group of seniors gamely take on the challenge, and Channel NewsAsia has assembled Singapore’s hippest social media stars to help them out.</p>
<p>Viral video makers, SGAG, train a team of helpless elderly home residents to film and star in their very own fund-raising video.</p>
<p>Hip Instagram photographers, the Yusman twins, teach four lonely seniors how to use Instagram and gather 'likes' for a legacy of life well lived.</p>
<p>And finally, famous geek artist Eugene Soh team up with four senior tech ambassadors to create Singapore's first VR game for immobile and sickly nursing home residents. </p>

<h1> No wefies, no hugs: How celebs got ready backstage for Star Awards 2021 </h1>
<div> <p>In the hours leading up to Star Awards 2021, CNA Lifestyle hung out backstage with artistes and nominees as they got glammed up. Who's happy to be out of their sweatpants? Who desperately wants to win? And who doesn't want to win?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>What’s the biggest concern on our celebs’ minds at this year’s Star Awards? Not being able to give hugs or handshakes.</p>
<p>Thanks to safe distancing guidelines, they’ll have to hold back their expressions of affection for friends and colleagues they haven’t seen in a long time. </p>
<p>And when the show itself starts at 7pm on Sunday (Apr 18), they’ll have to rein in their congratulations when winners are announced.</p>
<h3><a>READ: New meaning to 'airport fashion': Star Awards 2021 will be held at Jewel Changi Airport</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Star Awards 2021: These 60 stars are vying for Top 10 Most Popular Female and Male Artistes</a></h3>
<p>With masks on, however, the atmosphere was distinctly different from previous years’, with no one congregating in groups, no eating or drinking, and no wefies.</p>
<p>(And in case you're wondering, the artistes are permitted to remove their masks for television as long as safe distancing measures are in place.)</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>How strict are the safe distancing measures? Well, suffice it to say that we overheard a manager telling some artistes, "Remember not to touch anyone. Even if she falls down, you're not allowed to help her up!"</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>In the makeup chair, a chirpy Rebecca Lim was happy to be back in the thick of the Star Awards atmosphere.</p>
<p>Nerves were running high among most of the nominees, as seven actors are nominated in each acting category, up from the usual five.</p>
<p>“Right now, I’m still quite relaxed but I’m sure that as time goes by, I’ll start to get more nervous,” Romeo said. “This year is challenging – we have seven guys up for Best Actor. So, to be honest, I’m really nervous about later on.”</p>
<p>Someone who’s statistically likely to go home with at least one award is Kym Ng, who’s nominated for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Programme Host.</p>
<p>Bryan is also gunning for a trophy for his turn as a conniving eunuch in A Quest To Heal, telling us, “Everyone thinks I stand a pretty good chance and I so desperately hope that everyone is correct.”</p>
<p>But there’s one person who’s kind of hoping he doesn’t win an award, and that’s Pierre Png, who joked to us while he was getting his makeup done that he doesn’t want to have to make a thank-you speech in Mandarin.</p>
<p>In any case, he’s modest about his chances this year. “With Chen Hanwei in the running, I think the rest of us can just take a back seat,” he quipped.</p>
<p>Will he be proven right? We'll be watching the show to find out.</p>
<p>Star Awards 2021 is broadcast on Apr 18 on Channel 8 and Channel U, with a simulcast on meWATCH and Mediacorp Entertainment Channel on YouTube. </p>
<p>The “Walk of Fame” will run from 5pm to 6.30pm while the awards ceremony will run from 7pm to 10pm. You can also catch what’s happening backstage until 10.30pm on meWATCH and YouTube. </p>

<div> <p>Meanwhile, Bryan Wong and Kym Ng bagged Best Supporting Actor and Actress, respectively, while A Quest To Heal won for Best Drama Serial.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div><div> <p>After a hiatus last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Star Awards returned in a way that made its presence felt on Sunday (Apr 18).</p></div></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>For the first time ever, the show took place across multiple stages at the HSBC Rain Vortex at Jewel Changi Airport, the Shiseido Forest Valley and Changi Airport Terminal 4.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>And, giving new meaning to "runway fashion", the stars walked the red carpet with a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900 as their backdrop.</p>
<p>Artistes nominated for acting awards faced a tougher-than-ever fight this year, as the number of nominees for each category was increased to seven – up from the usual five – to make up for last year's lack of an awards ceremony.</p>

<p>Taking the award for Best Actor for his role in the time-travel drama A Quest To Heal – which was also named Best Drama – Qi Yuwu acknowledged the emotional aspect of being at the airport and going nowhere.</p>
<div> <div><p>“The last time I was here at the airport was the year before, when I was going home to Guangzhou for Chinese New Year. It’s been a long time since I was home, so I feel quite emotional,” said the China-born actor.</p></div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>She thanked the crew for fostering a positive atmosphere on set and said she enjoyed playing a character that was both easy to love and easy to hate.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>On the other hand, “My husband said he’d still love me even if I didn’t win anything! So, I think he’ll be proud!”</p>
<p>Reflecting on his and Kym’s wins, Bryan said, “Kym has been my battle buddy for many years. The two of us getting acting awards – it’s a special day.” He also said he thought his host friends were all adept at acting. </p>
<p>“Kym and I started out with City Beat, and 50 per cent of that variety show was us acting in sketches,” he said. “I played so many roles, including women, from young to old; from uncle to auntie!” </p>
<p>What’s more, he divulged, “Actually, Quan Yi Fong is also very good at acting – she just doesn’t want to do it because she finds it too much hassle.”</p>
<p>She’s clearly just as good, if not better, at hosting, because Yi Fong took home the Best Programme Host (Entertainment Infotainment) award for captaining the celebrity tell-all talk show Hear U Out.</p>
<p>In the Top 10 popularity awards, first-time winners included Marcus Chin, Hong Ling and Bonnie Loo.</p>
<p>Conspicuously missing from the list, though, were this year’s breakout star Chantalle Ng; and Felicia Chin, for whom it would have been her all-important 10th award.</p>
<p>Notably, a Top 10 award went to a teary-eyed Ann Kok, who said, “It’s my first award since leaving Mediacorp seven years ago. We are at the airport, and it feels like taking flight.”</p>
<p>Taking home their 10th popularity awards this year were Dennis Chew and Zheng Geping, who will consequently receive their All-time Favourite Artiste trophies next year.</p>
<p>In addition, a new award was introduced for the first time this year: Best Radio Programme, which went to The Breakfast Quartet of Love 97.2FM's Mark Lee, Chen Biyu, Marcus Chin and Dennis Chew.</p>

<h1> Now boarding: Why Star Awards 2021 at the airport was bittersweet for some </h1>
<div> <p>Best Actress Zoe Tay shone in a runway fashion shoot, but Best Actor Qi Yuwu was a little sad about not being able to fly home to visit his family.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>The Star Awards 2021 took off at full speed on Sunday (Apr 18) in an exciting departure from its usual format: For the first time ever, the event was held at Jewel Changi Airport and Changi Airport Terminal 4.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Star Awards 2021: Zoe Tay, Qi Yuwu and the rest of the winners</a></h3>
<p>Of course, everyone left their passports at home, but for many artistes, there were mixed feelings about being at the airport going nowhere. </p>
<p>And when Ann Kok, back on the scene for the first time in seven years, received a Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes trophy to her teary-eyed surprise, she also referenced the venue, saying, "Getting this award feels like I'm taking flight again".</p>
<p>For hosts Guo Liang and Quan Yi Fong, leading the show's proceedings at Jewel Changi Airport in the midst of a pandemic presented an unusual challenge. The pair were stationed at their own stage, without a live audience.</p>

<p>"It's the first time in my many years of hosting live shows that there has been no audience," Guo Liang remarked during an interview with media after the show. "There weren't any artistes in front of us, and there was no one to interact with."</p>
<p>That makes a host's job more difficult, said Yi Fong, because "we have to generate our own energy and excitement, instead of relying on interaction with the audience".</p>
<p>And, she added, having to raise her voice so she could be heard above the waterfall's crashing waters resulted in a sore throat.</p>
<p>Still, the novelty of holding the show at the airport was exciting, said most artistes we spoke to.</p>
<p>"I think this is something that might not happen ever again in the future, so I’m really blessed that I'm part of this historic event," Desmond Tan told CNA Lifestyle, before he bagged a Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes award.</p>
<p>In addition, he and other celebs including Zoe Tay, Elvin Ng, Rui En, Rebecca Lim, Chantalle Ng, Xu Bin and Ian Fang got to do a runway fashion shoot on the tarmac, in front of a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900.</p>
<p>Younger actresses Hong Ling and Bonnie Loo were also pleasantly surprised when they received their first coveted Top 10 trophies.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also those who surprisingly lost out on popularity awards, such as Felicia Chin, Xu Bin and Chantalle Ng.</p>
<p>Chantalle had also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Terror Within, and received an outpouring of positive feedback for <a>playing a Vietnamese bride in My Star Bride</a>.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Chantalle Ng on what mum Lin Meijiao said after her Star Awards loss</a></h3>
<a> meant for her late grandfather</a>, and apologised to her family for "not being able to share moments, including sad ones, with you".
<p>The 50-year-old was speaking of his decision to switch career paths at 40, going from hosting to concentrating on acting.</p>

<h1> A hug, a hunk, a cockroach: Tokyo Olympics' most memorable non-sporting moments </h1>
<div> <p>Even if you aren’t into sports, this year’s Games had plenty to offer on the sidelines. CNA Lifestyle lists them down. What were your favourites?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tan Hua Sze </a> </div> </div>
<p>Here’s a look back at some of them. From a marriage proposal to a condom that saved the day – 11 things we will remember from the Tokyo Olympics. Aside from all the sports stuff, of course.</p>
<p>THAT SHIRTLESS HUNK FROM TONGA</p>
<p>Yes, he is a recurring headline every time he appears in the Games but who’s complaining? The flag bearer also made his appearance in previous editions, including the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Yes, he was shirtless, too. In winter. </p>
<div> <div> <div><article> <div><blockquote> </blockquote> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div>
<p>THAT JAPANESE VIDEO GAMES SONG</p>
<p>The orchestral medley developed by Sega, Capcom and Square Enix echoed through the stadium and thrilled fans around the world with their familiar tunes such as Star Light Zone from the original Sonic The Hedgehog and the main Final Fantasy theme. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>This is giving us major flashbacks to four years ago where former Japanese PM Abe Shinzo dressed up as Mario in the Rio closing ceremony. Kawaii!</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>JOSEPH SCHOOLING’S COACH GIVES HIM THAT HUG</p>
<p>This is the team spirit that we love to see.</p>
<p>THE GERMAN JUDO POWER RITUAL</p>
<div> <div><p>The video circulated online and while many people were amused, some were concerned. The fighter then came out to defend her coach saying this is the pre-match ritual she has chosen to get herself fired up. You do you, girl!</p></div> </div>
<p>WHEN THE AUSSIE COACH WENT WILD</p>
<p>By now we’ve probably all seen Australia’s swimming coach Dean Boxall doing his, erm, super excited celebrations when swimmer Ariarne Titmus won her first of two gold medals in Tokyo. </p>
<p>It was a sequence of actions that wouldn’t look out of place as the next TikTok trend: It went from fist pumping the air to ripping his mask off to hip-thrusting a railing. Choose your own soundtrack.</p>
<div><p>What made it all the more amusing was the shocked look on the Japanese volunteer’s face, not knowing how to calm him down and return him to his zone. His reaction pretty much sums up all our inner thoughts throughout the Olympic Games.</p></div>
<p>THE ULTIMATE OLYMPIC LOVE STORY</p>
<p>We are all suckers for a good love story and who knew the Olympics would serve us such content? </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>The couple have been together for 17 years and he actually proposed 11 years ago but she rejected it. We guess she’s no longer sitting on the fence about it.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>WHEN A COCKROACH MADE ITS OLYMPICS DEBUT</p>
<p>You would expect full-on sports events when you watch the Games. But a particular cameraman gave us a few seconds of the National Geographic channel when he cut to a cockroach during the women’s hockey game. </p>
<p>Not sure if the roach is bugged by its one minute of fame.</p>
<p>At this point, literally anything can happen, right? Aussie slalom canoeist Jessica Fox shared a TikTok of how she channelled MacGyver and repaired the damaged nose of her kayak using a condom, then proceeded to win a gold and bronze medal. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>Apparently the condom was used to protect the carbon mixture or something like that. Either way, we are all impressed by her engineering skills and how the condom actually prevailed through this one.</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>Of course, the organising committee explained it was actually because of the environmentally friendly and recyclable aspects that cardboard was chosen. Fair enough. We still like Paul’s explanation.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>WHEN BESTIES SHARED A GOLD MEDAL</p>
<p>We said at the start that this was going to be a list of non-sporting moments. But we can’t help it – the Tokyo Olympics was full of heartwarming and inspiring incidents that happened during the events themselves. </p>
<p>One example was when athletes Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar decided to share first place for the men’s high jump, both bagging a gold. </p>
<p>The pair jumped 2.37 meters and failed their attempt at 2.39m, which left them with two options: To settle it with a jump-off or share the gold. </p>
<p>With no hesitation, Barshim asked the official if there could be two golds and before the official could finish explaining, the athlete reached out to Tamberi. The duo shook hands in agreement, and the crowd went wild. </p>
<p>That’s it, that’s the true spirit of the Olympic Games. That and seeing a cockroach on TV.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The KAWS:HOLIDAY exhibition at The Float @ Marina Bay will reopen on Tuesday (Nov 16) after <a>a court discharged an interim injunction</a> that ordered the exhibition to stop.</p>
<p>Organiser of the exhibition AllRightsReserved - a Hong Kong-based studio - said on Monday evening that the case was heard in court earlier that day, and the interim injunction discharged.</p>
<p>It added that the court had ordered The Ryan Foundation to pay legal costs.</p>
<p>"The court further ordered that there will also be an inquiry into the damages sustained by AllRightsReserved by reason of the injunction," said the studio.</p>
<p>The exhibition, which showcases a 42m-long inflatable of KAWS character COMPANION, will reopen on Tuesday, it confirmed.</p>
<p>In a statement on Monday evening, The Ryan Foundation confirmed the exhibition has been allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>The foundation added that it will "pursue AllRightsReserved for breaches of confidence and infringement of its intellectual property rights".</p>
<p>The foundation's director Adrian Chan said it was a "long case that will be fought for all freelancers and creatives".</p>
<p>The foundation's founder Ryan Su told CNA on Saturday it had been in talks with AllRightsReserved to bring a KAWS exhibition to Singapore in 2019, but it did not materialise.</p>
<p>The foundation applied for the court order after it found out that an exhibition would be coming to Singapore.</p>
<p>AllRightsReserved called the allegations "groundless". </p>
<p>The free exhibition will be on display at The Float @ Marina By until Nov 21. The KAWS:HOLIDAY exhibition has travelled to several sites around the world, including Seoul, Taipei, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tokyo.</p>
