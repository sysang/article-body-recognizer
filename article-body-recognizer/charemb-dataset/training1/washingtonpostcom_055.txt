<p> <i>[<a>Partly hidden by isolation, many of the nation’s schoolchildren struggle with mental health</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Mental health services will continue, Hickman said, because the problems the pandemic caused won’t disappear.</p>
<p>Last October, 26 schools in neighborhoods hardest hit by covid-19 were connected to outpatient mental health clinics, therapy, evaluation and other clinical services. Plans are in the works to hire 150 social workers.</p>
<p>But in some school districts, mental health interventions underway are “relevant but insufficient,” according to Howard Adelman and Linda Taylor, co-directors of the UCLA Center for Mental Health in Schools.</p>
<p>Too often the focus is on hiring more support staff, increasing education and expanding social-emotional learning but, they said, those are “often unrealistic and usually produce counterproductive competition for sparse resources.”</p>
<p>What’s also essential, they said, is unifying the district’s services and then weaving in community and home resources “to develop a comprehensive and equitable system of student learning supports.”</p>
<h4>Educators draw lessons from a challenging year</h4>
<p> <i>[<a>Dispatches from education’s front lines: Teachers share their experiences as school returns during the pandemic</a>]</i> </p>
<a>an Internet sensation</a> when videos of her enthusiastic virtual lessons went viral, and parents and teachers across the country applauded her vibrant approach.
<p>Adams, 24, said she and her colleagues had to adjust on the fly.</p>
<p>“We really had to shift our thinking and shift the way we do lessons when we went online,” Adams said. “Even veteran teachers were back to being new first-year teachers with this whole new way of teaching.”</p>
<p>Being enthusiastic is an essential trait for kindergarten teachers in normal times. But online, Adams said, “you almost have to like triple that level of enthusiasm and engagement.”</p>
<p>That approach works, but it’s also wearying. Adams thinks that both she and the students are experiencing screen fatigue. But it hasn’t dampened her desire to teach.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>For locked-down high-schoolers, reading ‘The Plague’ is daunting, and then comforting</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Aleta Margolis, founder and president of the Center for Inspired Teaching, said this past year should provide ideas and opportunities for teaching going forward.</p>
<h4>Laptops and hotspots likely to stick around</h4>
<p>Over the last year, by necessity, the vast majority of students have been connected. Millions of devices and hotspots have been purchased and distributed. The question now is: Will this new, more equitable arrangement persist?</p>
<p>In Texas, officials are <a>looking into a plan</a> that would bring broadband connections to every K-12 student beyond the pandemic, funded by a combination of state and local dollars.</p>
<p>The FCC has yet to rule. But acting commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has called the homework gap the <a>most important issue of digital equity</a> facing the nation and said the pandemic provided the incentive needed to finally address it.</p>
<p>“The days when out-of-school learning required only paper and pencil are long gone. Today, students live their lives online and use Internet-based resources for so much of modern education,” <a>she wrote last spring.</a></p>
<p>For now, he hopes that some schools use the $7 billion in new E-rate funding to go beyond handing out hotspot devices to families who need them, and to deploy new wireless networks that can serve many homes and live beyond the pandemic.</p>
<p>It adds up to a no-turning-back moment, said Richard Culatta, chief executive of the International Society for Technology in Education, a large nonprofit focused on helping teachers use technology to improve quality of learning.</p>

<h3>D-plus school buildings</h3>
<h4>Pandemic spotlight offers real chance for reform</h4>

<a>sailed past the school board</a> on an unanimous, bipartisan vote earlier this year.
<p>“We want to standardize this, so that moving forward, our buildings always meet the standard of warm, safe and dry,” Rivera said.</p>
<p>“Every child in our system deserves to have clean air in their classrooms, now and for the long term,” said Headrick, the parent volunteer.</p>
<p>“We have the opportunity to really make some improvements,” Filardo said, “with the light that has been shone on this.”</p>
<h4>Who attends, who is absent</h4>
<p>What it means to be in school is in flux.</p>
<p>School systems scrambled to come up with new ways to define attendance in remote school. Was it enough just to log in for the day or tune into a Zoom class?</p>
<p>States took varied approaches.</p>
<b> </b>remote learning as similar to a correspondence course.
<p>“The pandemic wreaked havoc with measuring attendance,” said Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit initiative that has tracked state policies.</p>
<p>For many school leaders, the issue was a balancing act as they tried to support students who may be in crisis — as covid-19 has claimed lives and left many workers strapped and jobless — but also draw them into school.</p>
<a>a major worry before the pandemic</a> that is worsening, experts say. High rates of absenteeism are linked to academic failure and dropping out of school.
<p>In Connecticut, described as the first state to produce monthly statewide data on the issue, the percentage of chronically absent students as of January was 21.3 percent — a 75 percent jump over a year earlier.</p>
<p>Harder hit were some of the most vulnerable students. The rate of chronic absenteeism for English learners more than doubled to 36 percent, and the rate for students from free meal-eligible families shot up by 78 percent, to roughly the same level.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty troubling,” Chang said.</p>
<p>Some say it’s past time to rethink attendance more broadly, to focus on mastery of skills and content.</p>
<h4>Changing the ‘butt-in-seats’ formula</h4>
<p>Parents, students and teachers were hyper-focused during the pandemic on when shuttered schools would reopen, but John Kuhn and other district superintendents were sweating out something else too: state funding.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Answer Sheet: This is what inadequate funding at a public school looks and feels like — as told by an entire faculty</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Some policymakers began to consider permanent changes that would meet the changed education landscape.</p>
<p>Hinojosa said she wants to use enrollment, not attendance, as the basis of Texas’s funding formula in part because districts have to budget for enrolled students — not for the changing number of students who show up daily.</p>
<p>With most public school students in Texas from minority and economically disadvantaged families, she said: “Our districts are getting shortchanged and our schools are getting shortchanged and so are our students.”</p>
<p>Now some districts are thinking ahead for the next school year beginning in the fall — but nobody knows for sure how many missing students will return.</p>
<h4>Wanted: New ways to assess students</h4>
<p>The exams have long been controversial. Supporters say standardized testing is vital to know how the most challenged students are doing. Critics say they don’t reveal valid, useful data and perpetuate educational inequity.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic jolted the country’s fixation with standardized testing, bringing the first break in the annual spring exam ritual since the No Child Left Behind era began in 2002.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Answer Sheet: One month in, Biden angers supporters who wanted him to curb standardized testing</a>]</i> </p>
<a>could spur</a> the drive for new assessments, said Bob Schaeffer, acting executive director of the nonprofit National Center for Fair and Open Testing, which fights the misuse of standardized tests.
<p>The 2015 K-12 Every Student Succeeds Act, the successor law to No Child Left Behind, provided for a pilot program to create more varied and valid assessments.</p>
<p>That is what the state chiefs talked about last Dec. 23 at the event hosted by the Council of Chief State School Officers, which brought together the leaders with Biden-Harris transition officials.</p>
<p>There were, according to participants, nearly unanimous calls for more opportunity to create assessments focused on “authentic learning” that can provide real-time information to direct student learning.</p>

<div><div><div>Truckers are overworked and overwhelmed, often confronting logjams.</div></div></div>
<div><div><div>Rail yards have also been clogged, with trains at one point backed up 25 miles outside a key Chicago facility.</div></div></div>
<div><div><div><h1>Inside America’s Broken Supply Chain</h1><h2>How industry failures to collaborate and share information left the system vulnerable </h2></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>David J. Lynch</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Updated Oct. 2 at 7:00 p.m.Originally published Sept. 30, 2021</div></div></div>
<p><mark><b>Reporting from Los Angeles and Joliet, Ill.</b></mark></p>
<p>The commercial pipeline that each year brings $1 trillion worth of toys, clothing, electronics and furniture from Asia to the United States is clogged and no one knows how to unclog it.</p>
<p>As Americans fume, supply headaches that were viewed as temporary when the coronavirus pandemic began now are expected to last through 2022.</p>
<p>[FAQ: Why inflation is rising and whether you should worry]</p>
<p>“It’s going to get worse again before it gets better,” said Brian Bourke, chief growth officer at SEKO Logistics. “Global supply chains are not built for this. Everything is breaking down.”</p>
<div><div><p>Port of Los Angeles</p></div></div>
<p>“From an economic point of view, it’s a disaster because cargo is waiting,” said Markus Grote, captain of a Hapag-Lloyd container ship.</p>
<p>[From ports to rail yards, global supply lines struggle amid virus outbreaks in the developing world]</p>
<p>“Information sharing and additional transparency is one of the few areas where indisputably we could get more capacity out of the current system,” said Dan Maffei, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.</p>
<p>“Our members are tired. Our members are feeling the pain of these covid deaths,” said Mike Podue, president of ILWU Local 63. “We’re lucky there hasn’t been a major accident.”</p>
<p>[The pandemic marks another grim milestone: 1 in 500 Americans have died of covid-19]</p>
<p>When the supply chain works, goods flow continuously, as if borne along by a river. Today, one bottleneck follows another. The problems are especially acute on the Asia-to-U.S. trade route.</p>
<p>Once a berth becomes available, longshoremen operating massive blue cranes lift the metal containers and position them to head inland via truck or train.</p>
<p>Ideally, a truck driver who has been alerted to the presence of a customer’s goods arrives at a terminal to find a chassis waiting. The container is then hoisted aboard and the driver pulls the chassis to the customer’s warehouse.</p>
<p>Even as cargo piles up on the docks, almost a third of the port’s night-shift appointments for truckers go unfilled.</p>
<p>At APM Terminals, the largest container site in the Western Hemisphere, the air echoes with truck horns, air brakes and the warning beeps of mobile cranes.</p>
<p>Steven Trombley, the facility’s managing director, needs the agility of a hockey goalie to ward off the daily complications. Today, his berths are full and four of the ships loitering in San Pedro Bay are impatient for a spot.</p>
<p>Trombley has nearly a week’s worth of truck chassis on the dock. But truckers are scarce. Such mismatches help explain why containers destined to travel by rail sit dockside for an average of eight days, up from two before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s a headache. Cargo is sitting here longer than planned,” Trombley said. “If I don’t get the cargo moving, then the next ship is not going to have space.”</p>
<p>With more money, the port could have expanded channels, fortified wharves and improved road and rail links, he said.</p>
<p>[West Virginia factory is center stage in supply chain crisis, showing economy’s strains]</p>
<p>Advocates of a rail link say it would eliminate from Southern California’s freeways thousands of daily truck trips and ease port congestion by moving millions of containers off the docks. But the railroads doubt the financial case.</p>
<p>The backlog got so bad last fall that port officials opened overflow lots to store thousands of containers.</p>
<div><div><p>APM Terminals, Los Angeles</p></div></div>
<p>At Pier S, on the other end of a harbor island from APM, about 7,300 containers and chassis are parked. Some have been sitting for almost three weeks.</p>
<p>One of the facility’s users is TRAC Intermodal, the nation’s largest chassis operator. CEO Dan Walsh, a wisecracking Australian, said current supply snags reflect Americans’ greater reliance upon e-commerce.</p>
<p>“They expect things to come faster, which puts pressure on everyone in the supply chain,” he said. “They also expect to be able to return things without cost.”</p>
<p>TRAC has spent $1 billion over the past decade upgrading its 180,000-vehicle fleet for what Walsh calls “the permanent whitewater of daily work.”</p>
<p>[U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods didn’t bring companies back to the U.S., new research finds]</p>
<p>That’s why the L.A. port exports three times as many empty containers as full ones.</p>
<p>National Tree, a maker of artificial Christmas trees, was able over the past three months to import only half as many containers as planned, CEO Chris Butler said.</p>
<p>“We had contracts to bring in all of our containers. Those contracts were not worth the paper they were written on,” he said.</p>
<p>Now, persistent cargo concerns are exposing the risks of ocean-spanning supply lines and hyper-efficient “just-in-time” production strategies that keep inventories and costs low.</p>
<p>Cargo carriers are offering expedited VIP service for truly desperate shippers, some of whom offer to pay any price to get their goods moving.</p>
<p>Craig Grosscart, SEKO’s senior vice president for global ocean, said one desperate shipper recently asked: “Do you take bribes?”</p>
<p>Others have pleaded to use helicopters to retrieve containers from vessels offshore.</p>
<p>[Washington Post Live: Supply chain issues have caused deliveries to take two or three times longer, says Ethel’s Bakery CEO]</p>
<b> </b>businesses in coming months will probably order more than normal to avoid being caught short again, further aggravating congestion, executives said.
<p>Asked to describe his current strategy, Seeler said: “We’re praying. That’s what we’re doing.”</p>
<div><div><p>Union Pacific rail yard, Joliet, Ill.</p></div></div>
<p>One of the main rail routes leaving the port leads to Union Pacific’s Global 4 facility in Joliet, which sprawls across the equivalent of 500 football fields.</p>
<p>The rail yard is essentially an inland version of the terminals in Los Angeles. Like an industrial Lego set, the lot is replete with towering walls of orange, green, white and blue containers.</p>
<p>At one point, trains trying to enter the yard were backed up for 25 miles.</p>
<p>“When things like this happen, the train can’t get loaded and we’re wasting hours of service,” said Thomas Moses, 49, a veteran locomotive engineer.</p>
<p>In July, Union Pacific took the extraordinary step of temporarily halting all trains arriving from West Coast ports. In Los Angeles, Seroka said he was informed of the decision just one or two days in advance.</p>
<p>But union representatives and regulators question the associated job cuts. Union Pacific’s 31,000-person payroll is more than one-third smaller than it was in 2015, part of a broader shrinkage across all major railroads.</p>
<p>Global 4 has reopened to incoming trains at 75 percent of its previous volume. A planned doubling of capacity, with the introduction of five massive new cranes, is scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>Union Pacific says it has reduced the number of stockpiled containers. Managers have compiled pandemic lessons into a crisis manual known as “the playbook” and are hiring again.</p>
<p>Ongoing efficiency studies aim at additional fine-tuning. Already, the railroad is installing uniform signage at all Union Pacific facilities, so that truckers will see familiar instructions no matter where they go.</p>
<p>“We’ve got it fluid,” said Drew Steinkamp, general manager of the Chicago service unit. “But we’ve got a constant volume coming at us.”</p>
<p>Alvaro Ramirez has learned to be patient. Sitting in his green-and-white Freightliner truck, stuck in line for hours at cargo depots, the veteran driver listens to Conan O’Brien comedy routines, self-help audiobooks and tai chi lessons.</p>
<p>“It helps me breathe and calm down,” said Ramirez. “I used to be a screamer.”</p>
<p>He had good reason. Ramirez is almost 2,100 miles from the Los Angeles port, where dozens of ships wait offshore. But he confronts the same dysfunction.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Ramirez, 44, could make seven round trips in an 11-hour workday. That number fell to just one or two, forcing him to switch to the less crowded overnight shift. Still, his earnings are down 20 percent.</p>
<p>At Road One Intermodal, which employs Ramirez and provides trucking services at nearly 90 ports and terminals, a truck was out of commission for more than two months while the company suffered its own supply chain woes, waiting for a new clutch.</p>
<p>“This is my 46th year in the business. I’ve never seen anything like this and it’s not easily resolved,” he said.</p>
<p>In July, when two of the nation’s largest railroads restricted shipments from the West Coast to their Chicago hubs, they reduced the backlog of containers jamming their facilities but made port congestion worse.</p>
<p>As space aboard freight trains grew scarce, shippers switched to trucks, driving over-the-road freight bills up by 85 percent compared to April 2020, according to DAT Solutions.</p>
<p>But many logistics companies are reluctant to add permanent capacity, fearing they will be caught with too many ships, trucks or chassis (the trailer-like frame that holds the containers) once consumer buying patterns return to normal.</p>
<p>“You don’t build a church for Easter and Christmas. You build it for the average week,” said Jason Hilsenbeck, president of Load Match, an equipment clearinghouse in Naperville, Ill.</p>
<p>[How the delta variant stole Christmas: Empty shelves, long waits — and yes, higher prices]</p>
<div><div><p>American Sale warehouse, Tinley Park, Ill.</p></div></div>
<p>The supply chain ends at Bob Jones’s door in Tinley Park, Ill., more than 7,700 miles from the Chinese port of Ningbo, where many of his products originate.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the cost of shipping one container to his 200,000-square-foot warehouse was less than $5,000. In late August, the bill hit $26,000.</p>
<p>Some of his containers sit for two or three weeks once they reach Union Pacific’s rail yard or a similar facility belonging to rival BNSF.</p>
<p>Jones passes some of the higher cost to consumers and absorbs some himself. Since Americans have stocked up on outdoor products during the work-from-home era, he makes up some of his losses on volume.</p>
<p>The uncertainty is his chief worry. Kinks in the supply chain mean he has summer products arriving now when summer is a memory on the shores of Lake Michigan. More out-of-season goods will reach the Midwest as the snow flies.</p>
<p>“We have a typical supply chain route. This year, there’ve been hiccups all along the way,” Jones said. “It’s not getting better. In fact, I would say it’s getting worse.”</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Angela Fritz</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 2, 2020</div></div>
<p>Not everyone experiences the same symptoms, and the order in which they appear can vary. Some people don’t show any symptoms — what health experts call “asymptomatic” cases — but still could spread the virus to others.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Fever, cough or shortness of breath</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fever, cough or shortness of breath are the highest-frequency symptoms of covid-19. According to a study of symptoms in about 11,000 adult covid-19 patients, at least one of these symptoms was reported in 93 percent of cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fever or chills</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A fever might be the first indication you have a covid-19 infection, according to a recent study that looked at the onset of symptoms.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fever itself can range from low-grade — maybe only a degree or two higher than normal — to dangerously high. A fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit is considered very high in adults and is a sign of a severe infection.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Cough</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so cough is a common symptom, and it can also appear early in the infection. A dry, persistent cough can be a red flag that you have covid-19.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Shortness of breath</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Along with the cough can come shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Covid-19 can sometimes cause pneumonia, according to Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pneumonia occurs when “air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms,” Galiatsatos writes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortness of breath caused by covid-19 can be mild or severe enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen or a ventilator.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Fatigue or muscle aches </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sometimes the only indication that you might have of a viral infection is a general sickly feeling, or what physicians call fatigue — a persistent exhaustion that isn’t solved by getting more sleep.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In extreme cases, people who have suffered from covid-19 describe having barely enough energy to walk to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a glass of water.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some people report muscle aches or general achiness for no other apparent reason.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fatigue and aches have also been reported by <a>so-called covid-19 “long-haulers,”</a> who continue to experience symptoms of the illness for weeks or months after becoming infected.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Headache</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Headache is the most common neurological symptom in covid-19.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other less-common neurological symptoms could include muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures and stroke, <a>according to Harvard Medical School</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Loss or distorted sense of smell or taste</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>The loss of smell or taste is typically linked to early symptoms of upper-respiratory infections — including previous coronavirus strains — because the virus damages olfactory bulbs that are involved in the sense of smell.</p></div>
<div><div><p>It appears to be more common for people who have covid-19, and it’s possible to <a>lose your sense of smell or taste</a> while experiencing no other symptoms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another possible symptom is a distorted sense of smell or taste.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The distortions are most common in people who are recovering from covid-19 and starting to get their smell back, according to Justin Turner, medical director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Smell and Taste Center.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Sore throat, congestion or runny nose</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>A sore throat, congestion or runny nose are less frequently associated with covid-19, but they still occur in enough cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added them to its list.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A runny nose was reported by about 7 percent of adult patients <a>in the study of symptom frequency</a>, while a sore throat was reported by 35 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It can be difficult to determine whether these symptoms are a result of covid-19 or something more benign, such as allergies.</p></div></div>
<a>would not trigger things such as a fever, muscle aches or chills</a>, according to Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19.
<div><div><h3><div>Stomach issues</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Studies have found that about half of coronavirus patients experience at least one gastrointestinal symptom, which can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>In the study of symptom frequency</a>, diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal-related symptom in adults, and abdominal pain was the least common.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Difference between covid-19 and the flu</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, infectious-disease doctors say <a>most people won’t be able to tell which illness they have</a>. Common warning signs for both include fever, cough, chills and shortness of breath.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Absent a loss of taste or smell, most patients will need a nasal swab to get a proper diagnosis.</p></div></div>

<div><p>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</p></div>
<h1>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</h1>
<h2>Omicron has sparked alarm among health experts worried about the new variant’s ability to spread rapidly and evade the body’s immune defenses. Scientists are racing to learn more as cases rise.</h2>

<div><div><p>The highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus has taken over as the dominant strain in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said omicron “is not something that can be avoided.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<a>milder infections</a> than other variants, public health experts say the sudden swell of cases and large number of people who remain unvaccinated could still overwhelm strapped health-care systems.
<div><p>How scary is omicron? Scientists are racing to find answers.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That said, much is still unknown about omicron, and U.S. leaders note that there are many more tools to combat the surge in cases than at the start of the pandemic.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>However, that research is underway, and in the meantime, experts say we can make an educated guess.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How long will vaccine immunity last?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal health authorities have not provided a definitive answer to this question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the real world, the protection should last quite a bit longer, though the length of time still needs to be determined with further studies, experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Your questions about coronavirus vaccines, answered</p></div>
<div><div><p>There are also certain factors that may influence how much protection they provide and for how long.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And it does not mean people with a stronger immune response will have more severe side effects from the shots or vice versa, <a>according to a recent survey by the British National Health System</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>Immunity</a> could also depend on what happens with future
<div><div><p>Although researchers do not yet have all the answers, previous knowledge of other coronaviruses, as well as emerging research about the current strain, may provide clues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can we extrapolate from what we know about natural immunity?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes.</p></div></div>
<a>immune responses</a> in people who have had covid-19 and illnesses from other coronaviruses, rather than in people who have been vaccinated, said Dbeibo, who is director of vaccine initiatives for Indiana University.
<div><div><p>“But vaccine responses should not be less reliable than in natural infection,” she added.</p></div></div>

<a>retained immunity that was robust after eight months</a>. That gives researchers a starting point in predicting how long immunity may last after vaccination, Dbeibo explained.
<div><p>All of that said, <a>antibodies will wane</a>. And although it is a gradual process, once antibodies decline to a level that is no longer protective, reinfection is possible. Still, the infection is likely to be milder, experts said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said memory B cells can even adapt quickly to a new variant, usually within days.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Even if antibody levels wane and <a>you get reinfected or you get infected with a variant</a>, the memory B cells — if you have enough of them — will respond very quickly and prevent that severe disease,” he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said covid-19 is severe right now because “adults are seeing this virus for the very first time and have no preexisting immunity.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>So what now?</div></h3></div></div>

<div><p>The CDC also said fully vaccinated people can gather indoors with those who are also fully vaccinated. And they do not need to quarantine, or be tested after exposure to the coronavirus, as long as they have no symptoms, the agency said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, applauded the advice but said it has taken too long for the CDC to tell an exhausted public when their masks can come off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The sooner we move to telling people if you’re fully vaccinated you don’t have to wear masks, that will be an incentive for people to get vaccinated,” Hotez said.</p></div></div>

<p>Small gatherings probably represent minimal risk — with the safest situations being for the fully inoculated to get together with one another in private settings, such as a dinner among vaccinated friends in their homes, the CDC says.</p>
<div><div><p>But risk increases as gatherings get larger, take place outside the home or include more unvaccinated people who may have come from places with <a>high rates of transmission</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Hotez and his wife are both fully vaccinated and traveled by plane this past weekend to visit their two oldest grown children, whom they had not seen in person in 14 months. One has been vaccinated, and the other was recently infected.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Like any kind of travel right now, taking a cruise comes with coronavirus risks. So does going to bars and restaurants in your hometown or gathering indoors with extended family <a>for the holidays</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>passenger and crew outbreaks</a>. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no-sail order for cruises in March 2020 accordingly. They have since allowed sailings to resume with coronavirus restrictions under a
<a>conditional sailing order</a> that is in place for all cruise ships operating in the United States (except for those in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis
<a>won a lawsuit</a> blocking the order). The CDC tracks which ships have reported cases — and which it’s investigating —

<a>made headlines</a> after it docked in New Orleans with at least 17 passengers and crew members infected with the
<a>coronavirus</a> (including one probable case of the omicron variant).
<a>Wexner Medical Center</a>, says of cruise lines. “Unfortunately, they just can’t do enough to mitigate that risk.”
<div><div><p>“All it takes is one first case," Gonsenhauser says. "The index case in an environment like that can lead to a superspreader situation, and the risks are just are just too high to accept the risk of that occurring.”</p></div></div>

<p>No numbers can fully convey the state of the covid-19 pandemic in the United States, but several metrics taken together provide a clearer view of what is happening now and what may be coming soon.</p>
<a>Department of Health and Human Services</a> (hospitalization and testing) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (vaccinations). Not all tracking sites use the same sources or report dates, so case and death numbers can differ.

<p>The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a warning: If cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. However, areas with little testing probably will appear to have fewer cases regardless of how rampant the virus may be.</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average is the best way to view trends in new cases, because more than half of states don’t report new data every day. That is why certain days of the week show up as consistently higher or lower than others.</p>
