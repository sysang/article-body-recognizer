<p>Stephen Curry began his journey to the top of the NBA’s all-time three-pointers list Oct. 30, 2009, as a 21-year-old rookie playing in his second career game.</p>
<p>Television broadcaster Gary Bender greeted the shot by calling Curry, the son of former NBA sharpshooter Dell Curry, “one of the pure shooters you’re ever going to see coming out of college.” Indeed.</p>
<p>“I obviously know I’m closing in, but I try not to let it creep into how you play,” Curry said last week. “You just enjoy the journey to get there. It does mean a lot to me.”</p>
<p>[Stephen Curry’s record-setting April scoring spree]</p>
<div><p>While Curry seemingly has plenty of high-level basketball ahead of him, he has reached summit in just his 13th season at age 33.</p></div>
<div><p>His rapid ascent is even more remarkable because he got a late start, compared with some of his peers, because he spent three seasons in college at Davidson.</p></div>
<div><p>Curry is five years younger than Allen was when he set the record.</p></div>
<div><p>Despite significant injuries in his third season and in 2019-20, he broke the record having played fewer than 800 games.</p></div>
<div><p>Curry has played 511 games fewer than Allen when he retired with 2,973 three-pointers.</p></div>

<a>reinstituted enhanced coronavirus health and safety protocols</a> and altered its roster rules to allow teams to cope with outbreaks by signing replacement players without impacting their salary cap or luxury tax payments.

<a>missing the Milwaukee Bucks’ past five games</a>. Here’s a preview of the five-game slate, ranked by watchability considering the many covid-related absences.

<div><h1>For both U.S. national soccer teams, it’s a massive year</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Goff</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:23 a.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 12:31 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams are accustomed to operating on separate timetables, their priorities set by World Cups and qualifying scrums that fall in different years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2022, however, the ambitions of American soccer’s flagship squads will overlap during a few vital months and carry enormous consequences.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By the end of March, a young men’s troupe nurtured by Gregg Berhalter will have booked a ticket to the World Cup late this year in Qatar — or flamed out for the second consecutive cycle.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Carlos Cordeiro, who left USSF amid equal-pay fight, wants his old job back</p></div>
<p>By the end of July, <a>the women’s team</a> — top-ranked for almost five years but undergoing renovations after another Olympic mishap — will have completed efforts to qualify for the 2023 World Cup and 2024 Summer <a>Olympics</a>.</p>
<a>Australia and New Zealand for the 2023 world championship</a> and a possible third consecutive title.
<a>and still haunted by the disastrous 2018 qualifying campaign</a> — the men cannot afford to stumble. The women have little to worry about, though transition is often imperfect.
<div><div><p>The 2022 mash-up is the result of pandemic-influenced scheduling changes to the men’s World Cup qualifying slate and sweeping changes to the women’s qualifying formats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With eight of 14 games out of the way, the Americans are in good standing. They sit <a>second in an eight-team group</a> offering three automatic berths in Qatar and an intercontinental playoff spot to a fourth country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They’re one point behind upstart Canada but also just one point ahead of both Mexico and Panama. The other four challengers are well back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given its personnel and resources, the United States should always finish first or second. Even with the youngest roster in history, that remains true.</p></div></div>
<a>the failure of a veteran squad to qualify for the 2018 World Cup</a>, is carrying a heavy burden.

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Liz Clarke</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:44 p.m. EST|Updated today at 4:02 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>NASCAR on Tuesday decided against approving a sponsorship based on the anti-President Biden slogan “Let’s go, Brandon,” according to a NASCAR official with direct knowledge of the deliberations.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From last week: NASCAR could red-flag sponsorship deal related to ‘Let’s go Brandon!’ chant</p></div>
<div><div><p>It wasn’t until Tuesday that NASCAR executives reviewed the sponsorship proposal and decided against it. NASCAR informed the team of its decision Tuesday afternoon.</p></div></div>
<p>Max Marcucci, a Washington-based crisis media strategist who represents the team, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating its position that the team followed the standard process for NASCAR approval of its proposed sponsorship and was granted it.</p>
<div><div><p>NASCAR offered no official comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But according to an official with direct knowledge of the process, NASCAR’s decision reflects no rescission or backtracking, given that the sponsorship had never been properly approved.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Wednesday, images of the red-white-and blue LGBcoin Chevrolet had been removed from the <a>team’s website</a> and replaced with a picture of a black No. 68 Chevrolet Camaro with a red “FOR SALE” sign on its hood.</p></div>
<p>NASCAR President Steve Phelps has prioritized diversifying the sport’s driver ranks and fan base; in 2020 he <a>banned displays of the Confederate flag</a> at NASCAR tracks, saying the sport must ensure that all feel welcome at its events.</p>
<div><div><p>Asked in December how he felt about NASCAR being associated with the “Let’s go, Brandon” chant, Phelps called it “unfortunate.”</p></div></div>
