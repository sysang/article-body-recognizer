<p>Jan. 6, 2021, was always on the country’s radar.</p>
<p>[The four-hour insurrection: How a Trump mob halted American democracy]</p>
<p>As the scene in D.C. <a>continued to darken</a>, smaller demonstrations across the nation also flared, forcing officials in several statehouses to evacuate.</p>
<p>This is how the day unfolded.</p>
<h3>Trump rallies his supporters as Congress convenes</h3>
<h3>Pro-Trump mob breaches Capitol, forces Congress to adjourn</h3>
<h3>Trump refuses to condemn violence as conflict intensifies</h3>
<p>Trump remained relatively quiet, even as the country called on him to make a statement that could end the chaos. Though he eventually told the mob to go home, he simultaneously expressed his love for the rioters and rationalized their feelings.</p>
<h3>After the Capitol is secured, Congress officially declares that Biden won the election</h3>

<p><a>Five people died</a> as a result of the Capitol breach, one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies. Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died Thursday night of unspecified injuries he suffered in the attack.</p>
<p>Trump eventually released a video Thursday evening, calling for calm and declaring he is now focused on a “smooth, orderly, seamless transition of power.” The very next morning, however, he sent another tweet:</p>
<p>Twitter <a>permanently suspended</a> Trump’s account around 6:20 p.m. Friday night for “incitement of violence.”</p>

<a><h2>How Jan. 6 — and Republicans — enabled Trump’s domination of the GOP</h2></a>
<p>Many top Republicans blamed Trump, and just as quickly moved on when that looked like the bad play. Meanwhile, Trump managed to avoid the fate that usually awaits presidential losers.</p>

<p>The president who didn't want his presidency to be focused on Trump suddenly took Trump to task.</p>

<p>Garland was predictably cautious, but amid questions about whether the Jan. 6 investigation might lead to higher places, he didn't exactly play down the possibility.</p>
<a><h2>Sean Hannity’s texts and the duplicity they reinforce</h2></a>
<p>Sean Hannity apparently knew about unrest in the White House over Trump's Jan. 6 campaign. He didn't share it — or even allude to it. And he has company.</p>
<a><h2>Ron DeSantis echoes Trump’s old too-much-covid-testing mantra</h2></a>
<p>Republicans declined to echo that particular portion of Trump's coronavirus response. But it's suddenly a focal point in Florida, where DeSantis cites "hysteria."</p>
<a><h2>We’ve reached the ‘Yeah, it was pretty much an attempted coup, so what?’ stage of the Jan. 6 probe</h2></a>

<li>The No. 1 Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), said, “There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking” the attack.</li>
<li>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Trump’s rhetoric about a stolen election had been “irresponsible” and “reckless.” He added that Trump “went way too far over the line.”</li>
<li>Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called on Trump to “quit misleading the American people and repudiate mob violence” and said Jan. 6 was “in part a result of” such misleading claims.</li>
<li>Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Trump’s call for protesters to march to the Capitol “was inciting.”</li>
<li>Even Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Jan. 7 that Trump had “recklessly encouraged” the events of the day.</li>
<div><div><p>GOP leaders thought they might be able to break with Trump, only to be proved very wrong. The lesson for all of them was that there’s virtually nothing Trump could do to lose the base, and they should act accordingly.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The fallout from Novak Djokovic’s safety-flouting Adria Tour exhibitions worsened Tuesday, when the world’s top-ranked tennis player disclosed he has become the fourth participant to test positive for the novel coronavirus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, 33, organized the Adria Tour to give himself and fellow pros a chance to compete after being idle since March, when the men’s and women’s pro tours were suspended.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But it has proved calamitous, resulting in at least six other positive tests: fellow players Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki; Djokovic’s wife, Jelena; Djokovic’s fitness coach; and Dimitrov’s coach.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The exhibitions were staged without following basic health and safety protocols to guard against transmission of the highly contagious virus, which has infected more than 9 million and <a>killed at least 472,000 worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic announced his positive result in a statement Tuesday morning, explaining that his family was tested upon returning to Belgrade after the tour stop in Croatia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My result is positive, just as Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative,” Djokovic wrote, adding that he intends to self-isolate for 14 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the court, there was no apparent effort to keep players from shaking hands or draping arms around one another following matches. And off the court, they danced and partied shirtless at a Belgrade nightclub.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia’s Nick Kyrgios was among the players who chose not to take part in the exhibition. He called it “boneheaded” Monday, after Coric became the second player to disclose his positive test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Also Tuesday, the remainder of the Adria Tour, which was to run through July 5 with a final stop in Bosnia, was canceled.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Liz Clarke</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>February 21, 2021 at 10:58 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>One day,<b> </b>Novak Djokovic’s dominance at the Australian Open will come to an end. Such is the reality of time — the opponent that champion athletes can stave off but never defeat.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Naomi Osaka, the bright star of women’s tennis, claims another Australian Open title</p></div>
<div><p>Djokovic’s dominance Sunday also underscored the gap that remains between the sport’s Big Three — Federer, Nadal and Djokovic — and younger rivals seeking to dethrone them, particularly at Grand Slam events.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Said Medvedev, 25, an astute tactician and delightful interview: “We are talking about some cyborgs of tennis — in a good way. They are just unbelievable.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The men’s championship match was contested before a raucous crowd of roughly 7,000 — about 50 percent of capacity under Australia’s strict <a>coronavirus</a> protocols — that sounded like a full house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic’s path to the final was rocky. He narrowly averted a third-round loss, pushed to five sets by American Taylor Fritz, and suffered an abdominal injury that he revealed Sunday was a muscle tear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he was all business Sunday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although Medvedev’s strokes and tactics are varied and typically clever, Djokovic gave him scant opportunity to show much of that, being the aggressor and dictating the terms on nearly every point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“During the match, I felt like I’m doing my best, but it’s not there,” Medvedev said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic lauded Medvedev as a great person and player who, he noted, would certainly win a Grand Slam. He also thanked his trainer for getting him ready to play, alluding to the abdominal tear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Government-mandated protocols were strict. Three planeloads of players and coaches were forced to quarantine in their hotel rooms for two weeks because a fellow passenger had tested positive upon landing in Australia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the trophy in hand, Djokovic acknowledged the work of Tennis Australia in staging the tournament amid such difficult circumstances, a notable concession given his earlier pushback against the strict protocols.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He saved his final thanks for Rod Laver Arena and the court on which he has claimed half of his 18 Grand Slam titles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I love you each year more and more,” Djokovic said during his post-match interview as the crowd cheered. “The love affair keeps going.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Two years ago, I proposed the idea of developing a scale for rating winter storms in Washington. Reader feedback on the concept was extremely positive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since then, I’ve been thinking about such a scale and began to design a model for it. Now, I’m pleased to roll out the first version of our Winter Storm Impact Scale.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several of Capital Weather Gang’s expert contributors helped with its development.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>CWG Winter Storm Impact Scale categories</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Category 1 — Nuisance storm: Untreated roads are slick. Possibility of school closings and delays.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Category 2 — Disruptive storm: Slick roads. School closings and delays likely. Possible adjustments to government operations. Some flight delays.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Category 3 — Significant winter storm: Snow-covered or glazed roads, some impassable. School closings very likely. Government operations likely altered. Flight delays and some cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Category 4 — Major winter storm: Many roads impassable or hazardous. School closings virtually certain. Altered or closed government operations very likely. Significant airport and mass transit disruptions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>How are the winter storm categories computed?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For every winter storm, we will calculate a score of up to 120 points based on the following variables:</p></div></div>
<li>Total accumulation of snow and ice.</li>
<li>Precipitation intensity.</li>
<li>Average temperature the day before precipitation begins.</li>
<li>Average temperature during precipitation.</li>
<li>Average temperature the day after storm ends.</li>
<div><div><p>But there are also many more factors that influence a storm’s effect in our region.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A storm can earn bonus points, potentially increasing its impact rating, if:</p></div></div>
<li>It is the first snow or ice event of the season (when people are not yet used to wintry precipitation)</li>
<li>Snow or ice coincides with a commute.</li>
<li>Snow or ice coincides with a big travel day (such as the day before Thanksgiving).</li>
<li>A flash freeze occurs after precipitation ends.</li>
<li>Strong winds appear after precipitation ends (causing blowing and drifting snow or power outages).</li>
<li>Snow is on the ground before the storm begins.</li>
<li>Snow is heavy and wet, or if ice accretion is significant, potentially stressing power lines.</li>
<li>Subfreezing temperatures persist for days after the storm, so the precipitation does not melt.</li>
<div><div><p>A storm can earn deductions, potentially decreasing its impact, if:</p></div></div>
<li>The sun angle is high (such as when precipitation falls during the day in March).</li>
<li>A majority of precipitation falls on a weekend or holiday.</li>
<li>There is a pause or lull in the precipitation for several hours during the storm.</li>
<li>The snow changes to sleet for several hours during the storm.</li>
<li>There is a temperature spike after the precipitation ends and it is well above freezing.</li>
<li>Temperatures in the days after the storm are well above freezing.</li>
<li>Frozen precipitation changes to rain.</li>
<div><div><p>For every storm, we will take all of this into account to develop the storm category based on the following point totals:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Category 1: 20-39</li><li>Category 2: 40-59</li><li>Category 3: 60-79</li><li>Category 4: 80-99</li><li><span>Category 5: 100+</span></li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We have calibrated and tested this scale using past winter weather events. For example, the Snowzilla blizzard, Jan. 22 and 23, was a Category 5. So was Snowmageddon, from Feb. 5 to 6, 2010.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This rating scale is a work in progress, and we will fine-tune it over time, learning from each storm.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We welcome feedback on this initial scale concept. If there are variables or circumstances not mentioned above that you think should be considered, please provide a comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Also, although we are initially calling this the Capital Weather Gang’s Winter Storm Impact Scale, we’re looking for a catchy acronym for this scale.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A leading candidate is WISE: Winter Storm Impact Scale for Everyone</p></div></div>

<h2>Senators said quick federal action prevented bankruptcies and saved hundreds of thousands of aviation jobs</h2>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Lori Aratani</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Michael Laris</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 15, 2021|Updated December 15, 2021 at 7:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Senators and top airline executives used an oversight hearing Wednesday to tout the results of a $54 billion bailout, saying taxpayers kept a critical industry from being crushed under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I know that we’re in a better place than where we would have been,” said committee chairwoman Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It worked,” added Southwest Airlines chief executive Gary Kelly.</p></div></div>
<a>Southwest</a> suffered well-publicized service disruptions this summer and fall, in part because of staffing issues.
<div><div><p>“PSP kept the airlines from collapsing entirely. PSP is the reason flight cancellations were limited to mere days and not months and years. And PSP is the reason ticket prices did not skyrocket,” Wicker said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While some executives previously acknowledged planning missteps, top executives Wednesday pointed to broader pandemic-driven challenges as a key reason for occasional disruptions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s difficult to get people to pick up extra time,” Parker said. “There is a global pandemic going on.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“With no demand, I can’t speak for everyone, but I’m certain most all of us would have shut down our airlines, furloughed everyone, waited for demand to return,” Parker said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passenger advocates said they were disappointed they weren’t included among the witnesses Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With general agreement among those asking and answering the questions on the rescue package, a host of broader and, at times, contentious questions peppered the proceedings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>United CEO Scott Kirby faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the airline’s decision to require employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We did this for safety,” Kirby said. “We believe it saves lives. That is my number one obligation, safety.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The exchange prompted Sen. Gary Peters, (D-Mich.) to urge people to get vaccinated. “I am tired of this pandemic,” he said. “I’m tired of what we are dealing with. We have a tool that works.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wicker brought up the issue of mask requirements on planes, asking the executives when passengers might be able to get rid of them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think the case is very strong that masks don’t add much, if anything, in the air cabin environment. It’s very safe, very high quality, compared to any other indoor setting,” Kelly said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Airlines were required to limit executive compensation as part of the rescue. They also
<b> </b>generally had to maintain a minimum level of air service along existing routes.
<div><p>Taxpayers spent billions bailing out airlines. Did the industry hold up its end of the deal?</p></div>
<div><p>Southwest Airlines president apologizes after days of cancellations, delays</p></div>
<div><div><p>John Laughter, executive vice president and chief of operations for Delta, said given the severity of the crisis, it was unrealistic to think carriers could keep the same number of workers employed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Laughter said more than 17,000 employees opted to take early retirement or departure packages, while more than 40,000 took voluntary unpaid leaves. The carrier posted a pretax loss of $12.4 billion in 2020, the largest in its history.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Like many carriers, Delta is now hiring thousands of workers as travel continues to rebound.</p></div></div>
<div><p>While domestic travel has continued to rebound, international passenger counts are still down sharply, a problem made more complex by uncertainties surrounding the omicron variant, which has dampened the enthusiasm of some travelers.</p></div>

<h2>Questions have emerged about what worked, and what didn’t, after one of Washington’s most powerful industries was propped up by federal money</h2>

<div><div><p>The bailout of U.S. airlines under Presidents Donald Trump and Biden was meant to stave off economic calamity and keep the nation’s aviation system alive through the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It included provisions, inspired by investing giant Warren Buffett, that supporters said could give Uncle Sam a piece of the upside when the ailing stocks of airline companies rebounded.</p></div></div>
<p>Buoyed by federal aid, planes kept flying as air travel plummeted by more than 90 percent. But after handing airlines tens of billions of dollars in grants, the value of stock deals struck on taxpayers’ behalf is not in Buffett’s league.</p>
<div><div><p>But nearly two years after the pandemic was declared,<b> </b>questions have emerged about what worked well, and what did not, after one of Washington’s most powerful industries was propped up by a vast U.S. bailout.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. airlines begin negotiations for coronavirus aid focused on front-line workers</p></div>
<b> </b>year in asking whether airlines have held up their end of the bargain with taxpayers. On Wednesday, the chief executives of major airlines will be summoned to Capitol Hill to testify on their performance.
<div><p>Some carriers<b> </b>have acknowledged planning missteps as passenger counts have grown to near pre-pandemic levels, but argue their companies were<b> </b>resilient against a relentless and unprecedented foe not of their making.</p></div>
<div><div><h4><div>‘Time is running out’</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>In March 2020, when there were no coronavirus<b> </b>vaccines and air travel was down 80 percent and falling, U.S. airlines warned of an employment apocalypse.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>to congressional leaders, warning that draconian furloughs were imminent without federal
<b> </b>action. Tens of billions of
<b> </b>“ensure that we can save the jobs of our 750,000 airline professionals.”
<div><div><p>It was a cry for help at a moment of national vulnerability. Fears of the coronavirus and economic collapse drove<b> </b>bipartisan support for a massive bailout.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But unlike with the multibillion-dollar bailout of General Motors under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the federal government did not take a major ownership stake in the airlines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The money was handed over with no expectation that the government would recoup its investment directly, as lawmakers were content with other benefits it provided.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Airlines sought financial assistance three times, including extensions of the Payroll Support Program in December 2020 and again in March as part of a far-reaching coronavirus aid package backed by Biden.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>receiving the money, airlines could not buy back
<b> </b>shares of their stock or pay shareholder dividends. They had to limit executive compensation and could not furlough workers involuntarily or reduce pay or benefits. They also
<b> </b>generally had to maintain a minimum level of air service along existing routes.
<div><div><p>The core of the industry’s argument that it needed federal grants came down to saving<b> </b>jobs, but the picture is more complex than it portrayed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The voluntary reductions were allowed under the bailout, but they<b> </b>would come back to hit customers as coronavirus vaccines became available and travel began to ramp up.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>canceled more than 900 flights in early July to better match its schedule with staffing levels. In August, Spirit Airlines
<b> </b>canceled thousands of flights in an episode that cost the company $50 million. In October, thousands of Southwest Airlines passengers were left stranded for days as the carrier scrambled to recover, later admitting that it was short-staffed.
<div><p>Less than two weeks after executives at American boasted during an earnings call that it had posted the best operational performance in the carrier’s history the previous month, it suffered a meltdown at the end of October.</p></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Drawing scrutiny on Capitol Hill</div></h4></div></div>
<a>oversight</a> of the aviation industry — to schedule a hearing Wednesday with airline officials over their use of bailout money.
<div><div><p>Reps. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Sam Graves (R-Mo.) said in the letter that while many factors might be at play, “travelers don’t care why their flight is delayed. They care just that it’s delayed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consumer advocates have their doubts. While airlines say they followed rules laid out under the Cares Act, Breyault said the industry managed to find ways around some elements, including limits on executive compensation.</p></div></div>
<a>gave bonuses</a> to managers whose pay had been reduced early in the pandemic.
<div><div><p>“Following the letter, but not the spirit, of the Cares Act is exactly the problem we’re worried about,” Breyault said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even so, union leaders say the Payroll Support Program was a win for workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A ‘healthy return’ hasn’t materialized</div></h4></div></div>
<b> </b>they could have better prepared for a severe drop in business. Taxpayers who aided airlines are entitled to receive a “healthy return,” Reed said early in the pandemic.
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Reed declined to say whether he was satisfied with how his provision has played out.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A federal appeals court on Tuesday scrutinized<b> </b>former president Donald Trump’s effort to keep White House documents secret from a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Who decides when it’s in the best interest of the United States to disclose presidential records? Is it the current occupant of the White House or the former?” Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Trump’s attorney.</p></div>
<div><div><p>When else in history has a former president had the “final say,” Jackson asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judge Patricia A. Millett noted that past Supreme Court decisions give more deference to the determinations of the sitting president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have one president at a time under our Constitution,” Millett said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Whatever the incumbent president says, goes?” Judge Robert Wilkins asked the lawyer for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “We don’t just flip a coin.”</p></div></div>
<b/>However the D.C. Circuit rules, the Supreme Court is likely to be asked to intervene.
<div><div><p>Trump’s lawyers have accused congressional Democrats of launching the probe to intimidate and harass him and his closest advisers in an effort untethered to any “valid legislative purpose.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The stakes in this case are high … It is naive to assume that the fallout will be limited to President Trump or the events of January 6, 2021,” Trump attorneys Jesse R. Binnall and Clark wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump White House records can be turned over to House Jan. 6 investigative committee, judge rules</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President,” Chutkan wrote, ruling that an ex-president’s residual right to withhold records from Congress after leaving office does not continue in perpetuity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chutkan said Trump failed to identify any personal “injury to privacy, property, or otherwise” that he would suffer from the production of records.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Read the opinion here</p></div>
<div><div><p>The D.C. Circuit blocked the imminent release of records and fast-tracked oral arguments for Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump’s legal strategy tested in fight with Congress over Jan. 6 records</p></div>
<div><div><p>All three appellate judges said Tuesday that Trump had failed to show what specific harm would come to him personally from the release of the initial set of documents Congress requested.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It would be astonishing for this court to override the current president and Congress,” Letter argued Tuesday. “These are key documents Congress should have and they should have them right now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nevertheless, Millett said Supreme Court precedent and congressionally approved statutes allow former presidents to challenge such determinations in court, and that a sitting president’s authority is not unlimited.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Attorneys<b> </b>for the House and the Justice Department have argued against any delay, which could run out the clock on the investigation before the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans hope to wrest control from Democrats.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The legal fight over Trump’s documents foreshadows similar fights over the House investigation as it has issued <a>at least 40 subpoenas, including those to former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Stephen Bannon trial set for July as defense promises legal brawl</h1></div>
<h2>Judge rejects bid to delay trial until just before next year’s midterm elections; defense vows to seek House, White House and Justice Dept. documents </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Spencer S. Hsu</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 3:33 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A federal judge on Tuesday set a July trial date for Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser indicted last month for refusing to testify before the Jan. 6 congressional committee.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>even if they are not relevant to his litigation — a move supported by news organizations citing First Amendment grounds.
<div><p>The big warning signal Stephen Bannon’s indictment sends</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a joint filing before Tuesday’s hearing, for example, the sides laid out diverging visions of how swiftly the case should move.</p></div></div>
<p>While reluctant to say he was splitting the difference, Nichols called an October trial “too slow” and an April date unrealistic, noting that whether the defense arguments “have merit or not, they still have to be decided.”</p>
<p>“Seven or eight months is still a long time in the arc of a criminal case,” Nichols said, but appropriate given how many pandemic-backlogged trials and Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants are ahead of Bannon on the judge’s calendar.</p>
<div><p>Who could have predicted the Capitol riot? Plenty of people — including Trump allies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Revealing such information otherwise would expose witnesses and congressional staff to public attack and could influence witnesses’ trial testimony by letting them know what others planned to say, Vaughn said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This case should be decided in the courtroom through this litigation, not in the media,” Vaughn said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Christian David Mandeville, 31, also must undergo mental health treatment and stay away from Switzerland’s embassy and ambassador in the nation’s capital, said U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The assault of a foreign diplomat in his home “is deeply concerning to the government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tara Ravindra said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mandeville, who is White, had grown agitated believing he was targeted by white supremacists because of his sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the Netherlands recently denied his request for asylum there, Vanegas said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Obviously what he did was wrong, but I don’t think it can be separated from his mental health crisis,” Vanegas said, calling Mandeville gentle, fragile and “vulnerable.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Contreras noted that no one was seriously injured during the incident, contrasting it with the violence against police allegedly committed by defendants before him who were charged in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In comparison to the hours and hours of January 6 footage I’ve watched of hand-to-hand combat, this doesn’t quite compare as far as the level of seriousness,” Contreras said.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The arguments came before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which again is reviewing whether to uphold a House Oversight Committee subpoena to Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA.</p></div>

<div><div><p>But Jackson said she was “worried about another separation of powers problem” — carving out long-lasting protections for presidents after they return to private life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We also have to worry about the president encroaching on the powers of the Congress,” Jackson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Srinivasan appeared to agree on that point: “You do have an executive branch and a legislative branch — but the person associated with this subpoena is neither of those.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>In an initial round of litigation, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta and another D.C. Circuit three-judge panel sided with the House. But the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2020 sent the case back to lower courts for further proceedings.</p></div>
<a>ruled</a> in a 7-to-2 opinion that congressional subpoenas seeking a president’s information must be “no broader than reasonably necessary” and returned the question to lower courts to work out the standard.
<div><p>House Democrats granted limited access to Trump financial records</p></div>
<div><div><p>However, Mehta found that the House could obtain records related to legislation regarding the Foreign emoluments clause, which bars presidents from accepting gifts from foreign nations, regarding his Washington hotel lease.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Committee therefore is not engaged in a baseless fishing expedition,” the judge decided.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Pelosi for example, McFadden wrote, predicted just before the 2020 election that under a new president “the world will see what [President Trump] has been hiding all of this time.”</p></div></div>
<p>McFadden found that claim was enough, given court precedent. As troubling as evidence of the House’s motivations might be, he wrote, the Ways and Means Committee need only state “a valid legislative purpose [and] it had done so.”</p>
<div><div><p>However, if Neal’s true intent were to evaluate the presidential audit program, he could do so without making Trump’s tax data public, McFadden warned.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The results appear to have flipped some judges’ sentencing tendencies, given their backgrounds. Chutkan is a former public defender, and McFadden is a former Justice Department official, prosecutor and police officer.</p></div></div>
<div><p>When prosecutors asked for a two-month home confinement sentence for a defendant from Oklahoma<b> </b>who climbed into the Capitol through a broken window and pleaded guilty to parading, McFadden instead gave her two months of probation.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think the U.S. attorney would have more credibility,” McFadden said, “if it was evenhanded in its concern about riots and mobs in this city.”</p></div></div>
<p>Chutkan stands out in exceeding government requests in seven of her eight cases so far, sentencing defendants who pleaded guilty to unlawful parading to prison terms of 14 to 45 days — above prosecutors’ requests for no time or 30 days.</p>
