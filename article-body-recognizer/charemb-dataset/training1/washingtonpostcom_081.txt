<div><div><p>The tradition-steeped Rose Bowl is considered the “Granddaddy of them all.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the hastily arranged Frisco Football Classic, which kicks off Thursday in the same stadium that on Tuesday hosted the Frisco Bowl, says far more about what’s driving the proliferation of postseason games.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a one-off, the Frisco Football Classic — which will pit North Texas (6-6) of Conference USA against Miami of Ohio (6-6) of the Mid-American Conference — will be canceled upon its conclusion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This season’s 42 bowl games set a record — up from 35 in 2011, 25 in 2001 and 18 in 1991.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, there’s no sign that the sport has hit a saturation point among fans, conference leaders or certainly residents of the Dallas exurb of Frisco, which bills itself as “Sports City USA.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The same can be said of ESPN, which broadcasts all but a handful of bowls and now owns and operates 18 of them (43 percent) via ESPN Events.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clint Overby, vice president of ESPN Events, called the creation of the Frisco Football Classic a win for all concerned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>CBS football analyst Jerry Palm agrees that 42 bowls isn’t too many, given the TV ratings for even mediocre matchups.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is something of a Christmas miracle that the Frisco Football Classic came together in a matter of weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is very much the definition of building it while you fly it,” said Overby, alluding to the challenges of the compressed timetable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The heavy logistical lifting fell primarily to Sean Johnson, executive director of the Frisco Bowl since its inaugural game in 2017, who was also named executive director of the Frisco Football Classic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to Overby, ESPN Events discussed the potential of adding the bowl game with its conference partners the morning of Nov. 30. On Dec. 2, the Football Oversight Committee granted the waiver.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For this set of facts and this timing, there wasn’t much pushback,” said Ty Halpin, director of Championships and Alliances for Division I football.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the 42nd bowl authorized but its name, date and venue yet to be announced, Palm dubbed it the “Mystery Meat Bowl” in updating his <a>CBS Sports.com bowl projections</a> that night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frisco’s Toyota Stadium, just 30 minutes north of Dallas, fit that bill. And Dec. 23 at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time was the best time slot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was hardly the only logistical hurdle that required an audible by Johnson, who had to orchestrate two bowls with a full-time staff of 1½ people, roughly 20 college interns and can-do Texas spirit.</p></div></div>
<p>“It has been a whirlwind, I’ll tell you that,” Johnson said at the end of a 20-hour day, detailing the frenzied effort to create a second website for ticket sales as well as distinct Twitter and Instagram accounts for the new bowl.</p>
<div><div><p>Though finding sponsorship wasn’t Johnson’s top priority, ESPN announced Dec. 15 that a Dallas-based tax services and software provider had signed on, making it the Frisco Football Classic presented by Ryan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given that it will be the game’s first and last edition, whoever tallies the most touchdown passes, rushing yards and tackles Thursday afternoon is assured of being a bowl record holder for all time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Johnson and his crew, the metric of success is more modest yet equally meaningful in his view.</p></div></div>

<a>cancellation of the Hawaii Bowl</a> after
<a>an outbreak on the Hawaii Warriors’ roster</a>. That followed Wednesday’s announcement that Texas AM
<a>was withdrawing from the Dec. 31 Gator Bowl</a>, unable to field a team given its own coronavirus spread and plague of injuries. Rutgers, with a 5-7 record,
<div><div><p>“Bowls are working directly with the conferences to manage protocols based on their local area and conference/team protocols,” NCAA spokesman Chris Radford wrote in an email.</p></div></div>
<a>a pause in the NHL season</a>, the rescheduling
<a>of some NFL games</a> and the postponement or cancellation of several NBA and college basketball games — is a disjointed, ad hoc set of protocols at the more than 40 bowl games.
<div><p>CFP committee’s new coronavirus policy could lead to forfeits or a vacated championship</p></div>
<div><div><p>That’s because the NCAA has nominal authority over bowls, which are run by conferences and independent bowl owners, whether nonprofit or for-profit entities such as ESPN Events.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The NCAA’s role in those games is largely symbolic, chiefly “certifying” that each bowl meets minimal standards for operations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, more than three dozen other bowls are following a combination of local and conference requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Further confounding matters, the NCAA set protocols for the Football Championship Subdivision championship game Jan. 8 in Frisco, Tex., between Montana State and North Dakota State, and the preceding playoff games.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s because the NCAA runs the FCS championship in the same way it runs the national championships of every varsity sport other than major college football.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As of Thursday, the NCAA isn’t ramping up the testing protocols it has mandated all season, according to Greg Johnson, another NCAA spokesman.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The medical staff onsite will conduct the tests, and the NCAA will cover the expense.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron is wreaking havoc, but the NBA is determined not to break</p></div>
<div><div><p>Different schools interpret that in different ways.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Michigan already had planned a mass vaccination for players, coaches and staff to get booster shots the day before they left for Florida in advance of their Dec. 31 semifinal against Georgia.</p></div></div>
<a>Alabama trouncing Ohio State</a> before a limited crowd of roughly 15,000 (20 percent of normal capacity) at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Sam Houston State was crowned the 2020-21 FCS champion — but not until mid-May, after FCS conferences shifted football from a fall to spring sport.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That CFP revenue is <a>projected to triple</a> if the playoffs are <a>expanded to a 12-team format</a>, as expected.</p></div></div>

<p>The ACC’s revised policy provides greater flexibility for those who test positive and must isolate. It came after three ACC teams announced Sunday that they were forced to withdraw from their bowl games because of virus-related complications.</p>
<a>with 96 positive tests</a> among its players.

<div><div><p>The latest updates to the ACC’s Medical Advisory Group report, which since July 2020 has guided the conference’s protocols regarding covid, were <a>posted</a> on the conference’s website Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ACC’s revision followed <a>updated guidance issued from the CDC</a>. The agency on Monday shortened the recommended time that infected Americans should isolate from 10 days to five if they are asymptomatic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ten ACC schools earned bowl berths this season, but three have been forced to withdraw, scuttling two bowl games in the process, because of outbreaks on their roster. News of all three ACC withdrawals came Sunday.</p></div></div>
<a>withdrawing from the Fenway Bowl</a> against SMU in Boston because of covid-related complications, and the game was canceled. The Military Bowl
<a>also was canceled</a> after Boston College announced it couldn’t field a team to face East Carolina in Annapolis.

<a>previously announced</a> that playoff matchups, including the title game Jan. 10, could be canceled and a vacated championship is possible if teams are unable to compete because of virus issues.
<a>from 10 days to six</a>, as long as they are asymptomatic and meet other testing standards, per the Associated Press. The NFL and its players’ union
<a>scrambled airline travel</a>, with thousands of domestic flights canceled over Christmas weekend because of staffing shortages as infected employees isolate.
<a>vary</a> because they are determined by conferences and local health policies, not the NCAA. Amid the omicron surge, that setup has led to a disjointed, ad hoc set of rules and guidelines that could be revisited as bowl season unfolds.

<div><div><p>Around noon Eastern time Tuesday, the UCLA football Twitter account posted “it’s GAMEDAY! #GoBruins.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Roughly four hours later, an update followed: UCLA was withdrawing from the Holiday Bowl “due to COVID-19 protocols within the Bruins’ program.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Such is the volatility bordering on chaos afflicting the college bowl season amid a nationwide surge of the highly contagious omicron variant, which is now the dominant form of the <a>coronavirus</a> in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Holiday Bowl became the fifth bowl game to cancel because of covid-19 complications.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And N.C. State became the fourth ACC team — among the conference’s 10 that earned bowl bids this season — to miss its bowl game because of protocols designed to limit the spread.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Liz Clarke</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 10:08 a.m. EST|Updated today at 10:35 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The NASCAR driver whose victory in a second-tier race last fall inadvertently spawned a coded vulgar insult of President Biden unveiled a plan to compete next season in a car sponsored by a cryptocurrency that has been spun off the phrase.</p>
<div><div><p>NASCAR must approve all racecars’ sponsors and paint schemes. According to a NASCAR employee familiar with the governing body’s deliberations, it has not yet approved the LGBcoin sponsorship.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A NASCAR official with direct knowledge of the matter reiterated that the governing body has not decided yet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Based on previous comments by NASCAR President Steve Phelps, who has led efforts to make stock-car racing more inclusive, the racing body could be hesitant to approve the divisive message, however coded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Political analyst Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, encouraged NASCAR to reject the plan.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How ‘Let’s go Brandon’ became an unofficial GOP slogan</p></div>
<div><div><p>Phelps, asked during a season-ending news conference how he felt about NASCAR being associated with the “Let’s Go Brandon!” chant, called it “unfortunate.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Phelps added that NASCAR would block any instance in which the phrase was used in conjunction with NASCAR’s logo or trademarks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NASCAR’s top series has had just two black full-time drivers. Can Bubba Wallace change that?</p></div>
<div><div><p>James Koutoulas, founder of Typhon Capital Management and the investor behind the coin, called Brown an exemplar of perseverance and “truly America’s Driver.”</p></div></div>
<a>tweeted</a> a photo with the caption: “It’s not a phrase, it’s a movement! #LGB.”
<div><div><p>Brown has been less explicit about his own views.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m also no longer going to be silent about the situation I find myself in, and why millions of Americans are chanting my name,” Brown wrote. “I hear them, even if Washington does not.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Corporate sponsorship is the lifeblood of auto racing because prize winnings don’t come close to covering the costs of fielding even moderately competitive cars.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As Brown noted in his Newsweek commentary, “In my world, there is no car to drive without the sponsors.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under that economic model, NASCAR’s racecars serve as rolling billboards designed to capture the attention of ticket holders and TV viewers as they whiz by at nearly 200 mph.</p></div></div>
<a>has allowed NRA billboards trackside</a> but drew the ire of gun-rights activists in 2019 for rejecting ads from makers of assault rifles.
<a>triggered a backlash</a> among some supporters by extending that in June 2020 to a ban on fans’ displays of the Confederate flag in its grandstands and infields.

<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic used two exclamation points and an emoji of a flexed biceps Tuesday in announcing that he had been granted an exemption from coronavirus vaccination, enabling him to defend his Australian Open title.</p></div></div>
<a>Federer previously announced he won’t play</a>, but Nadal will, having already arrived in Australia to begin preparations. The tournament begins Jan. 17.
<div><div><p>Djokovic isn’t the only player to have been granted a medical exemption. Tournament officials acknowledged that “a handful” of others had but declined to say how many.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While Djokovic supporters cheered the news, the pushback was swift and strong from other quarters in the sport.</p></div></div>
<p>British doubles specialist Jamie Murray, asked his opinion of the decision <a>during a news conference at the ATP Cup in Sydney</a>, said, “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated, I wouldn’t be getting an exemption.”</p>
<a>One Twitter user asked</a> whether he could “swing an exemption for all the unvaccinated teachers, police officers, nurses…” Earlier this week,
<a>Victoria reported</a> 8,577 new coronavirus cases, passing the previous peak of 7,442 on Jan. 1.
<p>Oliver Brown, chief sportswriter for Britain’s Telegraph, argued that the decision showed Australia’s hard-line covid-19 protocols didn’t apply to the rich and famous and predicted widespread resentment toward Djokovic as a result.</p>
<a>tweeted</a>: “After everything Victorians have been through, Novak Djokovic getting a vaccine exemption is nothing short of a kick in the guts. All those lockdowns, all that suffering. Seriously?”
<div><div><p>Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said the criteria for evaluating applications for medical exemptions were “fair and independent.” Personal information was redacted from the application process.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Liz Clarke</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:44 p.m. EST|Updated today at 4:02 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>NASCAR on Tuesday decided against approving a sponsorship based on the anti-President Biden slogan “Let’s go, Brandon,” according to a NASCAR official with direct knowledge of the deliberations.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From last week: NASCAR could red-flag sponsorship deal related to ‘Let’s go Brandon!’ chant</p></div>
<div><div><p>It wasn’t until Tuesday that NASCAR executives reviewed the sponsorship proposal and decided against it. NASCAR informed the team of its decision Tuesday afternoon.</p></div></div>
<p>Max Marcucci, a Washington-based crisis media strategist who represents the team, issued a statement Wednesday reiterating its position that the team followed the standard process for NASCAR approval of its proposed sponsorship and was granted it.</p>
<div><div><p>NASCAR offered no official comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But according to an official with direct knowledge of the process, NASCAR’s decision reflects no rescission or backtracking, given that the sponsorship had never been properly approved.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Wednesday, images of the red-white-and blue LGBcoin Chevrolet had been removed from the <a>team’s website</a> and replaced with a picture of a black No. 68 Chevrolet Camaro with a red “FOR SALE” sign on its hood.</p></div>
<p>NASCAR President Steve Phelps has prioritized diversifying the sport’s driver ranks and fan base; in 2020 he <a>banned displays of the Confederate flag</a> at NASCAR tracks, saying the sport must ensure that all feel welcome at its events.</p>
<div><div><p>Asked in December how he felt about NASCAR being associated with the “Let’s go, Brandon” chant, Phelps called it “unfortunate.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Liz Clarke</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:02 p.m. EST|Updated today at 7:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Until Monday, when a federal court is expected to end the diplomatic incident that has taken on circuslike theatrics, Djokovic must remain in the hotel.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tennis star Novak Djokovic draws renewed attention to Australia’s ‘detention hotels’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Monday’s hearing will be held one week before the tournament’s Jan. 17 start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic was detained at Melbourne’s airport overnight Wednesday as Australian border officials reviewed his visa and qualifications for a medical exemption to Australia’s strict covid vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was one of “a handful” among 26 applicants granted an exemption by Tennis Australia and the government of the state of Victoria to compete in the tournament.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rationale for Djokovic’s exemption, which was granted in consultation by medical authorities who reviewed applicants without knowing their identity, was a previous covid infection, <a>the Guardian reported</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Australia’s national standard for medical proof that a visitor to the country cannot be vaccinated, which is enforced at the border, is higher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has acknowledged contracting covid in summer 2020, after taking part in a short-lived exhibition he staged in Serbia and Croatia amid minimal precautions. It is unclear if he contracted covid more recently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With 20 Grand Slams and the men’s record-holder for weeks atop the world ranking, Djokovic, 34, is quite possibly the greatest to ever play tennis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two qualities in particular set the 6-2, 170-pound Djokovic apart:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A fanatical adherence to a strict gluten-free diet and a program of stretching and exercise that has transformed his otherwise unremarkable physique (much like Tom Brady) into a purpose-built, pliable winning machine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the foot speed, reach and flexibility to blast winners even if badly out of position, he covers virtually every inch of the court, sapping opponents’ will in the process.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And he has mastered the mental game, whether that means summoning his best when most players would be at their breaking point or breaking the momentum of unfavorable spells with a bathroom break or call for a trainer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>None of these attributes was bestowed. They are not gifts, but the product of relentless work.</p></div></div>
<p>Djokovic has been chasing tennis perfection since childhood — the past two decades, in the form of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, champions who are elder by five-plus years, in the case of Federer, and 11 months, in the case of Nadal.</p>
<div><div><p>But Djokovic has yet to close the gap in fans’ affection. He has been forever a third wheel in the sport’s love affair with Federer and Nadal.</p></div></div>
<a>straight-sets loss to Daniil Medvedev in the U.S. Open final</a> — Djokovic wept with a pathos that won hearts.

<div><div><p>As the United States hurtled toward new coronavirus pandemic records on Thursday, experts debated the utility of some long-standing metrics to measure the impact of covid-19.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Omicron is unlikely to be the coronavirus’s last variant of concern, World Health Organization officials said Thursday, noting the virus will continue to mutate as it circulates.</p></div></div>
<p>Speaking during a news briefing, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said there is “still a lot of energy in this virus.” When the delta variant emerged, he said, some scientists wondered how it could adapt further when it had become so fit.</p>
<div><div><p>“And yet, we’ve seen a further variant emerge that is even more transmissible than delta, which was itself more transmissible than previous variants,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging-disease and zoonosis unit, said the question is what kinds of mutations happen in the future — and what their effect on the severity of the virus will be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no inevitability that the next variant will be less severe or more severe,” she said. “We just have to see what happens as this virus evolves.”</p></div></div>

<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, patients who have been more recently infected appear less likely to be hospitalized or put in intensive care, according to preliminary studies.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>even when accounting for vaccination status, according to
<a>a recent study</a> done by researchers from Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine.
<div><div><p>But even with less severe symptoms, the increase in the number of covid-19 patients can still overwhelm hospitals and result in more patients with serious illness, <a>health experts say.</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael E. Miller</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 24, 2021 at 1:43 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have to break this cycle,” Morrison said of states going in and out of lockdown. “This groundhog day has to end.”</p></div></div>
<a>drop quarantine restrictions</a> for some travelers and is preparing further easing. And it may not be the last, as New Zealand also reckons with a
<div><p>A goofy paper horse became an Australian pandemic sensation. Now he’s going in a museum.</p></div>
<a>covid zero</a> became something of an article of faith. For much of the past year, the country was
<b> </b>largely united behind the idea. Australians accepted snap lockdowns and two-week stints in hotel quarantine in an effort to eliminate the virus. And they shared in the success of a
<a>near-normal lifestyle</a> envied around the world.
<div><div><p>Yet, that unity has started to fray in recent weeks as fissures have opened between regions where <a>coronavirus</a> has taken root and those that remain relatively covid-free.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Sydney, where a single case in mid-June has swelled to around 750 per day in the past week, state officials now stress living with the virus instead of eliminating it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For states with few or no infections, however, isolation still sounds pretty good.</p></div></div>
<div><p>New Zealand’s first coronavirus case in six months sends country into lockdown</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Western Australia, which reported zero cases Monday, Premier Mark McGowan has said his plan is still to “crush and kill” the virus, not live with it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And in Queensland, where there were two new cases Tuesday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she may not open her state’s border with New South Wales even after the country hits a nationally agreed vaccination threshold.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Palaszczuk said the “goal posts have changed” since then with Sydney’s outbreak obliterating the 30-case scenario envisioned by the plan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Now there are thousands,” Palaszczuk said Monday. “This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks. This is uncharted territory.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The institute whose modeling underlies the four-phase plan <a>insists</a> hundreds of cases a day aren’t a hurdle to safely reopening at 70 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison has warned state and territory leaders against backing out of their “deal with the Australian people,” while his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has threatened to withhold some federal assistance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the state premiers aren’t the only ones to raise questions about the national plan. So, too, have some <a>epidemiologists</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Locked-down Australia needed an Olympic lift. Now for the covid comedown.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not based on logic,” said Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and World Health Organization adviser. “It’s based on a model and models are often fraught with assumption problems.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among those problems, she said, is that the plan does not take into account the more-infectious delta variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The plan also means the nation could reopen when pockets — including more vulnerable <a>Indigenous communities</a> — remain undervaccinated, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>McLaws had advocated shutting down Sydney as soon as the first case of delta appeared in June. Instead, the premier waited 10 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With cases showing little sign of coming down, McLaws said she and Berejiklian agreed on one thing: Australia’s covid zero ambitions are over.</p></div></div>

<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>

<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<a>hold accountable all those responsible</a> for the Jan. 6 riot — whether they were at the U.S. Capitol or committed other crimes surrounding the day’s events.

<a>announced last week</a> that they have charged more than 725 people with assault, resisting arrest and other crimes in the events of Jan. 6, 2021. About 165 people have pleaded guilty, the U.S. attorney’s office said.
<div><div><p>President Biden on Thursday <a>squarely blamed</a> former president Donald Trump for the Capitol riot and accused him of continuing to propagate falsehoods and stoke unrest over the past year.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But on the eve of the first anniversary, Cruz again acknowledged the events of Jan. 6 in a Senate Rules Committee hearing.</p></div></div>

<p>Amid the pushback from Carlson and Bannon on Cruz’s comments, Rove wrote in an opinion piece for the <a>Wall Street Journal</a>, headlined “Republicans’ Jan. 6 Responsibility,” that the GOP has a duty to condemn the riot.</p>
<div><div><p>“You’re making us think, maybe the Republican Party is as worthless as we suspected it was. That can’t be true,” Carlson concluded. “Reassure us, please, Ted Cruz.”</p></div></div>

<p>New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof is considering a Democratic bid for Oregon governor, saying in a statement Monday that friends have been urging him to run and that his home state needs “someone with leadership and vision.”</p>
<div><div><p>News that Kristof is considering a gubernatorial bid <a>was first reported Sunday</a> by Willamette Week. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) is term-limited, and the 2022 Democratic primary field is wide open.</p></div></div>
