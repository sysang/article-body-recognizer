<p>Coronavirus case rates are at record levels in D.C., Maryland and Virginia as the <a>highly contagious omicron variant</a> becomes the predominant variant in the country. </p>Jump to metric:
<a>relaxed restrictions</a> on gatherings and the spread of the
<a>highly contagious delta variant</a>, largely among pockets of unvaccinated people. They plateaued in September — a testament to
<a>the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines</a>, experts say — before ticking up again in early November.
<a>highest seven-day averages of new cases</a> at any point since the pandemic began in early 2020, fueled in part by the omicron variant. Leaders — including
<a>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R)</a> and the county executives of
<a>Prince George’s</a> and Baltimore — have themselves tested positive for coronavirus.
<p>Coronavirus-related deaths, which often lag caseloads by several weeks, have so far not been rapidly increasing.</p>

<a>rapid testing and vaccine mandates</a> has continued amid virus outbreaks at schools. In mid-December, Prince George’s public schools announced that
<a>all classes would be virtual</a> through mid-January because of the viral surge. And on Dec. 29, D.C. Public Schools announced that it would
<a>require a negative coronavirus test</a> for students and staff returning from the winter holidays.

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Timothy Bella</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 2:03 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Peters had no idea what awaited him when his flight from San Francisco landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was kind of scary,” Peters told WTOP. “We didn’t have any food or water.”</p></div></div>
<a>told WRC</a>. “I have no say in which way the Uber goes.”
<div><div><p>After he disputed the charges, Uber announced Wednesday that it was giving Peters a refund for “this terrible ordeal.” The company noted that the driver’s pay would not be affected by the refund.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have refunded Mr. Peters and greatly appreciate his patience,” the company said in a statement. “We’re glad that he and the driver got home safely.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s unclear how many other Uber riders stuck in the I-95 closure also received refunds from the app. Peters did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p></div></div>

<div><p>I-95 reopens in Virginia after winter storm forced closure that stranded motorists</p></div>
<div><p>The interstate in Virginia, which is already known for gridlock, <a>reopened </a>Tuesday evening. Highway crews spent earlier this week clearing interstate off-ramps and towing dozens of vehicles that were abandoned or ran out of gas.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We hopped on the first exit and then … we stopped moving right there. There were cars behind us. There was nowhere to go,” Peters said to WRC. “It was like being in some weird parking lot.”</p></div></div>
<a>website </a>how “heavy traffic may cause your trip to take longer than expected and to compensate your driver for the additional time, your fare may change.”
<div><div><p>Peters refused to pay the fee, but initially struggled this week to get a hold of anyone at the company who could do anything about the $600 bill.</p></div></div>
<a>WTOP</a>. “So that was a little frustrating. And because it isn’t a person — that’s just [the] app saying those types of things, so I wasn’t able to get anybody on the phone.”
<div><div><p>Even with the refund, Peters emphasized to WRC a new lesson he learned that might come in handy during horrific winter storms: “Don’t take Uber in the snow.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Donna St. George</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:00 a.m. EST|Updated today at 7:08 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>One hundred and fifteen more public schools in Montgomery County hit the “red” level of coronavirus infections Wednesday night, following a remarkable one-day jump in cases throughout Maryland’s largest school system.</p></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, those schools opened for classes anyway, with students and teachers turning out for a regular school day — and some quietly worrying about attending classes as the highly contagious omicron variant rages.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The morale is very low among staff,” said Dominique Parker, a teacher at Wootton High School. “We know there are all of these red schools, but we have no word from MCPS as to any sort of plan.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Montgomery school system leaders said they would consult with county health officials to evaluate whether to move all the schools to 14 calendar days of virtual instruction.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But for Thursday, only the first 11 schools from Tuesday were in virtual-learning mode. School officials said late in the day Thursday that at-home test kits would be given to families at the other 115 schools no later than Monday.</p></div>
<div><p>Eleven Montgomery County schools hit ‘red’ covid levels, move online</p></div>
<div><div><p>At many of those 115 schools newly designated as red, 6 to 9 percent of students and staff tested positive, higher percentages than in the initial group.</p></div></div>

<div><p>D.C.-area parents and teachers split over return-to-school plans</p></div>
<div><p>Almost as quickly as the expanded color-coded list of schools was released Wednesday night, debate began about what it should mean. Some worried about a possible overreporting of positive cases and others about possible underreporting.</p></div>
<div><p>D.C. required negative coronavirus tests to return to school. Did it work?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Lyric Winik, president of the PTSA at Bethesda Chevy Chase High School, sharply criticized school system leadership Wednesday night, saying in a letter to school families that they had mismanaged the current situation.</p></div></div>
<a>Coronavirus infections have climbed </a>across the D.C. region, surpassing 2 million. The seven-day average of new daily cases is up 69 percent in Virginia and 42 percent in Maryland, and down 6 percent in D.C., as of Thursday, according to
<a>a Washington Post tracker</a>.
<div><div><p>The test positivity rate in Montgomery County is 27 percent, according to <a>state data</a> — more than 25 times what it was in the summer and more than eight times what it was in early December.</p></div></div>

<div><p>“With DCPS, even though sometimes they’re delayed on some things, when they do get it right, it’s right,” Robinson said. “I feel like they should have done it at the beginning of the school year.”</p></div>
<b> </b>left many parents struggling to upload their results.
<div><p>As of Thursday morning, approximately 39,000 of the system’s 50,000 students had returned their results, <a>according to officials</a>. Families reported 2,189 positive coronavirus cases; 672 staff members said they were infected.</p></div>
<a>about 7,000 staffers</a>, but 9,200 test results were uploaded from this group.
<div><div><p>DCPS representatives did not answer a request to explain these inconsistencies.</p></div></div>
<a>failed intermittently</a> Tuesday and Wednesday, DCPS sent out an email to parents advising them that students could bring a screenshot of their negative result or a signed note certifying that their result was negative.
<p>Washington Teachers’ Union President Jacqueline Pogue Lyons said she did not believe that was a fair complaint, given the union’s push to require testing before students entered the building and to certify proof of the results.</p>
<div><div><p>Some teachers told The Post on Thursday that staff and student attendance was low at their schools and that they could not teach their normal lessons. But teachers also expressed relief.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There have just been a few concerns, a few glitches,” Lyons said early Thursday afternoon, before the school day ended, “but I haven’t heard anything overall that’s concerning.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s good, but I think they need to physically see them take the test,” Robinson said Thursday morning. “I’m just hoping people are honest.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trivoria Ballard, 33, walked with her children to Tubman Elementary. She had taken her six children to their doctor’s office so they could get PCR tests, but those results take longer and her four Tubman kids needed a rapid test.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I just feel like it’s too much,” Ballard said. “Why go through all of this to get the kids tested to see who’s positive or who’s negative? Why not have them just be virtual?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was awesome,” Willis said. “She was tested and in the classroom within 15 minutes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For example, with my youngest, her teacher makes her put her mask on while she’s chewing her food,” he said. “Which is absurd!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If anything,” McGilly said, “you get more attention when there’s fewer kids around.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I expect that there were probably a hundred different ways to get kids in the building, and I’m looking forward to figuring out what worked,” Bowser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In response, the school system <a>announced</a> in October it would spend $22 million to equip each campus with a full-time substitute teacher and a coronavirus response coordinator.</p></div></div>
<a>letter shared </a>by D.C. Council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4).
<div><div><p>The next challenge for the district is likely to come next week when more students are expected to show up for classes, said Richard Jackson, head of the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level school leadership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower attendance numbers reported by some school leaders Thursday, he said, made it easier to test students who showed up at schools without proof of a negative test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Monday will be the real day where they’ll see if their systems really work,” Jackson said.</p></div></div>

<p>No numbers can fully convey the state of the covid-19 pandemic in the United States, but several metrics taken together provide a clearer view of what is happening now and what may be coming soon.</p>
<a>Department of Health and Human Services</a> (hospitalization and testing) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (vaccinations). Not all tracking sites use the same sources or report dates, so case and death numbers can differ.

<div><h3>Cases in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average case rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>

<p>The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a warning: If cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. However, areas with little testing probably will appear to have fewer cases regardless of how rampant the virus may be.</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average is the best way to view trends in new cases, because more than half of states don’t report new data every day. That is why certain days of the week show up as consistently higher or lower than others.</p>
<div><h3>Covid-related deaths in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average death rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>

<p>Health officials believe the virus has killed more people than state totals indicate, especially early in the pandemic before testing and effective treatments were widely available.</p>
<p>A rise in deaths usually follows a rise in new cases by about a month. For example, after the delta variant caused a surge of new cases beginning in July 2021, the death toll began to climb in August.</p>
<p>As with the new cases chart, occasional single-day anomalies reflect one-time adjustments by states. They are noted but not included in the seven-day averages.</p>
<div><h3>Hospitalizations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Reported covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Currently hospitalized</div><div> Filled ICU beds</div></div></div>
<p>A rise in hospitalizations tends to follow a rise in new cases by a couple of weeks.</p>
<div><h3>Vaccinations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Doses of covid-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Reported doses administered per day</div></div><div>See more detailed vaccination statistics for each state in the Vaccine Tracker.</div></div>
<p>The vaccine rollout beginning in December 2020 was limited and chaotic, but free vaccines are now widely available and recommended for everyone age 5 and older. The CDC also recommends booster shots for many people.</p>
<p>Note: Fully vaccinated shows people who have completed vaccination, either through both doses of a two-dose vaccine, or a single dose of a one-dose vaccine.</p>
<div><h3>Tests reported</h3></div>
<div><h4>Tests reported per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Positive tests</div><div> Negative tests</div></div><p>Note: Data is preliminary. The most recent days are frequently revised upward.</p></div>
<p>Testing was slow to ramp up in 2020, but it has become more robust, so the rate of positive tests is another clue to the concentration of the coronavirus in an area.</p>

<div><h1>Washington’s most significant weather events of 2021</h1></div>
<h2>The D.C. region experienced rare tornadoes, intense coastal flooding, extraordinary winds and many, many hot days</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ian Livingston</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 28, 2021 at 3:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ve made it through another year. There were plenty of challenges in 2021, but around here, weather was not responsible for most of them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was something of a quiet year in the D.C. area when it comes to massive weather events. Even so, there was still plenty to watch and to talk about from January to December.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Washington region saw plenty of snow days. A lot of wind. A couple of bouts of tornadoes and a spooky coastal flood event near Halloween. Then there were record temperatures — all on the warm side.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>February snow days</div></h3></div></div>
<p>And yet, we lamented later that month: “D.C. just experienced its least-productive snowy stretch ever recorded.” Despite the nine days of snowfall, the city recorded only 5.1 inches of snow. All days but one delivered less than one inch.</p>
<div><div><p>The “D.C. snow hole” was part of the equation during the month, as we can see above.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington posts first colder than normal February in six years</p></div>
<p>In short, it means storms go north. Some go south. It still felt wintry there for a bit, especially as you went north and west of the city. A storm to our south even dropped half a foot. We can be stuck in the middle — with the snow hole.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Late-April wind and a lot of other gusts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>At least one person was killed in the region as a big late-spring windstorm rocked the region with gusts of more than 60 mph. Damaging winds stretched from northeast West Virginia and Northern Virginia, then up into New York state.</p></div>
<div><p>Reagan National Airport measured a gust of 62 mph for D.C. — the strongest gust in April since at least 1998. It was actually one of the stronger gusts in the region during the event, knocking down numerous trees in the city.</p></div>
<div><p>Friday’s windstorm and its 60 mph gusts were remarkable for late April in Washington</p></div>
<p>Besides Washington, Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport also hit 58 mph, as did Hagerstown and Glen Burnie. Gaithersburg gusted to 59 mph, while Leesburg and Washington Dulles International Airport reached wind speeds up to 60 mph.</p>
<div><div><p>It was one of many windy days, especially in the spring. From March through May, the city experienced seven days with gusts of at least 50 mph.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Tornadoes on July 1</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>We see a handful of brief tornadoes most years in the area, but only rarely do they hit our small target of a city. This year was one of those exceptions.</p></div></div>
<p>On July 1, the city was struck by EF1 and EF0 tornadoes. Tornadoes are rated on a 0-to-5 scale, with 0 the weakest. It was the second round of storminess that day; a 58 mph gust was recorded at National Airport that afternoon during the first round.</p>
<div><div><p>The mighty mesocyclone that was responsible for both tornadoes was embedded within a line of storms that passed the region. Dave Dildine, a reporter for WTOP, had a front-row seat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The visible world appeared to be bending and swirling toward an invisible vacuum,” he wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This was the second time in recent years that Washington has been hit by tornadoes. In April 2017, one struck the Tidal Basin among other locations around the city.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hurricane Ida flooding and tornadoes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The storm later spawned another EF0 in Baltimore County, to the northeast of the Annapolis twister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ida’s remnants caused another significant tornado outbreak in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as a widespread flash flood disaster in and around New York City.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>October coastal flooding</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay experienced some of its worst coastal flooding in recent memory at the end of October.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Old Town Alexandria reached its third-highest tide on record, experiencing its highest levels since Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Similar conditions were reported in Annapolis.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Washington region sees worst coastal flooding in years amid heavy rain and strong winds</span></p></div>
<b> </b>Even without a big coastal storm offshore, the setup brought major storm surge flooding.
<div><div><p>In recent decades, the region has experienced an increase of unusually high water levels — the number of incidents doubling between 2000 and 2015, per a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Honorable mention: A quiet-ish weather year, but warm</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The city is poised to finish 2021 among the top 10 warmest on record — very toasty and yet somewhat behind last year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The city saw four daily record highs: one in March, one in October and two in December. Additionally, Washington saw eight record high minimums. There were no record lows or record low maxes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Additionally, August was the ninth warmest on record, October was the second warmest, and December is on track for at least fifth warmest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The city also experienced 48 days registering at least 90 degrees — eight more days than average from 1991-2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, D.C. was spared major weather catastrophes this year, but the mundane conditions produced the memorable. Given other events in 2021, we’ll take a relatively quiet weather year.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Brace for a wild winter in Washington, but it’s no thrill for snow lovers</h1></div>
<h2>We’re projecting big swings in temperature but below-average snowfall for the fifth time in the past six winters</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Matt Ross</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jason Samenow</div></span></div></span></div><div>November 10, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>After our second-warmest October on record, the first week of November delivered a chill, offering a taste of the inevitable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Winter officially starts in just three weeks (using the Dec. 1 meteorological definition), and it’s time for our annual seasonal outlook.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’re forecasting a volatile winter with big temperature swings. The mercury will be prone to both springlike spikes and bone-chilling plunges. But overall, temperatures should work out close to average.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The odds of a blockbuster nor’easter coming up the coast and walloping us with snow is lower than average, but can’t be entirely ruled out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>January should provide additional windows of opportunity for snow, while wintry weather may fade in February.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Outlook details</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Temperatures</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, we expect temperatures for December through February to be close to average.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>December: 1 to 2 degrees colder than average</li><li>January: Around average</li><li>February: 2 degrees warmer than average</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>Snowfall</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Our snowfall projection covers November through April. Overall, we expect slightly to somewhat below-average snowfall.</p></div></div>
<li>Reagan National Airport (DCA): 8 to 12 inches (compared with a 13.7-inch average)</li>
<li>Dulles International Airport (IAD): 12 to 16 inches (compared with a 21-inch average)</li>
<li>Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport (BWI): 10 to 15 inches (compared with a 19.3-inch average)</li>
<li>Fairfax, Loudoun, Montgomery counties: 10 to 18 inches</li>
<li>Alexandria, Arlington and Prince George’s counties and the District: 8 to 14 inches</li>
<div><div><p><b>Qualifiers</b></p></div></div>
<li>Although advances have been made in seasonal forecasting, there is still a great deal of uncertainty and limited skill in developing these outlooks. These remain low-confidence forecasts.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Answers to questions you may have</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What are other forecasters predicting for the Washington region?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here is a brief summary of their outlooks:</p></div></div>
<li>Joe Bastardi, WeatherBell: Average temperatures and snowfall</li>
<li>Todd Crawford, Atmospheric G2 (formerly WSI): Above-average temperatures and below-average snowfall (9.5 inches)</li>
<li>Judah Cohen, Atmospheric Environmental Research: Average temperatures and slightly below-average snowfall (11.6 inches)</li>
<li>Paul Dorian, CTFV (formerly Perspecta Weather): Average temperatures and near-average snowfall (15 inches)</li>
<li>Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather: Above-average temperatures and below-average snowfall (8.7 inches)</li>
<li>Matt Rogers, Commodity Weather Group: Average temperatures and below-average snowfall (8.5 inches)</li>
<div><div><p>Several of these forecasters agree that winter will start fast with cold, snowy conditions before trending milder.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Of the Washington-area television affiliate weather teams, only FOX5 so far has released an outlook. It’s calling for above average temperatures and below-average snowfall (5 to 13 inches), in line with everyone elses expectations.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The National Weather Service’s winter outlook does not include snowfall projections, but it calls for above average temperatures and near-average precipitation for the Washington region.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NOAA calls for stormy winter across the northern U.S. but mild, dry weather elsewhere</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>What is your long-term track record with these winter outlooks?</b></p></div></div>
<a>best winter forecast preceded the record-breaking Snowmageddon winter of 2009-2010</a>, when we said: “Overall, we find chances for a large snowstorm of 8-12 inches or more are much higher than normal this coming winter.”
<a>Our outlook for the winter of 2014-2015 was also quite successful</a>, as we correctly called for it to be cold with somewhat above-normal snow.
<a>5 degrees warmer than average</a>. Several winters ago (2013-2014), we called for a warm winter with slightly below-average snowfall, and
<a>it was cold, with snow that totaled more than twice the average</a>.
<div><div><p><b>How is climate change influencing our winters?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Winter temperatures have steadily risen in Washington over the past 150 years, and snowfall amounts are in decline. Since 1970, the average winter temperature <a>has risen between 3 and 5 degrees across the region</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Climate averages or “normals” warmed around 1 to 2 degrees in every winter month between the 1981-2010 and 1991-2020 periods alone.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington’s new climate ‘normals’ are hotter and wetter</p></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, the 30-year average snowfall has declined from over 20 inches in the late 1800s to just 13.7 inches today.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We do take these long-term trends into account in our winter outlooks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Aren’t weather forecasts only reliable out to about eight to 10 days?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Study says ‘specific’ weather forecasts can’t be made more than 10 days in advance</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Methodology</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below are some, though not all, of the factors that we considered in determining conditions for this upcoming winter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Tropical Pacific Ocean</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We are currently experiencing a strengthening La Niña event, which is indicated by colder-than-average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In our region, La Niñas, particularly moderate to strong events, are often associated with dry, mild winters with modest snowfall. This is usually because of two primary factors:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>1. The frequent presence of a southeast ridge. It is a persistent area of high pressure near Bermuda that pumps mild air into the region and pushes the storm track to our north and west.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This winter we expect a weak to moderate La Niña to persist throughout the winter, with some weakening late.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>North Pacific Ocean</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We are currently in the midst of a very persistent negative PDO period. Additionally, La Niña often lends itself to a negative PDO. We expect that this winter the PDO will average negative, perhaps strongly so.</p></div></div>
