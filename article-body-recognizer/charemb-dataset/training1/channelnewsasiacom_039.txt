<p>In Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Indonesia and Brunei, respondents said flooding was the most serious climate change impact for their country.</p>
<p>Research shows there is merit to such concern, with the region’s cities among the most vulnerable in the world and projections that once in a 100 year flood events could be happening every year by 2100.</p>
<p>Singaporeans were most worried about sea level rise, which regionally is being experienced faster than the global average and will continue around Asia over the coming decades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thais thought drought was the biggest climate change impact faced and Cambodians selected biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Only 21 per cent believe that their country has a policy and plan to protect agriculture against climate change, even though the overall majority thought that their country’s food supply was threatened by climate change.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> ‘Inconvenience stores’ help Thailand turn green amid plastic crisis </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pichayada Promchertchoo </a> </div> </div>
<p>BANGKOK: Most retailers strive to make shopping easy for customers. But Papawee Pongthanavaranon is determined to make it less convenient. </p>
<p>Her clients must come prepared with empty containers and shopping bags - a practice still largely uncommon in Thailand - and pay for a range of environmentally sourced merchandise at her self-service bulk store Refill Station in the capital.</p>
<p>The businesses are common in many developed countries which have greater awareness of environmental issues. In Thailand, however, it is a new and unusual concept.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the plastic use shows no signs of falling. Thailand’s Pollution Control Department reported last year the country uses 45 billion plastic bags annually, 6.8 billion styrofoam food containers and 9.8 billion single-use plastic cups. </p>
<p>About 18 billion plastic bags are handed out at fresh markets and stalls, while the rest - 27 billion bags - come from retailers, malls and convenience stores, according to the department’s data.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, bulk stores have begun to emerge as demands for eco-friendly products and services grow in Thailand. </p>
<p>Growth in GDP and improved quality of life in these countries has resulted in “exploding demand” for consumer goods, which exceeded their waste-management infrastructure, the report added.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Unless steps are taken to manage this waste properly, by 2025 the ocean could contain one ton of plastic for every three tons of finfish - an unthinkable outcome.</p> </blockquote>
<p>In Thailand, the problem of unmanaged plastic waste has prompted its environment minister to convince 43 major shopping malls and convenience stores to stop handing out plastic bags to customers from Jan 1 next year.</p>
<p>“After a long time of campaigning against plastic waste, it’s now time to take real action,” Minister of Environment Varawut Silpa-archa said in August.</p>
<p>“Let’s get used to carrying cloth shopping bags today. Cut down on the convenience a little to let the world and the environment stay with humans for a long time.”</p>
<p>The move came shortly after the death of a well-loved baby dugong, Mariam, who died in August after months of intensive care. The autopsy linked the animal’s death to several pieces of plastic blocking its intestinal tract.</p>
<p>“The inflammation that ensued had caused gas build-up in her digestive system and blood infection,” veterinarian Nantarika Chansue from Chulalongkorn University wrote on her Facebook page last month.</p>
<p>While Thais have grieved for their beloved dugong, many of them were not surprised by the news. </p>
<p>THAILAND’S PLASTIC ADDICTION</p>
<p>A zero-waste or low-plastic lifestyle remains limited to a small network of people in Thailand largely because life can be cheap and easy with plastic.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Thailand is in the grip of a growing plastic waste crisis.</p> </blockquote>
<p>To cut down on their plastic addiction, people in Thailand have to pay more for eco-friendly products. They also have to put maximum effort in sorting and recycling waste due to a lack of waste management options in the country.</p>
<p>According to Pichmol, only a quarter of plastic waste - mainly plastic bottles - was recycled last year. “Among the rest was around 1.2 million tonnes of plastic bags, a major contributor to plastic pollution in Thailand,” she added.</p>
<p>Still, many people believe their country can still overcome the plastic crisis. Its grim situation has not discouraged the likes of Papawee, who has noticed small but gradual change in consumer behaviour over the past two years.</p>
<p>Refill Station now welcomes more customers than before. The variety of its products has also grown from shower gel, shampoo and dish-washing liquid to bamboo toothbrushes, reusable sanitary pads and plastic-free toothpaste tablets.</p>
<p>“These provide alternatives for whoever wants to start reducing plastic use; they can start with anything. We’re also in the process of setting up a food refill station,” Papawee said.</p>
<p>“We have hope and we work based on that,” she added. “We believe little things make great change.”</p>

<h1> Putus sekolah tak putuskan semangat penjual tahu ini untuk sebarkan cinta membaca </h1>
<div> <p>Semua bermula dari membagikan tahu secara gratis kepada anak-anak sekaligus meminjami mereka buku. Kini puluhan orang rajin membaca berkat Rudiat.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kiki Siregar </a> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: Pagi pukul enam dan sinar mentari belum lama menerangi langit Desa Pasirhuni di Jawa Barat, namun Rudiat sudah sibuk memilah-milah tumpukan buku.</p>
<p>Penjual tahu itu kemudian memasukkan puluhan buku ke dalam dua kotak di bagian belakang sepeda motornya, bersisian dengan satu kotak lain berisi beberapa bungkusan tahu. Lantas ia berangkat menuju beberapa desa di Kecamatan Cimaung.</p>
<p>Berdagang tahu merupakan sumber pendapatan utama Rudiat selama sekitar satu dekade terakhir. Namun, ia telah menjadikan tumbuh kembang literasi sebagai misi hidupnya.</p>
<p>Setiap kali mengunjungi penduduk desa yang menjadi pelanggannya, pria berusia 43 tahun itu juga meminjamkan buku kepada mereka.</p>
<p> “Saya bawanya buku-buku yang cocok buat mereka. Kalau saya datangnya ke desa yang mayoritas pembeli tahu saya peternak, ya saya bawanya buku-buku peternakan, misalnya cara beternak bebek.</p>
<p> “Tapi kalau penduduknya sebagian besar ibu-ibu, saya pinjami buku-buku tentang pengasuhan anak dengan topik seperti cara merawat anak,” jelasnya kepada CNA.</p>
<p>Meski hanya berpenghasilan sekitar 1,5 juta rupiah per bulan, lebih rendah dari upah minimum regional Jawa Barat sebesar 1,8 juta rupiah, ia selalu menyisihkan 2,5 persen dari pendapatannya untuk membeli buku.</p>
<p>Rudiat telah membeli sekitar 3.500 buku sejak ia mulai bekerja 25 tahun lalu. Ada pula buku-buku sejumlah 2.500-an judul dari para donatur yang telah mendengar kabar tentang pengabdian sukarelanya.</p>
<p> “Saya nyebutnya tahu buku. Di mana ada tahu, di situ ada buku. Buku bikin kita pintar dan tahu bikin kita sehat,” ujarnya seraya menambahkan bahwa ia siap merelakan buku-buku yang tak kunjung dikembalikan.</p>
<p>Bermula dari inisiatif kecil-kecilan, upaya Rudiat telah menarik hati sederet pembaca setia. Sebagian dari mereka bahkan tak sungkan-sungkan mengirimkan pesan untuk memberitahunya jenis bacaan yang mereka inginkan sehari sebelum ia datang.</p>
<p>Rudiat bahkan bersedia menempuh 20–30 kilometer berbekal buku dan tahu untuk para warga di satu perkebunan teh di Pangalengan. Pencapaian yang paling ia banggakan adalah pertemuannya dengan Presiden Joko Widodo untuk berbagi pengalaman.</p>
<h2>DIEJEK KARENA PUTUS SEKOLAH</h2>
<p>Rudiat dibesarkan oleh ibunya, seorang janda yang bekerja serabutan. Selepas lulus kelas empat, ia harus putus sekolah akibat himpitan ekonomi.</p>
<p>“Anak-anak di kampung dulu sering ngejekin saya. Mereka bilang, 'Eh anak enggak sekolah' terus ngejek-ngejek saya,” kenangnya.</p>
<p>Semua itu tak membuat Rudiat cilik berkecil hati. “Saya bertekad kalau saya tetap bisa berhasil walaupun enggak tamat sekolah,” ujarnya.</p>
<p>Menginjak usia 19 tahun, ia mulai bekerja di pabrik tahu. Terinspirasi oleh kewajiban zakat dalam Islam, ia memutuskan untuk membeli buku menggunakan 2,5 persen dari gajinya.</p>
<p>Rudiat kerap membawa buku-buku itu ke tempat kerja untuk ia baca di waktu luang. “Saya mau menunjukkan kalau saya bisa mengembangkan diri lewat membaca.”</p>
<p>Setahun kemudian, Rudiat menemukan cinta sejatinya, seorang gadis lulusan SMP yang juga gemar membaca.</p>
<p>Setelah menikah, masing-masing dari keduanya membawa tiga buah buku ke tempat tinggal mereka yang baru.</p>
<p>Rudiat berkisah bahwa ketika kehilangan mata pencaharian di awal tahun 2000, istrinya rela menyisihkan 2,5 persen dari upahnya bekerja di pabrik daur ulang kertas demi membeli buku.</p>
<p>Dia kemudian dipekerjakan di sebuah pabrik garmen, lantas berhenti pada tahun 2008 untuk memproduksi dan menjual tahu berbekal ilmu dari pekerjaannya yang dulu.</p>
<p>Kala itu, koleksi buku Rudiat sudah berkembang dan para tetangga sering datang untuk meminjam.</p>
<p>Dengan keyakinan bahwa penduduk di desa-desa lain tertarik untuk membaca — didukung pula oleh angka melek huruf Provinsi Jawa Barat yang mendekati 100 persen — ia pun mengisi tasnya dengan lima hingga 10 buku per hari untuk para pelanggan tahunya.</p>
<p>Awalnya tak banyak yang berminat. Rudiat lantas mendekati anak-anak dengan memberi mereka tahu gratis sekaligus meminjamkan buku bacaan yang cocok untuk mereka.</p>
<p>Perlahan-lahan, beberapa warga lain mulai menanggapi upayanya. Rudiat pun paham bahwa keinginan untuk membaca dapat muncul apabila bahan bacaan disesuaikan dengan minat.</p>
<p>Maka ia pun memutuskan untuk membawa buku-buku yang sesuai dengan profesi maupun demografi penduduk setempat.</p>
<h2>BERTEMU DENGAN PRESIDEN</h2>
<p>Seiring waktu, beberapa pejabat daerah Kabupaten Bandung mengajak Rudiat untuk menumbuhkembangkan literasi di kalangan anak-anak pedesaan.</p>
<p>Ia bahkan diminta turut mendidik anak-anak muda di suatu desa dengan tingkat melek huruf yang lebih rendah serta beberapa kasus kenakalan remaja.</p>
<p>Pemerintah setempat pun sigap mendirikan perpustakaan kecil di samping rumah Rudiat, berikut yayasan untuk menaungi aktivitasnya.</p>
<p>Sementara itu, kerja nyata Rudiat terdengar oleh para pejabat kementerian pendidikan. Pada tahun 2016, mereka menawarinya beasiswa untuk mengunjungi Singapura dan menuliskan hasil pengamatannya di sana.</p>
<p>Malang tak dapat ditolak; Rudiat jatuh dari motor dan cedera pada lengan serta dadanya saat menuju kantor imigrasi untuk mengurus paspor.</p>
<p>Karena luka-lukanya, tubuhnya melemah dan ia tidak bisa lagi membuat tahu seorang diri. Ia lantas memutuskan untuk membeli tahu dari produsen kemudian menjualnya kembali sembari membawa buku-buku ke berbagai desa.</p>
<p>Kecelakaan itu juga memaksanya untuk membatalkan perjalanan ke Singapura.</p>
<p>“Awalnya saya pikir ada yang ngerjain saya," ujar Rudiat.</p>
<p>“Waktu lihat Pak Presiden, saya pikir saya sedang mimpi. Apa iya ini nyata?"</p>
<p>“Ini di luar dugaan, karena impian saya sempat terkubur waktu saya terpaksa putus sekolah.”</p>
<p>Kini Rudiat berani untuk bermimpi lebih tinggi. “Saya kepengin bikin sekolah gratis yang bisa bermanfaat untuk banyak orang.”</p>

<div> <div> <a> Kiki Siregar </a> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: Indonesian Erwin, not his real name, felt his world instantly collapse last month.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old coffee sachet seller, who usually cycles the streets of Bandung in West Java to sell his brew, was struggling to make ends meet due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>But that was not his only sorrow. </p>
<p>"Our child had a fever, he couldn't eat because he had a sore throat. If he ate, he would vomit,” Mr Erwin spoke of his youngest child.</p>
<p>“I just gave him some medicine. I didn’t dare to bring him to a hospital because I didn’t want to be separated from him since he was physically disabled.”</p>
<p>After three days, his 11-year-old son started to have difficulties breathing and Mr Erwin decided to take him to a local health clinic. </p>
<p>“We brought him to a health clinic and they provided intravenous (IV) infusion, and performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on him. It was positive. He only spent a night at the health clinic and then he passed away.</p>
<p>"I regret not taking him straight to a hospital. I didn't know it was COVID-19. At that time I was confused about whether to take him to a hospital or not, I didn't have the money. My god, I really regret this until now.”</p>
<p>As COVID-19 drags on, children in Indonesia have not been spared. </p>
<p>At least 1,065 children have died due to COVID-19 in the country since the start of the pandemic, said Professor Aman Pulungan, head of the Indonesian Paediatric Society (IDAI).</p>
<p>The number of fatalities has increased amid the deadly second wave of infections, with more than 100 deaths recorded per week since July, he claimed. </p>
<p>“This is not a good situation of course,” Prof Pulungan told CNA, adding that the fatality rate among children in Indonesia is likely the highest in the world.</p>
<p>He also said that at least 207,000 children have contracted the disease in Indonesia. Out of this, around 90,000 of them contracted the virus since Jul 14.</p>
<p>Children now make up about 12.5 per cent of the country’s confirmed cases, an increase over previous months, said Prof Pulungan.</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that the data may not necessarily showcase the true scale of the situation, as COVID-19 testing in Indonesia is low at between 100,000 and 200,000 daily tests in the country of 270 million people.</p>
<p>With more than 3.6 million cases and 104,000 deaths so far, experts are worried more children will die. They have urged the authorities to take immediate actions to prevent more deaths.</p>
<h2>HEIGHTENED RISK FOR INFANTS </h2>
<p>Another parent who had to endure the loss of a child is Mdm Tantien Hermawati, 35. </p>
<p>Recounting the day when she lost her baby last December, the housewife from Tuban regency, East Java, said the obstetrician detected a heart defect in her fetus during the eighth month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>She was advised to seek treatment in East Java’s capital Surabaya but was hesitant because COVID-19 cases were raging there. </p>
<p>She managed to give birth normally in Tuban, but after 1.5 months, those around her noted that her baby appeared to be “blue”.</p>
<p>Mdm Hermawati eventually went to Surabaya and the baby underwent a cardiac catheterisation to diagnose and treat heart conditions.</p>
<p>It was unsuccessful and her child needed to undergo a second operation. He was swabbed and tested positive.</p>
<p>“My baby was isolated for about 14 days until he passed away in December 2020,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>She did not know how he contracted the virus and she herself was negative for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Prof Pulungan said that about 42 per cent of child deaths in Indonesia due to COVID-19 had occurred among those aged below a year. This meant that they were born during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This means our system is not okay. The monitoring system during pregnancy or post-birth,” he surmised.</p>
<p>Prof Pulungan, who is also the executive director of the International Pediatric Association (IPA), added that comorbidity is the underlying factor for fatality involving infants under the age of one.</p>
<p>Common comorbidities include congenital heart disease, he said, while the fact that babies cannot wear masks also contributes to the problem.</p>
<p>Loved ones visiting the babies and mothers may unconsciously spread COVID-19, he noted.</p>
<p>“It is heartbreaking. It is a tradition to celebrate newborns, and it is difficult for a mother and family to refuse visitors who are not complying with health protocols ... However, it’s now a grave risk to take.” </p>
<h2>MULTIPLE FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO DEATHS</h2>
<p>There are other factors in play as well. </p>
<p>Mr Tata Sudrajat, deputy chief for programme impact and policy of non-governmental organisation Save the Children in Jakarta, said that there are at least three main reasons why children die from COVID-19. </p>
<p>Lack of malnutrition, access to health care, and compliance to health protocols are the most notable ones.</p>
<p>The number of affected children is also dependent on how many adults are infected by COVID-19 as many of them contracted it from their parents.</p>
<p>He noted that if a family member is infected and self-isolating, other family members are also at risk, especially since the conditions at home are not appropriate for self-isolation, he said.</p>
<p>“Children infections and deaths are increasing and it seems it will keep increasing if the situation is not changed,” Mr Sudrajat told CNA.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Delta variant is the main variant found in most COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, but Prof Pulungan said it is unclear whether it is the main reason why deaths among children are increasing.</p>
<p>He highlighted that for the past few weeks the problem is the health system is also overwhelmed due to a surge in infections.</p>
<p>“If at the same time everyone is ill and the health system is collapsing and there are not enough beds for children, not enough beds for babies, then what to do?”</p>
<p>He noted that there are about 18,000 new children infections nationwide per week.</p>
<p>Thus, Prof Pulungan urged the government to add more hospital beds for children, enhance testing and tracing as well as speed up <a>vaccination for adolescents</a>, who make up about 30 per cent of the country’s population.</p>
<p>Dr Siti Nadia Tarmidzi, the government’s spokeswoman for COVID-19 handling and vaccination noted during a July press conference that at the moment there is no vaccine suitable for children. "The only protection is a tight health policy,” she said.</p>
<div><p>Mr Sudrajat of Save the Children concurred. “Without help from the international community through COVAX, the COVID-19 crisis in Indonesia will quickly spiral out of control. We hope that the international community is listening."</p></div>
<p>He also suggested spreading more public awareness of COVID-19 by providing information and social assistance, counselling and hotline services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr Erwin the coffee sachet seller is now extra vigilant.</p>
<p>After the death of his third child on Jul 15, the entire family was swabbed.</p>
<p>His wife also tested positive and had to self-isolate.</p>
<p>“Now I really take care of my wife, I don’t want to lose another family member. I truly regret it.</p>
<p>“My son dreamt of becoming a soldier even though he was physically disabled. But he is dead now."</p>

<p>JAKARTA: Heavy rain suddenly poured down when Ahmad Marzuki, an office boy in Jakarta, was on his way home from a late shift in April 2018. </p>
<p>He immediately ran to seek refuge and chanced upon a family of scavengers lying on the pavement, as a little baby cried. It was about 9pm. </p>
<p>“The woman said to the man, ‘Why can’t you do something? Our baby is hungry.'</p>
<p>“But the man replied: ‘What can I do? It is raining and we don’t have money…’,” Mr Marzuki recalled. </p>
<p>At that time, Mr Marzuki was only in the third week of his new job and had yet to receive his salary. He made a promise to himself to help the family once he received his first paycheck. </p>
<p>“I thought the encounter was God's way of reminding me: If you have something like a salary, you shouldn’t forget (to help others),” Mr Marzuki told CNA.</p>

<p>When he received his first salary of less than 3 million rupiah (US$213), he bought an electric stove and prepared meals meant for the family of scavengers he saw on that rainy night. </p>
<p>However, he could not trace the family later so he gave the food to the other homeless people he encountered during his search.</p>
<p>And from there, he started providing food to the needy once a week, usually on Saturday or Sunday night. </p>
<p>There is no fixed budget for the initiative, but Mr Marzuki, 33, sets aside about 25 to 30 per cent of his current monthly salary of slightly over 4 million rupiah to cook for the homeless. The minimum wage in Jakarta is around 4.2 million rupiah.</p>
<p>"ADDICTED" TO HELPING OTHERS</p>
<p>Inspired by his noble deed, Mr Marzuki's friends have decided to join him on his weekly distribution trips across Jakarta. </p>
<p>He did not approach them at first, out of fear of troubling them, but a friend discovered his weekly route at the end of 2019 and volunteered to contribute. </p>
<p>Each week, at least five of his friends would help him out, either to cook or to give out the free meals. </p>
<p>Some of his friends also offered their place to prepare the meals, since Mr Marzuki is living in a small rented room of 3m x 2.5m. "I have to fold the mattress so I have enough space to cook," he said. </p>
<p>They normally prepare food for about 50 to 100 people each time. </p>
<p>Rice and vegetables are usually included in the menu, while beef will be included during festive days such as Hari Raya and Christmas.</p>
<p>Every week, they go to different parts of Jakarta so that they can help different people.</p>
<p>Mr Marzuki believed it is best to distribute free meals at night because he noticed that those who appear to be homeless during day time are often professional beggars. </p>
<p>People who sleep rough on the streets at night are most likely real homeless people and this is the group he wants to help, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Marzuki said his experience so far has been pleasant, and he claimed that he is "addicted" to helping others.</p>
<p>He has never had a bad experience, he said. </p>
<p>“Once, a man saw us and immediately approached us. He asked me whether he could get some food while showing us his shaky hands. He hasn’t eaten the whole day.”</p>

<p>Another time, they went to an area in South Jakarta and wanted to give a woman food but she rejected. </p>
<p>She said she did not need it because someone else just gave her free food so she would rather someone else have the meal. </p>
<p>About five months ago, Mr Marzuki met a scavenger who has a four-month-old baby. The baby was so tiny, he said, so his group decided to provide them with a regular supply of milk powder.</p>
<p>“Now the baby has grown a lot. There is a personal satisfaction seeing the baby's growth,” he said.</p>
<p>MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE IN JAKARTA DURING COVID-19</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on in Indonesia, Mr Marzuki and his friends still continue their charitable deed.</p>
<p>But to ensure their safety, they give the food without making small talk with the less fortunate people, unlike before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Marzuki noticed that since the pandemic, there are more needy people as they keep encountering new homeless people.</p>
<p>“I just hope the pandemic will soon end because there are many people who have been laid off. </p>
<p>“Hopefully we will also be healthy, so we can continue to help each other.”</p>
<p>SHARING MAKES US FEEL WE HAVE ENOUGH: MARZUKI</p>
<p>As the son of farmers living in Lampung province on Sumatra island, Mr Marzuki grew up in a poor household.</p>
<p>After school, he had to help his parents earn a living by finding snails or trash to sell, leaving him with no time to study.</p>
<p>When he was in junior high school, he had to walk 7km daily to school.</p>
<p>An incident Mr Marzuki could never forget is when one day his parents were sick and he wanted to borrow money from his relatives.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling sorry for him, his relatives asked him how he could afford to repay them next time.</p>
<p>“They were my family but they didn’t want to lend me money. So I went home empty-handed,” Mr Marzuki said.</p>
<p>He then tried to seek help from the middleman who usually bought his snails, and finally got some money to pay for his parents' medical bills. </p>

<p>His own life experiences motivated him to keep on helping others. </p>
<p>“When it comes to humans, they always feel everything is not enough. Regardless of how much God has given them, they will never feel it’s enough. </p>
<p>“That’s why we have to share with other people. By sharing, we will feel we have enough,” said Mr Marzuki.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Indonesia schools start cautious reopening after devastating COVID-19 wave </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: Indonesia's capital Jakarta reopened 600 of its schools on Monday (Aug 30) as coronavirus restrictions eased, though a teacher federation urged caution and warned of clusters in classrooms caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant.</p>
<p>Jakarta's infection rate has dropped, authorities said, from a peak last month that saw Indonesia become Asia's coronavirus epicentre, with more than 4 million cases and 131,000 fatalities overall.</p>
<p>Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 610 of 10,000 schools deemed safe had opened at 50 per cent capacity in a resumption of a trial that started in April.</p>
<p>Zhafira Tsamara Ufaira Azza, 6, was excited to be back at school, where students will rotate with one day per week in class and the rest online at home.</p>
<p>"I got to meet my friends and teachers," she said.</p>
<p>Mother Endang Sugiarti, 35, said she was still worried about the Delta variant.</p>
<p>"But for my daughter's progress and education, I dared to try it first," she said.</p>
<p>Education Minister Nadiem Makarim last week called for school reopening to be accelerated to try to recover lost ground.</p>
<p>"There's a decrease in study targets, lots of children quit school, especially girls in some regions," he said.</p>
<p>"There's a learning loss with permanent impacts."</p>
<p>But Heru Purnomo, of The Federation of Indonesian Teachers Associations, said broadening the reopening could be risky.</p>
<p>According to official data, about 1 per cent of Indonesian coronavirus deaths and 13 per cent of its cases have been minors.</p>
<p>"It could create new clusters ... it could add to the death of children," he told Reuters.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Taliban leader decrees Afghan women's rights must be 'enforced' </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KABUL: The Taliban issued a decree on Friday (Dec 3) in the name of their supreme leader instructing Afghan ministries "to take serious action" on women's rights, but failed to mention girls' access to schools.</p>
<p>"The Islamic Emirate's leadership directs all relevant organisations ... to take serious action to enforce Women's Rights," the decree states, quoting elusive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.</p>
<p>The decree centres on marriage and widows' rights, stating "no one can force women to marry by coercion or pressure" and that a widow is entitled to an unspecified fixed share of her husband's inheritance.</p>
<p>It instructs the Ministry of Culture and Information to publish material on women's rights "to prevent ... ongoing repression".</p>
<p>Respect for women's rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid.</p>
<p>The decree crucially makes no mention of girls' secondary education - which has been suspended for millions - or the employment of women, who have been barred from returning to jobs in the public sector.</p>
<p>Women's rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban's previous stint in power, which lasted from 1996 to late 2001.</p>
<p>Women were forced to wear the all covering burqa, only allowed to leave the home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education.</p>
<p>Akhundzada has maintained a very low public profile since becoming supreme leader in 2016, after his predecessor was killed in a US drone strike.</p>
<p>The Taliban on Oct 30 released a 10-minute audio recording purported to be him addressing a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar that day.</p>
<p>But some analysts believe he may have been killed one or more years ago.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Dreams on hold: Afghan girls, women desperate to get back to class </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KABUL: To fill her days and keep her mind occupied, university student Hawa sits by the window in her Kabul home and pores over a book.</p>
<p>Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghan girls and young women, the 20-year-old Russian literature undergraduate has not been allowed to return to her studies since the Taliban seized power in mid-August.</p>
<p>And like many of her peers, she is feeling a mixture of frustration and anger that her aspirations to study and work are being thwarted.</p>
<p>"We are not born to sit at home," Hawa told Reuters in her family's house in the Afghan capital, where she has been cooped up spending her days drawing, reading and doing chores.</p>
<p>"If we can nurture babies we can provide for our families too. In this situation, I do not see my dreams coming true."</p>
<p>The hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which stormed to power earlier this year after ousting the Western-backed government, has allowed all boys and younger girls back to class, but has not let girls attend secondary school.</p>
<p>Most public universities are not functioning at all, or only partially.</p>
<p>Officials have tried to assure Afghans and foreign donors that people's rights will be honoured, including allowing girls to go to school and women to study and work once details on how to do so in accordance with Islamic law are thrashed out.</p>
<p>They have also blamed the international community for cutting off aid, making it harder to fund the reopening of schools and universities for all.</p>
<p>More than three months into their rule, that has not happened, and some are sceptical of a group that, when it was last in power from 1996 to 2001, banned all girls from school and women from paid employment.</p>
<p>Fewer than 40 per cent of Afghan girls attended secondary school in 2018 even though it was allowed then, according to the most recent figures from UNESCO.</p>
<p>Much of the country remains deeply conservative, despite 20 years of Western-backed rule and billions of dollars in foreign aid aimed partly at promoting equality and civil rights.</p>
<p>But in urban centres in particular, girls and women have enjoyed greater freedoms since 2001, and they are reluctant to let them go.</p>
<p>"Those of us who went to university and also had jobs, were helping our families, of course nothing will come of us, because they (the Taliban) say that whatever we studied in the last 20 years is useless," Hawa said.</p>
<p>Across town, 17-year-old Sahar is also stuck at home. She wants to become an engineer, but, for now at least, has to learn at home as best she can.</p>
<p>"I am trying to continue my lessons at home but nevertheless the environment at school, the classroom, our friends and teachers is something different compared to being at home."</p>
<p>She proudly showed Reuters around her old classroom - a school manager on the premises that day allowed Sahar in.</p>
<p>"I would love to come back to my class, resume my studies, to be with my classmates and teachers," she said, looking wistfully around the room where desks and benches gathered dust.</p>
<p>When her younger brother and sister return from school each day, Sahar helps with their homework.</p>
<p>"They ... come home and do their homework, talk about their classmates and their studies. But I feel sad inside that I can't go to school myself."</p>
<p>Her sister Hadia, who is 10, has noticed that some of her former teachers and classmates are no longer around - she assumes they were among thousands of Afghans who fled Kabul in the chaotic weeks that followed the Taliban's conquest.</p>
<p>Even at her age, she recognises the difficulties ahead.</p>
<p>"I'm in the 4th grade. I want to be a doctor, but if in two years' time I am not allowed to continue my studies like my sister, I won't be able to fulfil my dream," said Hadia. "That already scares me."</p>

<h1> ‘My friends felt I was crazy’: From working an office job to running a milk empire in Malaysia </h1>
<div> <p>Farm Fresh founder Loi Tuan Ee started with 60 milk cows a decade ago. Today, he has 6,000 of them.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Amir Yusof </a> </div> </div>
<p>KOTA TINGGI, Johor: When Loi Tuan Ee stepped out to the milking shed at his farm in Kampung Mawai, it was a little difficult to imagine that this was the man helming one of Malaysia’s largest dairy companies.</p>
<p>The company’s founder was dressed simply in T-shirt and jeans. His clothes were drenched in sweat from the blistering heat while his boots were covered in mud.</p>
<p>Loi, 57, spends most of his days in corporate offices, speaking to lawyers, clients and employees. But when he has the time to visit one of his five dairy farms in Malaysia, he is happy to do so because they are where he feels most at home.</p>
<p>He started The Holstein Milk Company, and its subsidiary brand Farm Fresh, in 2008. Since then, Farm Fresh has become a household name in Malaysia, and even in neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Brunei.</p>
<p>Behind the brand’s growth is a story of risk taking, passion for agriculture and tapping the potential in the local dairy industry.</p>
<p>Loi’s journey as a milk farmer actually began as a gamble.</p>
<p>He had worked at a corporate job for 20 years in the food packaging industry, rising to senior positions.</p>
<p>Loi was thriving in his job. At one point, he was earning around RM500,000 (US$119,489) a year.</p>
<p>He headed a marketing department and worked with huge companies such as Sony and Panasonic.</p>
<p>Yet, Loi felt there was a limit to what he could achieve as an employee.</p>
<p>“It was a very closely-knitted family business,” he recounted, adding that as an outsider, it would have been difficult for him to take things to the next level. </p>
<p>He also wanted to do something related to agriculture, which he developed a passion for while growing up in his kampung in Setiawan, Perak.</p>
<p>“I have this love for agriculture, because of my (background) in the kampung. My parents were rubber tappers and they grew tapioca,” said Loi when interviewed by CNA.</p>
<p>“I felt that I wanted to come out to do something that is more sustainable. Evergreen … and resilient. And that's one of the reasons why I opted for agriculture, to produce food products,” he added.</p>
<p>Loi decided to leave his job to open a dairy farm.</p>
<p>Looking back at this decision, Loi said that it was a risky move and he recalled how some of his friends and family had warned him against it.</p>
<p>They were concerned that the capital-intensive venture would not pay off.</p>
<p>“I think my wife was very worried. My sister was thinking, ‘Gor (brother), are you sure you want to do something like this?’. So I said (to them): ‘Let me try’.”</p>
<p>“A lot of my friends felt that I was crazy.”</p>
<p>He said that one of his friends even thought that Loi was having a “midlife crisis”.</p>
<p>“You give up a half-a-million-ringgit perks job and you want to raise cows?,” Loi said, recalling the words of his friend.</p>
<p>“They found it very amusing. But thank God, you know, I think that was a right decision and the sheer perseverance and determination to make this work has indeed paid off.”</p>
<p>The early days were gruelling.</p>
<p>While he was used to working in a cushy air-conditioned office, the milk farmer now had to ready himself for the back-breaking work of clearing land and building sheds. </p>
<p>In 2006, he bought around 500 acres of land for the farm in Kampung Mawai, near Kota Tinggi. The farm is a 20-minute drive from the nearest main road and has no cellular reception.</p>
<p> “That’s what we could afford then. When we first came in, the place was part of a forest,” said Loi.</p>
<p>“During the initial years, I spent a lot of time here, maybe six days a week. I would stay in that living quarters so that I could set up the farm.”</p>
<p>He started off with importing 60 Holstein Jersey cows from Australia.</p>
<p>This was tricky as the cows were not acclimatised to the tropical climate in Malaysia, and the volume of milk production was low. </p>
<p>He also faced issues getting loans from banks to purchase livestock and infrastructure.</p>
<p>“If you want to do other established industries, like palm oil, for example, the bankers are more than happy to lend you. But if you want to buy cows, they are very, very worried about it,” he added.</p>
<p>His big break came when Khazanah Nasional, the strategic investment arm of the Malaysian government, invested in his company.</p>
<p>Today, 30 per cent of Farm Fresh is owned by Khazanah’s investment vehicle Agrifood Resources Holdings. </p>
<p>Loi noted that he had a stroke of good luck as the opening of his farm coincided with a period when the government was looking to invest in agricultural businesses to promote national self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>With financial backing, The Holstein Milk Company was able to grow exponentially over a decade.</p>
<p>“We were doing RM9 million in business for the whole year (in 2012) and then fast forward nine years later, we are doing RM9 million business a week. So that tells you how much we have grown,” said Loi.</p>
<p>Nationally, Farm Fresh products grew in popularity. According to a 2019 report by AC Nielsen, the brand has the largest market share for fresh milk in Malaysia, garnering more than half of the consumer share in the peninsula. </p>
<p>On Wednesday (Oct 6), local media reported that Farm Fresh is set to be listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Market.</p>
<p>It has reportedly filed a draft prospectus on the Securities Commission Malaysia’s website and its initial public offering (IPO) would entail the sale of 743.18 million shares, or 40 per cent of its enlarged issued share capital.</p>
<p>On the export front, Loi said that Singapore is the company’s largest market, mainly due to the geographical proximity to its farms in Johor. </p>
<p>“We have been exporting to Singapore for the last three, four years. Of late, I think it is gaining very fast traction there as well,” said Loi.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of Singaporeans have started to appreciate our product and I think that in the coming years there will be a lot of effort towards Singapore,” he added.</p>
<p>Farm products are also exported to Brunei, while there are plans to expand to Indonesia and the Philippines. </p>
<p>Today, besides its pilot farm in Kampung Mawai, Farm Fresh has four other farms in Desaru (Johor), Muadzam Shah (Pahang), Taipeng (Perak) and Universiti Putra Malaysia (Selangor).</p>
<p>The number of dairy cows have also grown a hundred-fold, from the initial 60 to 6,000.</p>
<h2>HEAT-RESISTANT HYBRID COWS</h2>
<p>One of Loi’s successful projects, which proved key to Farm Fresh’s production, was his decision to breed cows that could thrive in the tropical climate.</p>
<p>In 2012, The Holstein Milk Company acquired an Australian genetic company that was set up by the Queensland government.</p>
<p>Through cross-breeding, this company developed the Australian-Friesian-Sahiwal cow, a breed more suited to the tropical climate.</p>
<p>Loi said this new breed has been invaluable in ensuring that Farm Fresh maintains a high volume of milk production, as its supply line is “constantly behind demand”.</p>
<p>“It's a very strategic investment for us because all our dairy breeds are coming in from Australia,” said Loi.</p>
<p>“This ensures we have enough generic (breeds) coming back to Malaysia to support our growth,” he added.</p>
<p>Loi, who describes himself as an animal lover, goes out of his way to ensure that the dairy cows are fed with quality grass and have ample space to graze.</p>
<p>While many industries in Malaysia had to halt production amid the Movement Control Order, Farm Fresh continued its operations as milk is considered an essential good.</p>
<p>Loi was wary of COVID-19 clusters breaking out among his employees at the farms and processing facilities.</p>
<p>He saw how COVID-19 cases spread in foreign worker dormitories in Singapore and other parts of Malaysia and decided to take pre-emptive action by housing his workers in rented units.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want them to go out and buy food. So all the lunch and dinners were provided,” said Loi.</p>
<p>“We have to ensure that they adhere to very tight protocols. Thank god over the last one and half years, we have had no incidents,” he added.</p>
<p>Loi said that ensuring the welfare of his dairy cows as well as employees is crucial to the longevity of his business.</p>
<p>“You can grow, you can make money, but then again, how do you treat your animals? Are they well looked after and things like that? And how about your employees?” said Loi.</p>
<p>“I think we wanted to build a brand and some day, people will appreciate this as a company where all our stakeholders from our customers, our employees, our animals, are well taken care of.”</p>

<p>JAKARTA: With full makeup and glitzy outfit, Netha Salsabila used to mesmerise the audience when she performed dangdut, Indonesia’s folk pop music famous for its upbeat melodies.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who goes by the moniker Ranesa Queen, is a dangdut singer in the Indonesian city of Madiun, East Java.</p>
<p>Like many other dangdut performers, she was forced to switch jobs and change her lifestyle because of COVID-19. </p>
<p>When the pandemic broke out last year, her world turned upside down from performing shows at night to cooking food for her customers in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>“The reason I changed my job is that many events were cancelled due to the difficulty of obtaining a permit for holding celebratory events such as weddings and birthdays,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>“So I switched to culinary and now I sell food online such as fried catfish.”</p>
<p>Dangdut performances usually involve singing, live music and dancing.</p>
<p>In a normal situation, they are not difficult to host. However, putting all the elements together during the pandemic is not an easy task, particularly when live events open to a large audience are not allowed.</p>
<p>With the many movement and gathering restrictions imposed in public places, dangdut artistes and musicians have found it difficult to make a living as there are no opportunities for any public performances.</p>
<p>Often touted as the national music of Indonesia, dangdut as a genre arrived in Southeast Asia (namely Indonesia and Malaya) in the late 1950s, said music experts. </p>
<p>Originally developed by infusing Malay music with Hindi and Arabic influences, dangdut in its contemporary version also includes many Indonesian folk elements.</p>
<p>Dangdut’s popularity reached its peak in the 1990s especially in Indonesia when it was both a medium of mass entertainment as well as a platform to promote national messages and popular narratives.</p>
<p>As folk music of sorts, dangdut remains popular to many segments of the Indonesian society today, especially the general public.</p>
<p>Its massive popularity helped to entice many young people including Salsabila to become full-time dangdut singers, musicians or dancers.</p>
<p>But as the COVID-19 situation worsened, many in the dangdut music industry had to bear the brunt of the pandemic with few or no opportunities to perform.</p>
<h2>STRUGGLING TO FIND JOB</h2>
<p>Salsabila became a dangdut singer 17 years ago by accident when a friend asked her to replace a dangdut singer who abruptly cancelled a gig.</p>
<p>“Coincidentally, singing has been my hobby since I was little. So I then joined a group called Sentana. </p>
<p>“I learned a lot from the musicians whom I regard as my own siblings,” said Salsabila. </p>
<p>As a dangdut singer, she could earn about 5 million rupiah (US$350) per month from various performances. </p>
<p>If she had offers to perform in other cities such as in Malang or Tuban, she could even earn up to 7.5 million rupiah in a month.</p>
<p>Currently, she only earns about half of her previous income. </p>
<p>“I miss performing on stage and eating during festivities. Now I only sit at home and cannot gather with fellow artistes.” </p>
<p>Besides, running her own food business is a difficult task where extra patience and tenacity are required, she said. </p>
<p>”Early in the morning I have to be ready and take pictures of the food and upload them to my social media accounts,” she noted, adding that most of her customers approach her on social media. </p>
<p>Another former dangdut singer Novi Listiana, 23, has turned to farming to make ends meet since the pandemic.</p>
<p>Based in Boyolali, Central Java, Listiana previously performed in several villages in her hometown. </p>
<p>“I was a singer not because my voice is good but because I was the only breadwinner in my small family.</p>
<p>“So I had to do it for my family and I had been singing since I was in junior high school in 2013,” she said.</p>
<p>When she got married in 2018, she thought about changing her career and appearance too.</p>
<p>She was concerned that there are people in Muslim-majority Indonesia who disapprove of the way some dangdut female artistes dress and deem it too revealing and “unIslamic”. </p>
<p>As she decided to leave the dangdut music scene, Listiana also found it hard to find a different job especially when the pandemic situation worsened in Indonesia.</p>
<p>“When COVID-19 struck, there were also no requests to perform. I looked for other jobs and couldn’t find any,” she said.</p>
<p>Her musician husband, who played a two-headed drum called kendang, also decided to leave behind his music career.</p>
<p>He taught Listiana some farming skills and since then both husband and wife have been working as smallholder farmers.</p>
<p>“At first I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed. But over time I actually feel happy and now I feel comfortable being a farmer,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>Listiana said that income wise, there was no drop in her earning as she still makes about two million rupiah per month, the same amount she earned as dangdut singer.</p>
<p>Less fortunate though are dangdut musicians such as Agus Suprapto and Listyo Pramono.</p>
<p>Suprapto, who was a dangdut keyboardist for almost two decades, is now an electrical handyman.</p>
<p>He also runs a small food stall and a Playstation 3 (PS3) video game rental service. </p>
<p>“In mid-2020, around July or August, I even had to sell my Yamaha keyboard to buy electronic service tools, a second-hand TV for my PS3 rental service and to set up my stall,” said the 46-year-old. </p>
<p>As a keyboardist, Suprapto used to perform every day during festive seasons and earn about 200,000 to 300,000 rupiah for every show.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he fixes faulty electronic equipment, a skill he taught himself from watching Youtube clips. He gets such requests twice or thrice a week.</p>
<p>“Maybe because of the pandemic, there are fewer requests for repair. At the moment what is important is to survive,” said the father of a preschooler. </p>
<p>He admits that there is both joy and sorrow in being a small-time technician. For instance, he does get upset whenever a client in a village cannot afford to pay him for his service.</p>
<p>But then he also gets to feel their joy when he sees his client’s happiness after their faulty equipment has been fixed again.</p>
<p>“From one client I can get a maximum of 100,000 rupiah. Well, I live in a village,” said the East Java native who lives in Joho village. </p>
<p>“And then there are some who cannot afford to pay for my service because they don’t have money. That’s okay because I know how it feels (not to have money).” </p>
<p>For former dangdut guitarist Listyo Pramono, being unemployed has been a major blow since he lost his job.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old who spent 15 years as a dangdut musician had to work as a labourer in a sugar factory when the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>Even then he would find himself unemployed every now and then since work at the factory is on a seasonal basis only.</p>
<h2>DANGDUT CAN STILL THRIVE: ANALYST</h2>
<p>Music analyst Bens Leo acknowledged that many dangdut artistes and musicians have changed jobs because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But he noted that this was also the case with artistes of other genres as well. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, he believed that dangdut performers as a whole face bigger challenges since there are more of them in Indonesia compared to the rest in the entertainment industry. </p>
<p>With limited opportunities because of the pandemic restrictions, competition for jobs or offers to participate in events was much stiffer among them. </p>
<p>As the COVID-19 situation began to show signs of improvement in Indonesia, many regions have started to open up and small events under strict health protocols were permitted. </p>
<p>Observers like Leo were confident that the dangdut scene would make a strong comeback as many of those involved in the industry felt “dangdut is their DNA”</p>
<p>He believed that dangdut artistes would likely return to the scene as soon as more opportunities for them to perform were available.</p>
<p>Salsabila, the dangdut singer-turned-cook, readily admitted that if there were opportunities, she would go back to singing again.</p>
<p>However, she insisted that her culinary business would come first as her main job, with singing and performing dangdut as a sideline.</p>
<p>“In the entertainment industry, there are newcomers every year, so I’ll focus on my culinary business. But I would be happy if I could do both,” said Salsabila.</p>
<p>Keyboardist Suprapto and guitarist Pramono were also hopeful that the pandemic would be over soon, so they could return to their dangdut music again. </p>
<p>For some like Listiana who have moved on to other things, going back to the dangdut life is not an option anymore.</p>
<p>“I have forgotten the glamorous life because I feel that to be happy, I don’t need to live a sumptuous life.” </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Thailand reports first Omicron COVID-19 cluster, cancels some New Year events </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BANGKOK: Thailand reported on Friday (Dec 24) its first domestic cluster of coronavirus infections from the Omicron variant in Kalasin province in north-eastern Thailand, officials said.</p>
<p>“From the Kalasin cluster, there are 21 new infections,” said the country’s COVID-19 task force spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan.</p>
<p>The infections stem from a couple who travelled from Belgium through the country’s Test Go scheme that waived quarantine for vaccinated arrivals, she said.</p>
<p>Both had tested negative for infections before travelling and after arrival in Thailand in early December.</p>
<p>“By Dec 15, they started having symptoms and tested positive and were later confirmed to have the Omicron variant,” she said.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Thailand’s capital city Bangkok cancelled government-sponsored New Year activity, including midnight prayers</p>
<p>Fireworks and countdown events organised by malls were still going forward, and would require proof of vaccination and antigen test results.</p>
<p>The health ministry also previously said that it would introduce a fourth booster dose for medical personnel.</p>
<p>So far, Thailand has 205 infections from the Omicron variant, mostly in foreign arrivals. Of that number, 25 people were infected with Omicron by those coming from aboard.</p>
<p>Other clusters are being investigated in the country’s south, senior health official Supakit Sirilak told a separate news briefing.</p>
<a>first local transmission</a> of the variant on Monday, and later
<a>reinstated quarantine for foreign arrivals</a>, ending a waiver for vaccinated tourists. A sandbox programme that requires travellers to stay on the resort island of Phuket for seven days remained in place.
<p>"We should follow the protective measures closely and slow down the outbreak as much as possible," Supakit said.</p>
<p>Thailand has reported a total of 2.2 million confirmed COVID-19 infections and 21,528 deaths. About 62 per cent of an estimated 72 million people living in the country have received two doses of vaccinations.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Thousands of flights cancelled globally as Omicron mars Christmas weekend </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK: Commercial airlines around the world cancelled more than 4,300 flights over the Christmas weekend, as a mounting wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant created greater uncertainty and misery for holiday travellers.</p>
<p>The website showed that 1,616 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 365 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.</p>
<p>Commercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the cancelled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.</p>
<p>Among the first US carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>The average number of new US coronavirus cases has risen 45 per cent to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
<p>New York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state's daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>Rising hospitalisations were hitting healthcare systems especially hard in the US Midwest, with intensive care units in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan bracing for the worst even as they remain under pressure from an earlier wave of Delta variant cases.</p>

<p>In Britain, many industries and transport networks were struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolated, while hospitals have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.</p>
<p>One in 20 Londoners had COVID-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics. </p>
<p>Government data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000.</p>
<p>While recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalisations, than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook.</p>
<p>"There is a glimmer of Christmas hope ... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat," Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season.</p>
<p>Instead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city's streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends.</p>
<p>"We just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas," Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York's LaGuardia Airport.</p>
<p>New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year's Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases, capping the number of attendees 15,000.</p>
<p>The Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China's COVID-hit Xi'an city reports rise in infections </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Xi'an in northwest China reported an increase in daily COVID-19 infections for Friday (Dec 24), and local companies curtailed activity as the country's latest COVID-19 hot spot entered its third day of lockdown.</p>
<p>The city of 13 million detected 75 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Friday, its highest daily count of the year and reversing the previous day's decline, official data showed on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the southern city of Shenzhen, five passengers who arrived on Wednesday, on a flight from Los Angeles, tested positive for coronavirus, and three were confirmed to be Omicron infections on Dec 24, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.</p>
<p>Xi'an, which started a new round of mass testing on Saturday, has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant. Nationwide, China has reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China.</p>
<p>"So far the turning point for the outbreak is yet to come, and stringent curbs are necessary," Zhang Boli, who helped to shape China's early COVID-19 response and treatment, told state media.</p>
