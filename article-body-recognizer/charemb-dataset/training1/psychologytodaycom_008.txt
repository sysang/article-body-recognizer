<h2> How being on a losing soccer team was a real "win" for my son. </h2>
<li>Experiencing repeated loss taught my super-competitive son that winning isn't everything.</li>
<li>A supportive coach, encouraging parents, and a connected team made the actual scores of the games far less important.</li>
<li>The true victory of this experience was in the team bonds, the lessons learned, and the strength gained—both inwardly and outwardly.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Cara DiYanni</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>wisdom</a> over the course of the season was a victory far beyond what could happen in any soccer game.
<a>teamwork</a>, and the determination they were learning made them bigger winners than any season’s scorecard could.
<a>smile more</a> when playing in teams than when playing alone, and about how children
<a>can be taught appropriate behaviors</a> in both winning and losing situations. I also found research suggesting that parental behavior, parental control, and parental expectations all
<a>affect their child athletes’ fear of failure</a>, and can lead to higher competitive and
<a>anxious</a> personalities in their children, which, in turn,
<a>influences the children’s expectations and levels of hopelessness</a>.

<li>Complex PTSD is much more prevalent among adults than some might surmise. </li>

<a>caretaker</a>. As adults, the value in this same behavior can look like being a responsible parent, spouse, employee, or friend. In life, they can be reliable, consistent, and persistent. They can demonstrate many qualities of
<a>learned helplessness</a>. Another challenge is to take pride in their efforts and abilities. As adults, the value in this is they can exhibit the strengths of meeting and solving life challenges through competence, problem-solving abilities,
<a>creativity</a>, and a “find-a-way” attitude. They can know exactly what to do in any given situation, or they move to figure it out.

<h2> What Is Adolescence? </h2>
<a>identity</a>; as adolescents cultivate their sense of self, they may face difficult choices about academics,
<a>gender</a> identity, drugs, and
<div> <h3> What are the stages of adolescence? </h3> </div>
<a>different challenges for teens</a> and necessitates different responses from parents.
<div> <h3> What is the purpose of adolescence? </h3> </div>
<a>psychologically and socially transform into a young adult.</a> Breaking from their
<a>attachment</a> and security allows children to acquire freedom and responsibility to develop independence and to differentiate themselves from their parents and childhood to establish their own unique identity.
<div> <h3> Why is puberty so challenging? </h3> </div>
<a>hormonal</a> and biological changes that occur can lead adolescents to feel
<a>anxious and self-conscious and to require more privacy and become preoccupied with their appearance,</a> which can influence how they are perceived and accepted.
<div> <h3> Why do teens make bad decisions and take risks? </h3> </div>
<a>risk-taking</a> is often blamed on hormonal changes, but relationships play a key role as well. The teenage years are devoted to creating friendships that can serve individuals for life. Along those lines, research suggests that
<a>adolescents are motivated by peer acceptance</a> more than adult perceptions—for better or for worse.
<div> <h3> How does sleep change during adolescence? </h3> </div>
<a>sleepy</a> later and therefore wake up later to get the recommended 8 to 10 hours of sleep. This is why later middle and high school start times are associated with
<a>improved attendance and grades as well as a lower likelihood of experiencing depression</a>.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> How Do I Talk to My Teen? </h2>
<p>Speaking openly with adolescents about changes that they are experiencing can be a challenge for any parent, especially given the shift in the parent-child relationship during this time.</p>
<a>intimacy</a> and trust—while simultaneously allowing the teen to process their experience.
<div> <h3> How can I maintain a close relationship with a teen? </h3> </div>
<a>maintain a close relationship</a> despite that process. Express interest and ask questions about your teen’s new passions. Welcome their friends and provide family structure. In disciplinary situations, critique choices rather than character.
<div> <h3> How do I talk to a teen about healthy sex? </h3> </div>
<a>porn</a>, pleasure, and love. During these conversations,
<a>listen openly and non-judgmentally.</a> Shutting down a vulnerable adolescent with negativity or judgment can lead to
<a>fear</a>. Being open encourages them to trust you with future questions and to develop a healthy relationship with sex.
<div> <h3> How do I talk to a teen about drugs and alcohol? </h3> </div>
<a>smoking</a>. But parents can
<a>inform the choices they make with guidance,</a> such as that the decision to use should be intentional, not automatic and a personal choice, not a socially-pressured one. Parents should discuss the topic openly, honestly, and continually.
<div> <h3> How can I support a teen when they’re upset? </h3> </div>
<a>bored</a>, maybe they can find a new hobby or sport. Adolescence can be an emotional time, but
<a>these ideas and others can help</a>.
<h2> How Does Mental Health Change During Adolescence? </h2>
<p>Many of the mental health conditions people confront as adults begin to manifest in adolescence. In fact, <a>one in five</a> young adults has a diagnosable disorder, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<a>depression</a>, and other forms of distress that are developmentally appropriate and will not necessarily endure. It’s difficult to know when a problem merits clinical
<a>attention</a>, but when in doubt, querying a school counselor or another mental professional is the best course of action.
<div> <h3> Why are teenagers today so stressed and anxious? </h3> </div>
<a>91 percent of Generation Z has felt physical or emotional symptoms of stress,</a> such as depression or anxiety. This
<a>stress</a> may be due to parental trends like overscheduling, effects of social media like negative social comparisons, and historical events like the great recession and mass shootings.
<div> <h3> How can I help an anxious teenager? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How common are mental health disorders in college? </h3> </div>
<a>one in three first-year college students</a> meets the criteria for a mental health disorder, research suggests. An array of factors can contribute to the onset of mental illness during this time: the transition to college, childhood
<a>trauma</a>, biological changes, financial stress, academic pressure, lack of sleep,
<a>social isolation</a>, and uncertainty about the future.
<div> <h3> How can I help a college student access mental health care? </h3> </div>
<a>unable to provide treatment</a> due to high demand, your child can explore meeting with other health professionals on campus like a doctor or nurse practitioner, asking a campus case manager to help find care off-campus, and beginning
<div> <h3> What’s the relationship between social media use and mental health? </h3> </div>

<h2> Understanding the Adolescent Mind </h2>
<div> <h3> How does parenting change when adolescence begins? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do teens take so many risks? </h3> </div>
<a>adolescents take greater risks</a> when with their peers than when they are alone.
<div> <h3> Why do teens lose interest in things? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is happening inside teens’ heads? </h3> </div>
<a>The negative voices in a teenager’s head</a> can push them sometimes to seek alone time in their rooms, and at other times to seek to confide in an adult other than a parent.
<div> <h3> Why are teens so preoccupied with their appearance? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does social media really cause depression in teens? </h3> </div>
