<h2> What Is Mild Cognitive Impairment? </h2>
<a>memory</a> loss is the predominant symptom, and non-amnestic impairment, in which other cognitive areas, such as
<a>decision-making</a> or spatial orientation, are primarily affected.
<div> <h3> Is mild cognitive impairment serious? </h3> </div>
<a>middle ground</a> between a normal age-related cognitive loss and more serious diminishment of function. MCI can impact a person’s judgment, speech, and reasoning.
<div> <h3> At what age does cognitive decline start? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>A minor decline in cognitive function can appear as early as the <a>late twenties</a>, but such decline is less pronounced until middle age, and it becomes more and more apparent among septuagenarians and people who are older.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between dementia and mild cognitive impairment? </h3> </div>
<a>Dementia</a> is not the same as mild cognitive impairment.
<a>Dementia</a> can impact a person’s daily living and activities. People with dementia, for example, forget whether they took their

<div> <h3> What factors contribute to MCI? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>It is important to rule out the side effects of medication, neurovascular problems, sleep deprivation, depression, or other factors that may be contributing to MCI and do not represent an underlying neurological process.</p> </div> </div>

<a>2018 report</a> by the American Academy of Neurology. MCI is a complicated condition that involves many potential causes, both genetic and environmental, with age perhaps the most universal factor.
<div> <h3> Can stress cause cognitive impairment? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Chronic <a>stress</a> will increase levels of the <a>hormone</a> cortisol, which in turn can shrink the brain and its function. Stress also contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s as well as dementia.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Is MCI genetic? </h3> </div>
<a>gene</a> is strongly associated with
<a>Alzheimer’s</a> in both men and women. However, it is unclear whether this variant of the gene just influences the chances of getting the diagnosis or if it also promotes conversion of MCI to Alzheimer’s or dementia.
<div> <h3> What are the risk factors for developing MCI? </h3> </div>
<p>You are <a>more likely to develop MCI</a> if: You are advanced in age; carry the APOE ε4 gene; are not intellectually engaged; suffer depression; or have poor health and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or high cholesterol.</p>
