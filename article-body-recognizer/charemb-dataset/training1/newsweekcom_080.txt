<div> Opinion Christmas <a>Holidays</a> <a>American history</a></div>
<p>Christmas is so much more than just a celebration. It's hope and joy—it's a spirit.</p>
<p>Without the Christmas Day sacrifice of our revolutionaries, we might not have the American Christmas we cherish today.</p>
<p>Christmas has historically embodied a spirit of unity in American history. Over the generations, national leaders as well as millions of everyday Americans have lived up to spreading "good will toward men" during the holiday season.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, the Christmas we know now began to take shape. Clement Clarke Moore penned the poem now known as "Twas the night before Christmas" in 1823, which introduced the modern Santa Claus and stockings hung above fireplaces across America.</p>
<a>food and supplies</a> to distribute to civilians in Georgia. The soldiers even tied tree branches to the mules so that they would resemble reindeer.
<p><a>In 1870</a>, President Ulysses S. Grant declared Christmas a national holiday. The new official holiday helped to foster a sense of community and unity across the country.</p>
<p>The first White House Christmas tree appeared in <a>1889 at the behest of President Benjamin Harrison</a>. It's a tradition that continues to this day. The tree was placed in the second floor oval room and decorated with candles.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2, the Bible records that after Jesus was born, angels sang "peace on earth to those on whom God's favor rests." The history of Christmas in America, and throughout the world, is one of unity, of hope and of joy.</p>
<p>This year, let's put all the politics aside, and let's celebrate Christmas. Whether it's a gift exchanged, a church service or a meal shared together, our nation needs Christmas, now more than ever.</p>
<p>Phil Bryant was governor of Mississippi from 2012 to 2020.</p>

<h2><a>Kari 'Fake' Lake and the GOP's 2022 Problem</a></h2>
<div>In many places, GOP strategists and party mandarins find themselves in the unenviable position of having to root out the candidates who are merely mimicking the former president's style and positions to win votes to earn an endorsement.</div>
<h2><a>To Win in 2022, The GOP Should Focus on Its State Success</a></h2>
<div>The GOP leadership needs to reflect on how long it can go before it must posit substantive alternatives to the Democrats' radicalism.</div>
<h2><a>The Progressive Panic Over Justice Breyer</a></h2>
<div>As the Court has moved rightward, it has come under increased scrutiny from liberals and progressives who once accepted its decisions.</div>
<h2><a>Twitter Spies and Foreign Lies: Is Social Media Safe for Democracy?</a></h2>
<div>As social media sites have grown in importance and market cap to become "Big Tech," the public deserves a fuller understanding of whether and how they have sacrificed their noble free speech principles.</div>
<h2><a>America Has to Make High-Tech Medicine Hack-Proof</a></h2>
<div>The danger is real, and the American people understand it, especially after everything we've been through during the pandemic.</div>
<h2><a>The Cheney Conundrum and What It Means for the GOP</a></h2>
<div>To the elites, Wyoming representative Liz Cheney's ouster from the No. 3 position in the House GOP leadership is a big deal.</div>
<h2><a>Senator Tim Scott and the Silent Democrats</a></h2>
<div>The "woke" fancy themselves crusaders engaged in a battle against injustice, racism, inequality and other societal ills they believe have held certain people back since before this country was founded.</div>
<h2><a>Most Voters Don't Want More Judges on the High Court</a></h2>
<div>The Democrats are returning to their roots during Joe Biden's presidency. The Clintonian concession that the "era of big government" was over has been nullified.</div>
<h2><a>For 2024, Pence Is In. Can He Make it?</a></h2>
<div>Pence has a chance to shine now, to step into the spotlight and show America what he'd do and how he'd inspire voters to embrace conservatism redefined.</div>
<h2><a>The GOP Needs A Pro-Growth Message and Pro-Growth Messengers</a></h2>
<div>Growth matters. The Republicans who followed Reagan into the White House either didn't get it or couldn't explain it.</div>
<h2><a>Democratic Delusion and the Conspiracies that Fuel it</a></h2>
<div>The Democrats don't plan to run on their record in the 2022 midterm elections. They plan to go to the voters and argue that Republicans are too crazy to be allowed in Congress.</div>
<h2><a>Saving Washington's Birthday</a></h2>
<div>It was only a matter of time before cancel culture scored a hit in its fight to eliminate the Founders from our collective memory.</div>
<h2><a>John F. Kerry: Climate Warrior or Climate Conman?</a></h2>
<div>The aristocratic and socially well-connected elites who run the Democratic Party nowadays are far removed from the working classes who in the 20th century built the party into a political powerhouse.</div>
<h2><a>When Biden Said 'Unity,' What Did He Mean?</a></h2>
<div>The survival of the American system depends on room continually being made for rigorous, civil, constructive debate, even over topics people find unpleasant.</div>
<h2><a>In Virginia, the GOP May Find its Great New Hope</a></h2>
<div>For the GOP to be competitive once again in elections across the commonwealth, it doesn't have to change its message.</div>
<h2><a>McConnell's Right – The $2000 Checks Are a Bad Idea</a></h2>
<div>The national debt has doubled thanks in no small part to efforts to alleviate the impact of the economic lockdown used to prevent the disease from spreading.</div>
<h2><a>Advice for the GOP: Focus on the House, Think Like Democrats</a></h2>
<div>Forcing self-described Democratic moderates to declare where they stand is the beginning of the fight to keep America from lurching sharply to the left.</div>
<h2><a>What's Biden Hidin'?</a></h2>
<div>Biden has an agenda in mind, and he should be telling the American people what it is. Except he doesn't want to be on the ballot on January 5 any more than he wanted to be on the ballot on November 3.</div>
<h2><a>Progressives Smashed, GOP Surges in Down-Ballot Races</a></h2>
<div>If there's one takeaway from the 2020 election, it's that, despite the aggressive support it received from donors, elected officials, candidates for office and the mainstream media, progressivism is on the decline.</div>

<p>On Jan. 6, 2021, I watched my incredible mother die on a FaceTime call, alone in an intensive care unit bed.</p>
<a>Current Opinion in Critical Care</a> have shown how critical-care hospitalization can lead to PICS-F for family members of ICU patients, which can include depression, anxiety and PTSD.
<a>Symptoms</a> include "nightmares, flashbacks, or frequent intrusive thoughts about the circumstances of the loss" in addition to feeling detached from life, lacking positive feelings, irritability and challenges with sleep. According to psychologists,
<a>traumatic grief is</a> "defined by 6 or more months' persistence of the problems and the degree of enduring functional impairment in individuals complaining of difficulty recovering from loss."
<p>One doctor called a few days in to pressure me to give up and let her die. I had never heard of him before and when the call got cut off after two minutes and I called back, I was told that he would call me back later. He never did.</p>
<a>over 250,000</a> COVID-19 hospitalizations and a
<a>33 percent increase</a> in both direct and indirect mortalities related to the pandemic, according to research from
<a>Stanford University</a> and MIT, our hospitals have become a familiar place for millions across the country. There are countless people currently experiencing PTSD and traumatic grief as a result.
