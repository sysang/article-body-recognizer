<a>told USA Today</a> in 2004 that, while “it’s important we separate fact from fiction,” the movie at least got people talking.
<div><div><p>“We did a press tour all around the world where we educated people about climate change and what it all means,” Emmerich says. “It was interesting, because it was a Hollywood movie.”</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> in Polygon that she wondered whether “Hollywood executives worry that carbon taxes, battery storage technology and Green New Deals aren’t sexy enough topics to drive a compelling story with mainstream appeal.”
<div><div><p>“It’s interesting that policymakers and climate activists are starting to world-build that future,” she says, “but we haven’t really seen that yet in mainstream film.”</p></div></div>

<a>“WALL-E,”</a> a movie with a political bent director Andrew Stanton insisted was unintentional. While promoting the Pixar film
<a>in an interview with New York magazine</a>, the director said he had no “ecological message to push.” It was just about a love story between two robots.
<div><p>“I don’t like being preached to when I watch my entertainment,” he says, recalling that he “didn’t want to come across, even accidentally, like I had something greater to tell than the story of WALL-E.”</p></div>

<a>“Happy Feet,”</a> his Oscar-winning animated film about a tap-dancing penguin that also commented on the dangers of overfishing.
<div><p>“To be a storyteller, you respond to the world that’s around you in all its dimensions,” Miller says. “You can’t help but tell these big, sweeping stories without it becoming part of the story.”</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Travis M. Andrews</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 6, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>The documentary</a> finds the band facing a looming deadline while simultaneously feeling the pull of their individual creative endeavors. Its hours of previously unseen footage find
<a>Ringo Starr</a> in turn collaborating, bickering and laughing; bored, anxious, angry and gleeful. Throughout it all, classic songs like “The Long and Winding Road,” “I Me Mine” and “Don’t Let Me Down” emerge.
<a>McCartney writes</a> the backbone of “Get Back” in minutes, and the sometimes smooth, sometimes arduous process of how to craft a song in the first place. Here’s what they had to say.
<div><div><p><i>These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>You know the Beatles. Here are 16 other important names in the epic ‘Get Back’ series.</p></div>
<p><a><b>Don McLean</b></a><b>, rock musician: </b>What I thought was interesting is I saw another clip where George told them he had a new song called “Something” and he seemed a little scared to play a song for [Lennon and McCartney].</p>
<div><div><p><a><b>Brian Fallon</b></a><b>, solo artist and frontman of the Gaslight Anthem: </b>You watch them do this, and it’s just spitballing. But the truth is you’re literally making something out of nothing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Crutchfield: </b>The fact that they were the most famous band on Earth didn’t seem to matter much in the room when they were just working.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Crutchfield:</b> The part when Paul starting writing “Get Back” is the moment where [Morby’s and my] jaws were on the floor, and we’re like, “This is actually incredible.”</p></div></div>
<p><b>McLean: </b>Paul was in the middle of a very intense creative time period in the 1960s with all of the big groups and the big writers doing their very best work, so there was a lot of pressure to go deep and top yourself, to dig deeper.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Weiner:</b> It’s another day at the office for Paul McCartney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Morby:</b> He’s playing the bass like it’s a guitar, which I’ve never seen done. He’s not even playing basslines. He’s playing chords, as if it’s a guitar.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Ben Bridwell</b></a><b>, frontman of Band of Horses: </b>He can write a song with four strings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Morby: </b>There is a sense of fishing, where you have something on the line and then you have to reel it in. And to reel it in, you have to be very concentrated for the next little while.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fallon: </b>He got that melody, and the words fell out of his mouth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Crutchfield:</b> What struck me is that the song is so powerful, and that’s its earliest form.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Brittney Spencer</b></a><b>, country singer: </b>I think my favorite part is when George starts yawning, but he’s yawning in key, while Paul is playing guitar and mumbling out these melodies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Heidecker: </b>Every idea starts somewhere and somehow. There’s going to be a genesis moment for every piece of media we’ve ever seen. The gift we have is that they were filming it. They were rolling.</p></div></div>
<div><p>John Lennon's most revealing album was his last</p></div>
<div><div><p><i>Many musicians felt validated — if not a bit envious — of McCartney’s process.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Dacus: </b>If people are seeing this and thinking it's a bit of magic, I hope they also realize magic is within anyone's reach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Heidecker</b>: One of the most instructive moments is how many bad ideas there are that get abandoned. The ability to self-edit and criticize themselves and keep working on something until it’s the thing we all know.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Tweedy: </b>Your ego stands in the way and wants everything to automatically feel great and cool. And the reality is it has to sound bad before it sounds good. … These eight hours reaffirm that.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Morby:</b> There’s something kind of amazing to see that the Beatles, they’re just humans like the rest of us.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Covid shutdowns and charges of white supremacy: American museums are in crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>The events of the past year have left their mark on the search process, according to Kevin Gover, undersecretary for museums and culture, the executive in charge of the hiring.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no one profile for a director any longer,” said Gover, who was director of the National Museum of the American Indian before his promotion in January, a move that created one of the six vacancies.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Air and Space Museum makeover estimated to cost almost $1 billion</p></div>
<div><div><p>Though funded primarily by Congress, the project includes $250 million in private donations to modernize the galleries. Officials have raised a little over $100 million toward that goal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Fundraising is important for that museum at this time. But we wouldn’t hire a brilliant fundraiser who doesn’t know the subject,” Gover said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We talk about the unicorn,” he added, referring to the rare executive who fills the unusual requirements for these positions. “We always find people with some combination.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Women are increasingly getting the top museum jobs. Will more of them finally get equal pay?</p></div>
<div><p>Diversity goes beyond representation, Gover added. “We want to be sure candidates are committed to diversity as well, making sure they are aware of the need for a diverse staff, diverse content. It’s a big thing.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“What does it mean to be American anymore? I think the Smithsonian is taking it to heart in important ways,” he said.</p></div></div>
