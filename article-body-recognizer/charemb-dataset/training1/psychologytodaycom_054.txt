<div> <div> <div> <h3> <a>Jim Detert, Ph.D.</a> </h3> <div> <a>Choosing Courage</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h1> Coach or Counselor: Which One Is Right for Me? </h1>
<h2> Part 2 of 2: Understanding when each type of professional may be most helpful. </h2>
<li>A coach can be helpful when looking to develop goals or plans or to work on skills and strategies for navigating specific workplace challenges.</li>
<li>A counselor is more appropriate for help resolving long-term pain or distress, or for diagnoses and treatment of mental health challenges.</li>
<li>Many people are helped by both coaches and counselors—sometimes simultaneously, sometimes sequentially. Switching when appropriate is common.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some distinctions that may help you decide.</p>
<h3>Deciding Between a Coach and a Counselor</h3>
<p>You might choose a coach when:</p>
<li>You’re looking for an independent, skilled perspective on your organizational context and how to most effectively navigate within it.</li>
<li>You’re looking for someone to help you surface, challenge, and change self-limiting beliefs or behaviors that impede progress toward specific goals at work, such as those associated with the <a>imposter syndrome</a>.</li>
<li>You’re looking to develop and practice particular <a>leadership</a> skills (e.g., <a>public speaking</a>, motivating others, leading change, demonstrating <a>openness</a>) under guidance and with accountability.</li>
<li>You’re considering switching careers due to changing interests, life stage, or goals and want help identifying and prioritizing options.</li>
<p>You might choose a counselor when:</p>
<li>You want to explore or deal with the underlying reasons why something—such as a disturbing pattern of behavior in yourself and/or others—is getting in your way.</li>
<li>You want a thorough diagnostic evaluation to help you understand and formulate a plan for addressing the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing distress or unwanted outcomes for yourself or others.</li>
<a>anxiety</a>, or compulsions or addictions—that is affecting your and others’ well-being and therefore needs to be a focal point for your engagement with a professional.
<li>Your work challenges (e.g., feeling chronically dissatisfied or unappreciated) are chronic and pervasive (i.e., lasting for months or years, and <a>cutting</a> across different bosses or organizations) and show up in other areas of your life.</li>
<li>Your distress is sufficiently enduring and intense that it is causing significant disruption to your ability to function and/or find pleasure and meaning in life.</li>
<li>Your reactions to stressors or other workplace experiences seem outsized—for example, you are outraged where others are mildly angry, or you find yourself sobbing about something most around you find slightly upsetting.</li>
<li>You have experienced (or are continuing to experience) a specific <a>trauma</a> or pattern of (physical, <a>sexual</a>, or psychological) abuse and are having unwanted and painful thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.</li>
<h3>Combining and Switching</h3>
<a>coaching</a> might help? It’s probably both.
<a>childhood</a> to his conflict avoidance and need to be perfect. And he’s working in that context to deal with the pain that his father caused and the lingering feelings of worthlessness that still plague him despite his impressive accomplishments.
<a>divorce</a> after catching her husband cheating and is also undergoing treatment for cancer.
<a>time management</a> and delegation skills. She also works with her coach on career planning for what’s next given the major changes in her life.
<a>motivation</a> tactics—may be better served by an expert coach. Conversely, a person in coaching may become so consumed by
<a>alcohol abuse</a> treatment or lose his job. Because he trusted his coach (and was still in
<a>denial</a> about the severity of his disease), he asked her to provide the
<a>substance abuse</a> counseling. She refused and helped him find an appropriate counselor. A year later, after he’d completed rehab and joined AA, he resumed his work with his leadership coach.

<h1> Finding Hope and Security in Relationships </h1>
<h2> How relationships can be used to build hope and positive adjustment. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Motivation? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The ideas I am presenting here are part of a recent chapter I wrote for the upcoming second edition of the Handbook of Hope. This material integrates my work on attachment and hope theories in what I think is a straightforward and intuitive way.</p>
<p>But first I need to be clear on the meaning of hope. The way I am using it, the word “hope” is not a fuzzy feeling or vague wish about the future. </p>
<p>Hope, as defined by my late mentor C. “Rick” Snyder, is a way of thinking in which you expect positive outcomes in life because of your ability to:</p>
<ol><li>Develop clear, challenging, and achievable goals</li> <li>Identify the strategies or pathways to those goals</li> <li>Muster the <a>motivation</a> needed to use those pathways and actively pursue the goals</li> </ol>
<a>depression</a>, anxiety, and greater
<a>happiness</a> and psychological well-being) and physical-health outcomes. They also achieve at higher levels in school, sports, and work. It only makes sense, then, that we should all be in the business of instilling hope in ourselves and in each other.
<p>Even though the process of developing hope starts in early <a>childhood</a>, it continues into adulthood and works in the same way even into old age.</p>
<h3>Developing hope starts with a “secure base”</h3>
<p>The secure base isn’t a physical object. It is composed of those people in our lives who are consistently available and responsive to us during times of need and who support us in pursuing our personally meaningful goals.</p>
<p>According to <a>John Bowlby</a>, the father of attachment theory, the secure-base role is:</p>
<p>According to <a>Ann Wilcock </a>of the University of Canberra in Australia, the goals of exploration are to:</p>
<ol><li>Satisfy basic needs for food and shelter</li> <li>Develop skills, relationships, and strategies needed to guarantee safety</li> <li>Develop the capacity for continued growth and development</li> </ol>
<a>anxious</a> or distressed. The most important thing for the person providing the safe haven to have is sensitivity. Having sensitivity, in this sense, means being
<a>empathic</a>, sympathetic, and showing that you really care.
<div> <h2>Motivation Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>3 Steps to a Relationship Reboot</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Turning Goals into Results</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Empathically attuned parents have a clear knowledge of their children’s abilities, how well they tolerate frustration, and how they react to feedback. This empathic attunement, in turn, helps the parent in providing a secure base.</p>
<p>In providing a secure base, the parent usually acts as an encouraging coach. In this <a>coaching</a> role, the parent is primarily invested in providing support for the child’s autonomy and exploration.</p>
<p>Autonomy support is not controlling. On the contrary, controlling behaviors on the part of the parent/coach should be expected to thwart autonomy and detract from the development of hope.</p>
<p>Research with school-aged children demonstrates that parents must demonstrate:</p>
<li>Sensitivity: the ability to accurately read, understand and support the child emotionally</li>
<li>Autonomy support: the ability to coach and guide the child in a way that matches the child’s developmental level</li>
<p>According to Natasha Whipple and her colleagues at the University of Montreal, autonomy support is based on how much the parent:</p>
<li>Gets involved according to the child’s needs</li>
<li>Adapts goals so that they are optimally challenging yet achievable</li>
<li>Encourages the child in going after the goal, gives useful hints and suggestions, and uses a tone of voice that tells the child that she is there to help</li>
<li>Sees her child’s point of view and shows flexibility in her attempts to keep her child on track</li>
<li>Goes at the child’s pace, provides the child with the opportunity to make choices, and ensures that the child plays an active role in achieving the goal</li>
<p>Whipple’s findings demonstrated that both sensitivity and autonomy support are needed to maximize secure attachment and hope.</p>
<a>self-esteem</a>, and the self-perceived likelihood of achieving specific goals in the future.
<h3>Healthy dependency and learning to rely on others in adulthood</h3>
<a>concentration</a>, and abilities to achieve goals. In other words, controlling or offering support that is not needed or desired will have the effect of diminishing hope and impeding goal pursuits among adults as well as among children.
<p>These and other findings all support Bowlby’s contention that interfering and intrusive behaviors are diametrically opposed to providing sensitive and responsive support and are a prime inhibitor of exploratory behaviors.</p>

<h2> 14 ways to distract yourself from worry or to spend time when you're bored. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Jason Scragz, Flickr CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Sometimes, there’s a reason for worry and nothing we can do about it, at least for now. Then, distraction may be a good alternative. Perhaps you’ll find something sufficiently compelling in the list below.</p>
<a>vape</a> pen and you’re not bored anymore; you're blitzed. And if you want some weed, endless billboards tell us just to click, and it will materialize at your door.
<p>What to do? Often in writing <a>self-help</a> advice, I feel the need to issue the disclaimer that there are no, ahem, magic pills, but might any of these be helpful?</p>
<p>Are you feeling inept? Sometimes, you feel like you can't do anything right, so why, after work, face more possible failure? That can be a downward spiral: The less you do, the less you feel you can do.</p>
<a>depression</a> (deep dives in between periods of relative normalcy), do you want to ride it out? Force yourself to take a baby step upward? See a clinician? Try or adjust an
<a>antidepressant</a>? Personally speaking, a cup of coffee or listening to pump-it-up music helps me, and they don’t hurt my body.
<p>Baby steps. Could you muster some easy, baby steps to improve your life: clean up one corner of one room, eat more mindfully, browse <a>dating</a> profiles, or search LinkedIn's job ads?</p>
<p>Make your fave activities easy to do. What’s an activity or two that you might actually consider doing, even if you're not feeling very motivated?</p>
<li>Maybe you like the idea of creative activity, playing guitar, or writing a short story, but it’s frustrating. What would make it easier and more motivating? Taking a lesson to get you over the hump? Joining a writer’s group?</li>
<a>competition</a>? I would think that many Psychology Today readers prefer gentler games. My fave is
<a>Stardew Valley</a>, in which you build a farm from scratch, become part of a community, explore caves, and make friends and lovers. Addictive.
<p>Other ways to address boredom or distract yourself from worry:</p>
<li> <p>Bury yourself in work. Stay longer at work, and maybe bring some home?</p> </li>
<li> <p>Help someone. Call a needy friend? Volunteer somewhere, like tutor at a school or library? Be a Big Brother/Big Sister?</p> </li>
<li> <p>Drive—Uber and Lyft jobs are easy and fast to get. There may be little room left in your brain for worrying if you’re talking to customers while negotiating traffic and/or listening to the radio.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Take on a physical challenge: ski, rock-climb, train for a 10K. These tend to be absorbing.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Write fiction, non-fiction, whatever. It uses all your brain, leaving little left for worry.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Clean. Your car? The room you’re most motivated to clean? The tub? I’ll bet it has all sorts of crud in all sorts of corners.</p> </li>
<li>Tackle your to-do list's optionals. Want to rearrange your living room, search for a better deal on your pricey insurance, call that relative you know you should call?</li>
<a>repeat</a> and have often listened to that 10-minute piece a few times in a row.
<p>So, what, if anything, do you want to add to or subtract from your repertoire of responses to boredom or worry?</p>
