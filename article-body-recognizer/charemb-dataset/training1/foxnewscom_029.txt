<h1>CDC shortens recommended isolation, quarantine period for COVID-19 infected patients amid staffing shortages</h1>
<h2>Individuals with COVID-19 are now recommended to quarantine for just five days if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask</h2>
<div><div><h4><a> Dr. Siegel says vaccines should provide protection from new coronavirus variants</a></h4> <p>Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel provides insight on the new omicron coronavirus variant.</p></div></div>
<p>The CDC cut the recommended isolation time for people with <a>COVID-19</a> from 10 days to five days on Monday amid a surge in omicron cases nationwide. </p>
<a>including major airlines </a>during the holiday season, experience severe staffing shortages because of omicron cases. Multiple airlines have delayed or canceled hundreds of flights nationwide at the height of the Christmas travel season.
<p>Individuals who are infected may now isolate for just five days if they're asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around other people. </p>
<p>In addition, only people who have received a <a>booster shot</a> are exempted from quarantine after being exposed to COVID-19. </p>
<p>For everyone else – including people who are six months out from their second mRNA dose or two months out from the Johnson Johnson vaccine – a five-day quarantine period is now recommended instead of 10 days. </p>

<p>The omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa last month, is rapidly spreading in the United States. It was responsible for 73.2% of all new cases for the week that ended Dec. 18.</p>
<p>The CDC's new guidance comes less than a week after the agency loosened guidance for health care workers who test positive, cutting the isolation period from 10 days to as short as five days if there are staffing shortages. </p>

<h1>State Dept. to extend measure allowing use of expired passports to help Americans return home</h1>
<p>The U.S. <a>State Department</a> announced Tuesday that it will continue to temporarily allow Americans to use expired passports to "return from abroad directly to the United States" amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<a>announcement</a>. "Certain criteria apply, and we encourage U.S. citizens to confirm their eligibility for traveling on an expired passport."
<div> <div><p> Los Angeles International Airport, January 21, 2018 (iStock) </p></div></div>
<p>The move, made in an attempt to further "lessen travel difficulties created" by the pandemic, is a coordinated effort between the State Department, the <a>Department of Homeland Security</a> and commercial airlines.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 6, U.S. citizens seeking to fly back to the country, regardless of vaccination status, must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test result taken within the 24 hours before their flight's departure time.</p>
<p>In May, the State Department announced it would allow U.S. citizens abroad to use an expired passport to regain entry until Dec. 31. At that time, the expired passports were required to be undamaged, unaltered and in the traveler's possession.</p>

<h1>Biden admin's Iran nuclear talks 'not going well,' national security adviser says</h1>
<h2>The U.S. and its allies warn Iran their patience is waning on reaching a nuclear agreement</h2>
<p>National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan took an ominous tone Friday when speaking about efforts to bring <a>Iran</a> back in line with a 2015 nuclear agreement saying, "It's not going well."</p>
<p>"We do not yet have a pathway back into the JCPOA," he said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.</p>

<div> <div><p> President Hassan Rouhani, second right, listens to head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi while visiting an exhibition of Iran's new nuclear achievements in Tehran, Iran, in April. </p></div></div>
<p>Sullivan said there has been "some progress" over the last few days but did not appear hopeful that a concrete resolution would be found following months of indirect talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>President Biden made it a top priority for his administration to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and re-enter the JCPOA, which fell apart after the Trump administration removed the U.S. from the agreement in 2018.</p>
<p>While European allies warned the move could weaken the nuclear agreement, the Trump administration <a>maintained</a> its withdrawal did not void Iran’s part of the bargain. </p>
<p>But by the end of Trump's time in office, Iran began blocking access to international inspections of its nuclear facilities and continued developing its nuclear capabilities. </p>
<p>"Since we walked away from a deal that had fundamentally put a lid on Iran's nuclear program, they have raced that program forward," Sullivan said Friday, speaking from an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>The election of anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi in June only further stonewalled Western efforts to negotiate with Tehran, and Iran has repeatedly paused talks with the other signatories of the JCPOA.</p>

<p>Officials from France, Germany, the U.K and the U.S. have <a>repeatedly warned</a> over the last several weeks that the time to negotiate is running out. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to circle a date on the calendar next week or next month, but I will say that as they continue to move their program forward, it does imperil the fundamental viability of the JCPOA over time," he added. </p>

<p>The Air Force spokesperson said that both crew members are also abiding by "host nation protocols."</p>
<p>Price told reporters that out of "an abundance of caution" the trip was canceled early.</p>
<p>"In order to mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and to prioritize the health and safety of the U.S. traveling party and those they would otherwise come into contact with, the secretary would be returning to Washington, D.C.," he said.</p>

<p>"What’s happening in Yuma right now, it’s basically overrun," he said, adding how he saw groups of 30 or 40 migrants walking in at a time. "It’s just so casual. It’s not extraordinary anymore to illegally cross our borders."</p>

<h1>2021: The year Biden's approval ratings sank slowly underwater</h1>
<h2>Biden started his presidency with positive poll numbers but ends 2021 in negative territory</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>President Biden joked earlier this month that he doesn’t follow his poll numbers "anymore."</p>
<p>In an appearance on the late-night talk shows, Biden quipped to <a>"Tonight Show"</a> host Jimmy Fallon that he kept an eye on his approval ratings earlier in his presidency, "but now that they’re in the 40s, I don't pay attention."</p>
<p>All kidding aside, it would be understandable if the president avoided closely watching his polls as his once solid numbers have slid five straight months.</p>
<p><a>NO LETUP IN BIDEN POLLING DOLDRUMS</a></p>

<p>The plunge in the president's approval was also fueled by the surge since the summer in <a>consumer prices</a> and to a lesser degree the surge this year of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the <a>southern border</a> with Mexico.</p>
<p>By mid-November, Biden's approval had sunk below 40% in two well-known national polls from ABC News/Washington Post and Quinnipiac University.</p>
<p><a>WHERE BIDEN STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING</a></p>
<p>Just ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s holiday break, Biden stood at 44%-53% in an average of the latest polls compiled by <a>Real Clear Politics</a> and at 43%-51% in an average by <a>FiveThirtyEight</a>.</p>
<p>There’s continued cause for concern once you get past the top lines in the recent surveys. Biden's approval on most major issues is also underwater, and he’s seen deterioration with key voting blocs.</p>

<p><a>DO VOTERS THINK BIDEN'S POLICIES ARE FUELING INFLATION?</a></p>
<a>George W. Bush</a> stood at 84%-12% in late December 2001, with his numbers skyrocketing as the country rallied around the government in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Former Presidents
<a>Barack Obama</a> and Bill Clinton stood at 50%-45% and 54%-40%, respectively, at the end of their first years in office.
<p>The only recent president whose poll numbers were worse than Biden's at this point during a White House tenure was <a>Donald Trump,</a> who stood at 39%-56% as 2017 was coming to a close.</p>

<p>John Anzalone, the veteran Democratic pollster who conducted surveys for Biden in the 2020 campaign, told Fox News that "we all know that voters are in a sour mood."</p>
<p>But Anzalone, who along with Fabrizio conducts polling for the Wall Street Journal, noted that "it's December 2021, and you fast-forward 10 months, and it might be a heck of a lot different."</p>
<p>"The reality is there's no modern president who's had the confluence of challenges like Joe Biden," Anzalone emphasized. "People tend to reward leaders who've gone through challenges and handled them well and got out of it."</p>
<p>While acknowledging that it's "not a fun time to be in right now," he stressed that "Joe Biden just doesn’t give up. He's going to keep moving forward and get things done. He's the eternal optimist."</p>

<h1>Chris Christie slams Phil Murphy over NJ Dem's Italy vacation</h1>
<h2>New Jersey's Democrat governor has been spending time with his family at their 23-room villa</h2>
<p>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had a few words to say this week about his Democrat successor, Phil Murphy, jetting off to Italy for a vacation with his family.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The fact that … he’s sitting in Italy should tell you a little bit how seriously the governor takes his job." </p> — Chris Christie, former New Jersey governor</blockquote>
<p>Christie advised Jack Ciattarelli – Murphy’s Republican opponent in this year’s upcoming gubernatorial election – to take advantage of Murphy’s absence as a chance to convince voters that Murphy should be denied a second term, the report said.</p>
<p>"He’s got plenty of material to work with, in my opinion," Christie said, urging Ciattarelli to hammer away at Murphy over his coronavirus policies and other issues.</p>
<p>Ciattarelli has been running a TV spot that includes a video clip of Murphy suggesting that voters should move away if their top concern is the state’s high taxes.</p>

<p>"If you’re a one-issue voter, and the tax rate is your issue, we’re probably not your state," Murphy says in the clip.</p>
<p>"Not your state? Who says that?" Ciattarelli responds. "Phil Murphy just doesn’t get it."</p>
<p>Christie, 58, a Republican who held the state’s top job from 2010 to 2018, claimed that Murphy’s willingness to leave the country for a personal holiday was sending the wrong message to voters.</p>

<p>"He’s sending a message in the midst of everything else going on in this state – a very interesting message for him to send," Christie said, <a>according to Insider NJ</a>.</p>
<p>The Democrat was criticized for previous Italy trips, including one taken in 2018, after he had been in office only about six months.</p>
<p>The Murphys appear to take their summer vacations close to their birthdays. First lady Tammy Murphy turned 56 on Aug. 5, while Phil Murphy turned 64 on Monday.</p>

<a>despite polls</a> indicating the incumbent was in for a comfortable victory in the state he won by over 14 points during his first run in 2017. President Biden also
<a>won the state</a> easily just one year ago, defeating Donald Trump by nearly 16 points.
<p>The incumbent faced several challenges throughout the race, including criticism of his decision to order nursing homes to readmit patients who were recovering from COVID-19, a move some critics said led to unnecessary loss of life. </p>
<p>In remarks late Tuesday as the election hung in the balance, Murphy promised to spend the next four years helping people in the state "achieve their American dream."</p>
