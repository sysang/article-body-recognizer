<div><div><p>South Korean officials have a message for pet owners in Seoul: Beware, your cat might burn your house down.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The warning comes as the capital’s Metropolitan Fire Disaster Headquarters estimated that more than 100 fires over the past three years were started by cats, many of which managed to turn on electric stoves with their furry paws.</p></div>
<div><div><p>According to the agency, 107 fires sparked by felines were recorded between January 2019 and November 2021. Nearly half of those were started when the owners were out of the house, officials said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the recorded incidents, four people were injured. But often the pets themselves do not survive.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>In the United States, almost 1,000 home fires each year are started by pets, according to the National Fire Protection Association, although it remains unclear what percentage of these blazes are started by cats.
<div><p>People have abandoned hundreds of cats on a deserted Brazilian island. Officials aren’t sure how to save them.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Korean officials have recommended that people keep flammable objects such as paper towels away from their cooking devices to help prevent such accidents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cats can also be heroes in a house fire.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Omicron is unlikely to be the coronavirus’s last variant of concern, World Health Organization officials said Thursday, noting the virus will continue to mutate as it circulates.</p></div></div>
<p>Speaking during a news briefing, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said there is “still a lot of energy in this virus.” When the delta variant emerged, he said, some scientists wondered how it could adapt further when it had become so fit.</p>
<div><div><p>“And yet, we’ve seen a further variant emerge that is even more transmissible than delta, which was itself more transmissible than previous variants,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging-disease and zoonosis unit, said the question is what kinds of mutations happen in the future — and what their effect on the severity of the virus will be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no inevitability that the next variant will be less severe or more severe,” she said. “We just have to see what happens as this virus evolves.”</p></div></div>

<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>

<h2>Fauci draws a line on New Year’s Eve parties — no big crowds, and moderate the ‘hugging and kissing’ </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Joel Achenbach</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Yasmeen Abutaleb</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 7:25 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>As the coronavirus spawns a record-breaking wave of infections, new research suggests that rapid tests widely used to identify potential covid-19 cases might be less effective at identifying illness caused by the swiftly spreading omicron variant.</p>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>The finding is the latest complication for anyone trying to strike a common-sense balance between being vigilant and <a>returning to normalcy</a> as the country approaches the third year of the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<a>new guidance</a> that lowered the isolation recommendations for people infected with the coronavirus, and who are asymptomatic or showing improvement in symptoms, from 10 days to five.
<a>less likely to cause severe illness</a>, Anthony S. Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said Wednesday in an interview with The Post.
<div><div><p>But for people who are unvaccinated and have not been infected previously, he cautioned, “It is not going to be just a common cold.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So what about New Year’s Eve? Party? No party? Fauci’s guidance is to keep it small, ideally with family and close friends known to be vaccinated and prudent in their behavior.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>At the same time, however, the tests, which are designed to quickly tell a person if they’re infected, have become harder to find.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>High demand has left major retailers such as Walmart, Walgreens and CVS struggling to keep kits stocked in stores, and online orders have also been affected.</p></div></div>

<div><div>Thousands who ‘followed the rules’ are getting covid. They shouldn’t be ashamed.</div></div>
<div><div><p>The answer is no, according to research. In fact, focusing on adages, such as “It’s the thought that counts,” isn’t necessarily the best approach to gift giving.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what experts say about some popular gifting beliefs, and here are their tips for giving holiday presents in a way that can help optimize happiness and connection.</p></div></div>
<div><p>2021 Holiday Gift Guide</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>It’s the thought that counts</div></h3></div></div>
<a>published research in 2012</a> that examined the cliche. “Putting a lot of thought, spending time thinking about what a recipient might like tends to make the givers feel closer and more connected to a receiver.”
<div><div><p>But recipients often “are not having your thoughts,” Epley said. His research suggests that, when people receive gifts, the “dominant effect” of the gift is how much the person likes it.</p></div></div>

<a>Mary Steffel</a>, an associate professor of marketing at Northeastern University who
<a>has studied gift giving</a>. “Givers often end up overshooting, getting things that are maybe more unique or more narrow than what the receiver might want.”
<a>Sam Maglio</a>, a consumer psychologist. “All the thought and mental effort in the world isn’t going to get you inside somebody else’s head as well as consulting a wish list.”
<div><p>Sustainable gift-giving is on the rise. Here are a few ideas for the holiday season.</p></div>

<div><p>Why having too much free time can be as bad for you as having too little</p></div>
<div><div><p>“You can frame the gift as an experience that they will have consuming it,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Give from the heart</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Giving from the heart can also take the form of sentimental gifts, experts said. <a>Research shows</a> that givers tend to shy away from sentimentality more than they should, because recipients actually appreciate presents with emotional value.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>It’s better to give than to receive</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not necessarily, experts said. “Giving love is a blessing, and so is receiving love,” Franco said. “One doesn’t have to be superior to the other.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maglio encouraged givers to ask some key questions: Would you really want it? What would it be like to own and use this gift? How can you give a gift that’s more practical or functional?</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Sleep doesn’t always come easily to Rebecca Robbins. That might be surprising to people who know her, because Robbins is a sleep researcher, but “I am not immune to these things,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>Tips for starting and getting the most out of therapy</a></div></div>
<div><p>How to choose the best sleeping position, and why it matters</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you want to sleep better, you have to work at it,” Canapari said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Do you have a weird question about sleep? Ask The Post's Wellness team.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is the process of falling asleep?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>A person’s sleep-wake cycle is largely influenced by <a>the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian drive</a>, experts said.</p></div></div>
<p>“What makes people sleep is when your circadian rhythm dips down for sleep and at the same time your homeostatic drive is really high to make you sleep,” Dasgupta said. “So, when you get that pairing, boom, you sleep.”</p>
<div><p>Why you snore, when to be concerned and how to stop</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What makes this process difficult for some people?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some people are just predisposed to developing insomnia, Dasgupta said, whereas others’ sleep woes may be the result of underlying health conditions, an undiagnosed sleep disorder or certain medications.</p></div></div>
<a>Sleep problems</a> have been pervasive during the coronavirus pandemic, which has also been responsible for
<a>increased mental health challenges</a>, including stress, anxiety and depression.
<div><p>The pros and cons of sleeping with pets</p></div>
<a>delay your body clock</a>, while stress and anxiety can
<a>activate the body’s “fight or flight” response</a> and increase the number of neurotransmitters that make you feel more alert.
<div><div><p>Racing thoughts, a form of cognitive hyper-arousal, are one of the main barriers to falling asleep, said <a>Michael Smith</a>, a behavioral sleep medicine expert at Johns Hopkins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In some cases, this frustration can lead to bad habits, such as spending too much time in bed or drinking alcohol, which may worsen insomnia, Dasgupta said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although people need to recognize that sleep is critical, Kolla said, he cautioned against overthinking. “The more you try to pay attention to it and optimize, the more difficult sometimes it tends to get.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What should I do if I can’t sleep?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most experts recommend a change in behavior. <a>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia</a> is widely considered by experts to be the front-line, gold-standard treatment for chronic insomnia.</p></div></div>
<a>environment conducive to sleep</a>, give yourself time to prepare for bed. That means unplugging from screens and using the time to wind down with relaxing activities, such as
<a>taking a warm bath or shower</a>, reading (preferably a boring book) or practicing meditation and mindfulness.
<div><p>Save your skin: How you shower matters more than when, dermatologists say</p></div>
<p>For those with racing thoughts, Smith recommends trying different relaxation exercises to help initiate sleep, such as <a>abdominal breathing</a>, <a>progressive muscle relaxation</a> or imagining scenes you might find pleasant or relaxing.</p>
<div><p>A night cap may get you to sleep, but studies show it will also make you sleep less well</p></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re struggling to fall asleep, get out of bed. “You don’t want to pair your bed and bedroom with being awake and worrying, because then that becomes a habit in and of itself,” Smith said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Once you’re out of bed, keep the lights low and “do anything that’s mind-numbingly boring,” Robbins said. When you feel tired, get back into bed, but be aware that it might take a few tries.</p></div></div>
<p>It’s important, however, to be realistic and patient<b> </b>about progress. Try to stick with a regimen for at least a month and see whether you can gain even 15 more minutes of sleep, Morse said. “Small steps are big wins.”</p>
<div><div><p>One bad night of sleep also isn’t the end of the world, experts said. “You can optimize things all you want, but once in a while, everybody’s going to have a bad night,” Canapari said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Just read a book, do something relaxing, drink a cup of tea and then try to go to sleep when you feel tired. You’re going to be okay the next day.”</p></div></div>
