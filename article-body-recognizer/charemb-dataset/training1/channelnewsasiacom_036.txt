<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Golden Village-Cathay merger proposed; will become Singapore's largest cinema operator if approved </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The merger would make the combined business the largest cinema operator in Singapore.</p>
<p>mm2 Asia, a Singapore-listed company, also operates 14 cinemas in Malaysia under Cathay Cineplexes Malaysia, Mega Cinemas and Lotus Fivestar brands. </p>
<p>Orange Sky Golden Harvest owns 14 Golden Village cinemas in Singapore and is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p>
<a>COVID-19</a> outbreak, the company said in a filing with the Singapore Exchange.
<p>There has also been "general disruption to the movie and cinema business, with the advent of content streaming apps and the growth of video content on social media", mm2 Asia said.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Cinemas look forward to increasing operating capacity as COVID-19 restrictions ease</a></h3>
<p>"The merger would result in a stronger platform for the operation of the cinema business," it added.</p>
<p>The merger is subject to approval from shareholders from both mm2 Asia and Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment. </p>
<p>It also requires approval from the Singapore Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange, as well as government authorities such as the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, mm2 Asia also announced plans for a possible spinoff of its cinema business by way of a listing on the Catalist board.</p>
<p>It is currently being proceeded with in parallel with the work on the proposed merger, mm2 Asia said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If the listing is completed successfully, mm2 and Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment will discuss "in good faith the basis on which the merger and proposed transaction would take place, taking into account the listed spinoff business".</p>
<p>mm2 Asia also said the two sides are discussing the financial terms based on operating figures from financial year 2019, subject to mutually agreed adjustments.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Cinemas, religious organisations to cut capacity to 100 people to avoid pre-event testing requirement </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aqil Haziq Mahmud </a> </div> </div>
<p>This comes after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Tuesday (May 4) several measures to stem a recent rise of COVID-19 cases in the community.</p>
<p>Attendees who undergo pre-event testing, which can be in the form of an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, must produce a negative result before being allowed to enter the venue.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Singapore returns to tighter COVID-19 measures - What's allowed under the new rules?</a></h3>
<p>Pre-event testing helps to reduce the risk of infected individuals transmitting the virus to other people at the event, said MOH on its website. This minimises the likelihood of an outbreak occurring at events, businesses or activities.</p>
<p>Pre-event testing has been <a>piloted from October last year</a> at meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) and live sports events in Singapore.</p>

<p>CHURCHES, MOSQUES TO SCALE BACK SERVICES TO 100 PEOPLE</p>
<p><a>Up to 250 people</a> have been allowed back at places of worship since Dec 28 last year, when Singapore entered Phase 3 of its reopening.</p>
<p>The Amazing Grace Presbyterian Church at Upper East Coast Road said it currently holds two services with more than 100 attendees each week. It does not "intend to conduct any pre-event testing for the time being", a spokesperson told CNA.</p>
<p>"We have merely limited the number of congregants to 100 people per service with effect this Sunday," said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>The church has reached out to its congregants regarding this new requirement, but said it will "need a few Sundays to observe their response".</p>
<p>"So far, (there has been) no major reaction," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the spokesperson said it is not feasible for the church to introduce pre-event testing, and that its services can also be conducted virtually.</p>
<p>"We understand that the pre-event testing is a massive thing and we don’t have the required manpower to operate," the spokesperson added. "Moreover the cost can be about S$50 per person per event."</p>
<h3><a>READ: Enhanced precautionary measures for religious organisations under tightened COVID-19 measures</a></h3>
<p>Likewise, the Heart of God Church in Eunos said it also plans to limit its worship services to 100 people and is "now looking into ways of making 250-person services possible".</p>
<p>"We understand that heightened alert is necessary in the fight against COVID-19," Pastor Charleston Lim told CNA.</p>
<p>"Our in-person and online worship services run by youths give us the flexibility to align with updated community measures quickly."</p>
<p>In a media release on Wednesday, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) said it will scale back each congregational prayer session to 100 persons from May 8.</p>
<p>It also said that it will study the feasibility of implementing pre-event testing procedures at mosques, "given the cost and operational considerations involved, to allow for larger congregational prayers".</p>

<p>PRE-EVENT TESTING "NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE": CATHAY CINEPLEXES</p>
<p>As for cinemas, a Cathay Cineplexes spokesperson told CNA that 25 out of its 64 halls across eight outlets can hold more than 100 guests with safe distancing.</p>
<p>It was earlier announced that from Apr 24, cinemas would be able to accommodate up to 250 guests, up from 50 patrons per hall during when they first re-opened.</p>
<p>"Attendance is usually dependent on the content and we do see an increase in occupancy rate whenever there is a blockbuster release," a Cathay spokesperson said.</p>
<p>But following Tuesday's announcement, the cinema operator said it will not allow more than 100 guests per hall and is already updating its seating capacities across all halls to adhere to the new requirement.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we will not have any screenings with the required pre-event testing," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"Having gone through even stricter measures during Phase 2 when we reopened last year, we feel that Cathay Cineplexes are well-adjusted to managing the new seating capacities and safety measures that have been announced."</p>
<p>When asked about the decision to not implement pre-event testing, the spokesperson said that it is "not a commercially viable option" because of the additional costs involved and "huge inconvenience caused to our guests".</p>
<p>"We believe that the measures are implemented to keep our guests safe, and will adhere to the recommended restrictions," the spokesperson added.</p>
<h3><a>WATCH: COVID-19: Pre-event testing costs expected to go down</a></h3>
<p>A Golden Village spokesperson told CNA that it will also introduce a 100-patron limit per screening so guests do not need to go for pre-event testing.</p>
<p>Since Golden Village resumed services, it has always operated below 50 per cent capacity, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"Whilst it is undeniable that the latest announcement would see a decrease in our overall seating capacity, Golden Village strives to mitigate such challenges," the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>"The safety of our patrons is our main priority and we will work closely with the authorities to ensure that our cinemas remain safe for all of them."</p>

<h1> Commentary: Is this the end of movie theatres in Singapore as we know it? </h1>
<div> <p>Cinemas have had it bad with curbs on audience sizes but there’s little to doubt we will fly back once it’s safe to again, says Nikki Draper of NTU Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nikki Draper </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Predicting the future of cinemas in the middle of a pandemic can be dicey.</p>
<p>If <a>travel bubbles closing</a> before they open has taught us anything, it’s a lesson about uncertainty.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am a streaming enthusiast, with a deep love for television. I appreciate how streaming and cable TV filled a gap and satisfied a need in a pandemic-ridden 2020.</p>
<p>Stuck at home, people turned to them for distraction and found ways to connect with friends and family. But our entertainment options were artificially restricted due to our circumstances.</p>
<p>What happens when we have full choice again? The situation for cinemas in Singapore and globally is concerning. The challenges aren’t small.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The rise of streaming and decline of cable TV will benefit consumers most</a></h3>
<p>CINEMA AS THE COMMON COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>Public policy and government assistance will be key to recovery for culture industries, including cinemas.</p>
<p>In September 2020, the OECD published a report looking at COVID-19’s impact globally on culture industries and making a case for the importance of creative sectors in cities’ economic footprint and employment.</p>
<p>Including cinemas in this group acknowledges the worth of that shared experience of watching movies in social spaces. That recognition is a good foundation that justifies public assistance.</p>
<p>This is especially true in Singapore, which has one of the world’s highest per capita movie attendances, a whopping 18.5 million in 2019 that plummeted to 4.6 million in 2020, according to the Singapore Film Commission.</p>
<p>That’s a big and scary drop. Some of it is surely due to the attendance cap imposed for safety.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder cinema operators lamented when Singapore added restrictions for cinema halls in mid-May. But the decent numbers last year suggest the audience appetite is there.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Why we missed dining out in Singapore these few weeks</a></h3>
<p>WHEN CINEMAS CLOSE, THE OTHER BUSINESSES IMPACTED</p>
<p>The second important takeaway from the OECD report is how cultural industries operate within an ecosystem. If we let our cinemas disappear, this will impact other businesses.</p>
<p>What could that look like locally? Singapore has 274 cinema outlets. Closing these purpose-built venues would impact commercial real-estate.</p>
<p>These venues also have projection equipment and sound systems that require servicing.</p>
<p>Our cinemas are primarily situated in malls with other stores and FB outlets. What happens when shopping centres don’t have that foot traffic?</p>
<p>Many local film festivals, like the Singapore International Film Festival, partner with Singapore cinemas. If we lose those screening spaces, we will almost certainly lose some festivals and the regional and independent films they showcase.</p>
<p>Currently, the Singapore Government appears inclined to preserve cinemas until the retail, arts and culture industries can adjust to the new normal. They’ve included cinema operators and their employees in the Jobs Support Scheme.</p>

<p>THE RISE AND RISE OF STREAMING</p>
<p>The second structural factor that will influence Singapore’s cinema landscape post-pandemic are the decisions studios make about releasing films.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of television, there has been a dilution of entertainment consumption – consumers have new choices over how they spend their time and dollars.</p>
<p>The number of options has steadily grown - with streaming services the most recent competitor.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The beautiful, horrifying, worst yet best show ever that is Game of Thrones</a></h3>
<p>Studios might not have found their formula yet, but Disney+ and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are an interesting possibility of how they might use both platforms to their advantage.</p>

<p>WHY WE WILL BE BACK IN NO TIME</p>
<p>So the big question remains: Will people still want cinema experiences? Streaming has made inroads that will be hard for theaters to overcome. One obvious challenge is comfort.</p>
<p>In my house, I have my favourite snacks, no one to block my view or interrupt with their phones, and can schedule watch parties with family. How can cinemas compete with that?</p>
<p>What pleasure can I derive from watching a film in a theatre? One common argument is that the pleasure of cinemas is technical.</p>
<p>Big screens and surround sound give us access to visual and aural quality not available at home. This is a favourite argument of major directors who say that their films are made for cinemas and that’s how they prefer we watch them.</p>
<p>That is true to some extent. But, to me, technical quality is often not the most memorable aspect of watching in a theatre.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Cinemas are on life support – and could look vastly different soon</a></h3>
<p>The pleasure was in participating in a live audience, the thrill of being around other people moved in the same way you are at a film’s twists, sad moments and jokes.</p>
<p>It’s our collective gasp when Thanos snaps his fingers in Avengers: End Game or when Spiderman disappeared in Avengers: Infinity War.</p>
<p>We could say cinemas are part of an experience economy that go beyond service delivery. These shared emotions connect us in that specific moment and place, creating something unique that adds to our enjoyment of a film.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt cinemas and streaming compete for our attention. But cinemas are still relevant, especially now. </p>
<p>If you don’t believe me, wait until cinemas can reopen with fewer restrictions on crowds. Most of us will be back in no time.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Cinemas are on life support – and could look vastly different soon </h1>
<div> <p>The global entertainment industry has ground to a halt because of the pandemic, with the American film industry in a particular bind. But it has weathered worse storms and there’s hope for this one too, says an observer.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Matthew Jordan </a> </div> </div>
<p>PITTSBURGH, Pensylvannia: Since the start of the pandemic, the film industry has been in free fall. </p>
<p>As deaths have continued to climb, so have studio losses, with crowded theatres – once a source of collective entertainment and escapism – now seen as petri dishes for the virus.</p>
<p>Familiar blockbuster franchises whose summer releases studios banked on to balance bleeding ledgers have been barred from shuttered theaters. </p>
<p>The 25th James Bond film, No Time to Die, the 7th Mission Impossible, Marvel Universe’s Black Widow, Wonder Woman 1984 and Spider-Man’s latest iteration, the sequel to Far From Home, have all been delayed. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: My favourite James Bond? Roger Moore. Nobody played the British spy better</a></h3>
<p>The billions of dollars invested in producing and marketing these films alone are sums that could make or break the studios.</p>
<p>Desperate to survive, AMC – the biggest of the three mega-chains of theatres – and movie studio Universal recently agreed to cut the exclusive theatrical release time down from 90 to 17 days before films could be streamed. </p>
<p>Huge opening releases have long been crucial for both theatre chains and studios, so AMC giving up its biggest source of revenue for a small cut of Universal’s profits can be seen as a sign of desperation.</p>
<p>The motion picture industry has endured pandemics and the threat of home viewing before. But in each instance, the existing way of doing things was upended.</p>
<p>During the current crisis, it seems that shifts in the industry that have been going on for some time are accelerating. While the movie theatre will likely survive, moviegoers can expect a change in what they can see on the big screen.</p>

<p>THE FIRST TIME ‘FLU BANS’ UPENDED THE INDUSTRY</p>
<p>Before World War I, the American motion picture industry was a loose collection of independent film producers, distributors and approximately 20,000 theater owners. </p>
<p>Theatres were forced to close off-and-on for months due to public health decrees. Theatres that needed ticket sales to recoup advanced rental fees fought to stay open using strategies that are eerily familiar to our COVID-19 moment. </p>
<p>Industry leaders lobbied governments to let them reopen. Theatre owners denounced “flu hysteria” and handed out gauze masks to patrons.</p>
<p>Even after “flu bans” were lifted, it took about a year and a half for skittish audiences to venture back.</p>
<p>As the pandemic ravaged the country, consolidation fever consumed the industry. Opportunists took advantage of the real victims of the flu bans: independent theatres. </p>
<p>The big chains, armed with capital, bought out their hobbled competitors, while bigger distribution companies gobbled up smaller ones.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Nowhere but up for Netflix after huge Oscar nomination nods</a></h3>
<p>One of the founders of Paramount Pictures, Adolph Zukor and his Wall Street backers sought to monopolise access to audiences. A new Hollywood studio system dominated by money and profits slowly started to take shape. </p>
<p>Zukor used Wall Street financing to take control of the reeling Famous Players-Lasky company and merged it with Paramount distribution, creating a studio that cranked out films with Ford-like efficiency.</p>
<p>Industry players desperate to recoup their pandemic losses traded their independence to be a part of the post-pandemic Hollywood, an oligopoly of vertically integrated companies that only distributed and screened films they produced.</p>
<p>Audiences previously comfortable watching all variety of shorts quickly developed a taste for the studio system’s expensive, feature-length, formulaic films.</p>
<p>TV THREATENS THE OLIGOPOLY</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Hollywood faced a second destructive event of the 21st century: television, a new technology that could broadcast content directly into American homes.</p>
<p>On the television, the motion picture form shifted from standard, feature-length films to serialised content similar to what people listened to on the radio.</p>
<p>The studio system felt the crunch. People who once went out to the movies multiple times a week now stayed home to watch TV. By 1954, there were 233 commercial stations and 26 million homes with TVs and studio profits dramatically declined.</p>
<p>In the end, home viewing and theatrical release managed to coexist.</p>
<p>THE WORST OF TIMES, THE BEST OF TIMES</p>
<p>In many ways, the current pandemic has been a tale of two movie industries. With theatres closed, streaming services have been cashing in.</p>
<p>Netflix, which has been laying the grounds for a direct-to-streaming world since 2015 has added a whopping 10.1 million subscribers since March.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the billions of dollars stuck in pandemic purgatory, some studios have started to change tacks. Tom Hank’s new submarine film, Greyhound, steered its US$50 million budget directly to port on Apple TV+. </p>
<p>Apple let financial markets know that the film’s opening, in terms of the number of people who watched, rivaled the best opening weekends. Thirty percent of those viewers were new subscribers.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the AMC and Universal deal shows the old distribution model, already battered by streaming services, taking on water fast.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Who will win the streaming war – Apple, Disney or Netflix?</a></h3>
<p>Audiences will still go out to be thrilled by big, CGI-driven spectacles with gut-rumbling surround sound. They’ve got a taste for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, major studios will likely continue to use their economic leverage to push into streaming in an attempt to maximize their potential for profit and control both modes of distribution.</p>
<p>Seen this way, the 2020s could be a glorious period of experimentation and innovation.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Group sizes down from 5 to 2, dining-in suspended as Singapore tightens COVID-19 measures </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The current size of group gatherings allowed will be reduced from five people to two people, following a spike in COVID-19 community cases, said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong on Friday (May 14). </p>
<p>This, and other new measures under what the Health Ministry labelled as "Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)" will take effect from May 16 through Jun 13.</p>
<p>Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Mr Wong said: “This will apply across the board, so if you want to go out for anything, grocery shopping, exercise, maximum of two persons henceforth. </p>
<p>“In fact, we strongly encourage everyone to stay home as much as possible, go out only for essential reasons.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about whether Singapore could enter another “circuit breaker” after the midpoint review, Mr Wong said: “If indeed the situation does not improve, we certainly will not rule out even more stringent measures thereafter. </p>
<p>“But there is also a chance that things may improve, and therefore, we may also consider the other way around, easing some of the restrictions.” </p>

<p>“We need to act decisively to disrupt the virus transmission. We will therefore further tighten safe management measures in the community” </p>
<p>DINING-IN SUSPENDED, WORK-FROM-HOME AS DEFAULT</p>
<p>Dining-in at FB establishments will also not be allowed, said Mr Wong. This includes hawker centres and food courts, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>“We will take tighter measures around the higher-risk settings, and these higher-risk settings are the ones where people are gathered together in an indoor environment without their mask on,” said Mr Wong. </p>
<p>“All dining-in will have to cease … All FB establishments will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. In line with this, wedding banquets will also have to cease because it’s a dining activity.” </p>
<p>Working from home will also be the default at workplaces, he added. “All employees who are able to work from home will have to do so. Work-from-home will be the default.” </p>

<p>The cap of five distinct visitors per household per day will also be reduced to two distinct visitors per household per day, Mr Wong said. </p>
<p>Grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not count towards the cap of two distinct visitors or the number of social gatherings per day, said MOH in the press release. </p>
<p>Other activities that will not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, said MOH in the press release. </p>
<p>EVENT SIZES AND PRE-EVENT TESTING</p>
<p>Event sizes and event size caps will be further scaled down, said Mr Wong. </p>
<p>Currently, events can have 100 attendees without pre-event testing and 250 with pre-event testing. This will be scaled down to 50 and 100 attendees respectively, he added. </p>
<p>This will apply to congregational and other worship services and MICE activities, said Mr Wong. </p>
<p>“Likewise, we will reduce the capacity limits across the board for shopping malls, showrooms and attractions, as well as cruises, museums, public libraries, all of these capacity limits will be scaled back,” he added. </p>
<p>For congregational and other worship services, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times “to further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions”, said MOH in the press release. </p>

<p>Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period. </p>
<p>Marriage solemnisations will be allowed to continue, with a cap of 50 and 100 attendees without and with pre-event testing respectively, the press release read. </p>
<p>“We know that there is one group who will be particularly impacted too, which are wedding couples. Some of them may already have wedding plans for this coming Sunday, and it may be very hard to make last-minute changes,” said Mr Wong. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Public transport can be 'very safe' if commuters keep their masks on and refrain from talking, says transport minister</a></h3>
<p>For affected couples, the Government is “prepared to consider grandfathering the arrangement” for couples who have already made plans for Sunday, he added. </p>
<p>“They can proceed, but we will require them to put in place pre-event testing for all their guests. But this is a special arrangement only for this Sunday because this is a once in a lifetime event for the wedding couples.” </p>
<p>The measures announced on Friday are “already very stringent”, said Mr Wong. “If everyone cooperates and we all do our part, we will be able to bring down the latest clusters and cases and bring the infection under control.” </p>
<p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said separately on Friday that people in Singapore should stay at home "as far as possible" and go out only for essential tasks as well as follow government advisories. </p>
<p>"If you do go out, remember to practise safe distancing measures, like using TraceTogether and wearing a mask," he said in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>Mr Lee also urged members of the public to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and their loved ones. </p>
<p>"The new measures will be difficult for everybody. But if we all play our part and look out for one another, we will succeed in stemming the transmission of the virus, just like we did last year," he added. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> NASA launches revolutionary space telescope to give glimpse of early universe </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The flawless Christmas Day launch, with a countdown conducted in French, was carried live on a joint NASA-ESA webcast.</p>
<p>Live video captured by a camera mounted on the rocket's upper stage showed the Webb gliding gently away after it was jettisoned, drawing cheers and applause from jubilant flight engineers in the mission control center.</p>
<p>Flight controllers confirmed moments later, as the Webb's solar-energy array was deployed, that its power supply was working.</p>
<p>By comparison, Webb's 30-year-old predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, orbits the Earth from 340 miles away, passing in and out of the planet's shadow every 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Named after the man who oversaw NASA through most of its formative decade of the 1960s, Webb is about 100 times more sensitive than Hubble and is expected to transform scientists' understanding of the universe and our place in it.</p>
<h2>COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY LESSON</h2>
<p>Webb mainly will view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born, while Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>
<p>Hubble's view reached back to roughly 400 million years following the Big Bang, a period just after the very first galaxies - sprawling clusters of stars, gases and other interstellar matter - are believed to have taken shape.</p>
<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, speaking during the launch webcast by video link, hailed the new telescope as a "time machine" that will "take us back to the very beginnings of the universe."</p>
<p>Aside from examining the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies, astronomers are eager to study super-massive black holes believed to occupy the centers of distant galaxies.</p>
<p>The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies. Northrop Grumman Corp was the primary contractor. The Arianespace launch vehicle is part of the European contribution.</p>
<p>Webb was developed at a cost of US$8.8 billion, with operational expenses projected to bring its total price tag to about US$9.66 billion, far higher than planned when NASA was previously aiming for a 2011 launch.</p>
<p>Astronomical operation of the telescope, to be managed from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is expected to begin in the summer of 2022, following about six months of alignment and calibration of Webb's mirrors and instruments.</p>
<p>It is then that NASA expects to release the initial batch of images captured by Webb. Webb is designed to last up to 10 years.</p>

<h1> Femtech in Singapore: Is women-centric health technology the next big thing? </h1>
<div> <p>Singapore is the femtech hub of the region for healthcare technology tailored for women. Money Mind talks to a few companies that have attracted the eye of investors.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Rose Sivam </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Healthcare technology tailored for women is a booming market, with global funding for start-ups in the sector crossing the US$1 billion mark for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Given that women make up half the population of the world, the sector has a huge potential market, but it is also a market that has historically been underserved, especially in Asia, said experts.</p>
<p>Exacerbating the problem, many women themselves lack awareness of their health issues.</p>
<p>Healthcare industry analyst Suchismita Das of Frost and Sullivan calls female technology (femtech) the “stepchild” of digital health.</p>
<p>She argues that it is time to go beyond general health treatments that do not take gender differences into account.</p>
<p>Femtech refers to products that use technology to improve women’s health.</p>
<p>This access gap is what femtech businesses hope to bridge.</p>
<p>Mr Rio Hoe and Ms Guadalupe Lazaro founded Ease Healthcare in 2019.</p>
<p>The couple say that the business was inspired by their own personal experiences accessing sexual and reproductive health services in Singapore.</p>
<p>“We faced different barriers along the way, such as the stigma of going down to a clinic or the judgment from doctors. So we wanted to change things,” said Ms Lazaro.</p>
<p>The result was the creation of a telemedicine platform that aims to make healthcare more accessible, convenient and discreet.</p>
<p>Users can book online medical appointments, and medications are delivered within four hours - in personalised and discreet packaging.</p>
<p>The start-up recently received seed funding of US$1.3 million – the largest femtech round in Southeast Asia. The funding was led by Insignia Ventures.</p>
<p>The app was launched last year, and now has about 20,000 users.</p>
<p>With its social media strategies and a slew of community building activities, the interface is designed to appeal particularly to a younger, digitally savvy audience.</p>
<p>At the other end of the age spectrum, is another major sector in the femtech space – menopause.</p>
<p>According to Frost and Sullivan, by 2025, more than 1 billion women globally will be experiencing menopause. That is around 12 per cent of the world population.</p>
<p>Singapore-based start-up EloCare is hoping to find data-driven solutions to address this condition.</p>
<p>Dr Tan Thiam Chye, EloCare’s clinical adviser, said there are currently not many health tech solutions dealing with menopause.</p>
<p>So even though about three-quarters of women will experience symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, many may not be aware of those signs.</p>
<p>The start-up’s aim is to improve the diagnosis, detection and monitoring of the symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p>The company has been awarded a seed grant by Singapore Health Technologies Consortium (HealthTec) – a platform for industry and academia to collaborate on technology that will transform health and wellness.</p>
<p>The funding will help support EloCare's development of an algorithm to identify the symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p>The aim is to help "differentiate between (menopause) symptoms and other noises", said Ms Mabel Nguyen, co-founder and CEO of EloCare.</p>
<p>"So we make sure that if you are having these hot flushes, it’s not because you are feeling hot. If you have some sleep disruption, it's because of menopause and it’s not because of something else," she added.</p>
<p>Having such data empowers women to understand their bodies better and to make informed decisions on healthcare solutions, all of which will have a short-term and long-term impact on health outcomes.</p>
<p>Femtech start-ups have raised more than US$1 billion this year, more than 10 times the US$98 million raised in 2011, according to PitchBook, which provides private public capital market data.</p>
<p>It is expected that revenue from the femtech sector will reach US$1.1 billion by 2024, with annual projected growth of 12.9 per cent, said Frost and Sullivan.</p>
<p>Singapore is the femtech hub of the region – with more than half of the femtech companies in Southeast Asia based here.</p>
<p>Expanding to the region will come with a new set of challenges – and opportunities.</p>
<p>Ease Healthcare has its eye on this market, knowing that the pain points it is trying to address in Singapore, such as convenience, accessibility and cost, are similar in many other Asian markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, co-founder Ms Lazaro acknowledges that such personal health topics are sensitive. She says businesses like theirs need to adjust to different expectations and cultural norms, and adapt their language and marketing accordingly.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Sudan forces fire tear gas as protesters head to presidential palace </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>A Reuters witness said Sudanese security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds on a tenth day of major demonstrations since an Oct 25 coup.</p>
<p>Protests have continued even after Abdallah Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister last month.</p>
<p>A week ago, demonstrators managed to begin a sit-in at the gates of the palace, but on Saturday they were met with rows of security forces.</p>
<p>People still managed to post images on social media showing protests taking place in several other cities including Madani and Atbara.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Omdurman, security forces also fired tear gas at protesters around 2km away from a bridge connecting the city to central Khartoum, another Reuters witness said.</p>
<p>The SUNA state news agency reported that the province of Khartoum closed bridges on Friday evening in anticipation of the protests.</p>
<p>"Departing from peacefulness, approaching and infringing on sovereign and strategic sites in central Khartoum is a violation of the laws," SUNA reported, citing a provincial security coordination committee.</p>
<p>"Chaos and abuses will be dealt with," it added.</p>
<p>The demonstrators have demanded that the military has no role in government during a transition to free elections</p>
<p>Protesters in Khartoum chanted: "Close the street! Close the bridge! Burhan will come straight to you," referring to military leader and sovereign council head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.</p>
<p>They were also heard cheering when security forces fired tear gas, a Reuters witness said.</p>
<p>A senior official at one internet provider told Reuters the service disruption followed a decision by the National Telecommunication Corporation, which oversees the sector.</p>
<p>UN Special Representative to Sudan Volker Perthes urged Sudanese authorities not to stand in the way of Saturday's planned demonstrations.</p>
<p>"Freedom of expression is a human right. This includes full access to the Internet. According to international conventions, no one should be arrested for intent to protest peacefully," Perthes said.</p>
<p>The military could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In Darfur, Governor Minni Minnawi asked citizens to stop looting the offices of UNAMID peacekeepers late on Friday, with sources telling Reuters they heard gunshots in the vicinity on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people marched to the presidential palace and the security forces fired volleys of tear gas and stun grenades as they dispersed protesters who had been trying to organise a sit-in.</p>
<p>Forty-eight people have been killed in crackdowns on protests since the coup, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> Women’s sex toys are buzzing right now – and Singapore is ready for it </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Women’s sex toys are buzzing right now – and Singapore is ready for it </h1>
<div> <p>Sex toys and other accessories that help achieve pleasure are having a moment in our seemingly conservative country. We find out why.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hidayah Salamat </a> </div> </div>
<p>Bedroom toys are stepping out of speciality shops and hitting mainstream shelves, a sign of a momentous shift in mindset when it comes to sex. </p>
<p>But exactly what’s shifted and why now? And how are brands keeping the market turned on? </p>
<p>Today, sex toys are no longer confined to traditional sex shops, but are taking pride of place on the shelves of mainstream retailers. </p>
<p>Sex toy makers Wow Tech said Singapore was the first market within the Asia-Pacific region where the company saw “strong responses” from conventional retailers.</p>
<p>Its brands, Arcwave, We-Vibe and Womanizer, are now available in different retailers across eight countries in Asia, including various Guardian outlets in Singapore, said the company’s Asia-Pacific consumer marketing manager Ruben Rodriguez. </p>
<p>Just last month, Essentials Pharmacy, which is located in Chinatown, announced it now stocks four products from American brand SVAKOM.</p>
<p>Smile Makers has seen a “dramatic increase” in mainstream retail sales across the world, including in Asia, said brand director Cecile Gasnault.</p>
<p>“We have been growing at a rate of 70 per cent for the past three years,” she told CNA Women.</p>
<p>Going mainstream in Singapore was a natural decision for the brand, whose strategy has always been to never be distributed at speciality sex stores. </p>
<p>Online sales of sex toys are also booming, a trend said to be riding on the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Good Vibes, an online shop that opened in November last year, saw sales increasing five-fold during the COVID-19 Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), when dining-in was suspended and gathering limits reduced to two people.</p>
<p>“This industry is inversely related to COVID-19 and when we had a (partial) lockdown in May, everything peaked – traffic surged,” said founder Meryl Lim. </p>
<p>But experts agreed that the pandemic was simply a catalyst, not the trigger, for the market’s growth.</p>
<p>“It has taken a long time, but many countries in Asia are experiencing a very high interest in pleasure wellness. The Asia-Pacific represents an increasing portion of our business year after year.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> The stigma is lifting. Women now expect to see vibrators in beauty retailers and mainstream retail. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>“Many of them are bringing to light a mismatch between how ‘taboo’ the topic is perceived in society and how great they feel after using toys, helping them in their life,” he said.</p>
<p>This trend was “boosted” by the pandemic, said Rodriguez, as many experienced “mentally straining situations” such as being separated from their loved ones due to lockdowns.</p>
<p>“Due to the fact that orgasms do improve our mental wellness and bridge our intimate relationship impediments during the pandemic, the curiosity about pleasure products is increasing at a fast pace,” he said. </p>
<p>“Education is a big part of forming the basis of one’s outlook in life,” said The Hedonist co-founder Sabrina Angela Meier, adding that the Singapore-based retailer works to “emphasise that health and happiness go hand in hand with pleasure”. </p>
<p>One of the ways its founders, which include Jacqueline Kee and Jade Amar, hope to normalise conversations around sex is by putting themselves out there.</p>
<p>The trio occasionally fronts videos on social media demonstrating use of their products. </p>
<p>“We are one of the first sex-positive pleasure brands in Singapore to put our faces to the brand. We want to normalise sex and pleasure as it is our birthright and what makes us human,” said Meier.</p>
<p>As part of their efforts to educate customers, some brands have quizzes on their website to help women discover and explore their sexual needs, helping them to decide which toy is best suited to them.</p>
<p>It’s often surprising how differently customers choose when they are more aware of their pleasure preferences.</p>
<p>But with the quiz, The Firefighter – which is used externally – “proves a very popular choice”, she added.</p>
<p>On the podcast, host Nicole Lim talks to personalities like Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling, Workers’ Party Member of Parliament Raeesah Khan and comedian Preeti Nair on a wide range of topics, from vulva health to motherhood.</p>
<p>Nair, better known as her online moniker Preetipls, is herself an influencer in this space, with her 40,000-strong Instagram audience enjoying content around the topics of women’s sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p>The response has been “promising”, said Noorindah, with more readers engaging with her posts and sending her messages asking for recommendations on sex toys. </p>
<p>She has also seen an uptick of online education and conversation around the use of sex toys in the pandemic, “possibly supported by the fact that when we can’t connect in person, many people turn to online platforms”. </p>
<p>SPEAKING RESPECTFULLY TO WOMEN</p>
<p>A key strategy that brands have adopted to grow their consumer base is to address women directly and respectfully. That meant bridging the gap between what women actually needed and what was available in the market. </p>
<p>Even if products for women were available, the shopping environment, product design and quality were “alarmingly unappealing the world over”, said Gasnault.</p>
<p>“No brand was speaking respectfully to women.”</p>
<p>The first thing to think about was, naturally, the design of the product. </p>
<p>Said Wow Tech’s Rodriguez: “In the last five to 10 years, the whole industry has radically changed its image.</p>
<p>Smile Makers products are designed to be “anatomically relevant and unintimidating”, said Gasnault, with “friendly” names, colours and packaging. </p>
<p>New kid on the block Good Vibes not only recognises the importance of marketing directly to women, but also in providing the most comfortable buying experience, especially to those new to sex toys.</p>
<p>The brand conducted surveys and focus groups, speaking to about 150 people in Singapore, and found that many of the women who owned sex toys had bought them with their partner. </p>
<p>Good Vibes’ research also showed that many of the women who had not yet experienced sex toys were open to trying them. </p>
<p>“It was very clear based on the survey that I needed to serve the beginners, which is why I only have three toys. A lot of my competitors are distributors and they have many global brands and thousands of toys in their shops,” said Lim.</p>
<p>Like Smile Makers, Good Vibes sought to make their toys look as appealing as possible to women in their 20s and 30s, giving them discreet names like The Pebble, The Koi and The Bamboo. </p>
<p>But ready as they are to try out sex toys, some may not be comfortable with putting their toys on display on their dresser, especially those who live with their family. Because of this, Good Vibes provides a satin pouch with every purchase.</p>
<p>“I really like that empowerment message … but in Asia, we’re a few steps behind,” Lim said.</p>
<p>In an effort to luxuriate the process of women buying sex toys for themselves, Good Vibes scents its packaging with orange blossom, and handwrites customers’ names on its boxes and thank-you notes to “create the mood”. </p>
<p>“Why can’t we make the whole experience of buying a sex toy like how you buy a gift for yourself, like buying a candle or a nice cookie?” said Lim.</p>

<p>In a national address, Modi also said those aged 15-18 would start receiving COVID-19 vaccinations from Jan 3 and those above 60 with comorbidities would be offered booster shots after recommendation from doctors.</p>
<p>"From the point of view of precaution, the government has decided that healthcare and frontline workers should start getting a precaution dose," Modi said in the speech.</p>
<p>India has reported a swift rise in Omicron cases, with the number reaching 415 overall across 17 Indian states.</p>
<p>Modi's government has been accelerating its vaccination campaign, administering at least one dose to 88 per cent of the eligible 944 million population, while 61 per cent have taken both doses.</p>
<p>As millions still await second shots, the authorities will now start offering booster shots to healthcare and frontline workers, who suffered from an overwhelming second-wave of the virus in the summer that killed tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Medical experts have said India needs to double down on its vaccination campaign and expand coverage to avert another possible surge in new infections particularly in the vast hinterlands where healthcare facilities are sparse.</p>
<p>Modi urged citizens to continue to wear facemasks and follow other COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>The federal government has urged states to impose curbs on overcrowding in the festive season until the new year and a few states have partially banned public celebrations.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Western states need united front against divisive China: Trudeau </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TORONTO: Western countries should have a united front against China to prevent the Asian state from using commercial interests to play them against each other, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview aired on Saturday (Dec 25).</p>
<p>Trudeau said China has been "playing" Western countries against one another as they compete for access to economic opportunities in the country.</p>
<p>"We've been competing and China has been, from time to time, very cleverly playing us off each other in an open market, competitive way," he said in an interview with Global television.</p>
<p>"We need to do a better job of working together and standing strong so China can't play the angles and divide us one against the other."</p>
<p>Meng reached a deal with US prosecutors in September, ending the extradition fight, and the two Canadians were released within hours of the agreement.</p>
<p>Even before Meng's arrest, Canada's repeated questioning of China's human rights positions had irked Beijing, and the two countries have failed to come closer.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Canada said it will join allies in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February to send China a message over its human rights record.</p>

<h1> Thai artisans revive old crafts to weave new fashion and stories for modern market </h1>
<div> <p>A rural community in northeastern Thailand tells stories of nature and its local way of life through unique handicrafts and slow fashion.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pichayada Promchertchoo </a> </div> </div>
<p>PHU PHAN, Thailand: Drawing was a matter of secrecy for Tavee Meboot when she was a little girl. The more she drew, the more money her father had to fork out to buy new notebooks.</p>
<p>Her family could not afford to keep doing that. So the young Tavee used each notebook sparingly and kept her art secret or until she ran out of pages for her childhood imagination.</p>
<p>“I liked drawing but we were poor. Each time I needed a new notebook, my dad would ask ‘Why do you buy it so often?’. The notebook was actually for art assignments from school,” Tavee, now 43, reminisced with a smile.</p>
<p>“I sneakily used it for my own drawings.”</p>
<p>Tavee’s love for art was tucked away in her heart. She grew into a farmer in her hometown of Sakon Nakhon, northeastern Thailand. Her life revolves around the seasons on the Phu Phan mountains, her paddy fields, cassava farm and rubber plantation.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a motorbike accident kept her immobile for months. That was when she got to know Bhukram - a clothing brand from her small village of Nang Toeng.</p>
<p>This is a creation of Pilan ‘Meaw’ Thaisuang, a Thai historian who is passionate about nature and the traditional way of life on the hills of Phu Phan. </p>
<p>Meaw grew up in Nang Toeng, where generations of residents have lived a simple life close to nature. Her childhood was shaped by the richness of the forest, where children played and looked for food with their parents.</p>
<p>“I love this place very much,” said Meaw, who had left home to pursue a university degree and work in Bangkok, 600 km away, for ten years. </p>
<p>“I always wanted to come home after finishing my education. I wanted to come back to do something and stay with my parents.”</p>
<p>Initially, Meaw worked as a historian in Bangkok with architects and communities. Her love for local fabrics and history, and longing for nature back home made her study the past of Nang Toeng village. </p>
<p>She discovered that cotton used to be grown along the farmland and harvested for weaving simple garments. It was then handspun into yarn and soaked in natural blue dye from the local indigo plant.</p>
<p>Colourful flowers and trees, streams, farms and paddy fields make up the designs of Bhukram’s products. They range from scarves to jackets, dresses and shirts - all made from cotton by hand.</p>
<p>Each of them is unique with its own embroidery design that is only produced once to reflect the artisan’s perception of the surroundings. Prices start from about US$45 for a scarf but can go beyond US$500 for a dress.</p>
<p>“I’m thankful to Meaw for giving me an opportunity to work like this,” said Tavee, who embroiders garments for Bhukram when she is not working on farm chores.</p>
<p>“This is what I wanted to do when I was little.”</p>
<p>The embroidery was inspired by a car ride up the Phu Phan mountains, when her eyes were amazed by the vivid display of colours, and her favourite place at the foot of a hill where her grandmother used to take her to look for mushrooms.</p>
