<h1> Depersonalisation: Why Do You Feel Empty and Numb? </h1>
<h2> Why do emotionally sensitive and intense people sometimes feel "nothing"? </h2>
<li>When faced with extreme situations, the body and psyche can go into a “numbing mode.”</li>
<li>Though it may seem like a solution for emotional survival, detaching from pain carries many downsides. </li>
<li>You can choose whether to use your emotional “shield” or not. </li>
<p>“I am emotionally intense, but mostly I feel nothing, empty, detached from reality and those around me…”</p>
<p>Do you feel like the world around you is unreal?</p>
<p>Do you feel as though you are watching your life go by without being in it?</p>
<p>Do you struggle to know what you are feeling or cannot find the vocabulary for it?</p>
<p>Do you find yourself feeling disconnected from your body?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>traumatic</a> experiences, human beings have three responses: fight, flight, or freeze. If disconnecting with others to avoid getting hurt is "fleeing," then numbing out our emotions altogether is "freezing."
<a>confidence</a>. Although the pattern started off as a way of protecting you from others, it can eventually morph into you hiding from yourself or denying your needs altogether.
<a>boredom</a> and emptiness like you are not able to show or feel any emotions. You may lose the ability to respond to events with the usual joy or sadness, or you may struggle to connect with others in a deep and meaningful way.
<a>substance abuse</a>, bingeing,
<a>self-mutilation</a>, psychosomatic complaints, 'blankness,' [or adopting] a cynical, aloof, or pessimistic stance to avoid investing in people or activities.’’
<p>The Pain and Danger of Freezing Up</p>
<a>anger</a>, both expressed and repressed; longing for what might have been; distress over past betrayal; or the
<a>grief</a> over relationships that ended too soon.
<p>With so much hidden within, you may feel particularly sensitive and irritable. It may take only minor events to reach your “boiling point,” where you may be caught off-guard by emotional outbursts that seem to have come out of nowhere.</p>
<a>memory</a> loss, as they do not remember much of their life—even looking at old pictures of themselves can seem surreal.
<a>friendship</a>. Although things may seem fine on the outside, you may feel overcome by a wave of sadness or
<a>loneliness</a>. Any reminder of life’s finiteness can bring on painful existential awareness and
<a>guilt</a>. This is because even if part of you insists on freezing up, there is something deep down in you that cannot help but remind you that you are missing out on life.
<p>Through the construction of emotional skills and <a>resilience</a>, you can begin to feel safe enough to dip your feet into the deep waters of feeling. We can start with small strategies, such as learning to label emotions and <a>self-regulate</a>.</p>
<p>Reflective Exercise: Working With Your Shield</p>
<p>1. Relinquishing blame and shame</p>
<p>The first step to working with your emotional numbness is to relinquish any shame or self-criticism attached to it. On top of the pain of feeling empty, you may have accumulated layers of relational shame and conflicts associated with it.</p>
<p>2. Acknowledging the sadness</p>
<p>Now, you are ready to look carefully at your numbness. Use your <a>imagination</a> and reflect on the following questions:</p>
<li>If your emotional numbness is a wall or a shield, how thick is it?</li>
<li>What kind of materials would it be made of? Metal, wood, or plastic? How dense or heavy is it? </li>
<li>When you touch your wall/shield, does it feel warm or cold? </li>
<li>Does it change according to your life circumstances or energy level, or does it remain stuck and static?</li>
<li>If your wall/shield has a voice, what is it saying?</li>
<p>4. Thanking and transforming the numbness</p>
<p>The next time you find yourself using the shield to defend against emotions that arise, or when you feel numb where you wish to feel alive and present, you will be more aware, and your numbness is no longer an <a>unconscious</a>, destructive force.</p>
<p>Your emotional shield aims to protect, and you may choose to use it or not. But the power remains in you. </p>

<h1> How Traumas Create Negative Patterns in Relationships </h1>
<h2> Unresolved traumas can create challenges in communication, intimacy, and trust. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: tiburi/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>PTSD</a>), but many more have trauma-related symptoms like physiological reactivity to triggers, panic attacks, chronic
<a>anger</a> or numbness, or a loss of trust.
<p>Following are four ways traumas can negatively affect <a>romantic relationships</a>:</p>
<p>1. Getting triggered into traumatized states</p>
<p>2. Fighting, fleeing, or freezing</p>
<p>Unprocessed traumas or ongoing serious chronic stressors can cause the primitive brain networks involved in survival and threat response to hijack your brain into a “fight, flight, or freeze” state.</p>
<a>sibling</a>), your brain will give that type of response priority and automatically generate fighting, fleeing, or freezing when the amygdala signals a relationship emergency.
<p>This can result in the following behaviors which are damaging to relationships:</p>
<li>Fight. Attacking your partner verbally or physically, raging at them, blaming them for all of your problems, expressing contempt, being controlling or demanding, or not letting things go.</li>
<li>Flight. Avoiding dealing with problems, panicking and acting impulsively, or running away from intimacy or emotional situations</li>
<li>Freeze. Feeling helpless, feeling unable to act, or shutting down and disconnecting from your partner.</li>
<p>3. <a>Shame</a>-based responses</p>
<a>compulsive behaviors</a> as a way of self-medicating the shame. You may drink or take drugs, play video games to excess, shop compulsively, act out sexually, or become a
<a>workaholic</a>. All of these patterns take you away from being available to a partner because they lead you to prioritize the substance/behavior of choice above your partner’s needs and feelings.
<p>4. Rigid, negative beliefs about relationships</p>
<a>bias</a> how you perceive your partner’s actions, leading you to interpret them in the worst light. You may be unable to trust, and therefore constantly monitor the status of your relationship or try to control your partner.
<p>5. Traumas can lead you to choose unhealthy partners and stay with them too long</p>
<a>guilt</a> and blame or be easily manipulated (as you were by your dysfunctional parent). You may be drawn to abusive or unloving partners because of "trauma
<a>bonding</a>": Trauma experience can make you addicted to emotional intensity, so you reject the friendly, honest, respectful person in favor of the inconsistent, rejecting, demeaning, or manipulative one.
<p>If any of these patterns sound familiar, it might be a good idea to get an evaluation from a mental health professional. Self-help books and articles may help as well, depending on the level of severity.</p>
<a>self-worth</a> that makes you less sensitized to conflict and rejection. Over time, you will be less likely to overreact to relationship ups and downs with primitive, emergency responses.

<h1> Do You Feel Trapped or Boxed In? </h1>
<h2> It could be your schemas or life-traps. </h2>
<li>Schemas are patterns developed in early childhood as a way to adapt to our environment, and which organise our experience. </li>
<li>Some of your schemas are very likely to become maladaptive or harmful, and become life-traps that distort your experiences.</li>
<li>Psychotherapy offers a safe environment to explore and work through your life-traps.</li>
<li>Individuals who undergo psychotherapy are able to make conscious decisions, and become the best version of themselves. </li>

<p>Have you found yourself trying very hard to change certain aspects of your life without getting the results you want? If so, Schema Therapy could be for you.</p>
<a>integrative form of psychotherapy</a>. It was initially developed to treat resistant
<a>personality disorders</a>. Due to its flexibility, ST has become popular among psychotherapists as a preferred
<a>transdiagnostic treatment approach</a>. ST emerged from
<a>Cognitive Behavioral</a> Therapy (CBT) and has been recognised as an effective and pragmatic type of
<a>psychotherapy</a>, which integrates previously existing therapies, such as
<a>childhood</a>, as a way to survive and adapt to our environment. Given that schemas are useful and adaptive early in life, we keep repeating them (reinforcing and elaborating) during middle childhood and
<p>Inevitably, schemas become <a>unconscious</a> core beliefs that determine our patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting towards others in life. Not surprisingly, schemas become highly stable, self-perpetuating, and very resistant to change.</p>
<a>perfectionists</a>, emotionally distant, fearful of intimate relationships, emotionally needy and clingy to others, defective and shameful,
<a>18 maladaptive schemas</a>, which I preclude listing here due to the length limitations of this blog.
<p>Steps to change your life-traps </p>
<p>Psychotherapy offers a safe environment to explore and work through your life-traps and distortive mindsets. This is so you don’t keep repeating the same negative patterns that keep you from becoming the best version of yourself. </p>
<p>In brief, this entails four main steps:</p>
<li>Recognising your life-traps (uncovering your blind spots)</li>
<li>Understanding the origin of your life-traps (identifying when, why, and how your schemas developed) </li>
<li>Deconstructing your life-traps (disabling, dismantling, or weakening their action mechanisms, and breaking down your schema-driven life patterns)</li>
<li>Developing and embracing new and more effective or adaptive ways to be in the world (having your core emotional needs met in everyday life, so can live to your full potential).</li>
<p>This process constitutes emotional and transformational learning. That is, the expansion of consciousness through which individuals question and redefine their beliefs, feelings, assumptions, perspectives, and their meaning and purpose in life</p>

<h1> New Findings on What Victims of Abuse Really Believe </h1>
<h2> The link between schemas and intimate partner violence. </h2>
<li>Maladaptive schemas are distorted mental structures and patterns of experience (e.g., emotions, beliefs) concerning oneself and the world.</li>
<li>Victims of intimate violence are more likely to have certain maladaptive schemas: Impaired autonomy, other-directedness, disconnection/rejection.</li>
<li>Schema therapy may help modify maladaptive schemas and beliefs, potentially reducing intimate partner violence.</li>
<p>What do victims of abuse really believe about themselves and the world?</p>
<a>intimate partner violence</a> perpetration and victimization correlate with several maladaptive schemas and core beliefs: impaired autonomy, other-directedness, and disconnection/rejection.
<p>Before describing the research, let me define maladaptive schemas.</p>
<h3>What are schemas (and maladaptive schemas)?</h3>
<p>Schemas are mental structures. They help us anticipate and make sense of a lot of information quickly.</p>
<p>Sometimes schemas themselves are abnormal or problematic. These erroneous mental structures and core beliefs are called maladaptive schemas.</p>
<a>maladaptive schemas</a> comprise dysfunctional patterns of perceptions, memories, emotions, thoughts, and sensations concerning oneself and the world. Maladaptive schemas develop during
<a>adolescence</a>, often in response to unmet emotional needs, such as the need for acceptance, the need for autonomy, and the need to feel safe and secure.
<p>Whereas adaptive schemas help us organize and interpret information quickly and accurately (so we can respond effectively), maladaptive schemas mislead us.</p>
<p>Of course, in an adult, the same distrust and <a>paranoia</a>—now in the form of rejecting all help or offers of <a>friendship</a> and <a>romantic relationships</a>—is more dysfunctional. </p>
<h3>18 Maladaptive schemas</h3>
<p>Eighteen maladaptive schemas, belonging to five domains, have been identified (see Table 1):</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Rafaeli et al. 2011)</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>self-control</a>/self-discipline. These patterns are more likely to develop in early family environments “characterized by permissiveness, overindulgence, lack of direction, or a sense of superiority.”
<a>attention</a>, or approval.”
<a>the environment</a> that interfere with one’s perceived ability to separate, survive, function independently, and perform successfully.”
<a>pessimism</a>, punitiveness, emotional inhibition, and hypercriticalness/unrelenting standards. Often seen in early environments characterized as “grim, demanding, and sometimes punitive.”
<a>mistrust</a>/abuse, emotional deprivation, defectiveness/
<a>social isolation</a>/alienation. These schemas typically emerge when a child’s needs “for security, safety, stability, nurturance,
<a>empathy</a>, sharing of feelings, acceptance, and respect” are violated.
<h3>An investigation of schemas and intimate partner violence</h3>
<p>With the above information in mind, let us review the study by Pilkington et al., which examined the link between maladaptive schemas and intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration.</p>
<a>LaMotte</a> et al. found small or medium correlations (r = 0.22 to 0.41) between violence perpetration and the mistrust/abuse schema.
<h3>What do victims of abuse really believe?</h3>
<p>Paradoxically, victims of abuse may also feel drawn to neglectful and abusive relationships—to unreliable, dishonest, manipulative, and cruel intimate partners. Why?</p>
<a>confidence</a> in their ability to function on their own or survive in a world they perceive as dangerous and unpredictable.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Claudio_Scott/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>assertive</a> and setting boundaries.
<p>But there is hope for victims. Some evidence suggests schema therapy can be <a>helpful</a> in challenging and modifying maladaptive schemas.</p>

<h1> Is Your Personality Keeping You From Finding Love? </h1>
<h2> The Big Five and involuntary singlehood. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>The Big Five model of personality predicts many behaviors and life outcomes.</li>
<li>Both extraversion and openness predict whether you’re coupled or single but in unexpected ways.</li>
<li>Most people, regardless of their personality, eventually find an intimate partner.</li>
<a>loneliness</a>, never able to find someone special? In an article recently published in the journal
<a>Big Five</a> Inventory, which assesses personality on five dimensions. The Big Five personality factors are easily remembered with the acronym OCEAN:
<li><a>Openness</a> to new experience: How much you enjoy trying new things versus a preference for the familiar.</li>
<li><a>Conscientiousness</a>: How neat and orderly you like to keep your environment and how dependable you are in your commitments to others.</li>
<li><a>Extraversion</a>: How outgoing and sociable you are. The opposite end of this spectrum is “<a>introversion</a>.”</li>
<li><a>Agreeableness</a>: How trusting you are of others and how easily you get along with people. (Note that this is different from extraversion. Being outgoing and easy to get along with are two different things.)</li>
<li>Neuroticism: How susceptible you are to experiencing emotional disturbances, with the opposite end of this spectrum being “<a>emotional stability</a>.”</li>
<p>The Big Five is the generally accepted model of personality in psychology. It’s been used in hundreds of studies and found to reliably predict a wide range of behaviors and life outcomes.</p>
<h3>Personality and Singlehood</h3>
<a>anxiety</a>. Ponder these five personality factors and think about how they might affect people’s ability to find and hold on to an intimate partner.
<h3>Personality and Intimacy</h3>
<p>Finally, it came as a surprise that none of the other personality factors predicted whether a person would be coupled or single. Conscientiousness didn’t matter, suggesting that both dependable and unreliable people can find mates.</p>
<p>Likewise, agreeableness wasn’t an issue, indicating that both easy-going people and those difficult to get along with have no major issues with finding an intimate partner.</p>

<p>Projecting confidence helps people gain credibility, make a strong first impression, deal with pressure, and tackle personal and professional challenges. It’s also an attractive trait, as confidence helps put others at ease.</p>
<h2> How to Build Confidence </h2>
<p>Confidence is not an innate, fixed characteristic. It’s an ability that can be acquired and improved over time.</p>
<p>Social confidence can be developed by practicing in social settings. Individuals can observe the structure and flow of any conversation before jumping in, and they can prepare questions or topics to discuss ahead of time.</p>
<a>Anxiety</a> can take hold when people are plagued by self-doubt, so putting themselves in and getting accustomed to the specific situation they
<a>fear</a> can assure people that nothing truly bad will happen. And the activity gets easier with practice.
<p>Outside of a social context, one can gain a sense of confidence from personal and professional accomplishments. Continuing to set and meet goals can enable the belief that one is competent and capable.</p>

<a>These tips and others</a> can help gradually build mental strength.
<div> <h3> How should I build confidence for a job interview? </h3> </div>
<a>conscientiousness</a>, reflecting on your faults so you can share how you’ve learned from them, and being warm, complimentary, and self-assured will
<a>build the foundation of a successful interview.</a>

<h2> Overconfidence and Underconfidence </h2>
<p>Too much confidence can come off as cockiness, arrogance, or <a>narcissism</a>. Overestimating one’s abilities might also lead to problems such as failing to complete projects on time.</p>
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between confidence and narcissism? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are we drawn to narcissists? </h3> </div>
<a>overestimate how much self-esteem narcissists have.</a> Perceiving a strong sense of confidence, which puts others at ease, may be the key to narcissists’ appeal.
<div> <h3> What are the reasons someone might have low confidence? </h3> </div>
<a>determine a person’s confidence level </a>include
<a>genetics</a>, temperament, cultural background, and early life experiences such as
<a>parenting</a> style or a past
<a>trauma</a>. Although those elements are generally out of our control, there are still plenty of ways to gain confidence throughout our lives.
<div> <h3> What are the costs of underconfidence? </h3> </div>
<a>shy away from new opportunities</a>—such as a
<a>career</a> shift or new romantic relationship—due to the fear of failure or
<a>embarrassment</a>. Reflecting on which opportunities are viable and the range of possible outcomes can make sure that underconfidence doesn’t prevent people from achieving success.
