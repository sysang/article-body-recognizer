<a>ambushing a Baltimore police officer</a> last week.
<div><div><p>Instead, she said, “it’s clear that you would much rather attack, disparage, and continue to use the City of Baltimore as your punching bag, in order to score political points with your conservative base.”</p></div></div>
<a>potential bid for the White House</a> built on a platform of
<a>uniting the country</a> through bipartisanship. It also highlights
<a>his fractured relationship</a> with Maryland’s largest city, whose leaders and residents have long
<a>questioned the governor’s </a>actions.
<a>Hogan told Fox News Sunday</a> that Mosby was “a big part of the problem” of continued violence in Baltimore, responding to a question that mentioned
<b> </b>the attempted murder of Officer Keona Holley, who is on life support.
<div><div><p>“We have a prosecutor in Baltimore City that refuses to prosecute violent criminals, and that’s at the root of the problem,” Hogan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the state’s probation and parole agency disagreed with Mosby’s assessment, saying the suspect was under local government — not state — supervision because of a handgun charge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mosby said she plans to ask state legislators to audit how state agencies monitor violent offenders on probation and parole.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hogan offers reward in Baltimore homicide. Some city leaders say he isn’t doing enough to stem violence.</p></div>
<a>been released</a> from state supervision weeks before the homicide, Mosby notes. Hogan has cited the killing of
<a>Evelyn Player</a> as an example of out-of-control violence that needed immediate intervention, rather than policies favored by Democrats aimed at addressing the root causes of poverty and crime.
<div><div><p>Late Tuesday, a Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services spokeswoman, Lt. Latoya Gray, said the agency was required by law to release that suspect because his supervision had ended.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In November, Hogan held a news conference in which he singled out Mosby, saying that “we also need a prosecutor who will actually prosecute violent criminals.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>After crime plummeted in 2020, Baltimore will stop drug, sex prosecutions</p></div>
<a>a letter</a> requesting detailed data and saying her state funding would be “under evaluation.”
<div><p>In supplying the data, much of which Mosby said was published on her website, she noted that the governor has been silent on rising crime in other parts of the state, and<b> </b>she directly addressed how the governor has treated her.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview, Mosby said the governor crossed a line when he implied her employees were falling down on the job.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hogan and Mosby’s relationship has <a>long been strained</a>, but it further deteriorated this year as the city logged more than 300 homicides for the seventh consecutive year and Hogan’s remarks about Mosby sharpened.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In May, Hogan <a>told reporters</a> that while he has met with other city leaders, Mosby “shouldn’t even bother” asking for a meeting.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In March, she announced her office would stop prosecuting nonviolent crimes, including drug possession, prostitution and minor traffic cases.</p></div></div>

<p>Coronavirus cases surged to new highs in parts of the Washington metropolitan area Tuesday, leading residents on a mad dash to find scarce home-testing kits and causing officials to warn of a need for tighter precautions and more hospital capacity.</p>
<div><p>Where can I get a coronavirus test in the DMV?</p></div>
<div><div><p>In D.C., the seven-day average of new cases per 100,000 reached 133 on Tuesday — the highest it’s been during the entire pandemic by far. D.C. began seeing record daily numbers of coronavirus cases on Thursday.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Some Maryland hospitals are spending three and four times the normal rate for traveling nurses who are in high demand across the country, Bob Atlas, the president and chief executive of the Maryland Hospital Association, recently said.</p></div>
<div><p>Tracking the coronavirus outbreak in D.C., Maryland and Virginia</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re paying extra to get travel nurses, and that is costing a large fortune for many of our institutions,” Atlas said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hospitals with fewer beds are also contending with a surge of flu patients that did not materialize last winter, state health officials said, leading to potentially long waits in emergency rooms and fewer surgeries for non-covid patients.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Prince George’s County, the signs of a surge are clear, officials said Tuesday, but there remains no county-specific data because of the continued fallout from a cyberattack on the Maryland state health department.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hospitals in the county are about 43 percent full, said health officer Ernest Carter, although he added that he knew that figure is “going to rise fast.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>The council also voted unanimously to allow Bowser to extend the city’s state of emergency up until March 17 if she chooses, and to require schools to continue sporadically testing students for the coronavirus until at least April.</p></div>
<div><div><p>At walk-up testing sites around town, many people waiting in long lines said they were unaware of the city’s take-home test program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later, at the Benning Stoddert Recreation Center Southeast, a line of more than 80 people stretched down East Capitol Street SE just after 1:30 p.m. Some people said they had waited more than an hour and a half for a test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ashley could not specify how many tests the city is processing in recent days but said the District has seen “tremendous demand” — with about a third of the volume coming from public testing sites.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said there is no concern about supply, with the city producing new kits each day. D.C. has also ordered 1 million rapid tests to be available to residents starting Wednesday, Ashley said.</p></div></div>

<header><div><div>Social Issues</div></div><div><h1>Refugee aid groups in Washington region overwhelmed by Afghan caseloads</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Antonio Olivo</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 12, 2021|Updated December 12, 2021 at 10:15 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>Afghans in D.C. area face their next hurdle: An affordable housing crunch.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Peck has hired 35 additional workers since July — but, she said, “You can’t go to a staffing level to serve 500 people a month overnight.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We just know that at this volume, frankly, our quality is suffering,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Evacuees who show up to their offices without first being assigned to their organization by the U.S. State Department are either being turned away or provided with limited aid, such as food stamps and basic medical care.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The evacuees are each entitled to receive $2,275 in federal support that is meant to cover housing costs, job training and other expenses over a three-month period once they are matched with a resettlement agency.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The high demand for such aid was on display inside the LSSNCA’s office in Annandale one recent morning. Clusters of evacuees arrived to an increasingly full lobby to see case managers who were already busy with other clients.</p></div>
<div><p>Afghan crisis wreaked havoc on Northern Virginia hospitals due to lack of federal planning, local officials say</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This is not the way that we should be treated,” said Wror, who has a special immigrant visa after working with U.S. officials as a psychological operations specialist for the former Afghan National Army.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I know that I am a load on my uncle,” he said. “We’re 10 people living in two bedrooms. That’s really difficult.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For example, the evacuees are being offered free housing in Oklahoma, officials said. They are also pointed to other parts of the country with more job opportunities.</p></div></div>
<a>White House’s point person</a> on Afghan resettlement. “But we also don’t want to overwhelm any one area.”
<div><div><p>But not everyone wants to disperse to parts unknown in the country. One is a 32-year-old man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for his family’s safety.</p></div></div>
<p>Last month, he and his wife took their three children out of the U.S. Air Force’s Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey when it appeared likely that they would be paired with a resettlement group in a different part of the country.</p>
<div><p>“They will send you to Alaska or Arizona,” he explained about his move, while his wife baked Afghan bread in their newly renovated kitchen. “I don’t have support there. I don’t know the culture there.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Local resettlement agencies say they’re seeing the effects of that desire to stay in the Washington region.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Thousands of Afghan children and teenage refugees will soon enroll in America's public schools</p></div>
<div><div><p>Complicating matters is the fact that many of the evacuees arrived in the United States without IDs or other documents proving who they are, making it harder to set them up with homes and work authorization, aid groups say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Biden administration has also been pushing for such a law while steering more funds toward Afghan resettlement. Since September, <a>an additional $13.3 billion</a> has been authorized for that effort.</p></div></div>
<p>Berhe, the refugee coordinator for Virginia, said the extra funds — amounting to $30 million in his state over a three-year period — will help with mental health counseling, job training and, more urgently, emergency housing assistance.</p>
<div><div><p>That could help the scores of evacuees who have shown up to the region from the military bases with no guarantee of local aid and no job prospects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bita Golshan Lotfi, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Outreach Center, said her McLean-based nonprofit has helped nearly 60 such families connect with a resettlement group while supplying them with donated clothes and food.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re coming without a resettlement agency, without furniture, without anything,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>MAYFIELD, Ky. — As the temperature dipped well below freezing and frost spread over car windows, about 150 men and women shuffled Sunday morning into the First Baptist Church on the corner of South and First streets.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it was largely spared, as was the pastor, Wes Fowler, who endured the storm in a tunnel beneath the church grounds and led the Sunday service. The rest of the town was not as fortunate.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Across a battered region, a public reckoning with unimaginable loss began Sunday, as survivors dug out homes and businesses, searched with diminishing hope for loved ones, and mourned others who died in the tornado’s path.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The need is evident everywhere. State and medical officials pleaded for blood donations, warning that in addition to the scores of dead, there are likely to be even more injuries.</p></div></div>
<span>that blew one Mayfield family’s photograph to a town 100 miles away.</span>
<div><div><p>Many simply prayed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s hard to explain to a 5-year-old what’s going on and why it happened,” Samples said. “We don’t want him to be scared of every storm.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div> A landscape changed </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The scope of the damage caused by the devastatingly powerful December tornadoes stretched across six states, leaving many dismayed by the potency of the weather and the loss of life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A sign outside a Methodist Church near Mayfield captured the powerlessness many here felt in surveying what just a few days ago were busy towns, now flatted and twisted beyond easy identification.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Pray for the storm victims,” the sign read.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Michael Kayse, an 18-year-old Mayfield resident, said he was at his friends’ house when the tornado struck. He said a tree fell and damaged a gas line near his house, causing a potentially dangerous leak.</p></div></div>
<p>Kayse said he slept in the family’s vehicle with his mother even though debris had damaged the windshield. Two friends stood next to him at the shelter, explaining that they had few answers to questions about the storm’s aftermath.</p>
<div><div><p>First responders “literally asked everybody to leave because of how bad the debris and houses were,” said Suni Hernandez, 27. “One apartment is completely gone.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for next steps, Hernandez wasn’t sure. “We don’t even know how long we’re going to be here,” Hernandez said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Beshear said “barrels of corrosive chemicals” were seeping through. “It’ll be a miracle if anyone else is found alive in it,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dozens were working the night shift when the tornado hit, although company officials said some employees may have clocked out early.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The plant sits in an industrial area of town, next to a Hutson tractor dealer and across the road from a Pilgrim’s Pride chicken plant, which residents said is probably the biggest employer in town.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chief executive Troy Propes said he was “heartbroken” by the deaths and devastation and was assisting first responders with recovery efforts. An emergency fund has been established for the factory victims.</p></div></div>
<p>“Our company is family-owned and our employees, some who have worked with us for many years, are cherished. We’re immediately establishing an emergency fund to assist our employees and their families,” he said in a statement.</p>
<div><div><p>“And that’s the last thing I heard from her,” Crouch said. “Nothing from the company.”</p></div></div>
<p>Crouch is holding out some hope. Several of her mother’s friends at work say they spotted Panameno at the hospital. Some told Crouch that her mother escaped with them but that she had a broken wrist and possibly leg and back injuries.</p>
<div><div><p>The assurances are not enough. Crouch, who lives in Norfolk, is 30 weeks pregnant and cannot travel to Mayfield to check the hospitals or shelters in person.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just feel like I need to talk to her and know that she’s okay,” Crouch said. “I just want to find her.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div> The spread of devastation </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Sunday, police identified the six people who were killed after a section of an Amazon distribution warehouse in Edwardsville, Ill., caved in during the tornado.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During a Saturday news conference, Edwardsville Fire Chief James Whiteford said, “Estimates are that the recovery portion of the incident will take about three more days.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div> Heroes in the storm </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The reckoning also revealed heroism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Trumann, Ark., Kim Gay, a licensed nursing professional, was the only staff member on duty at the Quail Run Health and Rehab elder-care facility on Friday night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aware of the storms approaching, Gay consulted with her bosses about what to do with the 35 residents there.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You decide,” she was told.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gay noticed the holiday wrapping paper decorating the residents’ rooms was fluttering. She then felt a breeze. That was when she made her decision.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She herded the residents to the building lobby, some of whom were irritated that they had to leave their rooms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Just 20 more minutes, y’all,” she told them. But the tornado “came 20 minutes sooner than I expected.”</p></div></div>
<p>The residents huddled on the floor while the building’s walls pulsated and shook. Outside, the center’s van tumbled side-over-side in the parking lot three times, Gay said. When it was over, the residents were all cleared out, unscathed.</p>
<div><p>Garris Street was one of the hardest-hit areas in town. On that block of wood-paneled homes, Patricia Austin, 71, and family members carried water-damaged family photos and other lost items from her house, whose roof had been torn off.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Austin was chatting over fresh coffee Friday evening, when the tornado barreled through.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If it hadn’t been for her, I would have been in my house,” Austin said about her neighbor. “She basically saved my life.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Austin appreciated her luck, but she was still heavy with grief over the loss of her co-worker and friend at the Dollar General.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>June Pennington, an assistant manager at the store, died while shielding another worker when a wall collapsed on them. The other worker had both his legs broken, said Austin, who worked as a cashier there.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She and Pennington were close, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I called her ‘Junebug,’ ” Austin said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few days ago, they talked about what they would get each other for Christmas. Pennington asked for a tall, good-looking man.</p></div></div>
<p>“I said: ‘That’s a tough order, but I’ll see what I can do.’ ” She laughed, then cried as a Red Cross truck passed. “She saved his life,” Austin said of Pennington. “It cost her hers.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div> Now there is nothing </div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Volunteers with Bread of Life, a Lowes, Ky.-based humanitarian effort, were busy by early Sunday with loaders and chain saws as they cleared three toppled pine trees outside the home of an elderly couple whose garage was damaged.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the parking lot, parishioners Joe Mack and Robin Brunswick sat in their red Mazda pickup surveying the damage to their church. The couple, like almost everyone else in town, had no power or water.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mack regretted throwing out his battery-powered radio when they downsized, saying that with scant battery life on one cellphone, they were cut off from the news and had no idea how high the death toll had climbed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They said they were among the more fortunate ones: Their home was minimally affected, and they have children within driving distance with whom they can stay if water and power aren’t restored soon.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We moved a few years ago from one little town that didn’t have anything to another little town that had some little stores and all,” he said of Mayfield. “And now there’s nothing here, either.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ronald Hayes was in the basement of his apartment building with about a dozen other people when the tornado hit. Above them, they heard a shrieking whistle. A portion of the basement ceiling collapsed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When they emerged, he could see that his third-floor apartment was wrecked, the roof gone, the windows smashed. “My living room was in my bedroom and my bedroom was outside,” said Hayes, 60.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His car, a white Pontiac Grand Prix, had been crushed by debris.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If we hadn’t had a basement, all of us would be dead,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hayes, along with more than 100 others, is now about 10 miles south of Mayfield in a shelter set up in the community center of a Baptist church. Most have no electricity or no home at all.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t know what’s next,” Hayes said. “I’ll just do the best I can to survive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Volunteers at the shelter said they had received huge support from local businesses. A nearby Walmart told them to come take whatever they needed. Applebee’s, Sonic and Chick Fil-A sent meals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re blessed that we can come together like this,” said Heather Payne, 43. “But it’s just devastating.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Antonio Olivo</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 17, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>Nearly 100 people died in the tornadoes<b> </b>that whirled through Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois last weekend, ripping through factories, city halls and nursing homes.</p>
<p>An assistant manager at a Dollar General store in Leachville, Ark., ran to shield one of her employees from a collapsing wall. She died when the structure toppled on her instead.</p>
<p>About 130 miles away, a woman trapped beneath the wreckage of a candle factory in Mayfield, Ky., called her mom to say goodbye. She escaped, pulled from the debris by a team of volunteers. Eight of her co-workers were not so lucky.</p>
<p>And in Samburg, Tenn., neighbors rescued an older woman who had been tossed into a tree. She was hanging upside down unconscious, her nearby home destroyed.</p>
<p>A few days later, Samburg residents came together at Gretchen Hutchinson Activity Center for an evening briefing on recovery efforts amid the stacks of donated food and clothing.</p>
<div><div><h3>“She basically saved my life.”</h3><div>- Patricia Austin, Leachville, Ark.</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first tornado reportedly touched down near Bay, Ark., around 7:07 p.m. It whirled northeast through Trumann, Monette and Leachville.</p></div></div>
<p>The tornado skipped across the rice and cotton fields of northeast Arkansas, kicking a barn to splinters and reconfiguring metal granaries as it spewed debris in all directions.</p>
<p>Then it bore down in Monette, population 1,700.</p>
<p>At Monette Manor nursing home, the workers shielded the 67 residents from the collapsing walls and roof with their own bodies.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to set them off too early and then see it not hit,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 200 homes were severely damaged. A factory and warehouse complex that was once home to the Singer Sewing Co. factory was beyond repair — an economic lifeline in the city of 7,000, extinguished in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“It’s just been hit so badly,” said Barbara Lewallen, Trumann’s mayor, working to maintain her composure in front of the roofless firehouse. “It’s going to have to eventually come down.”</p>
<p>A mile away,<b> </b>Tanner Morgan and Elizabeth Regina smiled as family and friends showed up to what was left of their house: a front corner room and an entryway with a cheerfully painted red door.</p>
<p>The tornado woke them and they ran toward an interior closet. Morgan tried to pull in their Alaskan husky, Sally, but the frightened dog ran off into the angry wind.</p>
<p>As Morgan struggled to pull the closet door shut, he saw pieces of wall, insulation and wood paneling peel away “like we were in a sandblaster.”</p>
<p>When they reopened the door, they had a clear view from where the kitchen once stood of a neighborhood laid to waste. Greeting them was Sally, who had survived.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how she did it,” Morgan said, his voice hoarse with emotion while the dog sniffed at some debris. “That’s our kid.”</p>
<p>In Leachville, Patricia Austin picked through her waterlogged belongings outside her roofless house and grieved for her friend June Pennington, the Dollar General assistant manager who died saving a co-worker.</p>
<p>Austin, 71, said a neighbor had invited her over for coffee the day of the storm. When it hit, they were still there, out of the tornado’s path, while the roof of Austin’s house flew away.</p>
<p>“If it hadn’t been for her, I would have still been in the house,” she said about the neighbor. “She basically saved my life.”</p>
<p>The thought triggered memories of Pennington. Austin, who worked as a cashier at the same Dollar General, said the selfless act was just like her friend “Junebug.”</p>
<p>“She was a wonderful lady,” Austin said, softly crying as utility workers repaired the power lines along Leachville’s lifeless downtown strip.</p>
<div><div><h3>“I call this my ‘happy to be alive’ day.”</h3><div>- Robin Taylor, Samburg, Tenn.</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>Samburg and Dresden, Tenn. are less than 50 miles apart but were hit by two different storms Friday night. The quad-state tornado tore through Samburg; just to the south, another twister leveled parts of Dresden.</p></div></div>
<p>The tornado came riding into Samburg like a marauder.</p>
<p>When it was done, the City Hall, post office and dozens of houses were shredded.</p>
<p>She huddled that night in a hallway with her mother, fighting to keep the older woman’s wheelchair steady as the house lifted and shook.</p>
<p>Afterward, they found their elderly neighbor hanging upside down from the branch of a felled cypress tree. Her home had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The woman was rescued. And Taylor was in good spirits despite the damage, thankful she has homeowner’s insurance.</p>
<p>“I call this my ‘happy to be alive’ day,” she said about her birthday while a porcelain Santa Claus figurine in the kitchen grinned behind her, undamaged beneath a gaping hole in the roof.</p>
<b> </b>buzz-sawed one side of the block — flipping a truck on its roof — while leaving the other side with barely a scratch.
<p>When the coronavirus pandemic struck, Gallimore, 59, lost work. No longer able to keep up with her expenses, she decided to cancel her house insurance, saving $435 a month.</p>
<p>Now, she’s out the $50,000 she poured into the home with a newly collapsed roof, no windows and just a sliver of porch.</p>
<p>“I got back to work last weekend and was going to get the insurance back today,” Gallimore said. The antique table and chairs sat on her lawn.</p>
<p>Kaitlyn Webb and her family were hit twice.</p>
<p>Webb was among the 100 candle factory workers trapped in Mayfield, Ky., after a tornado chewed up that city about 20 miles across the Kentucky border.</p>
<p>Webb lay beneath a collapsed wall with a broken ankle and, unsure she’d survive, managed to call her mother, Joan Turnbow, to say, “I love you.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming to get you,” Turnbow replied, running to the basement in their home at 211 E. Main Street in Dresden to fetch her car keys.</p>
<p>That’s when the buzz saw passed through.</p>
<p>“Luckily, she didn’t find her keys,” said Webb, 20.</p>
<div><div><h3>“People that don’t even know you ... offering to help.”</h3><div>— Jordan O’Neal, Cayce, Ky.</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>A tornado slammed into Cayce, Ky., Friday night, then traveled about 30 miles northeast to Mayfield.</p></div></div>
<p>On Friday night, Don Wright peered out at the hills of pecan and maple trees behind his house in Cayce. He saw a twirling black shape surrounded by lightning. It was headed right toward him.</p>
<p>Wright, 71, ran to an interior closet and yanked the door shut just as it struck, holding onto a shoelace he had tied around the latch as the wind worked to wrench open the door.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear much but the roaring,” Wright said over the drone of chain saws being used to clear out the toppled trees.</p>
<p>Thirty miles away, Luis Pardo surveyed the ruins of his mini-empire in Mayfield, Ky.</p>
<b> </b>a commercial block in this city of about 10,000. He started with a South American restaurant, which became a banquet hall. Then, he bought land for an auto detailing shop and a used-car lot.
<p>Finally, last October, he opened a regional “soccer factory” training complex with indoor and outdoor fields. It was his crowning achievement, he said.</p>
<p>None of that stood now, apart from a lot full of crumpled cars and outdoor soccer fields covered in debris. And none of it was insured, Pardo said, because he was working on getting an affordable rate that covered all his properties.</p>
<p>“You never think you’re going to lose everything at once,” he said. “I’ve never heard of a tornado coming through the city.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” Pardo said, as more than 20 young soccer players raked the field. “We may play a game after.”</p>
<div><div><h3>“We just started running through debris ... and we started carrying people down to the main highway.”</h3><div>- Lance Nosbusch, Dawson Springs, Ky.</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>The quad-state tornado hit Dawson Springs, Ky., Friday night, leveling much of the town. Bowling Green, about 90 miles away, was hit by a different tornado early Saturday morning.</p></div></div>
<p>Many people compare the sound of tornadoes to a freight train. In Dawson Springs, residents said it sounded more like a lawn mower grinding through the trees as if they were soft grass — more ferocious and surreal.</p>
<p>About 90 miles away, a tornado from a different storm struck Bowling Green. At least 15 people died, including seven children — four from the same family.</p>
<p>The tornado chewed through the recently built Moss Meadows neighborhood, home to refugees and immigrants who have altered the city’s landscape amid the southern Kentucky forests and fields.</p>
<p>“We never really thought it would happen, especially in our neighborhood,” said Joanna Escobar, 23, who huddled in a closet with her 5-year-old daughter as the wind tore into her house.</p>
<p>After nearly a week of ruin, the glow of support has started to dim and reports of looters picking through people’s belongings prompted the Kentucky National Guard to post soldiers in some heavily affected areas.</p>
<p>Carrazan had trouble sleeping in the days that followed, with a loop of the baby, the woman, the sirens and the sounds of people begging for help playing over and over in his head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “This is something. I can’t live with that. I don’t know.”</p>

<h1>Afghan siblings, wounded in Kabul airport bombing, seek new life in Northern Virginia</h1>
<h2>Mina, 8, and her brother Faisal, 13, navigated a tricky route to arrive in Alexandria. Now they must build a new life, while mourning the one they left behind.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Antonio Olivo</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<b> </b>— bounced out of her aunt’s Northern Virginia apartment for her first day of school in America.
<div><div><p>“How are you?” she said with a heavy Dari accent, practicing some English that might impress her teachers while her aunt, Ferishta Stanekzai, drove to her new school.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am fine,” Mina answered herself.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Mina is one of the hundreds of Afghans who have settled into the Washington region as part of an airlift out of Afghanistan that launched the greatest influx of refugees the United States has seen since the end of the Vietnam War.
<p>Almost all have been classified as “humanitarian parolees,” entitling them to some federal aid with no path for U.S. citizenship and no guarantee for long-term support in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.</p>
<div><p>Afghan refugees in D.C. area face their next hurdle: An affordable housing crunch</p></div>
<b> </b>bombing at the Kabul airport, as the family was trying to get through the military barricade.
<div><div><p>But all of that was far away that morning as she FaceTimed with her father, Wali Stanekzai, who remained in hiding from the Taliban — stymied in his effort to join Mina and her brother Faisal, 13, in Alexandria.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You want me to speak English?” Mina asked her father.<b> </b>“Okay. Hi. How are you? I am good.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A day of chaos</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>feared for the safety of her brother Wali and his
<b> </b>wife, Zakya, who taught English as part of a U.S.-funded education program, putting their family at risk for Taliban retribution.
<div><p>What video analysis shows about Kabul airport attack</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Get back! Get back!” anxious U.S. service members<b> </b>posted at an airport wall shouted, pointing their rifles as the crowd moved closer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then the world convulsed and bodies flew in all directions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Their children were nowhere to be found.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. officials misled public about the war in Afghanistan</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Where is my mother?’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wali stayed with his dead wife until 3 a.m., when an ambulance arrived and she was taken to a hospital.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Masi, his shoes ripped off from the blast and thinking his family had died, walked barefoot to a relative’s house a few miles away.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ibrahimi, the neighbor, had spotted Faisal lying unconscious near the remnants of the wall. He<b> </b>pointed out the boy to a U.S. service member, who carried him into a makeshift triage center set up inside the airport grounds.</p></div>
<div><div><p>As he stood outside the room, Ibrahimi heard Mina crying out from another treatment room, saying: “Oh, my God! Where is my mother? Where is my father?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ibrahimi approached a medic and told him, for expediency’s sake, that the girl with a broken thigh bone was his sister and that the boy in the next room with a broken clavicle was his brother.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Can you put them together?” he asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early the following morning, U.S. service members<b> </b>took the three to an awaiting airplane.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ibrahimi’s phone battery was almost dead. But he had enough charge left to call his mother.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Faisal and Mina are with me,” he told her. “We’re getting on an airplane but I don’t know where we’re going.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, the phone cut off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Comfort in a story</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Thousands of Afghan children and teenage refugees will soon enroll in America's public schools</p></div>
<div><div><p>Wali broke down when Ferishta phoned him to say<b> </b>that his children were alive and safe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was in such a bad condition,” he said through an interpreter in an interview over FaceTime from a location the family asked not to be disclosed out of worry for his and Masi’s safety.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The two siblings and their neighbor were flown to Dulles International Airport and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where Mina and Faisal would be further treated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ferishta visited the children at Walter Reed with plates of Afghan food, accompanied by the children’s grandparents, who live with Ferishta in Alexandria. But the children still didn’t know of their mother’s fate.</p></div>
<b> </b>agreed on a story that they believed could ease the children
<b> </b>into the eventual truth: Zakya was badly injured in a hospital and couldn’t talk.
<div><div><p>“When I come there, I will tell them myself,” Wali said in the interview, believing his arrival was only a matter of time. “Now, it will be very sad for them when their father is not with them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At one point, an imam at the hospital walked into Faisal’s room, expressing words of comfort over his dead mother.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ibrahimi was there and immediately alerted Ferishta, who called the imam, ordering: “Tell him you are mistaken.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The imam returned to a confused Faisal with an awkward apology.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was mistaken,” he said, according to Ferishta. “Wrong room.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Unaccompanied minors</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Afghan crisis wreaked havoc on Northern Virginia hospitals due to lack of federal planning, local officials say</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because neither of their parents was with them when they landed, Mina and Faisal were considered unaccompanied minors under a federal law designed to prevent human trafficking of children.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ferishta drove to the Youth for Tomorrow campus to try to see the children but was denied entry because she isn’t yet their legal guardian and hadn’t been approved as a visitor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few days later, she was allowed to talk to the children by telephone, finding them<b> </b>confused and scared that they would be abandoned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Auntie, where are you?” Mina asked, anxiously. “I heard they will give us to someone.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No one gave you to anyone,” Ferishta assured her. “We are working to get you back.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Why did all of this happen to us?” the girl asked. “We had a happy family. We didn’t do anything to anybody.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Refugee groups say the process can take as long as a month, longer if they are ultimately placed with a foster family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the sunny autumn day the three were released, Faisal silently embraced Ferishta. Mina, using a walker because of her injury, sported the new princess backpack she’d been given by a Youth for Tomorrow worker.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As she prepared to be taken to Ferishta’s home, the girl connected with her father over FaceTime, convinced that the entire family would soon be reunited.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I know English now,” she said, in Dari, as Wali showered her with praise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My name is Mina,” she said in English. “My father’s name: Wali. My mother: Zakya.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Caught in between</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now that they were with her, the question of when to tell the children about their mother’s death weighed heavily on Ferishta as she lay awake at night in her now-crowded two-bedroom apartment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She was overwhelmed by the details of suddenly becoming a single mother of two traumatized children while also financially supporting her parents — and sending money to Wali and Masi, who were unable to work.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Thousands of Afghans evacuated during withdrawal awaiting resettlement</p></div>
<div><div><p>Now, she felt helpless whenever Mina mentioned her mother while Faisal maintained an inscrutable silence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Should I tell them?” Ferishta asked, mostly herself. “Is it good to tell them? I feel caught in between.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Often, she’d find herself catching up with work late at night, poring over spreadsheets inside her small bedroom while the children were watching television or asleep.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Mina was asking more and more questions about her mother. Couldn’t someone take a smartphone into her mom’s hospital room, she suggested, just so her children could tell her they were safe?</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Life in school</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mina sat inside her second-grade classroom at Alexandria’s William Ramsay Elementary School and counted out addition problems with her fingers before scribbling her answers on a worksheet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How are you?” Maggie Donabedian, a teacher’s aide, asked before gently correcting a few errors.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a suburban classroom, learning to parent the children she left behind</p></div>
<div><div><p>Mina, wearing a face mask like everyone else in the classroom, offered a thumbs-up sign.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mina, who had decided she wanted to become a doctor, appeared to be thriving in her new environment. During a word game, where the class was asked to name something that has four legs but can’t walk, her hand quickly shot up.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“A chair?” Mina said, basking in the praise she received from her teacher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s okay,” Ferishta responded that night after hearing the story. “I’m here. I’m your mom.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No, Aunt. You’re not,” Mina said. “You are not my mom.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Festering anger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mina slammed shut her school-issued laptop one November evening, frustrated that she was not getting the correct answers on an English homework assignment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Why is this so difficult?” she shouted to her aunt in tears. “I can’t learn anything. I will never be a doctor.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“He’s your son.”
<div><p><span>Children's mental health badly harmed by the pandemic. Therapy is hard to find.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>And she was now having nightmares involving Zakya, Ferishta said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just want to talk to her, just for five minutes,” Mina once pleaded to Ferishta. “Please do something.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ferishta finally told Faisal about his mother’s death in early November,<b> </b>at the suggestion of a behavioral therapist he was now seeing. She expected tears, even encouraged them, but got just two short replies from the boy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The first: “We shouldn’t have gone to the airport that day.” The second: “Don’t tell Mina.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ferishta said she wouldn’t, knowing the promise was wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A painful discovery</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mina sat with Ferishta’s cellphone as usual, talking to her father over FaceTime.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She was home from school that late November morning, waiting to go to an appointment for minor surgery to remove a pellet-shaped piece of shrapnel from her chest that her doctor had recently discovered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mood was light. With Bradley’s help, Wali and Masi had gotten their identifications replaced and were hoping to get passports from the Taliban government — the next step in reuniting the family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mina scrolled through Ferishta’s photos to send her father some recent pictures of her life in Alexandria.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One image caught her attention: a photo of Zakya’s body wrapped in a white kafan in preparation for her burial.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Confused, she turned to Ferishta.<b> </b>“What’s this?” she asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ferishta, crushed, took the phone and informed Wali of the discovery. After some debate, she turned to Mina and said: “That’s your mom.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mina remained in shocked silence for about five minutes. Then, she curled her hands into fists and started to beat herself while crying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A torrent of questions followed:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What happened? Why wasn’t her mother flown to Germany so she could also be saved? Why did she die?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally: Why was she, Mina, only finding out now?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t want to talk to you anymore,” she told Ferishta, before locking herself in her bedroom.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ferishta cried, too. Then, after a while, she gently reminded Mina through the door that they had to leave for her surgery.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 8-year-old dutifully emerged from her room.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the hospital, she lay down on the operating table and quietly waited for another remnant of the explosion to be removed from her chest.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The time capsule is thought to store some 60 items related to the Confederacy — most tantalizingly, a possible image of President Abraham Lincoln in his casket, as suggested in cryptic news accounts at the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those reports said a 14-by-14-by-8-inch copper box was placed at the site — in what was then a tobacco field — three years before the equestrian figure of Lee was unveiled in 1890.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Protesters transformed Richmond’s Robert E. Lee memorial. Now they mourn the loss of their most powerful icon of resistance.</p></div>

<div><div><p>“We still don’t really know its dimensions or what the overall condition is,” she said Friday evening. But she was cautiously optimistic, given its unexpected and secure hiding place.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Julie Zauzmer Weil</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Antonio Olivo</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 27, 2021|Updated December 27, 2021 at 8:09 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The D.C. region went into Christmas weekend with record-setting coronavirus case rates — and came out with even worse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rapidly spreading omicron variant is tearing through the region, leaving overturned holiday plans, <a>canceled flights</a> and sports events and performances, and scared and sick residents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C., Maryland and Virginia all set records Monday, reporting the highest seven-day averages in new cases of any point during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The District reported 9,200
<b> </b>cases and two deaths from Dec. 23 to 26.
<div><p>Tracking coronavirus deaths, cases and vaccinations in D.C., Maryland and Virginia</p></div>
<a>himself tested positive last week</a>, made the grim announcement that just 13 intensive care beds are still open in the county’s hospitals; the number of people hospitalized with the disease has increased 188 percent in the past month, he said.
<div><div><p>In Virginia, where the seven-day average of new cases has nearly doubled in one week, the Northern Virginia suburban counties have been hit hard.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But because those areas also have higher rates of fully vaccinated residents, many of the new cases have been milder, making the impact on area hospitals less extreme than in other parts of the country, state health officials said.</p></div>
<div><p>Patient safety top concern as emergency rooms fill up</p></div>
<div><p>D.C. to require coronavirus vaccination to enter restaurants, gyms and other businesses</p></div>
<a>declared a health-care “disaster”</a> Friday at its Upper Chesapeake Health hospitals in Havre de Grace and Bel Air and Monday at its Baltimore Washington Medical Center in Glen Burnie, citing a staggering coronavirus caseload.
<div><div><p>“I am worried that even if it is milder, just the fact that it appears to be more transmissible will find more vulnerable people to send them into the hospital at higher rates,” Gronvall said.</p></div></div>
<p>Less than two weeks into the region’s omicron surge, Gronvall said it is too soon to say whether worse hospitalization rates will follow the rise in cases. “I have not seen anything that has made me feel reassured,” she said.</p>

<div><div><p>Hospitals also want protection from liability lawsuits, he said, because they are operating in a “catastrophic health emergency.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“All the help that we can get is going to be welcomed,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hogan, he noted, had a call Tuesday morning with the state’s multiagency <a>coronavirus</a> task force. “Additional actions will be taken as needed in line with the data and the science,” Ricci said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C., Maryland and Virginia emerge from Christmas weekend with record coronavirus case numbers</p></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland on Tuesday also resumed reporting covid-19-related deaths after a more than three-week pause because of <a>a cybersecurity breach</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the week leading up to Christmas, about 164 Marylanders died of covid-19, with the state’s more rural and less-vaccinated counties seeing dramatic increases in deaths per capita.</p></div></div>
<a> recent reports from medical experts </a>indicate that healthy people who have been vaccinated, and especially those who have been boosted, seem unlikely to develop severe infections from the omicron variant that would land them in the hospital.
<p>“A look at deaths over time—especially comparing last year’s wave to this one—is another indicator that #VaccinesWork,” Ricci tweeted, noting that this week last year, there were 44 deaths, compared with 18 this week.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials across the region report that they are trying — and often struggling — to keep up with the high demand for tests driven by the surging case numbers and holiday travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Loudoun County, a line of cars and SUVs began forming outside a free drive-through testing site at 8 a.m., prompting officials there to begin the testing more than an hour before the scheduled 10 a.m. start time.</p></div></div>
<div><p>David Goodfriend, Loudoun’s health director, said the county is working with its private contractor to increase the number of tests that will be available for another drive-through testing event planned for Thursday at the park.</p></div>
<div><p>“We want to meet that demand as well as we can,” he said. “But they’re also seeing demand in other places. So, it’s a challenge for them as well to be able to provide a larger number of tests.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If a test is available, take advantage of it,” Goodfriend said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Montgomery County, meanwhile, testing volume has nearly doubled since the week before Thanksgiving, said health department spokesperson Mary Anderson.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The county in late November was averaging about 3,500 tests per week; last week, it averaged 2,500 tests a day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At some points last year, Montgomery had as many as six county-run test sites, but some resources have since had to be redirected to the vaccination effort, Anderson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In addition, many of the staff at both testing and vaccination sites were school health nurses, who have since returned to their jobs at the county’s school system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Alexandria, people started lining up outside the Beatley Central and Duncan Branch library locations before they opened at 10 a.m., waiting to get a rapid antigen test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our phones won’t stop ringing,” Knight said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The library is excited to be a part of the solution,” Knight said about the program. “Other than running out, it’s been very successful.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Those changes are part of a host of new laws that will take effect in Virginia, the District and Maryland when 2022 begins.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Confederate pride and the Chamber of Commerce: Richmond Lee statue finally gives up its time capsule secrets.</p></div>
<a>a 5-cent surcharge on plastic shopping bags</a> that is aimed at curbing pollution in the region’s waterways, roads and open spaces — a step the District, Montgomery County and other area localities have already taken.
<a>time to switch to more eco-friendly electric leaf blowers</a> or some other alternative.

<a> notorious polluters</a>, which can be as loud as heavy traffic and cause health problems for people who breathe their fumes.
<div><p>The Department of Energy and Environment will scroll through those apps in the new year to make sure they’re following the law, said D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), who first introduced the zero-waste bill in 2019.</p></div>
<div><p>Leaf is collection behind schedule in D.C., leaving piles of leaves that can clog drains or start fires</p></div>
<div><div><p>Cheh said the department will first work to educate restaurants that violate the provision, offering grants to help cover any costs incurred by the change. After about six months, a fine will go into effect, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Maryland, low-income individuals who are pregnant will become eligible to receive health care under Medicaid for as long as a year after they give birth, instead of the current 60-day period.</p></div></div>
<p>Locally, Montgomery County will begin implementing a new council district map that creates two seats in underrepresented portions of the county, bringing the total number of district seats on the council to seven, plus four at-large seats.</p>
<div><div><p>The new map is meant to reflect the surge of Black, Latino and Asian residents in Maryland’s most populous jurisdiction.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The redistricting map also breaks up District 1, which stretches from Poolesville to Bethesda and is represented by council member Andrew Friedson (D). A new district will be structured around Wheaton, home to a large Latino population.</p></div>
<div><p>In Montgomery’s long-neglected east county, a new map stirs hope for stronger representation</p></div>

<div><div><p>“As we’ve gone throughout the public health emergency … we’ve evolved and pivoted accordingly,” Ferebee said during a news conference Tuesday.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Nicole Asbury</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Donna St. George</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 20, 2021|Updated December 20, 2021 at 9:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>As the holiday break — and a break from in-class transmission of the coronavirus — approaches for D.C. and Maryland public schools, parents and school leaders alike are wrestling with how to get students safely through the winter surge.</p>
<div><div><p>And no decision, it’s becoming apparent, will please everyone.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bowser reimposes indoor mask mandate as coronavirus cases surge</p></div>
<div><p>“We’ve lost so many days of school for these kids over the past two years,” said Hoffman, who lives in the Hill East neighborhood. “It makes me concerned that we are going to delay their return by two days.”</p></div>
<p>Coronavirus infection rates have risen in D.C. schools since Thanksgiving break, officials have said. But Ferebee noted that the testing is only “highly encouraged,” not required, before students return to classrooms in the new year.</p>
<div><div><p>“As we always remind our community, we’re in this together, and we want to ensure our family members are smart about their activities during the holidays,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hoffman, though, said students already have a week and a half of time off to get tested for the virus, which he called “plenty of time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If they really do want to distribute the test effectively or if they really wanted to amp up the protection, why not give kids rapid tests before they entered the school on Monday morning?” Hoffman said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Prince George’s students return to virtual learning amid ‘stark rise’ in covid cases</p></div>
<div><div><p>Still, the Prince George’s decision stands in contrast with neighboring Montgomery County, where officials emphasized their commitment to staying open this school year, in keeping with previous promises.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our determination to keeping our school system open five days per week has not changed,” said interim superintendent Monifa McKnight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But McKnight and others did not mention what many parents are focused on: instruction this week, through Wednesday, amid a surge in infections and just before holiday gatherings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lyric Winik, PTSA president at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, said there will definitely be fewer students in school. “It’s a very unfortunate ‘choice’ between absences and outbreaks,” she said.</p></div></div>
<p>According to school system officials, there have been more student and staff cases in December than in the first three months of the school year combined. (Positive case rates in Montgomery are still among the lowest in Maryland, they said.)</p>
<div><div><p>Adam Zimmerman, a parent of two in Rockville, said he was relieved to hear that the school system of 159,000 students intends to do all it can to stay open.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In my view, nothing should be a higher priority than keeping schools open,” he said. “[Closing] should be a last resort. Everything else should close before schools close.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the new year, there will be an increase in testing, Montgomery school officials said Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>School officials said they were not aware of any test supply problems. They get rapid tests from the state and use a vendor to supply PCR tests, they said.</p></div></div>
