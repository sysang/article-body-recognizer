<p>How to Leverage Intrinsic Motivation</p>
<p>So properly leveraging extrinsic motivation is hard. And as more leaders have begun to realize that, the conversation has shifted a tad into how to better leverage intrinsic motivation to bring out people’s best work.</p>
<a>five-factor model</a> of job characteristics that effected work outcomes (motivation being one of the most significant). Their Job Characteristics Model started with three core characteristics:
<ul><li>Skill variety</li> <li>Task <a>identity</a></li> <li>Task significance</li> </ul>
<p>Those three core characteristics are multiplied or diminished by two other characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>Autonomy</li> <li>Feedback</li> </ul>
<li>How can we provide people with more autonomy?</li>
<li>How can we put systems in place to increase feedback?</li>
<li>What can we do to increase the variety of tasks worked on?</li>
<li>How can we make sure people see the end result of their work?</li>
<li>How can we help people see that their work positively affects people?</li>
<a>wisdom</a> earlier that you can’t really increase intrinsic motivation the way you can with an incentive compensation scheme that increases extrinsic motivation. But that may not be true after all.
<p>The Significance of Task Significance</p>
<p>Maybe people just need a clear and concise answer to the question “Who are we helping?” or “Who are we fighting for?”</p>
<p>And if we do that, maybe it’s not a question of when we have to motivate people to work or when the work can motivate them. </p>
<p>Maybe we just let the “who” motivate everyone to get to work.</p>

<h1> The Power of Intrinsic Motivation </h1>
<h2> The most powerful habits are those that come completely from within. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Motivation? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Over decades of secrecy and solitude, Henry Darger worked obsessively at his art. </p>
<p>But despite dedicating his life to his art, it was never seen by anyone else until his death. It was only when he died, aged 79, that any of his work was discovered. </p>
<p>Lerner shared his pieces with the greater art world, which became similarly taken in by his work. He slowly accumulated a cult following, and today, a single original piece of his sells for more than $750,000. </p>
<a>attention</a> to his work. Above anything, the fascination with Darger has to do with the unique motivational state behind his art. How could someone dedicate so much to art that he never wanted anyone to see, much less buy?
<p>Darger and his artwork provide an interesting window into the science of motivation. </p>
<h3>The Psychology of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation</h3>
<p>Motivation is complex. Let’s say we went for a run this morning. Why did we do it? Because it feels good? Because we want to be healthy? Because we simply go for a run every morning? </p>
<p>For any given behavior, our motivations for it fall into two general camps: extrinsic and intrinsic. </p>
<p>People who are intrinsically motivated to run do so because they simply love the act of running itself. It feels like an important part of your <a>identity</a>, and you love the act of it itself — regardless of anything that can come of it. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Candy can be an effective (and tasty!) extrinsic reward</div> <div>Source: Photo by Robert Anasch via UnSplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Intrinsic motivation is great. In art, sports, or otherwise, truly loving the behavior itself, will keep you going like nothing else.</p>
<a>extrinsic motivation</a> comes in.
<h3>How Extrinsic Motivation Influences Performance</h3>

<p>Each of these provides a simple extrinsic reward, which pushes the behavior along. With the right structure, these rewards can also establish habits as well. </p>
<p>So far so good: they can be easily productized, coded into an app, and they reliably drive behavior. However, the world of extrinsic rewards is not without its downsides. </p>
<p>In certain situations, they can actually undermine performance. Consider the following perspective on marathon running, from Adam Alter’s book Irresistible. </p>

<p>But just like marathon finish times, achieving them feels good for the time being. But once we reach them, we’re left in the same place: looking for the next goal to strive for. </p>
<h3>The Psychology Of The Overjustification Effect</h3>
<p>In a word, extrinsic rewards are fleeting. They're great in the short term, but they tend to dissipate long-term. But the downsides of extrinsic rewards don’t end there: they can also have a negative impact on our intrinsic drive. </p>

<h3>Final Thoughts on Intrinsic Rewards and The Psychology of Motivation</h3>
<p>In the running world, these are people who simply love to run; running for running’s sake. And in the art world, these are people like Henry Darger: the rare ones who simply create for the sake of creation. </p>

<h1> The 10 Most Common Sources of Motivations </h1>
<h2> What motivates you to change? </h2>
<li>External incentives. If you want people to do something, emphasizing rewards (e.g., money) is powerful. But the external rewards encourage a focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term ones.</li>
<a>self-image</a>. People are motivated to be perceived favorably by themselves (e.g., kindness). Our actions offer a window into our
<a>boredom</a> or disengagement.
<li>Autonomy. People like to feel in control. We are biologically wired to seek control. It makes us happier and healthier across a number of dimensions. So giving people a sense of control (having options) is a powerful motivation.</li>
<a>happiness</a>, the overwhelming majority rate love,
<a>intimacy</a>, and social affiliation above wealth or fame, even above physical health.
<p>In sum, people are a mix of motivations. They are motivated by different needs and desires. These various motivation sources help us to appreciate the complexity of how to motivate human beings.</p>

<h1> How to Be Happy in Middle Age and Avoid a Midlife Crisis </h1>
<h2> What makes us unhappy in the middle of our lives? And what can we do about it? </h2>
<li>Research shows that after age 18, our happiness begins to decrease and doesn't recover until our mid-60s. </li>
<li>Jonathan Rauch posits that in our middle years, we see life as "a challenge to overcome rather than an adventure to be enjoyed."</li>
<li>Instead of thinking of life as a series of tasks you're supposed to complete, try to see it as a series of possibilities. </li>

<h3>What makes us unhappy in our middle years, and what can we do to get happy?</h3>
<a>career</a> setbacks or lost jobs can have the most detrimental effect. Having and raising children can bring us great joy in middle age, but it can also cause a lot of
<a>stress</a>. This is also when people get
<a>divorced</a>, lose their parents, and have more health problems. Unhappiness in middle age can't be wholly chalked up to our situations, though. When studies adjust for variables like
<a>marriage</a> and income, the curve is still U-shaped.
<p>Perhaps to be happier in the center stage of our lives, we should look to why people at the later stages are happier. Here are four tips for how to be happy in middle age and avoid a midlife crisis.</p>
<p>1. Nurture meaningful relationships and invest in what makes you happy.</p>
<a>friendship</a> will. And spend more time on your hobbies. Invest your time and energy in the things that matter most and aren't related to your everyday career climb.
<p>2. Let go of unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>3. Commiserate with your friends.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>; it's perfectly normal. So, stop beating yourself up about it.
<p>4. Live for the moment. </p>

<div> <h4>On This Page</h4> <ul> <li> The Physical Benefits of Happiness </li> <li> <a> How Health Affects Happiness </a> </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> The Physical Benefits of Happiness </h2>
<p>Researchers have pinned down connections between happiness and more specific aspects of health, such as the immune response we mount in response to a virus or how long our lives will ultimately be.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the physical benefits of happiness? </h3> </div>
<a>physical health benefits,</a> such as lower blood pressure, reduced risk of stroke, a stronger immune system, and even a longer life. Positive emotions are also linked to a reduced risk of injury in young adults and frailty in older adults.
<div> <h3> Do happier people live longer? </h3> </div>
<p>Yes, <a>happiness is correlated with a longer lifespan.</a> People who report feeling a stronger sense of happiness and well-being live longer, on average, than do those who report weaker feelings, and the effect exists for both men and women.</p>
<div> <h3> Can happiness boost your immune system? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s responsible for the connection between happiness and health? </h3> </div>
