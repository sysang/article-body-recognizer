<h1> Judge rules in Netflix’s favor over ‘13 Reasons Why’ suicide lawsuit</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 12:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 12:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The parents of a teenage girl who took her own life after watching the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” won’t see their day in court, a federal judge has ruled.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Netflix, with the support of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Herndon first spoke out in 2017 alongside the grieving family of Priscilla Chui. Both Bella and Priscilla were 15 when they died, after watching the first season of “13 Reasons Why.”</p>
<p>The bereaved father pleaded with Netflix at the time: “Don’t go through with the renewal for the second season of ‘13 Reasons Why.’ Stop this. This is wrong. You’re making money off the misery of others.”</p>
<p>Its first season finale ends with an excruciating, three-minute-long suicide montage.</p>
<a>in 2020</a>, was recently at the
<a>center of a national conversation</a> about teenage depression and suicide, drawing the
<a>ire of parents</a> despite high ratings among its young viewers. “13 Reasons Why” invited criticism from even the most progressive audiences, including
<a>according to one</a> elite NYC school.
<a>rose by 13%</a> in the three months following the release of “13 Reasons Why” in March 2017.
<p>Herndon’s lawyer, Ryan Hamilton, clarified that his client’s suit takes aim not with the show’s content but the algorithms that promote it.</p>
<p>“What this case is about is the private targeting of vulnerable children and consequences that were not only foreseeable and were foreseen but that Netflix was warned about,” he said.</p>
<p>Unconvinced, Judge Rogers concluded: “I just don’t think the lawsuit survives.”</p>
<a>teachers</a>, doctors and therapists, they ultimately decided to take “the advice of medical experts” and revise the grisly first season finale
<h1> Maya Vander may leave ‘Selling Sunset’ after her son’s tragic death</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 3:52pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 3:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Maya Vander has nowhere to go but forward. </p>
<p>The powerhouse real estate agent turned reality star from the Netflix series “Selling Sunset” is in the midst of a major life recalibration after the tragic loss of her third child, a stillborn. </p>
<p>“Just because of the logistics, going back and forth, and my kids. I kind of got away with it for Season 4 and 5, but it’s been tough, too,” Vander explained. </p>
<p>The blank slate will be something of a distraction from the trauma she still deals with every day, the 39-year-old told The Post. </p>
<p>“I know I have no choice but [to go] back to work and my old routine,” Vander said. “That being said, it’s been difficult to still process and seek answers.”</p>
<p>The family still doesn’t know why their son Mason didn’t make it. Vander found out about the stillbirth on Dec. 9, 2021, just weeks before he was due. As they await the autopsy results, they’re processing their grief in therapy.</p>
<p>“We go every Friday to the cemetery to visit our son,” she said. “Life is great, but unfortunately, [it’s] not always perfect — not always fair.”</p>
<p>Vander, who hopes to get pregnant again in the new year, has also been open about the experience of losing her son. </p>
<p>“I hope that me sharing my very personal experience with stillbirth helped other women just knowing they are not alone,” she said. </p>
<p>In the meantime, she’s setting her sights on her career. She started her own firm, Maya Vander Group, and has launched a real estate course. </p>
<p>Before she built her empire, Vander moved to the US from Israel when she was just 20 years old, following an American guy she had met while traveling.</p>
<p>“I followed him for love, and it didn’t work out,” Vander told The Post. “I was heartbroken and it was around the time I got my real estate license. And I took a chance. Everything happens for a reason.”</p>
<p>“He had just opened the office at Sunset Plaza. In LA, everybody knows each other. So one day he actually approached me, and said, ‘Hey, do you want to come work at my brokerage? I just opened it.'”</p>
<a>most recent season’s drama. </a>Then, Mary Fitzgerald, who had been dating Jason at the time, got her license and joined the firm.
<p>When the show was first picked up by Netflix, Vander had just relocated to Miami with her husband, David Miller.</p>
<p>“Once we relocated, we started filming three months later. And I basically rented a place in LA and flew back and forth,” she explained.</p>
<p>Vander is fortunate that Season 4 and 5 were shot back-to-back, which made it easier. But for Season 6, she has no plans of returning as a full cast member.</p>
<p>As the show became a commercial success, Vander had already given birth to two children, and she was on the fence on what to do. After all, flying back and forth between the West and East Coasts every week was not ideal. </p>
<p>“I cannot be an absentee mom.”</p>
<p>“I love Season 1, because they do show equal airtime with each of us, both personalized and the real estate aspect of it, which, you know, we are real estate agents. So I love that they show both aspects in Season 1.”</p>
<p>Vander pegged Quinn as the “perfect character for reality TV,” as she provides the “drama, fashion, funny lines” and understands why she was at the center in the latest season. </p>
<p>“It was entertaining but . . . there are seven other women in that show that do real estate,” she said. “Frankly, I don’t really care about the drama.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vander can’t reveal too much of her private life, although she wants to, adding that because her husband has a job in finance, he can’t be associated with a reality show.</p>
<p>Plus, she said, the finished product wasn’t always worth the hassle of leaving her life behind. </p>
<p>“I found that I flew just for people to see one line in the back of the office.” </p>

<h1> Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas’ teammates considered boycotting final meet in protest</h1>

<div> December 29, 2021 1:49pm <div> Updated <div> December 29, 2021 3:42pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A source close to the team of 41 women who considered the boycott <a>told the Daily Mail</a> that “they’ve been ignored by both Penn and the NCAA.”</p>
<p>The source told the outlet that “there is a feeling among some of the girls that they should make some sort of statement, seize the opportunity while they have a spotlight on them to make their feelings about the issue known.”</p>
<p>But after considering boycotting their Jan. 8 meet against Dartmouth, the swimmers decided against it out of concern that skipping the event would jeopardize their participation in the Ivy League championship in February, according to the report.</p>
<p>“Knowing they do not have backing from the school or NCAA, they’re reluctant to jeopardize their opportunity to make the elite Ivy League squad,” the source told outlet.</p>
<p>Other sources told the Daily Mail that the controversy will likely take center stage at the Jan. 8 event, which is traditionally a time for seniors to enjoy the limelight.</p>
<p>“It’s a very emotional day and it’s supposed to be a wonderful recognition for all the seniors have accomplished over the years,” a source told the outlet.</p>
<p>“These girls are still determined to make sure they get the proper recognition and that their moment is celebrated as it should be,” the source added.</p>
<p>A parent of one of the swimmers suggested protesting in other ways.</p>
<p>Another source told the Daily Mail that Thomas will likely blow away the upcoming competition.</p>
<p>“It’ll be like the last couple meets. Lia will finish and nobody will give a s—. Then when the first biological female finishes, there will be a huge eruption of applause,” the source said.</p>
<p>Thomas has said she’s taking an ongoing regimen of estrogen and testosterone blockers. Before her transition, she competed for three years at Penn as a man.</p>
<p>It is unknown when Thomas transitioned from male to female, but the swimmer competed as a man as recently as November 2019. NCAA rules mandate at least one year of testosterone suppression treatment to be eligible to compete as a woman.</p>

<h1> Penn teammate speaks out against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas</h1>
<div> December 9, 2021 2:50pm <div> Updated <div> December 9, 2021 3:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A teammate of Lia Thomas on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team has spoken out as the transgender swimmer has shattered school records.</p>
<p>Before her transition, Thomas competed at Penn for three years as a male. </p>
<p>An anonymous teammate of Thomas <a>spoke to the website OutKick</a>, claiming most members of the team have expressed displeasure over the situation to their coach, Mike Schnur. </p>
<p>“When the whole team is together, we have to be like, ‘Oh my gosh, go Lia, that’s great, you’re amazing.’ It’s very fake.”</p>
<p>NCAA bylaws permit transgender athletes to compete as women after they have completed one year of testosterone suppression treatment. </p>
<p>“The Ivy League is not a fast league for swimming, so that’s why it’s particularly ridiculous that we could potentially have an NCAA champion. That’s unheard of coming from the Ivy League,” the teammate said.</p>
<p>“On paper, if Lia Thomas gets back down to Will Thomas’ best times, those numbers are female world records. Faster than all the times Katie Ledecky went in college. Faster than any other Olympian you can think of.”</p>
<h1> Ivy League swimmer Lia Thomas says she’s ‘the Jackie Robinson of trans sports,’ teammate says</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 9:40pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 9:41pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Lia Thomas, the standout transgender swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania, has created a “toxic environment” for the school’s women’s team, a new report claims.</p>
<p>Speaking anonymously to The Washington Examiner, a teammate complained that Thomas has acted entitled — even likening herself to groundbreaking baseball legend Jackie Robinson.</p>
<p>“She compares herself to Jackie Robinson. She said she is like the Jackie Robinson of trans sports,” the teammate told Christopher Tremoglie, in the op-ed published Thursday.</p>
<p>Thomas competed on the Ivy League school’s men’s team for three years before transitioning genders, and has since <a>shattered women’s records</a> at the university.</p>
<p>The teammate also told the paper that Thomas has refused to follow team rules regarding dress code, and wore Penn gear on a trip to Florida despite orders to not draw attention to the team to avoid harassment.</p>
<p>Thomas said last month she just <a>ignores the widespread backlash</a> about her performance.</p>
<p>“It’s not healthy for me to read it and engage with it at all, and so I don’t, and that’s all I’ll say on that,” she said.</p>
<p>Thomas told her school paper last year that swimming remained a steady force in her life.</p>
<p>“Being trans has not affected my ability to do this sport and being able to continue is very rewarding,” she said.</p>
<p>Last week, Thomas <a>lost a race to Iszac Henig</a>, a Yale University trans athlete who swims on the women’s team.</p>

<h1> Why are so many people in Taiwan changing their names to ‘Salmon’?</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> March 18, 2021 4:12pm <div> Updated <div> March 18, 2021 4:12pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Some folks will go to great lengths for the best meals, but this one really takes the cake. </p>
<p>News outlets throughout Asia reported this week that approximately 150 insatiable sushi fans in Taiwan have legally changed their names to “Salmon” as part of a restaurant promotion, according to Agence France-Presse in Taipei.</p>
<a>Akindo Sushiro</a> with the Chinese characters for “salmon” appearing on their identification card has prompted dozens of young people to rush government offices this week to make the name change.
<p>The promotion, which allowed for up to six guests per one “salmon” reference, ended Thursday, leaving an onslaught of paperwork for local government officials to process. </p>
<a>according to local reports</a>. The country permits their citizens to legally change their name up to three times — which means some could opt to change it back — but discourage doing so frivolously.
<p>“Please be careful to take care of your good name,” read a statement made by the ministry of the interior <a>on Wednesday via Facebook</a>.</p>
<a>the Washington Post reported</a>. “We have seen changed names such as ‘Hotness Salmon,’ ‘Dip Wasabi and Eat Salmon,’ and ‘Can’t Help but Want to Eat Free Salmon.’ ”
<p>In just one day, some 200 patrons with names that included “salmon” visited on Wednesday, said Akindo Sushiro marketing manager Dory Wang.</p>
<p>A university student surnamed Ma told TVBS news channel in Kaohsiung that they had changed their name to “bao cheng gui yu,” which means something close to “Explosive Good-looking Salmon,” according to the Guardian. </p>

<h1> Maine Coon kitten outweighs a toddler: ‘Everyone confuses him with a dog’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 11:34am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 11:39am </div> </div> </div>
<p>This cat’s as big as a dog — and sweet as a baby.</p>
<p>A Maine Coone from Stary Oskol in eastern Russia is thought to be the world’s largest kitten at just under 2 years old — with perhaps years more before he stops growing.</p>
<p>Owner Yulia Minina bought the alabaster tomcat named Kefir — after the creamy cultured milk drink — two years and many pounds ago.</p>
<p>“But when strangers come to the house, everyone first confuses him with a dog,” she added.</p>
<p>In fact, Kefir weighs more than the average toddler, with 2-year-olds typically clocking in at 26 to 28 pounds, according to BabyCenter.com.</p>
<p>“I could not even think that an ordinary baby can become so big,” joked Minina.</p>
<p>She told South West News Service that the commanding kitty’s stature is matched by his charming disposition. “He not only grew up big in appearance, he is also very smart and always behaves calmly,” she boasted.</p>
<p>For all the care he requires, Minina speaks about Kefir as if he were her own son: “The look is generally like that of a person, and Kefir has a formidable appearance, but he is a very affectionate and modest child,” she mused.</p>
<p>Like a newborn begging to be coddled, she suggested: “When friends and acquaintances come to the house, all the attention is on him and he willingly allows himself to be stroked.”</p>
<p>But according to Minina, Kefir has already eclipsed the average Maine Coon.</p>
<p>Since gaining 28 pounds (12.5 kilograms) — with still two more years to size up as Maine Coons are known to grow for up to four years — Minina can’t do all the things with Kefir she used to.</p>
<p>“At night he likes to climb on me and sleep. When he was a kitten, it didn’t cause me any inconvenience,” she explained. ”But now he has become big and heavy, and, of course, it is difficult to sleep like that.”</p>
<p>Minina added that the images of her cradling the overgrown cat are evidence of his extraordinary stature as she promised, “I don’t use Photoshop.”</p>

<h1> What Ariana Grande’s zodiac sign and birth chart reveal about the superstar</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 3:42pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 5:20pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“Dangerous Woman” and pop icon Ariana Grande has been smashing records, breaking hearts and channeling Glinda the Good Witch from Broadway’s “Wicked” in leading a wildly “Popular” life.</p>
<a>has been riddled with twists and turns</a>, including
<a>a surprise marriage to Dalton Gomez</a>. (But not a surprise to me, of course; I’m an astrologer.) And her scandals have propelled her to even higher levels of fame, from the various meanings of her cute yet strange-but-probably-still-cute
<a>recent frenemy feud</a> with Blake Shelton on “The Voice.” And! We! Want! More! Now
<a>you can even “wear”</a> Ms. Grande with her new R.E.M. beauty line if you want to feel ferocious, too.
<p>Needless to say, Grande is a force to be reckoned with — and she does not care what anybody thinks about her. </p>
<p>Let’s dive into her astrology and find out why.</p>
<h2>Ariana Grande’s birth chart is ‘fabulous’ incarnate</h2>
<h2>Ariana Grande’s relationships are a hot mess, but mostly hot</h2>
<a>she’s not afraid of intensity</a>. Her Venus, connected to her romantic side, is in fiercely loyal and stubborn Taurus. That is one of the reasons she can’t get over someone until she lets out allllllll the feels.
<h2>Deeper insight into the masterpiece that is Ariana Grande</h2>
<p>If that wasn’t enough insight into Grande’s very spicy birth chart, there are a few final details I want to highlight. </p>
<p>Also, perpetual ups-and-downs are guaranteed for life. Buckle up, Grande fans! You know what that means? Hella good music! Sign me up, baby! Make me feel something!</p>
<p>Except just kind of kinky. Dangerous indeed.</p>
