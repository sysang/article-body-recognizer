<p>Newsweek reached out to Melbourne Flight Training for comment Tuesday morning but had not heard back by publication. This story will be updated with any response.</p>
<div> News Plane <a>RyanAir</a> <a>Flights</a></div>
<p>When a bird flew into a Ryanair plane's engine during takeoff, pilots diverted the flight for an emergency landing at Liverpool John Lennon Airport Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The plane, which took off from Manchester, England was meant to fly to Lanzarote before the bird flew into its engine. It landed in Liverpool, approximately 35 miles from where it originally took off from.</p>
<p>"The aircraft landed normally, and customers were transferred to a replacement aircraft which departed to Lanzarote following a short delay of approximately one hour," a statement sent to Newsweek read.</p>
<p>BBC reported that a representative with Liverpool John Lennon Airport confirmed that a Ryanair flight requested to make an unscheduled landing. Seven minutes later, the plane landed "safely and without incident."</p>
<p>What was going on in the air could be heard on the ground.</p>
<p>"The noise of the engine sounded more like a motorboat or a propeller engine," Mark Crilly told Newsweek. "At first I thought it was coming down as it was spooling quite fast but the plane was low and slow."</p>
<p>Crilly posted a tweet of the flight's path, asking others if they knew the status of the flight, writing that the engines "sounded really rough."</p>
<p>One Twitter user wrote that the noise woke him up and said it sounded like a "broken turbo prop at 3,000 feet."</p>
<p>Another replied to Crilly's tweet and said the plane flew over their house and it "sounded awful."</p>
<a>Federal Aviation Administration</a>, about 61 percent of bird strikes with planes occur during a flight's landing, 36 percent occur during take-off run and climb and 3 percent occur as the plane is en-route to its destination.
<p>Steve Landells, a former pilot and former flight safety specialist with the British Airline Pilots Association, <a>explained</a> that bird strikes are fairly common, but are rarely dangerous.</p>
<p>"Aircraft are designed and built to withstand bird strikes and pilots undergo rigorous training to enable them to deal with eventualities like a bird strike," he said.</p>
<p>In a serious incident, there may be extensive damage done to the engine, but it is unlikely that an aircraft would crash if they lose one engine.</p>
<p><a>Sullenberger told Newsweek</a> in 2015 there were numerous things he would have had to do, even if he were to land on a typical runway. That type of landing with that type of aircraft was accomplished only a few times in the history of aviation.</p>
<p>After pilots successfully landed the Ryanair plane and passengers were given a new flight, Ryanair "sincerely apologized" to its customers.</p>

<p>Halloween holiday travel plans face continued disruption with American Airlines passengers facing another day of canceled flights over parts of the U.S.</p>
<p>The world's busiest airline has cited a combination of heavy winds at two major hubs and staffing shortages for the travel chaos.</p>
<p>American Airlines has confirmed to Newsweek some 338 flights were canceled today, representing 6 percent of its total schedule.</p>
<p>This is compared to 1,060 flights grounded on Sunday, 548 on Saturday and 343 on Friday—meaning 2,289 flights have been disrupted in the past four days.</p>
<p>David Seymour, the airline's chief operating officer, said in a note to employees seen by CNN: "With additional weather throughout the system, our staffing begins to run tight as crew members end up out of their regular flight sequences.</p>
<p>"To make sure we are taking care of our customers and providing scheduling certainty for our crews, we have adjusted our operation for the last few days this month by proactively canceling some flights."</p>
<p>The ongoing travel chaos saw several would-be American Airlines passengers take to social media and express their frustration.</p>
<p>Posting an accompanying screen appearing to indicate her flights had been postponed for a second consecutive day, <a>Twitter</a> user J Nikol Jackson-Beckham said: "Absolutely NOT what I wanted to wake up to on Monday.</p>
<p>Twitter user Kimber Lee wrote on Monday: "Thanks @AmericanAir for just cancelling my flight as I'm on the way to the airport. And making it impossible to rebook. Ughhhhhh."</p>
<p>Aviation website FlightAware showed American Airlines flights scheduled to leave major airports LAX and <a>Denver</a> and on Monday morning.</p>
<p>American Airlines has announced a plan to boost employee numbers, with approximately 1,800 flight attendants returning from leave and over 600 new flight attendants starting by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Southwest has also announced it is recruiting staff, intending to have up to 5,000 new employees by the end of this year.</p>
<p><a>Skywest Airlines customers faced flight delays and cancellations across the U.S. two weeks ago, following a computer glitch</a>.</p>
<p>An airline ramp agent has given flyers a peek into how pets travel when placed in the baggage hold.</p>
<p>TikTok user @djsugue regularly takes to TikTok to show users how he loads cases on the plane and the behind-the-scenes of his job. And, when a user asked where they put the dog cages, he obliged.</p>
<p>"Can you show us where you put dog cages...please I am planning to bring my dog with me but I am very scared," asked the individual.</p>
<p>With a background noise of a yapping dog, DJ filmed from the inside of the plane's belly and showed a dog in its cage strapped down in the plane's compartment.</p>
<p>The dog is placed securely in the luggage belly but is somewhat separated from the cases. "All strapped down," assured DJ in the video.</p>
<p>A following video showed two small dogs sharing the same carrier, as DJ recommended owners pad them out with blankets. "If you ever fly with your dog again, make sure you put blankets around their cages so they can stay warm," he wrote.</p>
<p>Another video showed a small dog appearing to try to leave its carrier, biting at the wire. "Little dude was trying to get out of his cage this morning," DJ captioned the video.</p>
<p>Following videos showed various sized and breeds of dogs in cages after being loaded into the plane's baggage hold, some with water bottles attached to the cage and some without.</p>
<p>The Humane Society of the United States recommends owners consider all other options before deciding to travel with a pet, including using a pet-sitter or driving.</p>
<p>In cases when this is not possible however, they have a list of advice for owners including choosing direct flights and choosing flights that accommodate to temperatures like taking an evening flight during summer and a day one during winter.</p>
<p>The video shared online has split opinions, with some owners left concerned for the stress levels of dogs while flying, while others argued that the dogs are safe and for many it's the best option.</p>
<p>"You say you wouldn't let your dog fly like this, but most of us don't have a choice," commented one TikTok user.</p>
<p>"As a ramp agent myself we love your pets and always make sure they're okay and safe," claimed one alleged worker.</p>
<p>"Not a single dog looks overly stressed," commented another on a video of the various dogs.</p>
<p>Others however saw it differently, and felt the dogs appeared to pant, which can sometimes be a sign of stress: "Why do people think the dogs are smiling, they're literally panting."</p>
<p>"The place isn't the worst, it's the noise that makes it horrible for the animal," commented another.</p>
<p>"I'd put one of my siblings there before I put my dog," wrote one user, while another added: "I'd be crying and throwing up the entire plane ride knowing how lonely and scared he is."</p>
<a>this week directed</a> all airlines that operate flights traveling into the U.S. to share passenger information for anyone who was recently in the eight African countries covered by the travel ban President
<a>Joe Biden</a> issued last week.
<a>WHO</a>) identified a new coronavirus variant, known as Omicron, as a "variant of concern." Health officials in South Africa first alerted the WHO of the variant's emergence in the area on November 24.
<p>The information "must be provided for all flights that departed on or after 12:01 AM ET, November 29, 2021," the time Biden's travel ban went into effect, the CDC's directive said.</p>
<p>"CDC is issuing this Directive to prevent the importation and spread of a communicable disease of public health importance," the directive said. It will remain in place "until rescinded or modified," according to the CDC.</p>
<a>American Airlines</a>, Delta Air Lines and
<a>United Airlines</a> all intend to comply with the CDC's latest directive. Each of the three airlines confirmed with Newsweek their intention to comply with the order when reached later Wednesday for comment.
<p>Update 12/1/21, 12:55 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.</p>
<p>American Airlines is scaling back what was supposed to be an expanded summer flight schedule because Boeing was not being able to deliver its 787 jetliners.</p>
<p>According to a Thursday memo from American Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja to airline employees, the company was expecting 13 additional Boeing 787s, also called Dreamliners, by winter.</p>
<p>However, due to production issues such as faulty parts, Boeing had to slow its production and failed to deliver the planes.</p>
<p>American spokeswoman Andrea Koos said the airline had planned to operate at 89 percent of its 2019 schedule by the summer of 2022. Now, they are lowering the goal to about 80 percent.</p>
<p>Without the planes, the company "simply won't be able to fly as much internationally as we had planned next summer, or as we did in summer 2019," Raja said in the memo.</p>
<p>The memo added that American no longer will be able to fly to Edinburgh, Scotland; Shannon, Ireland; or Hong Kong. It will also have to cut flights they were planning to offer soon to destinations such as Shanghai and Sydney.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, Boeing said it was working to fix its production issues.</p>
<p>"Our team is continuing comprehensive inspections and rework, as needed, on undelivered airplanes, while holding transparent discussions (with the Federal Aviation Administration)," the statement said.</p>
<p>The twin-aisle Boeing 787 jet is popular with airlines for long flights because of its improved fuel efficiency over older planes of similar size.</p>
<p>"Boeing has advised us that they will compensate American for their inability to deliver the aircraft," he added.</p>
<p>In the emailed statement, Chicago-based Boeing did not address compensation but said it regrets the impact of delayed deliveries on its airline customers.</p>
<p>According to the memo, American won't bring back some destinations it served in 2019, including Prague. It will also delay starting new service including flights between Seattle and Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>American expects to resume a full schedule to Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, London, Dublin and Madrid, according to the memo.</p>
<p>Airbus said it regrets the need to hire lawyers, but "it has become necessary to defend its position and reputation."</p>

<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Video of Pilot Announcing to Passengers He Just Tested Positive for COVID Goes Viral</h1><div> By Kate Fowler <time>On 12/22/21 at 8:08 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> World Tiktok <a>Flights</a> <a>Pilot</a></div>
<p>A flight in Britain was delayed after the pilot received a positive COVID-19 test result while in the cockpit. One passenger documented the experience through a viral TikTok series.</p>
<p>The flight was boarded, ready to take off for the nearly 9-hour journey to Barbados, but passengers were left waiting without updates for two hours.</p>
<p>It was then announced that the pilot had been informed he was COVID-19 positive.</p>
<p>Passenger Darcy Bourne, 20, shared the moment to TikTok, writing: "Pilot just got a text saying he tested positive so we're all stuck on the plane."</p>
<p>The video can be seen in full here.</p>
<p>In a statement to Newsweek, British Airways explained: "We apologized and thanked customers for their patience and understanding while our teams worked hard to replace a pilot at short notice, so that they could continue their journey."</p>
<p>Bourne uploaded a second video of the incident from the departure lounge, writing: "Update; they kicked us all off five hours later and gave us all £4 food vouchers."</p>
<p>In a since-deleted video, Darcy reportedly claimed the test had simply been a false positive, making the 17-hour journey all the more frustrating.</p>
<p>"We get on the plane about 9 a.m. and are meant to take off at 10 a.m. At 10.45 a.m. I was like 'What is going on?'" she reportedly said in the post.</p>
<p>"The pilot makes an announcement and he's like 'Hey guys, I'm sorry, I just tested positive for COVID.' But we're not allowed to leave our seats. Three hours have gone by and we're still sitting in our seats...can't eat, can't move....come on.</p>
<p>"People are getting rowdy, so they let us off the plane and give us £4 food vouchers. You can barely even get a water for £4 at the airport.</p>
<p>"Then, two hours after that, so like 5 hours, they tell us it was a false positive. He never had COVID. So we're back on the plane, it's all good, except the food has gone off, they had to throw out our food for the 10-hour flight."</p>
<p>British Airways confirmed to Newsweek that catering was unavailable for the flight due to the delay.</p>
<p>Bourne did, however, reveal that passengers were greeted with a free bottle of Caribbean rum upon arrival.</p>
<p>The airline also confirmed that passengers were given a letter of apology and are being contacted over the coming days to offer a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines, like several other airlines, canceled hundreds of flights over the holiday weekend but said it was because of a winter storm in the Pacific Northwest, not COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Alaska Airlines canceled nearly 250 flights from Seattle and estimated more than 100 additional flights would be canceled on Monday.</p>
<p>Sunday's winter storm system covered Seattle with roughly 6 inches of snow overnight. Emergency warming shelters were opened in parts of the state after temperatures plummeted into the teens and were expected to stick around for at least a few days.</p>
<p>There is more snow predicted for the Seattle area on Thursday, but only 1 to 3 inches of accumulation is expected, according to the Weather Channel.</p>
<p>Flights leaving out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport were delayed about an hour on Monday because the runways needed to be plowed and planes needed to go through the de-icing process before takeoff.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines said it previously struggled with crew members calling out sick with COVID-19, but it was not a factor in the recent flight cancellations.</p>
<p>United said it canceled 115 flights Monday, out of more than 4,000 scheduled, due to crews out with COVID-19.</p>

<div> U.S. National Guard <a>Taiwan</a> <a>China</a></div>
<p>Senators from both sides of the aisle introduced new legislation on Tuesday that would see the <a>National Guard</a> establish a formal working relationship with <a>Taiwan</a>'s military at a time of increased security threats from <a>China</a>.</p>
<a>Congress</a> by a group of 13
<a>Democrats</a>, would be non-binding but signal that the United States "should continue to support the development of capable, ready, and modern defense forces for Taiwan to maintain its self-defense."
<a>Taiwan Relations Act</a>, provisions of which allow the U.S. to sell defensive articles to the self-ruled island that is
<a>under constant threat</a> from Beijing's "unification" ambitions.
<p>The new partnership, which was also introduced in the <a>House</a> on the same day, would "ensure a well-integrated defense force capable of fast deployment during a crisis," they said.</p>
<p>"Taiwan is a critical ally in a region facing growing destabilization and competition for power. This legislation would help ensure the National Guard is ready to act in support of Taiwan should its autonomy be threatened," Cornyn said.</p>
<p>Duckworth, a National Guard veteran who served in Iraq, called Taiwan "an important strategic partner for the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>
<a>noteworthy visit to Taipei on June 6</a>.
<p>Duckworth said the National Guard was "ideally suited to help build partner capacity across this range of skill sets in Taiwan."</p>
<p>"This legislation carries an important message to General Secretary Xi that we will not tolerate his threats against Taiwan's autonomy," he added.</p>
<a>Ted Cruz</a> (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS).
<p>In the lower house, the legislation was tabled by Representatives Mike Gallagher (WI-08), Andy Kim (NJ-03), Lisa McClain (MI-10) and Stephanie Murphy (FL-07).</p>

<a>Josh Hawley</a> on Tuesday aims to increase American support for

<a>Democrats</a> coalesce around a growing bipartisan consensus on the urgency of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait.
<a>Xi Jinping</a> secures a likely third term, in which Taiwan's defense establishment
<a>People's Liberation Army</a> will possess the capabilities to launch a full-scale invasion at a minimal loss.
<p>But even after Taiwan's budget rises to the expected $25.6 billion, Hawley's $3 billion initiative would still amount to a significant 11.7 percent of the island's total defense expenses for next year.</p>
<p>Still missing are Taiwan's missile boats and unmanned aerial capabilities. Taipei is awaiting the delivery of four MQ-9B SeaGuardian UAVs approved for sale by the Trump administration last November.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou said the government would follow the bill's progress through <a>Congress</a>. In a written statement to Newsweek, she thanked lawmakers for supporting the U.S.-Taiwan security relationship.</p>
<p>Hawley's bill sends "a clear signal" that says Taiwan is "a red line that doesn't allow for miscalculation," he said.</p>
<p>"We Taiwanese know it is our responsibility to face this crisis, but if the world thinks conflict here will result in a global disaster, then it should take clear steps to prevent Beijing's miscalculation," said Wang.</p>
<p>Taiwan expects to take delivery of modern fighting equipment including 108 M1A2T Abrams, 66 F-16Vs, HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and the first of its domestically built diesel-electric submarines.</p>
<p>The period between 2023 and 2027—covered by Hawley's bill—will be Taiwan's "darkness before dawn," the Taiwanese lawmaker said.</p>

<div> News Russia <a>Human rights</a></div>
<p>Protests have broken out in Russia after the country's Supreme Court ruled that a human rights group needs to be shut down.</p>
<p>"Of course, nothing is over with this. We will appeal, and Memorial will live on with the people," said Memorial lawyer Maria Eismont, "because it's the people behind it serving this great cause first and foremost. The work will continue."</p>
<p>Memorial currently consists of more than 50 groups in Russia and other countries. It was previously labeled as a "foreign agent" in 2016, subjecting it to increased government scrutiny.</p>
<p>Pressure on the group has sparked public outrage, with many prominent figures speaking out in its support this month. Several people were reportedly detained on Tuesday for picketing the courthouse.</p>
<p>Memorial's branch, the Memorial Human Rights Center, is up for closure as well, with a court hearing in the Moscow City Court scheduled for Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>OVD-Info condemned the ruling to shut down Memorial.</p>
<p>"Memorial is an institution of national memory about the times of the Great Terror and Soviet repressions," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Another Navalny ally, Lilia Chanysheva, was arrested and jailed in November on similar charges. She used to head Navalny's office in the Russian region of Bashkortostan and is facing up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.</p>
<p>Most of his top allies have faced prosecution this year on various criminal charges and have left Russia.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
