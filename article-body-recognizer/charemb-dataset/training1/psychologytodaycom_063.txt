<h1> What Is Exploratory Learning? </h1>
<h2> How following your curiosity helps you adapt and thrive. </h2>
<li>Learning is primarily aimed at helping us survive and thrive in “unpredictable conditions,” which pretty much seems like life.</li>
<li>Exploratory learning builds on the standard distinction between exploration and exploitation in the field of organizational learning.</li>
<li>Exploitation is engaging in the same activities, following routines, and getting tasks completed. </li>
<p>Why do we learn? This is the provocative question that Stanislas Dehaene asks in his book How We Learn.<sup>1</sup> But you’ve probably never asked yourself: “Why do we learn in the first place?” As Dehaene states:</p>
<p>The question seems almost absurd to ask, but the answer grounds learning in adaptation. As Dehaene continues:</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2>Why You Should Give More to Yourself</h2> <p>Giving to yourself comes in many forms, most of them in small moments in everyday life.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Find Joy at this Moment</a></h2> <p>The present moment is continually passing away, so relax and be open to this moment. Not planning, not worrying, not lost in thought.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Find What Is Sacred to You</a></h2> <p>What is sacred to you? Maybe you already know. Try to find a place or time that is peaceful and softly raise these questions to yourself.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Enjoy the Richness of this Moment</a></h2> <p>Be mindful of rushing—your own and others. See how other people assume deadlines that aren't actually real or feel pressured and intense about things that aren't that important.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Importance of Finding What Guides You</a></h2> <p>What's the light that will guide you out of your own tangled woods — both the woods "out there" in the world and the ones "in here," in your own mind?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Don't Cling, Just Love</a></h2> <p>As you cling less, it becomes natural for one to lighten up, stay out of quarrels, have more compassion, and forgive. You'll feel more nourished by the richness inherent in the present.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Direct Your Attention</a></h2> <p>Controlling your attention is being able to place it where you want it and keep it there, and being able to pull it away from what's bothersome or pointless.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Stop Stressing About Things You Can't Change</a></h2> <p>In our Green Zone, we are usually benevolent toward ourselves and to the world. Then we rev up into the Red Zone to deal with issues.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Be Warmhearted</a></h2> <p>Appreciate some of the benevolence that buoys you along. Most people are fair-minded, empathic, cooperative, compassionate, and kind — in a word, warmhearted.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Give Daily Offerings to Yourself and Others</a></h2> <p>Listen to your heart for offerings calling to be expressed. Maybe it's the offering of never speaking out of anger, or really starting that novel, or determining to give love.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Positive Self Talk Is Important</a></h2> <p>Inner criticism tears you down. Commit to skillful corrections. Take a breath and deliberately name three strengths or virtues you have and let them sink in.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Own Up to Your Faults and Move on</a></h2> <p>Remind yourself that it's in your own best interest to admit your faults and move on. It takes a strong person to do this, and it puts us in a stronger position with others.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Being the Body Is Telling a Truth</a></h2> <p>Focus on what others communicate, and try to receive that as a valuable offering. Open your mind to the good that is implicit or down deep in the other person.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Get Back to Life's Basics</a></h2> <p>There may be a cost to not attending to the fundamentals of relationship-building with others and ourselves. Here are some tips on how to return to and practice the basics. </p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Know that Your Good Deeds Help to Make You a Good Person</a></h2>
<p>Try to take in the good of feeling cared about; recognize the goodness in your acts of thought, word, and deed. Enjoy this beautiful goodness, so real and so true.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Nurture the Wolf of Love</a></h2> <p>The wolf of hate breeds alienation and conflict with others. The wolf of love is fed with our hearts, hope, and by our sense of what's good.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why the Tone of Your Voice Makes Such a Difference</a></h2> <p>Take responsibility for your tone and its impacts, and recommit to a clearer, cleaner, more direct way of expressing yourself.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Lessen the Pressure on Yourself</a></h2> <p>The pressure activates ancient motivational circuits that were very effective in keeping our ancestors alive but even at best, there is an inherent collateral damage.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Rest or Relaxation Can Help You Through Challenges</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it helps to shake things up, distract yourself, burn off steam, rest, or enjoy something. A respite or some sort of pleasure will help to refuel you for challenges.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Be Still In Your Mind</a></h2> <p>Stillness is a source of clarity and peace. In stillness, you can find refuge and some quiet amidst the noise.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Love the Earth, Our Home</a></h2> <p>When you love the world, you both appreciate and care for it. These actions make you feel good, plus they help you preserve and improve everything you depend on for air and food.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Stage Three of Brain Development</a></h2> <p>Hug the monkey inside yourself. It helps satisfy an innate need for connection, can remedy old pain, and provides that fundamental form of sustenance: love.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Stage Two of Brain Development</a></h2> <p>When you help the early mammalian parts of your brain feel rewarded and fulfilled, it's easier to let go of longing, disappointment, and craving.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Your Brain Developed in Three Basic Stages</a></h2> <p>The brain is highly integrated and has three key functions: avoiding, approaching, and attaching.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Let Good Guide You</a></h2> <p>We are constructed each moment by currents. We have no choice about being lived by these currents. But we can choose to give ourselves over to the good ones.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>There Is Value in Space and the Emptiness It Holds</a></h2> <p>Enjoy emptiness in all its forms, including the space between thoughts as your mind calms and becomes still when you have no plans at all.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Take Time to Recall What's Really Important</a></h2> <p>While it's good advice not to sweat the small stuff, we also need to nurture the large stuff. There are many good reasons to do so.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why You Should Take Breaks from Your Daily Routine</a></h2> <p>Tell the truth to yourself about how much time you actually truly come to rest, and then set aside more time when you don't do anything at all.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Bask in Your Accomplishments</a></h2> <p>To survive, animals — including us — have to be goal-directed, leaning into the future. This focus can get confused and stressful.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Recognize Your Part</a></h2> <p>Acknowledging one's own part in a difficult situation is one of the hardest, and most honorable, things a person can do.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<a>altruism</a>, and other kinds of “prosocial” behavior. As Bertrand Russell wrote: "The good life is a happy life. I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy; I mean that if you are happy you will be good."
<p>Gifting yourself comes in many forms, most of them in small moments in everyday life. For example, as I write this, the gift is to lean back from the keyboard, take a breath, look out the window, and relax. It’s a do-able gift.</p>
<p>You could also imagine a deeply nurturing being and see what this one gives you—and then open to giving this to yourself.</p>
<a>wisdom</a>, cherishing and support, let your gifts flow to that one being in this world over whom you have the most power and therefore to whom you have the highest duty of care—the one who has your name.

<h2> Part 2: The role of genes and the environment in hysteria and high sensitivity. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Are You a Highly Sensitive Person? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Victorian hysteria was predominantly understood as stemming from a woman's nervous system.</li>
<li>Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) is currently theorized as epigenetic in nature, meaning the environment influences the expression of genes.</li>
<li>Though neither men nor women are more predisposed to SPS, gender expectations can influence the expression of sensitivity in men and boys.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kat J/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p><a>Part 1 </a>of this series explored how Victorian and contemporary medicine talked about hysteria and <a>sensory processing sensitivity</a> (SPS), respectively, as sensorial-emotional maladies.</p>
<a>[1] </a>According to other physicians, whenever a woman saw or even remembered an object, emotions would arise immediately.
<a>sensory processing</a> sensitivity (SPS) is still, in part, understood as an innate condition of a person’s
<a>nervous system</a> (like hysteria was understood to be a part of women’s innate nervous constitution) research has recently come to suggest that SPS is
<a>epigenetic</a> in nature; it has also begun to tease out the different genetic and environmental aspects.
<p>So if both genes and environments contribute to people’s differential susceptibility to stimuli, then the question becomes: What genes and what environments, in particular, “cause” this trait in 15 to 20 percent of individuals?</p>
<h3>Identifying the Role of Genes in High Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Researchers have been actively asking the question of which genes cause sensitivity for the last decade, but haven’t yet come to an agreed-upon consensus. </p>
<a>the environment</a>. They concluded that those carrying multiple plasticity alleles will be more susceptible than those individuals carrying fewer plasticity alleles.
<a>[3] </a>Another research team, Acevedo et. al., studied the S-allele (serotonin transporter) and concluded that the serotonin transporter might come into play in the
<a>[4]</a> Homberg also claims that 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region) may be involved in SPS, but that more research needs to be done.
<h3>Exploring the Role of Environmental Factors</h3>
<a>childhood</a> experience strongly influences the genetic expression of SPS emerges frequently in the literature.
<a>[7] </a>Those with genetic predisposition but with better childhood experiences will remain sensitive but will not fall under the double-risk model of not only sensitivity but also

<h1> #WearBlueDay: Take a Stand Against Human Trafficking </h1>
<h2> On January 11, wear blue and raise human trafficking awareness on social media. </h2>
<li>The Blue Campaign helps identify potential victims of human trafficking and also helps victims name what is happening to them.</li>
<li>Social media ribbon campaigns especially help youth build community and support in issues of racial, gender, and other injustices. </li>
<li>Blue, the selected color for ending human trafficking, is the color of possibility and change.</li>
<a>social isolation</a> could only be pierced by the digital promise of social media.
<a>find community and support in issues</a> of racial,
<a>gender</a>, and other injustices. In fact, how news is framed can directly
<a>inspire activism</a> and action especially among youth and students.
<a>Blue Heart campaign</a>. According to the UN, this color was selected because it represents the sadness of those who are trafficked and the cold-heartedness of traffickers.

<h2><a>The "Glass Cliff": Why Someone May Take a Risky Promotion</a></h2>
<p>Racial minorities are often placed in leadership positions when the risk of failure is high, a phenomenon known as the "glass cliff." Accepting the role brings risk—but also the chance of high reward.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Are Those With Gender Egalitarian Views Also Anti-Racists?</a></h2> <p>Are feminists also anti-racist? Not necessarily. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Dramatic Rise in the Nation's Multiracial Population</a></h2> <p>What accounts for the dramatic increase in those who racially identified as "two or more races" in the 2020 census?</p> </div> </div> </div>

<h2><a>Family Relations After Interracial Marriage</a></h2>
<p>Approval of interracial marriage as an institution has vastly increased over the decades, but research suggests interracial couples like Harry and Meghan may still face challenges.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Millennials May Not Be as Racially Tolerant as They Seem</a></h2> <p>Attitudinal studies suggest that Millennials are racially tolerant, but behavioral studies say otherwise.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>COVID-19 and the Socioeconomic Future of Youth</a></h2>
<p>Does COVID-19 have an adverse impact on the educational and occupational trajectories of new graduates? New data seems to point in that direction, but the impact may not be even. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Collection of Racial Data About Covid-19</a></h2> <p>Why are there such contrasting views about the collection of race data on COVID-19 in Canada?</p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> The "Glass Cliff": Why Someone May Take a Risky Promotion </h1>
<h2> "Glass cliff" positions are a strategic move in the face of promotion barriers. </h2>
<li>Racial minorities are often promoted to high-status positions during period of crisis.</li>
<li>These "glass cliff" promotions emerge because of barriers to promotion for racial minorities.</li>
<li>Such promotions may be high risk/high return strategies employed by highly qualified minorities to deal with barriers to promotion.</li>
<sup>2</sup> Inequality scholars argue that organizations offer "glass cliff" promotions to racial minorities because they view them as more expendable.

<h1> What Is Toxic Positivity? </h1>
<h2> What distinguishes good positivity from bad positivity? </h2>
<li>Positivity can be good for well-being, as long as we’re not using it to avoid or suppress negative emotions. </li>
<li>Toxic positivity is defined as the act of rejecting or denying stress, negativity, or other negative experiences that exist. </li>
<li>Because negative emotions are tools we use to get important needs met, we don’t just want to be shoving them away without acknowledgment. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Foundry Co/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Toxic positivity is defined as the act of rejecting or denying <a>stress</a>, negativity, or other negative experiences that exist (Sokal, Trudel, Babb, 2020).</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of toxic positivity:</p>
<li>I say: “I’m having a bad day.” Toxic response: “But you have so much to be grateful for.”</li>
<li>I say: “I don’t know if I can have a relationship with my sister. She doesn’t treat me with decency and respect.” Toxic response: “She’s family. You should love her no matter what.”</li>
<li>I say: “This job sucks.” Toxic response: “You’re lucky you even have a job.”</li>
<p>In these examples, someone is using positivity to get rid of our true or negative experiences. </p>
<h3>When Does Positivity Become Toxic?</h3>
<a>emotion regulation</a> skill that we’re not good at, it could actually leave us worse off. And, for many people, positivity can be a difficult skill to develop and implement. So if you’re not good at being positive,
<a>optimistic</a>, or reflecting on your situation to find the silver lining, it could actually be bad for you (Ford Troy, 2019).

<p>How to understand the teenage brain</p>
<p><a>David Schwartz LMFT</a></p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>Helping Your Child Develop into a Caring Human Being</h2> <p>When raising children, compassion can be one of the most important qualities they develop toward having a happy and successful life.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Are You Emotionally Overwhelming Your Kids?</a></h2> <p>When we become frustrated with a child's behavior, it's important to moderate how we respond. Angry outbursts can be damaging.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>5 Ways to Help Reduce Teenage Defiance</a></h2> <p>Any parent of teenagers has likely been in arguments that have escalated. These strategies can help reduce conflict and create a more comfortable household.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>With Teenagers, It’s All About Timing </a></h2> <p>Arguing with teenagers when they are emotionally reactive is often a waste of time.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Remembering Who’s the Parent</a></h2> <p>Teenagers often challenge their parents' authority. When parents get emotionally caught while arguing with their child, they may overreact and potentially damage that relationship. </p> </div>
<h2><a>A Child’s Sense of Creative Freedom Is Joyous Yet Fragile</a></h2>
<p>Children start life feeling unguarded and free to express themselves in any way they choose. It is up to the adults in their lives to help protect that freedom.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Importance of Self-Care for Parents</a></h2> <p>Raising children is a full-time job. But that doesn't mean you have to give up your own needs.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>7 Truths Children Need to Know</a></h2> <p>What are the most important values we can instill in our children? Perhaps the ability to help them clear a pathway to success while staying true to who they are.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Teens Often Play "Divide and Conquer" to Get What They Want</a></h2>
<p>Teenagers often argue with parents to get their way. They also may attempt to pit one parent against the other. It's important that parents stay united in dealing with their teens.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Don’t Stay Together for the Kids</a></h2> <p>Staying together for the children is not nearly as important as staying together for yourselves. The stronger you are as a couple, the better home you will provide for your kids.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>When You Can’t Reason With Your Teenager</a></h2> <p>Teenagers are going through many changes, both physically and emotionally. These changes often bring heightened emotions that can make it difficult to reason with them.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Puberty Can Be Emotionally Overwhelming to Adolescents</a></h2> <p>Adolescents' physical changes often outpace emotional ones. This can be overwhelming and cause teens significant emotional distress.</p> </div> </div> </div>
