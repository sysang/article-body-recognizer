<h2><a>Why Won't People Let Go of Their Anger?</a></h2>
<p>Anger is the body's last ditch effort to control a threatening situation. It is a heightened flight or fight state. It is protective but blocks effective treatment of chronic pain.</p>
<div> <h2><a>“Stupid Stress”: Taking on the World’s Suffering</a></h2> <p>Just dealing with daily life is stressful enough, but we mentally take on the world's issues and become more agitated. Why do we do this to ourselves?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Perfectionism—the Ultimate Victim Role</a></h2> <p>Choosing "perfect" as your standard places you permanently into an angry, agitated state. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Impact of Anger on Your Life and Pain</a></h2> <p>Anger is your body's last-ditch effort to regain control of an anxiety-producing situation. It is destructive, including to yourself and those close to you. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>The Curse of Consciousness: Trapped by Your Thoughts</a></h2> <p>The inability to escape from our thoughts is the curse of consciousness. Suppressing them is problematic but positive thinking is even worse. There are solutions.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Mortal Combat: A Look at How Feuding Neighbors Are Hurting Each Other</a></h2>
<p>Many people cannot let go of their anger or they need it. That historically includes me. You always have a choice. Why are these people holding on? It is destroying them.</p>
<h2><a>Solving and Preventing Chronic Mental and Physical Disease</a></h2>
<p>Chronic stress causes mental and physical illness by creating a sustained flight or fight response. Understanding the body's response to threats allows you to mitigate this process.</p>
<h2><a>Create Your Reality Without Pain: Neuroplasticity</a></h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a neurological problem that doesn't respond to structural treatments. Stimulating the brain to shift to more functional circuits is a core strategy in solving it.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Escaping the Abyss of Chronic Pain</a></h2> <p>After 15 years of chronic pain and desperately attempting everything to escape, the process that evolved has been consistently helpful.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Descent into the Abyss of Chronic Pain </a></h2> <p>I went from a normal and productive life to experiencing over 17 symptoms in a matter of few months. This is my story.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Gift of Acute Pain</a></h2> <p>All life, from one-celled organisms to Homo sapiens, evolved from avoiding threats and gravitating to safety. Acute pain is an essential aspect of this response, and it is a gift.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Dynamic Healing—The New Paradigm Medicine Needs</a></h2>
<p>Chronic disease is created by prolonged exposure to stress, which fires up the fight-or-flight response. Unless the root cause is addressed, the problem will progress.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Darkness: The Abyss of Chronic Pain</a></h2> <p>Sustained exposure to threat creates an adverse neurochemical state with physical and mental symptoms. People become despondent without hope. It is the starting point of healing.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>How Chronic Stress Affects Physiology and Well-Being</a></h2> <p>It has been well-documented that chronic stress is deadly but why? It is because your body is in a sustained state of flight or flight and its defenses are worn down.</p> </div>
<h2><a>"Medically Unexplained Symptoms"? Always a Wrong Diagnosis</a></h2>
<p>Many patients suffer from symptoms without an obvious cause. They may be given a diagnosis of "Medically Unexplained Symptoms." All symptoms have a cause, and worse, the label destroys hope. </p>
<div> <h2><a>The Most Destructive Diagnosis in Medicine</a></h2> <p>All symptoms created by your body have a cause. By knowing the reasons, it is solvable. The diagnosis of medically unexplained symptoms is inaccurate and takes away hope.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Becoming a "Genius" at Not Feeling Pain</a></h2> <p>Any high-level skill requires repetition to become automatic. Survival reactions in response to pain are programmed in quickly and we become "experts" in feeling pain.</p> </div>

<h1> When Is a Mentally Disordered Person Dangerous? </h1>
<h2> The relationship between violence and mental illness is complex. </h2>
<li>Individuals with a non-paranoid form of mental illness are not likely to be dangerous.</li>
<li>Obtrusive or inappropriate behavior is understandably concerning to others, but does not necessarily augur violence.</li>
<li>The mixture of mental illness and substance abuse is potentially dangerous. </li>
<a>psychotic</a> conditions. For instance, the risk of a violent conviction for people who abuse
<a>anxiety</a> disorder are at a greater risk than those in the general public, at about 4-5%.
<p>When you reflect on these numbers, it’s important to keep in mind that most people do not commit violent acts, be they mentally ill, alcoholics, drug users, or those individuals grappling with anxiety.</p>
<p>So how does one identify a mentally disordered individual who might be a danger? Below are some signs and symptoms.</p>
<a>attention</a>… I was in my head…”
<p>Jason had a history of mental illness, with symptoms of auditory hallucinations. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but not with a paranoid form of the illness.</p>
<a>stressed</a>, the voices might call him pejorative names. Still, he had never been violent.
<p>The court agreed and Jason was placed in a comprehensive treatment program, in lieu of incarceration. </p>
<p>Here’s the takeaways regarding the nexus between mental illness and violence:</p>
<p>Someone with a mental illness who is paranoid and with command hallucinations is potentially dangerous. That risk of violence becomes combustible when <a>substance abuse</a> is mixed with paranoid thinking.</p>
<p>Those displaying these kinds of dangerous symptoms or behavior should be cleared by a mental health professional before returning to their everyday lives.</p>

<a>therapy</a>, can stop depression before it starts by diminishing reactivity to distressing experiences, effectively enabling disengagement of
<a>attention</a> from the repetitive negative thoughts that often set the downward spiral of mood in motion.

<h2> What Are the Signs of Depression? </h2>
<p>Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience a few symptoms, some many. The severity of symptoms varies among individuals and over time.</p>
<a>anxious</a>, or empty mood; feelings of hopelessness or
<a>pessimism</a>; and feelings of
<a>guilt</a>, worthlessness, or helplessness. It can also involve loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed, including
<a>sex</a>. Decreased energy, fatigue, or a sense of being "slowed down" are also common, as are restlessness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Many with depression have thoughts of death or suicide.

<h2> What Causes Depression? </h2>
<a>trauma</a>, loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or any
<a>stressful</a> situation that overwhelms the ability to cope—may trigger a depressive episode. Subsequent depressive episodes may occur with or without an obvious trigger.
<p>Some types of depression tend to run in families, suggesting there may be some genetic vulnerability to the disorder.</p>
<p>For more see <a>Causes of Depression</a>.</p>
<h2> How Is Depression Treated? </h2>
<p>Depression, even the most severe cases, is a highly treatable disorder. As with many illnesses, the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it can be and the greater the likelihood that recurrence can be prevented.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>. Many studies show that
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> psychotherapy is highly effective, alone or in combination with drug therapy.
<p>For more see <a>Treatment of Depression</a> and <a>Therapy for Depression</a>.</p>
<h2> Natural Approaches to Depression </h2>
<p>Depression requires active treatment, because the disorder can have enduring effects on brain function that make future episodes more likely. The longer a depression episode lasts, the more likely a future episode.</p>
<p>However, there are many ways to treat depression, and some of the most effective, especially in cases of mild to moderate disorder, do not require a prescription or medical-type intervention of any kind. </p>
<p>Depression can be seen as a kind of cave, and it takes some time and effort to get out of the cave. But it is possible, usually by learning some new patterns of thinking and doing. Nutrition plays a role as well.</p>

<h2> The Major Forms of Depression </h2>
<p>What most people mean when they talk about depression is unipolar depression—an unremitting state of sadness, apathy, hopelessness, and loss of energy. It is also called major depression.</p>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, a condition marked by periods of depression interspersed with periods of high-energy
<a>mania</a>. People swing between the two poles of mood states, sometimes over the course of days, and sometimes over years, often with stable periods in between.
<a>postpartum depression</a>, a condition requiring treatment because it can interfere with a parent's ability to care for their newborn.
<p>Depression can also occur seasonally, primarily in the winter months when sunlight is in short supply. Known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, it is often ameliorated by daily exposure to specific types of artificial light.</p>

<h2> Depression and Suicide </h2>
<p>Most suicides are linked to some form of psychiatric illness, particularly depression, and the more severe the depression, the greater the risk. Still, most people with major depression do not die by their own hand. </p>
<p>Studies show that about 5 percent of depressed persons may have thoughts about suicide—suicidal ideation. Only a small percentage of them actively make plans to end their lives.</p>
<p>The clearest warning sign of suicide is talk about wanting to die. And the best way to determine whether suicide is a risk is to ask. </p>
<p>For more see Depression and Suicide.</p>
<h2> Children and Depression </h2>
<p>Mental health conditions such as depression are increasingly afflicting the young, including preschoolers. Especially in the young, depression requires active treatment—it can interfere with normal development. </p>
<p>Depression can show up in children much as it does in adults, signified by sadness, lethargy, and disinterest. But especially among children it manifests as irritability. Other times it manifests as anger and acting out.</p>

<p>If only nourishment were a simple process: Get hungry, eat, get full, stop eating. In reality, an array of biochemicals sending signals between the brain and the body control both hunger and appetite, and the difference between the two is complex.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> What Creates Appetite? </li> <li> Appetite Loss </li> <li> Overeating and Emotional Eating </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> What Creates Appetite? </h2>
<p>It may seem like the stomach is the arbiter of hunger, but the brain is calling the shots. It is important to remember that humans evolved under conditions of food scarcity, and that such scarcity prevailed for most of human history.</p>
<div> <h3> Which factors contribute to appetite? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does sleep influence appetite and weight? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What leads appetite to increase? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a> can lead to different eating patterns including increased appetite.
<div> <h3> How has evolution affected appetite? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Which mental health conditions are linked to appetite loss? </h3> </div>
<p>When people don’t eat due to concerns around weight and <a>body image</a>, it may be due to an <a>eating disorder</a> rather than appetite loss. (For more, see <a>Eating Disorders.</a>)</p>
<p>Appetite loss can also be a side effect of medications for mental health conditions, such as <a>Adderall</a> or Ritalin for ADHD and Prozac for depression.</p>
<div> <h3> Is appetite loss a sign of depression? </h3> </div>
<a>dieting</a>. People who are depressed often lose interest and pleasure in eating, similar to the absence of
<a>motivation</a> overall. Additionally, some believe that the condition may blunt physiological taste sensitivity, another pathway for
<a>appetite loss in depression.</a> (However, the opposite relationship can also occur—significant weight gain can be a symptom of depression.)
<div> <h3> Which physical conditions can result in appetite loss? </h3> </div>
<p>A cold, flu, or stomach bug</p>
<p>• Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Crohn's disease</p>
<p>• <a>Pregnancy</a></p>
<div> <h3> Why do people lose their appetite when they’re sick? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Illnesses can strip people of the desire to eat, because immune cells release proteins called <a>cytokines that suppress appetite</a> and encourage rest. The body can then marshall all of its resources to fight off the infection.</p> </div>

<a>emotional eating or stress eating.</a> It can be evoked by stress, depression, sadness, shame, anger, loneliness, and boredom.

<a>Binge-Eating Disorder.</a> Binges involve eating an abnormally large amount of food in a contained time period, accompanied by feeling a lack of control over eating during the binge, according to the
<a>DSM-5</a>. Binges may involve eating abnormally fast, eating until uncomfortably full, and feelings of shame and distress. Binges tend to occur once a week for at least three months to receive a diagnosis.

<p>Borderline personality disorder is a chronic condition that may include mood instability, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and high rates of <a>self-injury</a> and <a>suicidal</a> behavior.</p>
<a>self-image</a>, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and an individual's sense of identity.

<p>People with borderline personality disorder often need extensive mental health services and account for 20 percent of <a>psychiatric</a> hospitalizations. Yet, with help, the majority of people who suffer stabilize and lead productive lives.</p>
<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a>, individuals with BPD exhibit some or all of the following symptoms:</p>
<li>Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.</li>
<li>Intense bouts of anger, <a>depression</a>, or <a>anxiety</a> that may last only hours or, at most, a few days. These may be associated with episodes of impulsive <a>aggression</a>, <a>self-injury</a>, and drug or <a>alcohol abuse</a>.</li>
<a>career</a> plans, jobs, friendships,
<a>identity</a>, and values. Sometimes people with BPD view themselves as fundamentally bad or unworthy. They may feel
<a>bored</a>, empty, or unfairly misunderstood or mistreated, and they have little idea who they are.

<li>Transient, <a>stress</a>-related paranoid thinking, or dissociation ("losing touch" with reality). </li>

<div> <h3> Are people with borderline personality very sensitive to rejection? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Although the cause of BPD is unknown, both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role in predisposing people to BPD. The disorder is approximately five times more common among people with close biological relatives with BPD. </p>
<p>Studies show that many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse, neglect, or separation as young children. Forty to 71 percent of BPD patients report having been sexually abused, usually by a non-<a>caregiver</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Is childhood trauma a cause of borderline personality? </h3> </div>
<a>trauma</a>. Research elsewhere shows similar evidence, where about 80 percent of people with BPD experience childhood emotional neglect, physical abuse, or 
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic psychotherapy, have been studied and proven to be effective ways to alleviate symptoms.
<div> <h3> Can medication help people with borderline personality? </h3> </div>
<a>Antidepressant</a> drugs and mood stabilizers may be helpful for depressed and or labile mood (exaggerated changes in mood). Antipsychotic drugs may also be used when there are distortions in thinking.

<p>The Borderline’s Monumental Ambivalence Toward <a>Intimacy</a></p>
<a>distrust</a> in BPDs typically comes about quite early in their development, which is why many of the self-protective devices they adopted in reaction to their insufficient nurturing tend to be primitive. Overgeneralizing the
<a>family dynamic</a> that engendered their distrust, they carry within them a deep ambivalence about how close they can safely get to others.
<a>trauma</a> of rejection and abandonment, of feeling desolate and all alone.
<a>attachment</a> to them (or maybe just one of them), at some point they became aware that they could never achieve the secure union they sought. As a result, they desperately needed to discover ways of dulling the acute pain of such
<a>paranoia</a> because their suspiciousness of others can at times approach the delusional, their distorted perceptions compelling them to view others, unjustifiably, as hostile or threatening.

<a>self-image</a> typically bring them little relief. So their final method of rage-infused, depressive coping may be to obliterate consciousness altogether.
<p>As <a>Melinda Smith and Jeanne Segal</a> have observed:</p>
<p>If you have BPD . . . things feel more scary and <a>stressful</a> to you than they do to other people. Your fight-or-flight switch is easily tripped, and once it’s on, it hijacks your rational brain, triggering primitive survival instincts.</p>

<a>personality disorder</a> in adults.
<p>Symptoms of conduct disorder generally fall into four categories:</p>
<li>Aggressive behavior toward people and animals. This includes <a>bullying</a>, threatening, physical violence, use of a weapon, physical cruelty to people or animals, and forcing someone to perform a <a>sexual</a> act.</li>
<li>Property destruction, including setting fires and purposefully destroying property.</li>
<li>Deceit or theft, including <a>lying</a>, shoplifting, and breaking into someone else’s property with the intent to steal.</li>
<li>Serious violations of rules, including breaking family rules, running away from home, and frequently skipping school before the age of 13.</li>
<div> <h3> Does conduct disorder manifest differently in boys and girls? </h3> </div>
<a>Gender</a> can play a role in the symptoms and diagnosis of conduct disorder, according to the
<a>DSM-5</a>. Boys with the condition are more likely to fight, steal, vandalize, and have disciplinary problems at school. Girls are more likely to lie, skip school, run away, and use substances. Boys show physical
<a>aggression</a> and aggression in relationships, while girls show more relational than physical aggression.
<div> <h3> Which conditions co-occur with conduct disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mental health disorders that may occur alongside conduct disorder include <a>ADHD</a>, <a>depression</a>, and substance use disorder. ADHD and <a>substance abuse</a> make it more likely that conduct disorder will persist.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <h3> When does conduct disorder develop? </h3> </div>

<a>psychotherapy</a> and behavior therapy to help the child learn healthier and more acceptable ways of thinking and behaving. In some cases,
<a>medication</a> may be used to treat both the conduct disorder and any co-existing conditions that may be diagnosed. Additionally, shorter-term parent
<a>management</a> training can help the family understand the problem, learn new ways of responding to the child, and rebuild the child-parent relationship.
<div> <h3> Which types of therapy treat conduct disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>Cognitive behavioral</a> therapy helps children recognize and change their thought patterns, develop skills to solve problems, cope with difficult emotions like
<a>stress</a> and anger, and exercise
