<h1> 4 Cognitive Biases That Can Impair Pandemic Decision-Making </h1>
<h2> When the stakes are high, we don’t always clearly see the pros and cons. </h2>
<li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, people often face difficult decisions between reducing risk and participating in valued activities. </li>
<li>When an activity has clear benefits, it can lead us to downplay risks, while salient costs can heighten risk perceptions.</li>
<li>Research on the optimism bias suggests that we tend to see ourselves as less vulnerable to risks than others.</li>
<li>Studies of temporal discounting find that it’s tempting to choose immediate benefits over long-term benefits because the future is uncertain. </li>

<a>exhausting </a>number of tough decisions daily. Should I attend that wedding? Take that vacation? Visit those relatives? We might think we have a good approach figured out, only to have it turned on its head by changes in the pandemic landscape.
<p>The problem is, several cognitive biases can skew our interpretation of the cost-benefit analysis in one direction or the other, making it harder for us to make rational decisions that align with our values. Here are four biases to look out for.</p>
<p>1. The perceived benefits of an activity can make it seem less risky. </p>
<a>perceive the risks</a> of the activity as lower than they actually are. For example, we might associate our annual holiday party with nothing but eating, drinking, and being merry, and therefore instinctively feel that nothing bad could happen there.
<p>2. The perceived risks of an activity may be higher if we’ve witnessed the worst-case scenario firsthand. </p>
<a>trauma</a> they’ve experienced.
<p>3. We assume bad things are more likely to happen to other people. </p>
<a>unrealistic optimism </a>can get us into trouble regarding health behavior because we might be less likely to take reasonable protective measures if we believe we’re less vulnerable than we actually are.
<a>CDC</a>. These cold, hard statistics can be unpleasant to think about, but being honest with ourselves about the numbers can help us make decisions with clear eyes and avoid being blindsided later on.
<p>We might also consider that even if we are, in fact, less vulnerable than others, our choices can have consequences for those who are more vulnerable and who have not chosen to take on the same risks we have.</p>
<p>4. Tangible, immediate benefits might seem more valuable than abstract future ones. </p>

<h1> Is Mental Health Stigma Decreasing? It’s Complicated </h1>
<h2> New research offers insight into the nature of stigma. </h2>
<li>Mental health stigma is a trenchant, complex, and consequential social phenomenon.</li>
<li>Mental health stigma is multi-dimensional, including emotional (prejudice), cognitive (stereotypes), and behavioral (discrimination) components.</li>
<li>Mental heath stigma may change over time, but not uniformly.</li>
<li>Scientific literacy about mental health is necessary but not sufficient to produce reduction in stigma.</li>
<a>concluded</a>: “There is no country, society or culture where people with mental illness have the same societal value as people without a mental illness.”
<a>profound</a> both personally and socially, as they may compel people to hide or deny their issues, refrain from seeking help, and engage in self-blame (AKA

<a>review</a> of the literature by Jessica Sharac of King’s College London and colleagues looked at 27 studies of stigma and its effects, concluding, “Mental illness stigma/
<a>discrimination</a> was found to impact negatively on employment, income, public views about resource allocation and healthcare costs.”
<a>concur</a>: “Stigmatization probably has a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life chances in such areas as earnings, housing, criminal involvement, health, and life itself.”
<p>Laypersons may intuit that stigma is one thing—a negative, prejudiced attitude about something. Yet research suggests that stigma, like most everything else in life, is a complex construct. </p>
<a>explain</a>, those are “a lack of knowledge (ignorance), negative attitudes (prejudice) and people behaving in ways that disadvantage the stigmatised person (discrimination)”
<p>In other words, stigma involves a cognitive component (ignorant beliefs), an emotional component (negative feelings of dislike, loathing, <a>fear</a>), and a behavioral component (acting to ostracize and oppress the stigmatized person or group).</p>
<p>Bruce Link and Jo Phelan (2001) <a>proposed</a> a model in which a stigma is defined by the process of convergence among five distinctive components:</p>
<a>other words</a>, “when people have an interest in keeping other people down, in or away, stigma is a resource that allows them to obtain ends they desire.”
<a>marriage</a>. At the same time, regressive changes were also observed. In 2018, participants saw people with schizophrenia as more dangerous and were more likely to attribute
<a>alcoholism</a> to bad character than did 1996 participants.
<p>The researchers identified five robust patterns in the data:</p>
<p>Second, they concluded that the recent survey period (2006-2018) documented the first significant, substantial decrease in stigma for major depression, although like decreases were not found for schizophrenia or alcohol dependence.</p>
<p>With stigma as with other complex psychosocial issues, the sobering truth remains that knowledge of the facts, while necessary, is insufficient for producing significant changes in attitudes or behavior.</p>

<h2> How to Make a Good First Impression </h2>
<div> <h3> How important is a first impression? </h3> </div>
<a> based on subtle facial and vocal cues.</a> These traits may differ slightly across cultures; for example, some studies have found that Chinese societies form first impressions based on competence (i.e., perceptions of
<a>intelligence</a> and social status) rather than on physical strength.
<div> <h3> What kind of first impression do you make? </h3> </div>
<a> the “liking gap.”</a> People may also be fooled by the “spotlight effect,” which leads them to believe that others are hyper-focused on them, judging them for every imperfection, awkward question, or bad joke.
<div> <h3> How can you make a good impression? </h3> </div>
<a>Using impression-management skills,</a> you can modify the way you present yourself to influence other people’s perceptions of you. Pay
<a>attention</a> to how you speak (whether you’re animated, express emotion, etc.), your facial expressions, your use of gestures, and your posture. Hone your storytelling skills, and show a genuine interest in what others have to say.

<h2> Understanding How Others See You </h2>
<a>self-esteem</a>. Most people's metaperceptions tend to be fairly accurate since individuals generally have a stable
<a>self-concept</a> that governs how they act around others. For example, if we believe that we’re friendly and likable, we will be more likely to act, or continue to act, in a friendly manner toward strangers.
<div> <h3> How can you avoid making a bad first impression? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do narcissists come across at first meeting? </h3> </div>
<a>narcissism</a>. Narcissists tend to view themselves as confident, agreeable, and friendly. Their high
<a>self-esteem</a> may make them seem charming and attractive initially, although
<a> this first impression quickly sours</a>. In time, people typically see through to how self-involved and smug narcissists truly are.
<div> <h3> How can you make a good impression online? </h3> </div>
<a>online dating</a> sites, we often judge strangers by what they write. Grammar and spelling errors in an online profile can make someone seem
<a> inattentive or less intelligent</a>—and therefore less attractive.

<a>Confidence</a> is so highly prized that many people would rather pretend to be smart or skilled than risk looking inadequate and losing face.

<div> <h3> What is the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
