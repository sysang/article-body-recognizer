<h2> What does depression look like in children? </h2>
<h2> Do children get depressed if a parent is depressed? </h2>
<h2> Why do children get depressed? </h2>
<a>Abuse or neglect </a>are notable adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that can
<a>reset children’s stress response</a> so that even minor upsets can trigger depression. The loss of a parent or beloved caregiver is another source of depression in children, just as is the loss of a significant relationship among adolescents.
<a>Bullying is a form of abuse </a>that can give rise to depression in victims. Developmental and learning problems can severely affect children’s sense of self and pave the way for depression. The
<a>decline of free play</a> in childhood is another contributor to depression, and it deprives children of an important source of joy. Among teenagers, there is mounting evidence that
<a>social media can have profoundly negative effects on mental health, </a> especially among girls. Teens increasingly report they feel lonely; they spend more time communicating electronically, less time face-to-face interacting with friends.
<h2> How is depression best treated in children? </h2>
<a>some form of psychotherapy</a>, with or without medication. The younger children are, the more important it is for them to be treated in conjunction with a parent—dyadic therapy. There is evidence that therapy specifically focused on
<h2> Are antidepressant drugs safe for children? </h2>
<a>benefits of antidepressants </a>outweigh the risks. Antidepressants work best when their use is regularly monitored by a psychiatrist and the treated child is carefully observed by parents.
<h2> Do children ever outgrow depression? </h2>
<h2> What's the best way to help a child with depression? </h2>
<a>nurturing the parent-child bond</a>, but outdoor activity is itself beneficial and involves exposure to sunlight, a natural antidepressant.

<h2> How does depression lead to suicidal thinking? </h2>

<a>Life events involving loss</a>—a job, a relationship, one’s health—play a role, too.
<h2> When does emotional pain become unbearable? </h2>

<h1> How to Help a Loved One Struggling With Suicidal Thoughts </h1>
<h2> Someone you love is struggling with suicidal thoughts. What can you do? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Suicide Risk Factors and Signs </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>empathetic</a> person who was always quick to attend the needs and feelings of others.
<p>For those who are struggling to help their loved ones, here are five important tips to open the conversation for those who are feeling alone in their struggle with suicide.</p>
<p>1. Know the risk factors of suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Risk factors are instances that make a person more likely to experience suicidal thoughts. </p>
<p>One major risk factor is having a mental illness. These mental illnesses include:</p>
<p>It is estimated that most people who complete suicide had an underlying, often undiagnosed mental illness. But it’s important to point out that not everybody who has committed suicide had a mental illness.</p>
<p><a>This pattern may differ based on culture</a>. In North America, about 12 percent of those who committed suicide did not have a mental illness. In East Asia, about 30 percent of people who committed suicide did not have a mental illness.</p>
<p>Even if you're confident that a loved one is not struggling with any mental health issues, you should still take other signs of <a>suicidality</a> seriously.</p>
<p><a>Sexual</a>/<a>Gender</a> Minority Status</p>
<a>bisexual</a> individuals have an 11 to 20 percent risk, and
<a>transgender</a> individuals have a staggering 30 percent lifetime risk of attempting suicide.

<p>2. Look for the suicidality warning signs.</p>
<p>When it comes to warning signs, which are more immediate signs that someone is considering or planning suicide, the <a>clearest is when a person talks about wanting to die</a> or mentions actively looking for a way to kill themselves.</p>
<p>When it seems the crisis has been averted and your loved one is seemingly more at peace, it’s understandable to want to let out a big sigh and take a break from crisis <a>management</a>. And you should certainly take care of yourself!</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>3. Don’t be afraid to ask about suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>There is a <a>fear</a>, even amongst many mental health professionals, that asking someone about suicide is going to “put the idea into their head” and increase their likelihood of committing a suicide act. <a>This is not true</a>.</p>
<p>If someone is at risk of having suicidal urges, the idea of suicide will not be new to them. Asking them about it will not make them more suicidal. But asking could reduce risk.</p>
<p>Talking about feeling suicidal can decrease stigma and give the person nonjudgmental permission to express their feelings. You can only provide someone with assets and support if you know what they need. </p>
<p>How to have a conversation about suicide</p>
<p>Here's one way to broach the subject if you’ve noticed warning signs: </p>
<p>“I noticed that you’ve been seeming really down lately. You mentioned that you feel like you’ve lost the will to live. Do you have thoughts about hurting yourself?”</p>
<p>If they say yes, or if they have already more explicitly talked about wanting to die, you can ask about their intentions:</p>
<p>“When you say that you want to die, do you mean that you want to end your life? Does it ever feel so bad that you think about suicide?”</p>
<p>“Do you have a plan for when or how to kill yourself?”</p>
<p>If you discover that someone you care about is suicidal, what next?</p>
<p>4. Show empathy, not <a>shame</a> or <a>guilt</a>, in your support.</p>
<p>If you’ve already started a conversation with someone contemplating suicide, that’s a good start! You may feel inclined to immediately start problem-solving or putting emergency suicide hotline numbers into their phone.</p>
<p>These are good steps to take, but first, remember that the person in front of you just opened up about the most agonizing, and perhaps shameful, feeling they’ve ever had. Take a moment to first acknowledge their feelings with compassion:</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It must be horrible.”</p>
<p>Even if you don’t agree that the person's problems are hopeless, you can identify with what they're feeling:</p>
<p>“I can see that you feel really hopeless. What a terrible feeling to have! I can’t even imagine.”</p>
<p>Don’t worry—you're not agreeing that their situation is hopeless. You’re not tacitly encouraging them to consider suicide by validating their feelings.</p>
<p>A better alternative is to let them know you can see their pain, that you’re here to listen, and that you care about them. Once you’ve made clear this unconditional support, you can start to help in a more hands-on way.</p>
<p>5. Connect your loved one with suicide prevention and other resources to prevent imminent harm.</p>
<p>Removing risk is the most important and immediate thing you can do to help. For example, if they have a plan to end their life soon, you should call emergency services or take the person to the Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Recognize that you may not be able to remove every risky thing from their life, so it’s just as important to connect them with resources for the long-term. </p>
<p>Apart from professional resources, you can help tremendously by connecting your loved one with daily resources. Social connections can be the most important thing to a person who feels alone. </p>
<p>6. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p>This is of vital importance. Those who die from suicide are not the only victims. People who lose loved ones due to suicide, or experience a loved one contemplating or attempting suicide, also undergo an incredibly difficult experience.</p>
<a>they had a quadruple risk of post-traumatic stress disorder</a> compared to people who have not been exposed to another’s suicide.
<a>sibling</a>, but just by listening, empathizing, and offering your love, you are doing your best.
<p>Your support is an incredible help to the person suffering suicidal thoughts. Even as you offer yourself, talk with them about bringing others into their support network. Let them know of the resources that exist to help them. </p>
<a>nutrition</a>, exercise, rest and sleep, social engagements, and the things that fulfill you and bring you
<a>happiness</a>. It’s OK to do things that make you laugh. After all, part of how you can help is by showing that there is goodness and hope in life.

<li> What is the role of genetics in depression? </li>
<h2> What is the role of genetics in depression? </h2>
<h2> Can genes for depression be modified? </h2>
<a>the nutritional supplement SAM-e</a>, a synthetic version of a compound found in the body, contains a substance that chemically augments the activation and deactivation of genes. Some studies show it is effective against symptoms of depression.
<h2> What happens in the brain with depression? </h2>
<p>Reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, which interprets and regulates emotional signals coming from the amygdala, accounts for the difficulties in decision-making and the cognitive fog that depressed people experience.</p>
<h2> How does lack of sleep alter brain function? </h2>
<a>sleep deprivation makes people emotionally reactive</a>, increasing activity in the amygdala and decreasing it in the emotion regulation center of the prefrontal cortex. Sleep deprivation impairs the brain’s ability to control negative thoughts.
<h2> How does the brain regulate mood? </h2>
<p>Under normal conditions, moods are relatively stable. But the persistence of negative mood in major depression suggests something is amiss in the nerve pathways between the amygdala and cortex.</p>
<a>the sleep-wake cycle</a>. Disturbances in biological rhythms are known to disrupt mood, and studies of depressed patients find that they exhibit abnormal patterns of many body functions, from temperature regulation to hormone secretion.
<h2> What role does serotonin play in depression? </h2>
<a>mediates many mental capacities important in social life</a>.
<h2> Does dopamine play a role in depression? </h2>
<a>implicated in depression</a>. It is associated with two of the most prominent features of depression—anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure, and appetite alterations.
<h2> How does nerve cell communication go awry in depression? </h2>
<a>The prolonged or excessive release of stress hormones</a> can lead to a failure of activation of key nodes in neural networks or impair the strength of signals between them, especially when processing emotion-related or reward stimuli.
<p>It’s important that depression is now seen as a nerve circuit disorder, because that influences the search for effective treatments.</p>
<h2> How does stress affect the brain? </h2>
<a>can disrupt many aspects of brain function and lead to depression</a>.
<h2> How does childhood stress affect adult brain function? </h2>
<p>Nevertheless, adult brains retain the capacity for neuroplasticity. Although it takes effort, and often the guidance of psychotherapy, people can learn to overcome many of the ill effects of early adversity.</p>
<h2> What areas of the brain play a role in depression? </h2>
<a>the amygdala,</a> which flags emotion-related stimuli; the prefrontal cortex, which analyzes and interprets experience, modulates emotional reactivity, and controls attention; and the two-way network of nerve fibers that connect them.
<h2> What does brain imaging look at in depression? </h2>
<a>whether and where there are problems in the way the brain processes specific types of information</a>.
<h2> How does depresson itself change the brain? </h2>
<a>changes in the network of brain areas involved in processing physical pain</a>, and the degree of hyperactivity in such areas as seen on brain scans correlates with the severity of depression that patients experience.
<p>Recent studies show that like other neurodegenerative conditions, longstanding depression <a>increases levels of inflammatory substances in the brain that further impair its function</a>, affecting many brain regions and circuits of connectivity.</p>
<h2> Can talk therapy change the way the brain functions? </h2>
<a>greater flexibility in finding solutions to problems</a>. The changes in cognition power help reduce negative emotionality by increasing people’s ability to calmly manage experiences and thoughts that stir emotions.
<h2> Why is nerve cell growth, or neuroplasticity, important? </h2>
<a>stimulate the growth of new nerve cells</a>—they enable the brain to rewire itself.
<h2> What are ways of stimulating neuroplasticity? </h2>
<p>All known therapies for depression stimulate the growth of new nerve cell connections. But the growth of new nerve cell connections is not dependent on antidepressant drugs. Researchers find that there are many ways to bring about neuroplasticity.</p>

<a>depression</a> is a serious medical condition and that you should consult with your doctor. As such, I will assume you have already heard that piece of advice. Here, I attempt to offer folks something more.
<a>self-help</a>” perspective. You do not need to be in
<a>therapy</a> (*although please see note at the end of this post). It is probably best suited for folks in the mild-to-moderate range of “clinical depression” and who have enough “mental energy” to read and think things through.
<p>These are the guides for doing things differently in the areas:</p>
<li>Behavioral activation (rather than behavioral shutdown)</li>
<li>Fostering healthy habits and lifestyles</li>
<li>Attending to your biology</li>
<li>Understanding emotions and adaptive coping</li>
<li>Fostering healthy relationships</li>
<li>Learning to engage in adaptive (versus maladaptive) thinking</li>
<li>Developing a value-based <a>philosophy</a> of living</li>
<p>Although this blog series has many episodes, it does have a primary take-home message. It is as follows:</p>
<li>Learn about the cycles of behavioral shutdown.</li>
<li>Understand how they trap you, given who you are and the kinds of things that are driving your depression.</li>
<li>Learn how to engage the world in a different way (i.e., doing, thinking, feeling, and relating).</li>
<p>Understanding what is going on and making these changes are hard to do. However, if you are patient and persevere, and are able to find a path of positive investment that nourishes your soul, then shutdown will reverse itself.</p>
<p>How does one find a path to positive investment? To guide the process we will be using the three “A's”</p>
<ol><li>Awareness</li> <li>Acceptance</li> <li>Active change</li> </ol>
