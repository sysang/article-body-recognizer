<p>Threesomes are one of the most popular sexual fantasies. But how many people have ever made the leap from fantasy to reality? And who’s most likely to have had a threesome before? </p>
<p>Why were the online participants more likely to have had a threesome experience? In part, it may be due to the fact that they tended to be older.</p>

<li>A recent study found that while the definition of "rough sex" differs from person to person, the practice should be considered normative.</li>
<li>Of participants in relationships, about 4 in 5 had engaged in rough sex with a partner, and almost all reported at least some enjoyment of it.</li>
<li>Transgender and non-binary individuals reported higher rates of rough sex enjoyment than others.</li>

<p>Rough sex is one of the most popular <a>sexual fantasies</a>. In fact, when I surveyed 4,175 Americans about their fantasies for my book <a>Tell Me What You Want</a>, I found that most people had fantasied about some type of rough sex before.</p>
<p>But what exactly does it mean to have “rough sex?” Which specific activities do people include in this? And how many people actually enjoy the idea of rough sex in real life—not just in their fantasies? </p>
<p>Participants were asked what rough sex means to them and could indicate their responses via a checklist. They were also asked to report how much they enjoyed rough sex and about their previous experiences with it. </p>
<p>When it came to definitions of rough sex, the most commonly endorsed items were: </p>
<ul><li>choking (77%)</li> <li>hair pulling (75%)</li> <li><a>spanking</a> (69%)</li> <li>being pinned down (66%)</li> <li>being tied up (65%)</li> <li>hard thrusting (64%)</li> <li>slapping (59%)</li> <li>biting (59%)</li> <li>scratching (52%)</li> </ul>
<p>Put another way, more than half of the sample counted the above activities as forms of rough sex. Items endorsed by less than half of the sample included:</p>
<ul><li>throwing someone onto a bed (49%)</li> <li>tearing clothes off (45%)</li> <li>punching (33%)</li> <li>making someone have sex (17%)</li> </ul>
<a>non-binary</a> participants generally counted more of these behaviors as rough sex than their cisgender counterparts.
<a>Sexual orientation</a> was unrelated to enjoyment of rough sex among men, whereas sexual minority women (but especially bisexual women) reported higher enjoyment of rough sex than heterosexual women.

<li>Depression is linked to a lack of sexual activity, as well as to increased sexual risk-taking.</li>
<li>These effects can be explained by the fact that people cope with depression in different ways. Some internalize, while others externalize. </li>

<p>How do we explain this pattern of results?</p>
<h3>Why Depression Affects Different People In Different Ways</h3>
<p>By contract, other people are internalizers, meaning they cope by looking inward and socially withdrawing. This is likely to reduce sexual activity, in part, because it reduces opportunities for sex.</p>

<li>People who regretted missing out on opportunities for casual sex did not pursue more casual sex in the future.</li>
<li>Those who regretted casual sex that they previously had did not experience a reduction in number of new partners over time.</li>
<li>Regret doesn’t appear to be an adaptive emotion in the sense of stimulating meaningful behavior change and reducing subsequent regret.</li>

<a>sexual</a> experience. It’s also not uncommon for people to regret their choice of a past partner, or to regret a one-night stand or other casual sexual experience.
<p>So what happens when we experience sexual regrets? Specifically, do we actually learn from them and change our future behavior so as not to experience even more regrets later on? </p>
<p>A longitudinal study published in the journal <a>Evolutionary Psychology</a> suggests that we don’t—and that, more broadly, regret doesn’t appear to be an adaptive emotion in the sense of stimulating meaningful behavior change.</p>
<h3>Do Regrets About Casual Sex Predict Changes in Casual Sex?</h3>
<p>In the second survey, participants were asked about their casual sexual behaviors since the previous survey. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the more regret people felt about casual sex during the first survey, the less likely they were to enter a committed relationship by the second survey.</p>
<h3>Sexual Regret Does Not Appear to Be Adaptive</h3>
<p>I suspect that many people will be able to relate to these findings. I mean, how many of us have done things that we’ve regretted—sexually and otherwise—only to find ourselves repeating the same behaviors over and over? </p>
<p>An interesting question for future research might be to explore when and for whom regret does serve an adaptive function. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to regret or are more motivated to actively regulate negative mood states. </p>

<h1> 6 Things That Draw People to Consensual Nonmonogamy </h1>
<h2> Wanting an open relationship is usually about far more than just sex. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Consensually nonmonogamous relationships are common, with about 1 in 5 people having been in one before.</li>
<li>Many see these relationships as being only about sex, or as being driven by sexual and/or relationship dissatisfaction.</li>
<li>New research identifies at least six distinct reasons for pursuing consensual nonmonogamy, with most people reporting more than one motivation.</li>
<li>Besides sex, these relationships are often driven by a desire for psychological fulfillment and to be one's authentic self.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Photo by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Consensual nonmonogamy</a> is a relationship style in which all partners openly agree to the possibility of having more than one sexual and/or
<a>romantic relationship</a> at a time. These relationships are common, with
<a>about 1 in 5 North American adults</a> saying they’ve been in some type of sexually open relationship before.
<p>However, the reality is that people can be drawn to consensual nonmonogamy for a very diverse set of reasons. In fact, research has identified at least six distinct motives.</p>
<p>The key question participants were asked was as follows: “Please tell us about your reasons for participating in a multipartnered/consensually non-monogamous relationship." </p>
<p>Participants could write as much or as little as they wanted in response—and the researchers then coded all responses for themes.</p>
<h3>The 6 Reasons People Pursue Consensual Nonmonogamy</h3>
<p>The results generated six broad, interconnected themes. Each is described below with brief descriptions in the words of the study’s authors in italics:</p>
<p>“It was important to participants to feel as if they had control over their own bodies and the ways that they interacted and connected with others. Having sexual and relational autonomy appeared to foster independence.” </p>
<p>Essentially, this theme centered around the idea of doing what felt most natural to the individual and being one’s authentic self.</p>
<p>“These beliefs reflected a tension between the constraints of <a>monogamy</a> and the possibilities offered by CNM as well as ideas about how personal and interpersonal needs should be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>Put another way, persons in multi-partner relationships tended to see monogamy as restrictive and potentially harmful to one’s well-being, with open relationships offering the ability to grow and explore the self.</p>
<p>Another common belief system involved the idea that it is difficult to have one partner who meets all of your needs, sexually and emotionally.</p>
<a>ethics</a> and allowed for relational integrity.”

<a>kink</a> identities, offer more sexual fun and adventure, and provide avenues for dealing with discrepant sexual desires/interests in relationships.
<p>“Many observed that having multiple partners fostered both personal and relational growth and provided opportunities for self-expansion.”</p>
<p>Consensually non-monogamous relationships were seen as an opportunity to broaden one’s sense of self and to experience more variety in non-sexual activities in a way that reduces pressure on any one given partner.</p>
<p>They were also seen as a way of growing and expanding a current relationship, allowing for deeper intimacy and connection as well as a greater feeling of security. </p>
<p>In other words, many felt that multi-partner relationships were just a practical way of managing their lives and achieving life <a>goals</a>. </p>

<h1> 3 Keys to Successful Friends-with-Benefits Relationships </h1>
<h2> New research explains how to make a "friends with benefits" relationship work. </h2>
<li>People can begin friends with benefits relationships for varied reasons, but matching expectations is key to success. </li>
<li>People who begin a friends with benefits relationship looking for love usually end up disappointed.</li>
<li>Setting ground rules at the outset is one of the keys to success for friends with benefits. </li>
<li>Friends with benefits can go back to being just friends, but it's important to have a solid friendship at the start. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Rido/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>All of this variability led us to wonder what ultimately happens to FWBs over time and what the most likely outcomes are. We decided to conduct a one-year longitudinal study of FWBs to find out.</p>
<h3>How do friends with benefits relationships change over time?</h3>
<p>Here's what we found. After just one year:</p>
<ul><li>26 percent were still FWBs.</li> <li>15 percent had become romantic partners.</li> <li>28 percent had gone back to being just friends.</li> <li>31 percent reported having no relationship of any kind with their former FWB.</li> </ul>
<h3>Whether an FWB relationship works out depends on why you got into it.</h3>
<a>goals</a> seemed more attainable than others. Specifically, those who wanted to go back to being just friends appeared to be the most successful: 59 percent of those who desired that outcome at Time 1 attained it at Time 2.
<p>Those who wanted to remain FWBs long-term were somewhat less successful, with 40 percent of those desiring this at Time 1 reporting that they were still FWBs at Time 2.</p>
<p>Lastly, those who wanted to transition into romantic partners were the least successful, with just 15 percent of those who initially wanted this outcome getting it after one year.</p>
<p>We found a similar pattern of results for <a>friendship</a> satisfaction: Those who were happier with their friendship at the outset were more likely to maintain some kind of relationship over time.</p>
<p>According to our research, the real key to making FWBs work seems to have a lot to do with matching expectations, excellent communication, and a solid friendship to start.</p>

<h3>1. Don’t sacrifice too much.</h3>
<p>Sacrifice tends to work best when it is mutual and minor.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t make your love conditional. </h3>
<h3>3. Don’t lose yourself in the relationship.</h3>
<p>The loss of self in a relationship is actually a common reason why <a>many people in perfectly happy relationships end up cheating</a>—it’s not because the relationship itself is bad, but rather it’s a quest for self-discovery.</p>
<h3>4. Don’t avoid every conflict. </h3>

<p>A recent study sought to explore how interest in different forms of somnophilia (consensual vs. non-consensual scenario and active vs. passive role) are related to a range of other sexual interests in an online survey of 437 adults.</p>

<h6> <a> Eating Disorders </a> </h6>
<h1> Study Finds Eating Disorders in Older Cancer Survivors </h1>
<h2> Developing an eating disorder is possible after age 60 and beating cancer. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>First-time eating disorders can develop in people over 60. </li>
<li>Surviving cancer and a will to live may not keep someone safe from an eating disorder's psychological and physical devastation.</li>
<li>Post-surgery or any period of weight loss would likely be beneficial to monitor for future wellness and eating disorder prevention.</li>
<p>Of the four cases—two males and two females—included in Rakusin and colleagues’ research, all were over 60 years old and experienced the following:</p>
<ul><li>No <a>psychiatric</a> history of feeding and eating disorders</li> <li>An eating disorder developing after curative cancer treatment</li> </ul>
<h3>Outcomes after surviving cancer treatment (surgery, chemo-radiotherapy, or both)</h3>
<h3>Expanding the applicability of this research </h3>
<p>This study spotlights that weight loss post-surgery occurred prior to the onset of each person’s eating disorder. That opens a broader discussion about weight loss—something that is usually praised automatically in Western societies. </p>
<a>dieting</a>, or having had the flu) commonly precedes an eating disorder's onset. For many individuals vulnerable to eating disorders, something in the weight loss process seems to accelerate
<a>disordered eating</a> attitudes and behaviors. So much so, eventually, they can no longer nourish themselves appropriately—even when they say they want to live and their non-eating-related actions back that will.
<p>Rakusin and colleagues' research provides powerful examples of that phenomenon. People over 60 who survived cancer treatment then had their lives and health damaged by an ensuing eating disorder. </p>
<p>Inherently, it clarifies two common misunderstandings about eating disorders: </p>
<li>People in <a>mid-life</a> and later life can and do develop eating disorders. </li>
