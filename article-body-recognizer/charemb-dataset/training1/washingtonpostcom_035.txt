<b> </b>and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. “There was a lot of violating content that did appear on the platform that wouldn’t otherwise have.”
<div><div><p>Pusateri denied that the company had pulled back on efforts to combat violent and false postings about the election after the vote. He did not comment on the quantitative findings of the ProPublica-Post investigation.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Facebook enforcement slowed before Jan. 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook’s fact-checking favors conservatives in election lead-up</p></div>
<p>The next day, Nov. 6, the Group Task Force gathered virtually to celebrate its efforts, former employees said. Days later, a task force member published a Workplace post titled “Some Reflections on US2020” to bring attention to its work.</p>
<div><div><p>“Along with heroic efforts from other teams across the company, I truly believe the Group Task Force made the election safer and prevented possible instances of real world violence,” said the post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the focus on U.S. political groups and content undermining the election wouldn’t last.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A noticeable drop in policing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It had been 35 days since the Civic Integrity team, and with it the Group Task Force, had been disbanded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Groups still active long after Jan. 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Months after the Capitol was breached, Facebook still was working to remove hundreds of political groups that violated company policies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of those was Smith’s United Conservatives for America, which continued to carry posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden’s election until Facebook removed it in May.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like its predecessor, the new United Conservatives for America group was racking up strikes for violations of Facebook’s rules, according to a post Smith made to the group in September.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Smith remained defiant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I'm Not Blaming Our Members,” Smith wrote. “I’m Blaming FakeBook!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Late last month, after being asked about Smith’s account and group, Facebook said it banned his profile and removed United Conservatives for America, citing unspecified violations of its community standards.</p></div></div>

<h2>The consumer electronics trade show salutes 2022 with some of the strangest technologies we’ve seen in a while. Here are the highlights.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Chris Velazco</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Tatum Hunter</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 9:58 p.m. EST|Updated today at 4:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The world’s biggest consumer electronics trade show known as CES feels weird this year, with far fewer attendees gracing the Las Vegas conference halls where consumer tech companies show off their latest and greatest (almost) every January.</p>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<p>As always, some of the industry’s plans are raising eyebrows. People still don’t have legal protections for the personal data they generate in normal old smartphone apps, yet consumer tech is marching forward into virtual reality.</p>
<div><p>What it’s like at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Garments made for gaming — and the metaverse</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The age of the metaverse is nearly upon us, according to some of the biggest names in tech. But what good is palling around with people in a sprawling, interconnected virtual space if you can’t feel the “world” around you?</p>
<div><div><p>That’s where the smart — and sometimes painful — garments from <a>Owo</a> enter the picture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>At last, augmented reality glasses that don’t look (that) ridiculous</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>But what’s a wearable like this actually meant to do? The software on the prototype we saw was far from finished, but it mentioned the ability to control phone calls, view photos and even display text on a virtual teleprompter.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Spacious space abodes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some CES presenters are thinking forward to when people live in entirely connected homes. Sierra Space is thinking about when people live in giant inflatable houses on the moon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A fitness tracker for your cat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The pet’s place in the family is changing,” says Caudron. “It’s no longer a dog-master relationship. We think of ourselves as parents and our dogs as a member of the family.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A projector that works in unexpected places</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Even now, in the middle of the strangest CES on record, companies have devoted big chunks of the show floor to showing off their flashiest, best TVs. But for Samsung, one of its biggest new products might actually be one of its smallest.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that nibbles your fingers and warms your heart</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>True comfort is priceless, and for some people, that kind of peace only comes when animals or babies cutely gnaw on them. If that’s you, a tiny product from Japan just might be the best impulse buy of your life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aoki hopes to usher Amagami Ham Ham through a crowdfunding campaign in a few months, and — assuming that’s successful — he aims to sell the robot in Japan and abroad for the equivalent of about $30.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that probably upsets you</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Humanoid robots are getting more lifelike, but only compared to their predecessors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just take the Ameca robot from Engineered Arts, a true-to-scale, metal-and-plastic robot person who blinks, shrugs and grimaces just like you and me — if you and me were stilted human facsimiles.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Rachel Lerman</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Nitasha Tiku</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022|Updated January 3, 2022 at 6:40 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>SAN JOSE — The fate of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is hanging in the balance after jurors said on Monday they were deadlocked on three counts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a jury note, a juror told the judge they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three counts during the seventh full day of deliberations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judge Edward J. Davila brought the jurors into the courtroom and read them a common instruction for deadlocked juries. He asked them to continue deliberations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later in the day, the jurors sent another note reiterating that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on three counts.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Blood, labs and fraud: Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes is on trial</p></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors alleged that Holmes intentionally misled investors and patients about the capability of her company’s technology.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes pleaded not guilty and during the trial her defense team argued that she <a>made mistakes</a> but acted in good faith while running the company.</p></div></div>
<p>The jurors’ deadlock on specific counts suggests they have reached verdicts on the other eight counts, said Robert Dugdale, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at Kendall Brill Kelly and specializes in white-collar defense work.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s likely we’re nearing the end of the line for deliberations,” said Dugdale, who is not involved in the case.</p></div></div>
<div><p>This is a highly unusual situation, said Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg, an expert in criminal law. Typically when a jury reports that it is deadlocked on some counts, it announces its verdict on the other counts, he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Until the jury announces its verdict to the judge, jurors are not bound to any preliminary vote on the other eight charges and can still change their minds, said Weisberg, who isn’t involved in the case.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes took the stand over seven days during the trial, testifying that she did not intentionally mislead investors. Her defense lawyer asked her plainly if she had ever taken steps to mislead investors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But prosecutors also pressed her to confirm that as founder and chief executive, she was in control of the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You take responsibility for the company, is that your testimony?” prosecutor Robert Leach asked her while she was on the stand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I do,” Holmes answered.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Erika Cheung, a former company employee who later reported her concerns to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, <a>testified that she left Theranos</a> because she thought her warnings were not being heeded.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It was starting to get very uncomfortable and very stressful for me working at the company, and I was attempting to tell as many people as I could, but it was not, just not seeming to get through to people,” she said.</p></div>

<h3>What to know about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes</h3>
<p>After a more than three-month proceeding, a federal jury found <b>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes</b> <a>guilty on four counts</a> of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud against investors.</p>
<p>Holmes was accused of <a>misleading investors and patients </a>about the capability of her company’s blood-testing technology.</p>
<p>She testified that she <a>believed the information she was providing</a> to her prospective business partners.</p>
<p>For some, the trial was a chance to get the full story of what happened inside the company, and an opportunity for the <a>Silicon Valley ethos</a> to be held in front of a public mirror.</p>
<p>Fellow Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and backers say Holmes represented only the <a>worst of start-up culture</a>.</p>

<h2>Mixed verdict included jury finding Holmes guilty on 4 of 11 charges in fraud trial</h2>

<div><div><p>“She chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and with patients,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing argument.</p></div></div>
<p>“The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes’s culpability in this large-scale investor fraud, and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,” said Stephanie Hinds, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California.</p>
<div><div><p>Following the verdict, Holmes walked out of the courtroom holding hands with her mother and partner, and did not respond to questions.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Elizabeth Holmes trial is the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley</p></div>
<div><div><p>The <a>downfall of Theranos</a>, and Holmes with it, captivated people around the country when the company dissolved in 2018 after years of regulatory investigations and media scandals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The government filed charges against Holmes for allegedly misleading investors and patients about the capability of her company’s blood-testing device. She pleaded not guilty.</p></div></div>
<p>One former employee, Erika Cheung, told jurors how she tried to bring concerns with the quality of lab tests to managers at the company, only to feel sidelined. Theranos’s tests weren’t passing quality-control checks, she said.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was starting to get very uncomfortable and very stressful for me working at the company, and I was attempting to tell as many people as I could,” she said on the stand in September.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Investors told jurors that they felt misled by Holmes’s representations of the company and said they didn’t know that Theranos was relying on third-party lab machines to run blood tests, rather than its own technology.</p></div>
<div><div><p>After the prosecution’s parade of insiders and expert witnesses, the defense called just two witnesses before it turned to its best weapon to woo the jury: Holmes herself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The entrepreneur testified for more than 20 hours over the course of seven days, alternately stony-faced and emotional. She told jurors that she always acted in good faith while leading the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They weren’t interested in today or tomorrow or next month,” she said on the stand. “They were interested in what kind of change we could make.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the verdict was read, Holmes sat up straight and gazed in the jury’s direction. She hugged her family and left the courtroom after it was delivered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She confirmed that Balwani did not force her to say allegedly misleading things to investors. But she said his influence was deeply felt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He impacted everything about who I was,” Holmes said. “And I don’t fully understand that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Balwani, who faces a separate trial for the same charges in February, has denied the allegations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In cross-examination, prosecutor Robert Leach pushed Holmes to admit that she was ultimately responsible for the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And you take responsibility for the company, is that your testimony?” he asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I do,” she responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 as a student at Stanford, growing it afterward to a massive company with hundreds of employees.</p></div></div>
<p>The Journal investigation in 2015 cited former employees who revealed that Theranos was using its own technology on only a small piece of its total number of tests, instead relying on outside traditional lab machines to test patients’ blood.</p>
<div><div><p>She left the company in 2018, and Theranos shuttered soon after.</p></div></div>
<p><b>Elizabeth Holmes</b>, the founder of <b>Theranos </b>who rocketed to fame nearly a decade ago, is accused of <a>misleading investors and patients </a>about the capability of her company’s blood-testing technology.</p>

<p>The next day, Nov. 6, the Group Task Force gathered virtually to celebrate its efforts, former employees said. Days later, a task force member published a Workplace post titled “Some Reflections on US2020” to bring attention to its work.</p>
<div><div><p>“Along with heroic efforts from other teams across the company, I truly believe the Group Task Force made the election safer and prevented possible instances of real world violence,” said the post.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>One of those was Smith’s United Conservatives for America, which continued to carry posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden’s election until Facebook removed it in May.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like its predecessor, the new United Conservatives for America group was racking up strikes for violations of Facebook’s rules, according to a post Smith made to the group in September.</p></div></div>
