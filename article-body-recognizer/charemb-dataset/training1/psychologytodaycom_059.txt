<p>Ray was married, with two kids. He described his wife as enjoying rough sex, but so did he. In fact, he enjoyed provoking her to the point that she’d physically attack him, after which they had intense sex.</p>

<p>Ray expressed his pain and resentments by acts of spite and meanness towards his sisters.</p>

<p>Most of what is known about the roles of women in sex trafficking operations focus on those in subordinate roles, which include:</p>

<p>Women may also have <a>leadership</a> roles in trafficking operations which fall broadly into two categories:</p>

<p>For example, in Nigeria, sex trafficking is considered the business of women. In Ukraine, one study found that 60 percent of all traffickers were women, and in Thailand and Laos, women may own the establishments from where women are trafficked.</p>
<p>Interestingly, of all the female traffickers, regardless of role, 60 percent were found to have some role in victims' physical or <a>emotional control</a>, such as the <a>sexual grooming</a> of victims.</p>

<h1> The Pathway From Victim to Perpetrator </h1>
<h2> Does sexual abuse in childhood create a pathway to sexual offending as an adult? </h2>
<li>Boys sexually abused in childhood are 10 times more likely to acquire sexual convictions in adulthood than those who were not sexually abused.</li>
<li>However, 90% of sexually abused boys do not go on to abuse others.</li>
<li>Men facing prison for sexual convictions are much more likely to deny having been sexually abused than they are to make up a history of abuse.</li>
<li>Those on the victim-to-perpetrator pathway have almost never disclosed their own abuse or they disclosed it but were not believed.</li>
<a>sexual</a> victimisation in their childhood. By high rate, I mean that 25-50% of those convicted of sexual offences report childhood sexual victimisation.
<a>sexual violence</a> in adulthood.
<h3>What we know about sexual offenders</h3>
<p>We do know something about this 10% of individuals, and what we know helps to shed light on some important determinants of the pathway to offending. We know that this group is:</p>
<li>More likely to have been emotionally abused or neglected in the home as well as sexually abused</li>
<li>More likely to have engaged in "consenting" sexual activity with male peers</li>
<li>Less likely to have disclosed their experiences of sexual victimisation to an adult, and if they did disclose, they were less likely to have been believed</li>
<li>Less likely to have had good reparative experiences in <a>adolescence</a>, such as a rewarding <a>social network</a> or positive intimate relationships</li>
<li>More likely to struggle with confused <a>sexual orientation</a> or sexual interests as an adult</li>
<a>anxiety</a> that subsequent life experiences exacerbated rather than resolved.
<h3>Offenders tend to deny their own sexual abuse</h3>
<p>How do we account for the persistence of this counterintuitive <a>denial</a>? I think that Frank explains the emotional intensity of admitting to abuse best in his own words when I asked him this very question: </p>
<a>therapy</a> with men who are struggling to articulate the trauma underpinning the victim-to-perpetrator pathway.

<h2> Is implicit-bias training the answer? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Racism is still a problem in America, and it seemed to show itself again in the high-profile Starbucks story from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the spirit of my slowing-down blog post, I tried not to jump to the conclusion of clear-cut racism. Initial reporting is notorious for sometimes leaving out relevant facts.</p>
<p>But as more information came out, it seemed to become more and more clear.</p>
<p>The higher-up Starbucks management has apologized, made reference to skin color affecting perceptions, and planned an anti-bias training for their employees across the nation. The training is scheduled for May 29 and will focus on implicit bias.</p>
<p>More subtle is research that showed non-black participants were more likely to misidentify hand tools as guns when first shown a quick flash of a black face compared to a white face (Payne, 2001).</p>
<p>Though these may be cases of implicit racial bias, is implicit-bias training the best remedy?</p>
<p>It’s probably better than nothing, but not necessarily.</p>
<p>Carefully designing effective training that can overcome these risks takes time. And some experts have expressed doubt that Starbucks has enough time before May 29.</p>
<p>I’m <a>optimistic</a> that the Starbucks training will at least make participants more aware of the existence of bias and the possibility of bias in themselves. And that may be an important first step.</p>
<a>stress</a>. Calling the police within two minutes might be too fast (not that I think restaurant managers have an easy job).

<h2> Why False Memories Are Common </h2>
<p>A person’s malleable memories often involve the mundane, such as when we second-guess whether the stove really is off or on. But they can often be far more consequential, such as <a>unreliable eyewitness recollections</a> of a <a>crime</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes a false memory? </h3> </div>
<a>newly formed, cobbled-together recollection</a> that does not accurately reflect reality. Also, under certain circumstances, a person can be given false information and be convinced to believe that an event that never occurred actually did.
<div> <h3> Should I question my memories? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Given that our <a>recovered memories</a> may be genuine or false, or a combination of the two, it is legitimate to question just how much of <a>what you remember</a> is real and how much is a misperception.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I identify a false memory? </h3> </div>
<p>Without material evidence, it’s hard to know for sure whether a memory is real or imagined. Even if you feel high conviction that a recollection is true, there is a high chance that the <a>memory is flawed</a>, by a little or a lot.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I get rid of false memories? </h3> </div>

<a>sexual abuse</a> or relies on the correct identification of a suspect by a child. But adults can also be tricked into remembering events that never happened, or changing the details of things that really did happen.
<div> <h3> Why do I remember things that never happened? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do memories change over time? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual abuse</a> allegations, notes that everyone embellishes or adds to their memories during recall or recounting. Over time those changes, accurate or not,
<a>become part of the memory</a> in the mind. Loftus warns that human memory is not a recording device, but more like a Wikipedia page: You can change it, but others can, too.
<div> <h3> Why can't I remember my childhood? </h3> </div>
<a>childhood amnesia</a>. In the first few years of life, a child’s body undergoes the process of neurogenesis, or the growth and development of nervous tissue. New nerve cells develop, and old cells get recycled or reformed, taking
<a>childhood</a> memories away with them.
<h2> How Misinformation Is Easily Spread </h2>
<div> <h3> Why is misinformation so detrimental? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can our attitudes and bias influence memory? </h3> </div>
<p>Biased thinking molds the way we remember. We all employ <a>bias</a> when perceiving, interpreting, and remembering information and events. This effect extends to the ways in which we tap our memories for <a>information about fake news</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Can well-known events be altered? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a study, researchers doctored images of well-known events and found that indeed <a>a person’s recollection</a> of even universally known, iconic events can be altered.</p> </div> </div>

<h1> How Does the Law Treat Repressed Memories? </h1>
<h2> Courts have failed to find a consistent approach regarding repressed memories. </h2>
<a>false memories</a> can be implanted. According to the American Psychological Association, it is not possible to distinguish
<a>repressed memories</a> from false ones without corroborating evidence.
<p>Memory generally consists of three processes:</p>
<li>Encoding (the process of forming a memory code in order to get information into memory)</li>
<li>Consolidation/Storage (maintaining encoded information in memory over a period of time)</li>
<li>Retrieval (recovering information from memory storage).</li>
<p>How have courts dealt with repressed memories and the risk of false memories? Courts tend to be all over the map.</p>

<h1> Eyewitness Imagination: How Our Minds Change Our Memories </h1>
<h2> Eyewitness memory can be inaccurate. But can it change itself? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Openclipart</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In our last Forensic View, we saw that typical eyewitness errors follow an interesting pattern. The most common eyewitness errors are those of suspect appearance, which is not surprising. </p>
<a>sex</a>, or of weapons used, or of important elements of the physical environment of a given
<a>crime</a>). Far beyond error rates in any of these important areas, people simply made things up. And they had no idea they were doing it.
<p>How is this possible? Well, it has directly to do with how <a>memory</a> works, rather than with how most people think memory works. </p>
<p>But why would this matter? </p>
<p>This means that every time you tell somebody about something, your retelling, as an event, may influence future accounts. Your imagination today can influence your imagination tomorrow.</p>
<p>In our experiment (Sharps et al., 2012), our first request for information resulted in a true/false ratio of 3.56; in other words, we got about three and a half true statements for every false one. Not great, obviously, but not too bad.</p>
<p>Repeating the story resulted in more and more errors, exactly as we’d predict by seeing repetition not as a passive act, but as an active contributor to inaccuracy. </p>
<p>This is yet another demonstration of the great importance of an understanding of psychology, including forensic cognitive psychology, to the effectiveness and fairness of the criminal justice system.</p>

<h1> Eyewitness Testimony, Eyewitness Mistakes: What We Get Wrong </h1>
<h2> What kinds of eyewitness mistakes send innocent people to prison? </h2>
<p>But what kinds of mistakes do these eyewitness processes create? My students and I have researched this, and a lot of what we found was very surprising (e.g., Sharps, 2017). </p>
<a>collaboration</a> with law enforcement colleagues, we’ve created images of realistic
<a>imagination</a>. In other words, people just made things up. Without knowing they were doing it.
<p>There’s only one reasonable answer to that question. “Dude, nothing happened next. I was looking at a photograph.”</p>
<p>But people told us. They gave us their accounts of memories that had no bases at all.</p>
<p>And it didn’t happen at all. </p>
<p>This is certainly not to belittle the persons involved; frequently, they reported exactly what they believed that they saw.</p>
<p>The only problem is that they were frequently completely wrong. Again, the average witness made something up out of whole cloth, at least in our experimental situation, about one and one-quarter times per account. </p>
