<div><p>Frank told The Post last week that when he told Ohio officials he would be calling the former president, he didn’t mean it literally. He said he meant to show that he had connections to powerful people who could be helpful.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I didn’t mean it as a threat. I meant it as an opportunity,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a text to The Post, Frank disputed that he spoke to the former president at the rally.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lindell interviewed Trump at his Florida club this fall for a show <a>streamed </a>on Lindell’s website, and the former president has praised the MyPillow executive for “fighting” for him, a Trump adviser said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the Trump rally in Ohio this summer, Lindell could be heard telling throngs of Trump fans that he would be showing more evidence “soon” as they mobbed him for photos.</p></div></div>

<p>In a statement, RNC spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez called his criticism “reckless and completely false,” saying the national party financed 50 election-related lawsuits in the last election cycle and is pursuing more than 30 suits now.</p>
<div><div><p>“We will continue to act and get results while others continue to do nothing more than talk,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b><b/></b>Numerous election security experts have dismissed the fraud allegations made by Lindell and Frank, but the claims have found traction among some Republican legislators.</p></div></div>
<p>In North Carolina this fall, a Republican state lawmaker sent officials an ominous-looking map of the state showing red lines identified as “remote connections” emanating like laser beams from all of the state’s 100 counties.</p>
<div><div><p>State officials said there is no merit to the document, which attributes the information to retired Army colonel Phil Waldron, another Trump ally who has challenged the results of the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waldron did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>'They seek me out'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve been going state to state and showing them evidence directly, and they all want to do audits,” Lindell said at the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frank said he is often asked for help by local activists who have seen his presentations online or his posts on the social media site Telegram.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Someone will call from a state and say, ‘Dr. Frank, our elections are ripped off. Will you come help us?’ ” he told The Post last month. “They seek me out; I’m not seeking them out.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ashcroft declined to comment, as did several other Republican officials whom Lindell or Frank said they contacted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other state officials have handled the outreach gingerly by agreeing to listen to the election deniers but then stating publicly that there is no evidence of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Merrill said he personally knows a couple of the voters living at Big Oak Ranch whose names were presented to him as evidence of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A simple Google check would have told you what these places are,” Merrill recalled telling the pair. “Instead you reached a supposition that voter fraud occurred.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frank acknowledged that the meeting did not go well. “We have since changed our approach as a result,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re going to be circling back to Alabama, obviously, long before the 2022 election and show him that the machines are defective,” Lindell said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Attempted breach of Ohio county election network draws FBI and state scrutiny</p></div>
<p>State officials pushed back, explaining that voters actually received forms to request absentee ballots, not the ballots themselves. Frank quickly backtracked, conceding he did not yet have the evidence about the ballots, according to the recording.</p>
<div><div><p>“We can arrange for that” in Ohio, he said, according to the recording.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview in November, LaRose offered a blunt assessment of Frank’s theories.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In early October, they counted a sample of ballots in a larger county, and Houck issued a second <a>news release </a>declaring Lindell’s claims “without merit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That posture was an unpopular one for Houck, who recently dropped out of the running for secretary of state in the deeply Republican state. But he said it was important to speak out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You put the facts out and you let the chips fall where they may,” he told The Post.</p></div></div>

<a>the Jan. 6 assault</a> and the 2020 presidential election color nearly every issue raised in the survey, from how much violence occurred at the Capitol that day to the severity of the sentences handed down to convicted protesters to whether

<div><p>Read full Post-UMD poll results</p></div>
<a>the day Congress was to ratify the 2020 electoral college vote</a>, Trump claimed at a rally near the White House that the election had been rigged and urged his followers to “fight like hell” to stop what he said was a stolen outcome.
<b> </b>Many of his supporters walked to the Capitol from the rally and took part in the violence.
<div><div><p>Overall, the<b> </b>Post-UMD survey finds that 68 percent of Americans say there is no solid evidence of widespread fraud but 30 percent say there is.</p></div></div>
<a>Washington Post-ABC News poll</a> at the time.
<div><div><p>Among those who say they voted for Trump in 2020, 69 percent now say Biden was not legitimately elected, while 97 percent of Biden voters say the current president was legitimately elected.</p></div></div>

<p>Moreno is emblematic of the modern Republican Party, echoing former president Donald Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen — a position that has become the unofficial litmus test for good standing within the GOP.</p>
<div><div><p>At least five candidates for the U.S. House were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riots, including Jason Riddle of New Hampshire, whom federal prosecutors have accused of chugging wine inside the building that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Riddle added that if he’s sentenced for Jan. 6 crimes, “I’ll run from jail. It will give me something to do.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“There is always going to be pressure on the RNC to try to do more than it has,” Riemer said in a recent interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump has been frustrated that some in the GOP, particularly prominent Republicans in the Senate, have not been willing to echo his claims — and that an overwhelming majority of the body voted to certify the election.</p></div></div>
<p>According to a <a>Washington Post-University of Maryland poll</a> in December, 58 percent of Republicans think Biden’s election was not legitimate, and 62 percent think there is solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.</p>
<div><div><p>Moreno said “the door was flung open” to fraud and abuse during 2020 and he, like Trump, is still trying to answer one key question: “How much actual fraud was there?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Rewriting the narrative</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The whitewashing of Jan. 6 began that very night.</p></div></div>
<p>Just hours after the insurrection — which resulted in five deaths, including a police officer — <a>139 House members and eight senators</a> returned to the desecrated Capitol and voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<div><div><p>Trump and his allies, too, began rewriting the narrative almost immediately.</p></div></div>
<a>“a normal tourist visit.”</a> And some Republicans rebranded those arrested in the aftermath of the insurrection as “political prisoners.”
<div><div><p>Nonetheless, the former president struck a defiant note, saying in the statement that protesters descended on Washington last Jan. 6 to fight “the fraud of the 2020 Presidential Election.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This was, indeed, the Crime of the Century,” he wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>‘I think Trump won’</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not one of the five hopefuls clearly stated that Biden had won the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The next day, on his radio show, Hewitt posed the same question to Josh Mandel, a Republican senatorial candidate in Ohio.</p></div></div>
<a>Mandel replied</a>. He went on to say that the results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin still need to be “fully investigated — and none of them have.”
<div><div><p>In his endorsement, Trump attacked Detmer’s GOP opponent, incumbent Lana Theis, who helped produce a legislative report finding that allegations of election fraud in the state were “demonstrably false.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>‘Long-term, I think we’re screwed’</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Boyer said he expects Republicans to do well in the 2022 midterms but that “long-term, I think we’re screwed as a party.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“When you’ve got Trump telling the base the system is rigged, don’t vote, they believe him, and that’s why we lost control of the U.S. Senate, that’s why we lost the two Georgia seats,” Boyer said.</p></div>

<div><h1>Democrats’ redistricting dilemma: Good government or ‘fight fire with fire’?</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amber Phillips</div></div>Politics Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021|Updated December 17, 2021 at 4:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Both sides gerrymander. But for the past decade, Democrats have been on the losing end of these battles, and now they could be out of power in the House of Representatives and key states for years to come.</p></div></div>
<div><div>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</div></div>
<div><div><p>This is playing out against the backdrop of increasing concern among Democrats and good-governance experts about the Republican Party’s anti-democratic push.</p></div></div>
<p>As gerrymandering has become a bigger political issue among a Democratic base calling for governing reforms from the local level all the way up to the Supreme Court, whatever path Democrats choose to advocate is politically risky for them.</p>
<div><div><p>Yet Democrats on the losing side of fairer maps don’t always see it that way.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How redistricting is shaping the 2022 House map</p></div>
<a>are an endangered species,</a> and politicians are using increasingly sophisticated tools to go into neighborhoods — sometime by the home — to draw maps that favor them.
<div><p>“So many advocates were hopeful that with increased public attention on the process this cycle, that we would deter some of the worst abuses,” he said. “It doesn’t feel like that has been the case.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Yet the Freedom to Vote Act supported by most Democrats in Congress notably bans partisan gerrymandering but doesn’t go as far as some advocates want, like by calling for independent commissions in every state.</p></div></div>
<a>as in Virginia</a>, or, in the case of California,
<a>gamed it to come out on top</a>.
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Republicans are nowhere nearly as politically boxed in to avoid gerrymandering. They control about two-thirds of state legislatures and thus most of the mapmaking.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans say that there’s probably no such thing as a fair map.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So where do Democrats go from here? They’ve already unilaterally disarmed in several key states for this redistricting cycle, and as a result, they could be out of power in certain states and the House for years to come.</p></div></div>
<header><div><h1>Which party controls congressional redistricting in your state</h1></div></header>
<p>The stakes are sky high. Republicans need to flip only five congressional seats to win back the House majority in 2022, and Democrats fear the GOP’s advantage in state legislatures could help tip the balance.</p>
<h4>What changed since the last redistricting cycle?</h4>
<p><a>The coronavirus pandemic</a>, coupled with the Trump administration’s <a>losing battle to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census enumeration</a>, delayed the release of 2020 Census redistricting data by about four months.</p>
<p>The independent commissions’ work could provide evidence for advocates who would like to see more states adopt them — or to <a>opponents who say they can be gamed to serve political ends</a>.</p>
<a>both parties are gearing up</a> for another round of intense litigation.
<p>Meanwhile, two landmark Supreme Court decisions of the past decade have given states more control over the shape of districts.</p>
<a>the Supreme Court rendered unenforceable</a> the Voting Rights Act’s requirement that certain states with a history of racial discrimination obtain clearance from the Justice Department before enacting new maps. Then, in 2019,
<a>the Court ruled</a> that federal judges do not have the power to stop partisan gerrymandering, with politicians drawing districts to preserve or expand their party’s power.
<h4>What constraints do map-drawers have to consider?</h4>
<p>[<a>How the racial makeup of where you live has changed since 1990</a>]</p>
<p>By amending state constitutions or passing laws, many states have imposed further requirements on their mapmakers. In some states, state courts have established precedents that could affect how maps are drawn.</p>
<h4>How quickly do states have to settle on a map?</h4>
<p>As a result of the census delays, mapmakers across the country will be pressed for time as they race to draw new congressional and state legislative boundaries.</p>
<a>vary from state to state</a> — Texas’s Dec. 13 filing deadline is the earliest, while Rhode Island’s is not until June 29, 2022.

<div><h1>No, there’s no substantive evidence that the Capitol riot was spurred by antifa</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Philip Bump</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Dalton Bennett</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 7, 2021 at 1:07 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>One sure sign that the violence that wracked the Capitol on Wednesday was broadly unacceptable to President Trump’s usual allies was how quickly some pivoted to blame people other than the president and his base of supporters.</p></div>
<p>Gaetz wasn’t alone. On Fox News Channel’s prime-time shows, hosts and guests similarly claimed that perhaps the mob was spurred on by antifa. The fringier networks that have blossomed in the wake of the election made similar claims.</p>
<p>“XRVision didn’t generate any composites or detection imagery for the Washington Times nor for a ‘retired military officer,’ ” Apelbaum said, “and did not authorize them to make any such representations.”</p>
<div><div><p>What happened, Apelbaum explained, was that the firm “performed an analysis on the footage” and, in doing so, was able to identify three people.</p></div></div>
<div><p>XRVision did create graphics comparing people who had been at the Capitol with other photographs, Apelbaum said, which “were distributed to a handful of individuals for their private consumption and not for publication.”</p></div>
<a>website</a> Philly Antifa. As
<a>noted</a> by Twitter user Respectable Lawyer, though, the reason the photo of those people is on the website isn’t that they are antifa, but that they were believed to be
<a>fascists</a>. That’s the “fa” in antifa: The ideology is predicated on combating fascism.
<div><div><p><i>Update: The Times removed the story, which can still be seen at </i><a><i>the Internet Archive</i></a><i>.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For that, we turn to Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The evidence that followed:</p></div></div>
<li>A member of Congress told him that there was an antifa threat.</li>
<li>A member of Congress told him that a Capitol Police officer speculated that antifa might infiltrate the pro-Trump crowd.</li>
<li>Capitol Police advised against leaving the Capitol complex on Tuesday.</li>
<li>A vague reference to other evidence, probably the photos above.</li>
<a>some anti-antifa sentiment</a> on display from the group.
<a>never robust evidence</a> of any such threat, but it was nonetheless effective at casting immigrants to the United States in a more nefarious light.
<a>captured it directly</a>: They were spurred by the false idea — spread by Trump, his allies and conservative media — that the election had been stolen.
<div><div><p>It is safe to assume, in other words, that Fox News bears more culpability for the collapse of order on Wednesday than does antifa.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The headline-grabbing paltry sum, however, is not the whole story, and Meghan will be receiving much more from the tabloid — but for violation of her copyright rather than privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wins court victory in privacy fight with British tabloid</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the court added that a “confidential sum agreed between the parties” will be paid by the tabloid’s publisher<b> </b>for copyright infringement. That secret sum could be quite high, legal observers say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The duchess sued — and the duchess won.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Duchess of Sussex wins her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in The Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online — SEE PAGE 3,” read the statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the case sets no legal precedent, Green said, it has “immense cultural and media significance.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Analysts said that for the payout, Meghan’s team would have sought to recoup the profits that the tabloid made from printing her letter, which violated her copyright.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the Mail on Sunday would have had to provide “accurate financial information as to how much it made from the infringing material.”
<div><div><p>Mark Stephens, a media lawyer at the London-based Howard Kennedy firm, said that during trials, expert evidence can be sought over how much the infringing material helped boost sales, although this case did not go to trial.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But he said that a number would still be generated “forensically” or simply “dealt with by sticking a thumb in the air” and landing on a figure to which both parties agree. He guessed it would be north of $100,000.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It looks as if they weighed up their options, and then decided that an account of profits in the copyright is going to give her more money than the invasion of privacy,” Stephens said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>For the first time in over 30 years, the EPA adds to its list of hazardous air pollutants</h1></div>
<h2>The move will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to curb the use of 1-bromopropane, a powerful dry-cleaning solvent linked to cancer</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dino Grandoni</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:22 p.m. EST|Updated today at 8:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It took over three decades, but the federal government finally expanded its list of chemicals too dangerous for Americans to breathe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By one.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that it took so long to add a single compound to a list Congress established in 1990 underscores the bureaucratic inertia that impedes any effort to protect Americans from harmful chemicals that businesses use every year.</p></div>
<p>“Putting it on the list was supposed to be easy,” said Adam M. Finkel, who used to direct the health standards programs at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and warned of the dangers of 1-bromopropane 20 years ago.</p>
<div><div><p>“I hate the term no-brainer, but this is a no-brainer,” he added. “It’s a toxic air pollutant, so it belongs on the list of toxic air pollutants.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here are Biden's new environmental policies</p></div>
<a>mercury</a> and lead — if it is “reasonably” anticipated to harm humans or the environment.
<div><div><p>The agency was supposed to make a decision within 18 months. But the delays spanned three presidencies.</p></div></div>
<p>Earthjustice senior attorney Tosh Sagar, whose group sued the EPA over the chemical, said its regulators “have trouble consistently following the law that Congress laid out in terms of protecting people” no matter who is president.</p>
<p>Obama administration officials didn’t draft a proposal approving the request until his last month in office, in 2017. The Trump administration <a>granted</a> the petition in 2020 but indefinitely delayed adding it to the hazardous list.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s taken them this long to act,” said Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Executive Director Faye Graul, whose members manufacture alternative chemicals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main lobbying arm in Washington, said they remain leery because the EPA has not yet said how it will curb the pollutant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The EPA is planning to propose a “regulatory infrastructure” for adding the chemical to the hazardous pollutant list this year, EPA spokesman Nick Conger said. It aims to finalize that rule by early 2023, he added.</p></div></div>

<div><p>At-home covid tests and omicron: What you need to know</p></div>
<b> </b>to add a throat swab has been gaining attention on social media recently, at the same time that concerns have been rising about the efficacy of at-home tests. The FDA
<a>announced in late December</a> that while rapid antigen tests do detect the omicron variant, some “may have reduced sensitivity,” citing an early finding from
<a>ongoing performance evaluations</a>. A
<a>anecdotal stories</a> of having coronavirus symptoms and testing negative when using a rapid test kit as instructed (only swabbing their noses). But when they swabbed their throats as well as their noses, they said, the
<div><div><p>Some prominent experts have also started recommending the additional throat swab.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>symptoms appear to be starting earlier in people infected with omicron, “there is a chance the virus isn’t yet growing in the nose when you first test,”
<a>tweeted</a> epidemiologist and testing expert
<a>Michael Mina</a>, a vocal advocate of rapid testing who recently left his academic and research positions at Harvard and is now chief science officer for the biotech software company eMed.
<div><div><p>“Virus may start further down,” Mina continued. “Throat swab + nasal may improve chances a swab picks up virus.”</p></div></div>
<a>Eric Feigl-Ding</a>, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed. “#Omicron is very different from all other variants,” he
<a>tweeted</a>. “We need to adapt to changing testing strategies.”
<div><div><p>Those research papers were released as preprint articles, meaning formal peer review of the work has not been completed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Feigl-Ding also said other countries, such as <a>Canada</a> and the <a>United Kingdom</a>, have authorized testing options that use throat swabs along with nasal swabs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the FDA, which issues emergency use authorizations for coronavirus tests, has strongly discouraged deviating from the specific instructions that accompany test kits.</p></div></div>
<p>“The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,” the federal agency said in an emailed statement to The Post on Wednesday.</p>
<a>recommends</a> that throat swabs should be collected by a trained health-care provider.)
<div><div><p>Other epidemiologists and testing experts echoed the FDA’s warning and said testing guidance should not change until there is more data.</p></div></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of work under the hood that has to be done for these companies to pivot to a new sampling method,” said <a>Albert Ko</a>, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<a> Yuka Manabe</a>, who runs the Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University, emphasized that it is “not the way the tests were designed to be used.”
<div><div><p>At this point in the pandemic, Manabe’s recommendation for testing is simple: “You should use at-home tests as the instructions for use tell you to use them,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an interesting topic, but requires careful investigation and any test differing from manufacturer claims need to be rigorously validated before implementation,” LeBlanc said.</p></div></div>
<a>Matthew J. Binnicker</a>, the director of clinical virology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “I don’t know what that false positive rate becomes with a throat swab included in the mix,” he said.
<a>noted</a> that while the strategy does “likely improve sensitivity,” it “may potentially cause a slightly greater number of false positives.” He recommended not eating or drinking 30 minutes before swabbing.
