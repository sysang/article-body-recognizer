<h1> The Truth About People Who Are Childfree </h1>
<h2> How the childfree differ from childless, parents, and people planning to parent. </h2>
<li>A higher percentage of people may choose not to have children than was previously thought. </li>
<li>These childfree individuals did not differ from other people in terms of race, personality, or life satisfaction.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, they were treated with bias and less warmth by parents, childless individuals, and people who wanted children in the future.</li>

<a>gender</a>, or race. In addition, they asked people in each of the groups how warmly they felt toward childfree women and men.
<p>The participants were a representative sample of 981 Michigan adults, including both men and women. Their average age was 52.</p>
<h3>Identifying the Childfree, Childless, Parents, and Adults Planning to Be Parents</h3>
<p>The researchers classified the adults into four groups based on their answers to three questions:</p>
<p>1. “Do you have, or have you ever had, any biological or adopted children?</p>
<p>People who answered yes were the parents.</p>
<p>2. “Do you plan to have any biological or adopted children in the future?”</p>
<p>The people who answered yes to this question after answering no to the first were classified as planning to have children.</p>
<p>3. “Do you wish you had or could have biological or adopted children?”</p>
<p>The people who answered yes to this question after answering no to the first two were classified as childless.</p>
<p>The childfree were the people who answered no to all three questions.</p>
<h3>How the Childfree Differed—or Did Not Differ—from the Other Adults</h3>
<a>23 percent</a> said they were not likely to have kids because they did not want kids.
<p>Only people in Michigan participated in this study. Michigan, though, is similar to the overall U.S. population in race, age, income, and <a>education</a>.</p>
<p>More than half of the childfree adults (54 percent) had always been single.</p>
<a>divorced</a>, separated, or widowed).
<p>Similar percentages of childfree adults were men (51 percent) and women (49 percent).</p>
<p>The childfree included the same proportion of people of color as the entire sample of participants.</p>
<p>Across all of the people in the study, 77 percent were white, and 23 percent were people of color. Among just the childfree, the percentages were 78 percent and 22 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The childfree were more politically liberal than the parents.</p>
<p>On average, the childfree were center-left politically. The parents were more conservative.</p>
<p>The childfree were just as satisfied with their lives as everyone else.</p>
<p>All of the other groups felt less warmly toward the childfree than the childfree felt toward one another.</p>
<p>What did the childfree do to warrant that cool reception? They were not complaining about not having kids; it was their choice.</p>

<h1> How to Know That You're Living Authentically </h1>
<h2> Living the life that is best for you, not the life others pressure you to live. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Rido/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>How do we become our best selves, our truest and most authentic selves? If we can figure that out, we are on our way to a much more fulfilling life than we would have if we were still floundering.</p>
<p>The more I study people who are single at heart, the more I think that at the core of their lives is <a>authenticity</a>. By living single, they are living the life that is best for them, and that is most true to who they really are.</p>
<a>attention</a> to how you are really feeling than, say, people who get married and have children and are never told that it’s just a phase.
<p>When you set a goal or make a plan, how do you feel about it?</p>
<li>Do you feel ambivalent about it?</li>
<li>Do you find that you just can't get yourself to follow through?</li>
<li>Do you disparage your own goals or plans when you are talking to other people?</li>
<li>Do you feel pressured by other people to pursue the goals you chose or the plans you made?</li>
<li>Do you feel constrained to pursue particular goals (for example, getting a law degree instead of a degree in English literature because you think you will need the better salary that a law degree might bring)?</li>
<li>Do you worry that if you do not pursue a particular goal or plan, you will feel guilty?</li>
<p>Or do you feel entirely differently?</p>
<li>Do you really enjoy pursuing your goals or plans?</li>
<li>Do you identify with what you are doing? Does it seem like what you are doing reflects who you really are?</li>
<li>Do you find what you are doing interesting? Meaningful?</li>
<li>Is it challenging in a way you appreciate?</li>
<li>If you are doing something in some sense because you have to (for example, you are doing your job because it pays), do you sometimes find that it is so engaging that even if you didn't need the money, you might want to do it anyway?</li>
<li>Are you more attuned to your own feelings of growth and self-improvement than to other people's evaluations of how you are doing?</li>
<p>If the second set of feelings describes you more accurately than the first set, then you are probably doing a good job of becoming your true self.</p>
<h3>Do You Pay Attention to Your Feelings?</h3>
<p>Similarly, people who "follow their gut" rather than trying to be overly rational may also do better at choosing the goals and plans that are right for them.</p>
<h3>Are You Surrounded By People Who Make It Easy to Be Your True Self?</h3>
<p>Self-concordance theory is mostly about you and not about other people. But the people around you can be important in making it easier for you to become your best self rather than standing in your way.</p>
<p>In the workplace, you are doing well if you have a boss who tries to see your perspective, who tries to give you choices, and who provides meaningful rationales for any advice that is offered.</p>

<h1> The Truth About "Relationship Virgins" </h1>

<li>"Relationship virgins" — a popular term for people who have never been in a romantic relationship — are often stigmatized and judged harshly. </li>
<li>People view those without romantic relationship experience as less happy, less well-adjusted, and lonelier than others, according to research.</li>
<li>As the number of single people grows in the U.S. and abroad, many people are taking pride in living outside of the conventions of coupling. </li>

<p>In 2017, a <a>story in the Guardian</a> broke the internet. It was about a woman who “managed to get to 54 without ever having a boyfriend.” She was called a “relationship virgin.”</p>
<p>The story was filled with anguish. The relationship virgin was distraught about her lack of romantic relationship experience and was struggling to figure out what was wrong with her. She was so ashamed, she would not even use her name.</p>
<a>wrote about</a> romantic relationship virgins when the Guardian story was first published, but I want to revisit the matter because I have glimmers of hope that some of the sadness and
<a>shame</a> around this matter is beginning to dissipate. In some instances, people who have never had a romantic relationship are instead, justifiably, experiencing pride.
<h3>Feeling Bad About Being a Romantic Relationship Virgin Is Understandable</h3>
<p>One of the many reasons we should stop stigmatizing them is this: They are in enough pain already.</p>

<a>matrimaniacal</a> popular culture, stopped being so unenlightened in their thinking and so judgmental.

<h3>Why the Stigma May Be Subsiding</h3>
<p>Even more stunning were the results of a Pew survey conducted just before the pandemic and published in 2020. It showed that half of all solo single people <a>do not want a romantic relationship </a>or even a date.</p>

<a>aromanticism</a> or their status as single at heart as an orientation or an
<a>identity</a>, not just a casual preference, and definitely not a deficit. They are creating their own forums, events, and collections of resources. With regard to asexuality, I think it is fair to say that it has become a social movement.
<a>explained previously</a>, investment in
<a>sexuality</a> or romanticism or romantic coupling no longer feels as compulsory as it did before. Most significantly, many take pride in living outside of the conventions of sex and romance and coupling, rather than being shamed by it.
<p>I wouldn’t be ashamed to be a romantic relationship virgin. I’m a little ashamed that I’m not.</p>

<sup>3</sup> The American Cancer Society highlights the importance of modifying health behaviors, such as smoking and a sedentary lifestyle, to help reduce the risk of recurrence.

<p>Each year, many of us make New Year’s resolutions, aiming to be healthier, happier, and more successful in the year ahead. But too often, after a few weeks, we lose momentum.</p>
<a>self-regulation</a>” (Neal, Wood, Quinn, 2006).
<a>goals</a> for the year ahead, take time to reflect on your life with these five steps. You may discover an old habit that has been blocking your progress. Identifying and eliminating this roadblock can release new energy to move forward.
<p>This week, at the end of each day, ask yourself how much time you spent in each of these categories:</p>
<li>Renewal activities (recreation, reading, <a>creativity</a>, fun)</li>
<p>2. Examine the patterns that emerge.</p>
<p>Do your daily activities reflect your personal values? Is your life balanced in a way that works for you? Do you make enough time for exercise, renewal, and <a>spirituality</a> or are you too bogged down with maintenance and daily chores?</p>
<p>3. Carefully examine the last category: Other.</p>
<p>What else have you been doing? Have you noticed habits that may not be serving you well?</p>
<li>Have you been spending too many hours on television, YouTube videos, or social media? If so, awareness is the first step to positive change. Ask yourself how you can cut down on these behaviors.</li>
<li>Have your days been filled with “shoulds” and external demands? If so, what can you delegate, eliminate, or simplify?</li>
<p>4. Ask yourself, “Is there anything missing from my life?”</p>
<p>Perhaps time for personal renewal or something else you value. Can you make room for this by scaling down your involvement in other areas?</p>
<p>5. Finally, when contemplating future choices or commitments, ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li>Is it necessary?</li> <li>Is it healthy?</li> <li>Does it express who I really am?</li> </ul>
<p>If it doesn’t fit these criteria, why do it? Research shows that having positive personal goals can help us flourish (Emmons, 2003).</p>

<p>Astrology is an ancient practice that remains popular in many places in the world, including in the U.S. Indeed, nearly one in three American adults <a>believe</a> in astrology.</p>
<p>The word astrology comes from the Greek astron, meaning star. Astrology refers to the study of the movement, position, and other aspects of stars and planets with the aim of obtaining knowledge about human lives and future events.</p>
<a>stress</a>, confusion, and uncertainty. For instance, during times of social and political upheaval (e.g., revolutions, pandemics) or personal
<a>crisis</a> (e.g., serious illness), many turn to astrology as a way to cope and feel life is controllable or at least predictable.
<a>spirituality</a>, thinking style, attitude,
<a>Personality and Individual Differences</a>, which suggests that belief in astrology is associated with higher narcissism and lower
<a>supernatural</a> causality for events and, due to lower intelligence and cognitive ability, fail to adjust their thinking when presented with empirical evidence to the contrary.
<p>With this introduction in mind, it is time to examine the findings of the research by Andersson and collaborators, who evaluated the link between astrology, intelligence, and personality (particularly narcissism).</p>
<h3>Investigating astrology, personality, and intelligence</h3>
<p>The sample included 264 people, 87% of them women, with an age range of 25 to 34. They completed the following tests:</p>
<li>The IPIP-30 Personality Scale: 30 items used to measure the <a>Big Five</a> personality traits—i.e. <a>agreeableness</a>, <a>conscientiousness</a>, <a>extraversion</a>, <a>neuroticism</a>, and <a>openness to experience</a>.</li>
<a>Machiavellianism</a>. Only the nine items measuring narcissism were used in this investigation. For example, “I know that I am special because everyone keeps telling me so.”
<li>Intelligence was evaluated using the four three-dimensional rotation items (measuring visual-spatial reasoning) from the International Cognitive Ability Resource.</li>

<p>Analysis of the data also showed narcissists tended to assume erroneously that belief in astrology is supported by scientific evidence.</p>
<p>An additional finding was that intelligent people were less likely to believe in astrology, whereas agreeable ones were more likely to believe in it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the authors argue, this is an important area of research, since belief in astrology may be correlated with belief in other pseudosciences and even conspiracy theories.</p>

<li>"Secret" benefactor acts (e.g., hiding $5 Visa gift cards around town or in stores, paying for the coffee or groceries of someone in line behind you).</li>
<li>Simply notice—without judgment—how often you nag, complain about, or criticize your spouse, whether in your head or out loud.</li>
<li>Turn down the volume on your complaint channel and instead allow the space where a complaint used to go to be filled with quiet observation.</li>
<li>Tack on an explicit expression of <a>gratitude</a> (even if you just think it to yourself or write it in a journal) every time you catch yourself complaining.</li>

<h1> Three Potential Ways to Become More Conscientious </h1>
<h2> A new report highlights several methods that hold promise. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: geralt/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>These adjectives describe a conscientious person.<sup>1,2</sup> Conscientiousness is an important concept because it predicts many significant and positive outcomes in life (e.g., better health, relationships, job performance, school outcomes).</p>
<p>How can we become more conscientious? That is what <a>researchers from Yale University and Harvard Medical School discuss</a> in an article examined in the January issue of <a>Personality Disorders</a>: Theory, Research, and Treatment.<sup>1</sup></p>
<a>Big Five personality theory</a>, conscientiousness is one of five dimensions of
<a>openness to experience</a>. Conscientiousness is associated with traits such as
<a>delay of gratification, ego control, effortful control, self-regulation, grit, and constraint</a>.
<p>How is conscientiousness measured? Usually along with the other <a>Big Five</a> personality traits. (Tests of conscientiousness are <a>available online</a>.)</p>
<h3>How to improve conscientiousness?</h3>
<p>Three types of interventions might help improve conscientiousness.<sup>1</sup></p>
<h4>Behavioral and cognitive interventions</h4>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pexels/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>contingency management</a>—reinforcing and rewarding positive changes in behavior (e.g., abstinence from
<a>substance abuse</a> disorders. In drug-treatment populations, contingency
<a>management</a> has been associated with moderate effect sizes (larger for cocaine and opioids than for tobacco).
<h4>Goal-related metacognitive techniques</h4>
<p>Another group of techniques involves <a>metacognition</a> (knowledge and awareness of one’s own thinking process).</p>
<a>fantasies</a> about the future do not automatically translate to a willingness to put in the effort needed for change. So what can we do? One metacognitive technique helpful with goal setting is called
<a>anxious</a> before the meeting.”
<a>Episodic future thinking</a> encourages people to try to “pre-experience” their future—to not just think about it but to imagine it vividly in all its realistic details; this is similar to how “episodic
<a>memory</a> allows us to re-experience our past.”
<p>Whichever of these techniques we use, we are asked to ponder the future and make plans. This may help increase our conscientiousness and allow us to move toward our goals—even if the goals and rewards associated with them are far away.</p>
<h4>Cognitive remediation therapy</h4>
<a>Cognitive remediation</a> is used to enhance an individual’s cognitive processes and functions, such as
<a>attention</a>, working memory, and social
<a>cognition</a>. It does so by utilizing cognitive exercises and educational video games.
<p>The goal of this intervention, aside from immediate improvement on the trained task, is transfer—meaning to transfer<a> cognitive gains to other related mental tasks, but also to activities of daily living</a>.</p>
<a>executive functioning</a> in disorders like schizophrenia.
<a>Executive functions</a> are top-down cognitive processes and are activated when the use of automatic or instinctive processes is inadequate (e.g., reading a difficult article in a noisy room).
<sup>6</sup> Given the hypothesized
<a> link between executive functions and conscientiousness</a>,
<sup>7</sup> cognitive remediation might increase conscientiousness by enhancing executive functioning.

<h3>Concluding thoughts on increasing conscientiousness</h3>
<a>self-control</a> translate to honesty, keeping promises, and returning favors. Consequently, conscientious individuals enjoy higher quality relationships and have lower rates of
<a>divorce</a>. Conscientiousness, in
<a>education</a>/work domains, has been linked with enhanced performance in school and college, better jobs, more success and satisfaction at work, higher likelihood of promotion, and more money. In short, conscientious people are
<a>healthier, have greater relationships, and are more successful</a>.

<h1> Self-Care: Governor, Time Traveler, and Gamer </h1>
<h2> Three metaphors for self-care are discussed. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: manbob86/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We can define self-care practices as “behaviors that maintain and promote physical and emotional well-being” (p. 56).<sup>1</sup> Self-care strategies help <a>reduce stress and increase life satisfaction</a>.<sup>2</sup></p>
<h3>Your body as a country</h3>
<h3>Traveling in time with your body</h3>
<p>Another potentially useful self-care metaphor involves time travel. Imagine you live in some future—say, eight years (or months, weeks, or even days) from now—and you have traveled back in time to the present moment.</p>
<p>In one version, you have taken care of yourself these eight years. In another version, you have not. The three of you—these two versions and your present self—are sitting in a circle.</p>

<p>Now become the person who practiced self-care regularly. What do you look like and how do you feel? As this person, do you feel a sense of <a>gratitude</a> for the effort and determination of your present-day self?</p>
<p>Last, become yourself once again. Remember, you will be making choices every day that will affect your future.</p>
<p>You do not have to be perfect to have a better future; simply commit to making choices with self-care in mind.</p>
<h3>Your body as a role-playing computer game</h3>
<p>This last of self-care metaphors requires you to think of your life as a computer game.</p>
