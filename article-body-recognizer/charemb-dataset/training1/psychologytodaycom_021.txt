<a>sexual</a> characteristics that develop in a person. Female (XX) mammals inherit one X chromosome from each parent, but males (XY) receive an X from their mother and a Y sex chromosome from their father.
<h2> Sex Differences and Fetal Development </h2>
<a>aggression</a>, there are myriad differences between men and women beyond simply their
<a>sexual</a> organs. This is known as sexual dimorphism and is found in most species.
<div> <h3> Can I choose my baby’s gender? </h3> </div>
<a>gender</a>—for a price. It’s possible to separate X and Y-sperms by flow sorting with some degree of accuracy. In the future,
<a>fertilization may not be so random after all,</a> but while pre-selection may be important to prevent certain life-threatening, inherited conditions, it involves a slippery ethical slope that requires further investigating.
<div> <h3> What is X chromosome expression? </h3> </div>
<a>inherited one X chromosome,</a> it is sure to be expressed.

<div> <h3> Are sex differences in behavior real? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some physical sex differences? </h3> </div>
<a>The truth about sex differences</a> is that they affect everyone in varying ways and degrees; however, there are some commonalities. For example, males tend to be stronger, bigger, and have deeper voices. They also enter
<a>puberty</a> later than females do and often die younger.

<div> <h3> What is the difference between biological sex and gender? </h3> </div>
<a>mismatch between the sex a person is assigned at birth and the gender</a> they feel inside.
<div> <h3> What is intersex? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Most people are born with either male or female sex organs. In rare cases, individuals may be born with ambiguous sex organs, falling under the category of “intersex.”</p> </div> </div>

<h2> Understanding Sex-Linked Diseases </h2>
<a>autism</a>, may be up-regulated or down-regulated by genes found on the X chromosome.
<div> <h3> What is genomic imprinting? </h3> </div>
<a>Christopher Badcock</a> and Bernard Crespi hypothesizes that imprinting contributes to a range of
<a>psychiatric</a> and neurological afflictions, most commonly autism spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
<div> <h3> Why would maternal and paternal genes "compete?" </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are women at greater risk of many mental illnesses than men are? </h3> </div>
<a>on female mental health.</a> It tends to be overexpressed in the genes of females who have
<a>bipolar disorder</a> or major
<a>depression</a>. The down-regulation of X genes, on the other hand, can be a predictor of autism spectrum disorders, especially
<a>Asperger</a>’s syndrome. Learning how to reverse some of this abnormal expression of X genes could help treat psychiatric disorders in women.
<div> <h3> What causes autism spectrum disorders, according to the imprinted brain theory? </h3> </div>
<a>psychosis</a>. The normal brain falls somewhere between the two extremes, ensuring that the child exhibits
<a>neither autism nor psychosis.</a>
<div> <h3> What is XYY syndrome? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is Klinefelter syndrome? </h3> </div>
<a>Also known as XXY syndrome,</a> this rare condition occurs when male babies are born with an extra X chromosome. These individuals tend to have smaller genitalia, extreme
<a>shyness</a>, speech delay, learning disabilities, and dyslexia. However, there are few other obvious signs of XXY syndrome.
<div> <h3> What is Angelman syndrome? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Angelman syndrome is caused by an over-expression of paternal <a>imprinted genes</a> and an under-expression of maternal ones on chromosome 15. Children with this genetic disorder tend to be more <a>hyperactive</a> and sleepless.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> What is Prader-Willi syndrome? </h3> </div>
<p>This genetic disorder occurs when part of chromosome 15 passed down by the father gets deleted. At the same time, the maternal <a>imprinted genes</a> are overexpressed. A child with Prader-Willi is likely to be more <a>sleepy</a> and inactive.</p>

<h2> <a>Intersex: Life in the Overlap Zone</a> </h2>
<p><a>Robert D. Martin Ph.D.</a> on September 24, 2019 in <a>How We Do It</a></p>
<p> Male/female distinctions overlap in an intersex zone. Some intersex people have atypical sets of sex chromosomes, but most have gene variants on other chromosomes. </p>
<h2> <a>No Substitute for Sex</a> </h2>
<p><a>Robert D. Martin Ph.D.</a> on August 20, 2019 in <a>How We Do It</a></p>
<p> Increasing use of “gender” as an alternative to “sex,” notably in the humanities, is inappropriate. In essence, sex is biological while gender is cultural. </p>
