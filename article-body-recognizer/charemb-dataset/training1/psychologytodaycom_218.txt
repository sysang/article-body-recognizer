<h1> What's the Point of Sexual Regrets? </h1>
<h2> Do romantic regrets have functional value? </h2>
<li>People tend to regret specific actions in the short term and missed opportunities in the long term.</li>
<li>Reflecting on regrets can be valuable for self-knowledge but doesn't generally change people's behavior moving forward.</li>
<li>The abundance of romantic opportunities today sometimes leads people to feel regretful and not enjoy the present.</li>
<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both…Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.” —Robert Frost</p>
<p>“The greatest regret in my life is that I slept with so many strangers. One night stands are always so sh*t and yet I always f*cking do it.” —Jane</p>
<p>“The greatest regret of my life is that I should have had more sex before sticking with one guy.” — Janet</p>
<p>Our love lives are full of romantic regrets, ranging from our choices of unsuitable partners to missed opportunities to establish a quality romantic bond. Do such regrets have a functional value and should we pursue them?</p>
<a>gender</a> differences have decreased in our era.
<h3>What is the biggest regret in your life?</h3>
<p>When women were asked, “What is the biggest regret in your life?”, they vividly regretted actions they mistakenly took and actions they missed:</p>
<p>“I divorced the father of my children.”</p>
<p>“Getting married when I had stronger feelings for someone else.”</p>
<p>“I regret that I got married too early, I divorced too soon, I married an unsuitable man, I did not divorce this man when I wanted to, and most men I dated were unsuitable for me.”</p>
<p>“Getting into a relationship with someone I did not have romantic feelings for because I was <a>lonely</a> and in a difficult place emotionally. I will never, ever, EVER do that again.”</p>
<p>“I love my boyfriend and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. However, I regret not <a>dating</a> or <a>sleeping</a> around more before getting into a committed relationship.”</p>
<p>“Staying with a guy who showered once a week and always smelled nasty.”</p>
<p>“Being too <a>shy</a>.”</p>
<p>“Not meeting my lover before.”</p>
<p>“I did not continue a relationship with a man who loved me very much (I was not sexually attracted to him).”</p>
<p>“I only regret that I married my husband when he annoys me.”</p>
<p>“I was with a stingy man for far too long.”</p>
<p>“Chasing after a guy that obviously didn't want me and treated me like sh*t.”</p>
<p>“I had two relationships where I dragged them out even though I knew I wanted out of them; I saw red flags but still tried to make it work.”</p>
<p>“Not being selfish enough; not speaking up for my needs.”</p>
<p>“I did not invest enough effort in finding someone suitable.”</p>
<p>“I was too obedient to my parents and did not continue relationships that I had just started that they didn’t approve of.”</p>
<h3>Do we all have regrets?</h3>
<p>“Regrets, I had a few, but then again, too few to mention.... I did it my way.” —Frank Sinatra</p>
<p>“No, I regret nothing, Not the good that has been given, Not the bad, it's all the same to me. It is payed, done, forgotten. I don't care about the past.” —Edith Piaf</p>
<p>“I have no romantic regrets, as I always dated women who were wrong for me.” —Noam</p>
<a>happiness</a> and in this sense, Jonathan was right not to marry this woman. However, his regret is based on the possibility of love changing—love can develop or vanish with time. In both cases, money can help.
<h3>Do regrets have a functional value?</h3>
<p>"Never yield to remorse, but at once tell yourself: remorse would simply mean adding to the first act of stupidity a second.” —Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<p>“Have regrets made me a wiser woman, or lessened the chances of making future mistakes? I wish I could say so. However, I need to practice a bit of self-compassion rather than muddle in <a>shame</a>.” —Omer</p>
<a>divorcing</a> those whom they married at a young age. A relative of mine divorced, remarried, and at the age 70 divorced again and remarried his first wife, who divorced her then partner for him as well.” —Nathan
<a>sexual</a> regrets has shown that people who regret casual sex do not necessarily stop having such sex in the following four months. Regret is valuable for self-knowledge, but its impact on behavior is limited (Kennair et al., 2021; see also Ludden
<a>Studies </a>on happiness indicate that moderate singular life events tend to affect happiness in the short term, but people often adapt to change. In the case of divorce, satisfaction with life first drops, then rises and stays high. And in the case of
<a>marriage</a>, life satisfaction builds up before, and fades out after the wedding. Adaptation is an important feature of well-being.

<li>Sensitivity is important for romantic relationships, but limited indifference is also valuable.</li>
<li>Limited indifference is a rational behavior, taking into account a person's priorities.</li>
<li>People can't always change a partner’s irritating behaviors, so it can help to be less sensitive to every bothersome characteristic.</li>

<p>“When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me, Speaking words of <a>wisdom</a>, Let it be." —The Beatles</p>
<p>“We also often add to our pain and suffering by being overly sensitive, over-reacting to minor things, and sometimes taking things too personally.” —Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama</p>
<p>“Do not give in too much to feelings. An overly sensitive heart is an unhappy possession on this shaky earth.” —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>
<a>happiness</a>, is more intense.
<h3>Between Sensitivity and Indifference</h3>
<p>“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.” —Elie Wiesel</p>

<p>“Tolerance is another word for indifference.” —W. Somerset Maugham</p>

<h3>Do You Take Your Lover for Granted?</h3>

<p>“My partner has a hot tempter; I am craving a little indifference from him.” —Julia</p>
<a>Marriage</a> counselors have a favorite line: Do not take your partner for granted! There is certainly much wisdom in this advice, especially when it involves romantic intensity. Change and some uncertainty can indeed fan the flames of a dying romance.

<h1> Does Imagination Enhance Romantic Relationships? </h1>
<h2> The value of idealization and sexual fantasies in enduring relationships. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Sexual fantasies can be beneficial to romantic relationships by creating novelty and sexual arousal without the need to change one’s partner.</li>
<li>Lovers also tend to idealize their partners, which is linked to a decreased risk of separation, higher satisfaction, and less conflict.</li>
<li>Idealizing a partner can lead people to overlook negative traits, however. Moderate idealization is best for satisfying relationships.</li>

<h3>Types of romantic imagination</h3>
<p>"Let us leave pretty women to men with no imagination." —Marcel Proust</p>
<p>“What we need most, is not so much to realize the ideal as to idealize the real.” —Francis Herbert Hedge</p>
<p>We may discern between two major types of romantic imagination: <a>sexual</a> fantasies and idealization. In sexual fantasies, we know that the imaginary content is unreal, and in idealization, we typically do not know it (Ben-Ze’ev, 2000).</p>
<p>“All fantasy should have a solid base in reality.” —Max Beerbohm</p>
<p>Like other emotions, sexual desire is generated by change and novelty. Fantasies generate sexual arousal – creating a change and novelty without the need to change one’s partner.</p>
<h3>Idealization and positive illusions</h3>
<p>“Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations." —Leo Buscaglia</p>
<p>“You love another person not because of his virtues — that is infatuation — but in spite of his faults. [...] Love has no place for idealization.” —Sudhir Kakar</p>
<a>romantic relationships</a>, we need more than just fantasies. We need continuous enhancement of our positive evaluation of the partner and in this sense, idealization is crucial. Lovers often idealize rather than realistically evaluate their partners.

<h1> Living in the Shadow of Your Resume or Eulogy </h1>
<h2> The best methods of choosing a romantic partner. </h2>
<li>Resumes, which are based on achievements, and eulogies, which most often refer to one’s kindness, are important for evaluating one’s worth.</li>
<li>Resumes are more common, and often the major tool in academia and business.</li>
<li>The information in eulogies is more important when choosing a romantic partner.</li>
<blockquote> <p>“Every man’s life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.” —Ernest Hemingway</p> </blockquote>
<p>When we analyze or assess a potential partner, it is possible to categorize them according to one of two groups: (a) characteristics described in their resume, and (b) those mentioned in their future eulogy. But which one matters more in love?</p>
<p>“Let us so live that when we come to die, even the undertaker will be sorry.” —Mark Twain</p>
<p>“A friend of mine stopped smoking, drinking, overeating, and chasing women—all at the same time. It was a lovely funeral.” —Unknown</p>
<a>sense of humor</a>. A eulogy focuses on the good you did for others, rather than your success as a result of competing with them. These traits are not easily quantified.
<h3>Should We Have a Ready-Made Eulogy?</h3>
<blockquote> <p>“Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints on your heart.” —Eleanor Roosevelt</p> </blockquote>
<h3>Which Traits Are More Important in Romantic Love?</h3>
<blockquote> <p>“I want a man who is kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?” —Zsa Zsa Gabor</p> </blockquote>
<a>Romantic relationships</a> benefit from non-relational traits in a kind of backhanded way; they offer better circumstances in which to enhance relational traits—and, therefore, a couple’s connection (Ben-Ze’ev, 2019).
<blockquote> <p>“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” —Maya Angelou</p> </blockquote>
<p>It seems that the characteristics mentioned in a eulogy, which focus on doing good to others, are ultimately more important for conducting a meaningful, happy life. So why are they not more central for us, while we are still alive?</p>

<h1> So, You Want to Impress Her? Make Her Laugh </h1>
<h2> The importance of humor in romantic relationships. </h2>
<li>Humor and sexiness tend to be more romantically attractive than wisdom and beauty.</li>
<li>Men tend to look for a partner who appreciates their sense of humor, while women tend to look for a man who can make them laugh. </li>
<li>Humor and laughter, when shared by both partners, is more likely to generate an optimal bond. </li>

<h3>Gender differences in humor</h3>

<li>There is value in enduring, profound love, but recent studies suggest that casual sexual relationships can also provide benefits.</li>
<li>Variety, spontaneity, and a change of perspective are crucial to a rich life, and social contact with strangers enhances well-being.</li>
<li>People view their casual sexual relationships and experiences more positively than negatively, according to research.</li>

<p>“I need more sex, OK? Before I die I wanna taste everyone in the world.” —Angelina Jolie</p>
<p>“My <a>marriage</a> is pretty great. But I think about other guys all the time.” —A married woman</p>
<a>sexual</a> encounters more positively than negatively. Do these studies imply the advantage of casual sex over enduring love?

<a>romantic relationship</a> to flourish. Profundity involves certain types of activities that evolve over time and as a result, is absent in casual sex (Ben-Ze’ev, 2019).
<h3>Richness in a good life</h3>
<p>“Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go it’s pretty damn good.” —Woody Allen</p>

<p>“Good girls go to heaven; bad girls go everywhere.” —Mae West</p>
<p>If we are to apply these claims to the romantic realm, it seems that casual sexual relationships, rather than enduring profound love, have the above advantages that strangers can provide.</p>

<h1> Is Ambivalence Beneficial When Choosing a Romantic Partner? </h1>
<h2> Combining decisiveness and hesitancy in romantic choices. </h2>
<li>People with a high propensity for ambivalence are less prone to prejudice and see more complexity and diversity in the world. </li>
<li>Love at first sight is wonderful but not a sufficient starting point for a relationship.</li>
<li>An optimal selection should focus on a small number of significant positive and negative traits to which a person gives great weight.</li>
<p>“I’m not indecisive. I get excited too quickly and therefore make mistakes. I had no hesitation in marrying my two husbands from whom I happily divorced.” —Emily</p>
<p>“When I got married, I did not know my true market value. Now I am married and have wrinkles, and it is too late.” —Rebecca </p>

<a>decision-making</a> process, while great hesitation is associated with tension, worries,
<a>procrastination</a>, and a constant feeling of discomfort. Nevertheless, an inability to decide due to chronic hesitation is rightly perceived as a mental disorder (Schneider et al., 2021).

<a>sexual</a> element without getting rid of it outright, refusing to
<a>conform</a> to any standard, being able to delay satisfaction, and not offering total satisfaction (Ben-Ze’ev Goussinsky, 2008).
<p>On the nature of ambivalence, a divorcee wrote:</p>
<h3>Ambivalence in Choosing a Partner</h3>
<p>“You’re window shopping . . . You’re not buying, you’re just trying.” —Hank Williams</p>
<p>“I do not like ambivalence. It creates uncertainty and insecurity.” — Gaia</p>
<a>generosity</a> (Ben-Ze’ev, 2019).
<h3>Deal-Makers and Deal-Breakers</h3>
<p>“Ambivalence is a wonderful tune to dance to. It has a rhythm all its own.” —Erica Jong</p>
<p>Romantic life is certainly not a fairy tale; some even say that there is no happy love. However, without realizing the complex ambivalence of the romantic environment, our romantic choices are likely to be problematic and painful.</p>

<h1> The Seductive Power of a Sexy Voice </h1>
<h2> ... especially if it's saying the right things. </h2>
<li>Sexy voices have a greater impact on attraction than physical appearance.</li>
<li>People rated the voices of strangers who had a history of cheating as more likely to cheat.</li>
<li>Men and women with sexy voices are more likely to be sexually unfaithful.</li>

<p>“The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love.” —Jean de la Bruyere</p>

<p>What is the role of seeing and hearing in generating sexual <a>attraction</a>? And what is the most seductive part of the body?</p>
<h3>Seeing and hearing in love</h3>
<p>“An attractive face is more important than a sexy voice since attraction to what we see is greater than to what we hear.” —Grace</p>
<p>"Of course I liked you, but then you opened your mouth." —A woman to a man on their first date</p>
<h3>Why is a sexy voice attractive?</h3>
<a>Madeleine Fugère</a> brings into focus studies that imply women find lower-pitched voices more masculine and attractive. Men’s deeper voices are associated with higher levels of
<h3>Comparing a sexy voice to a pretty face</h3>
<p>"A pretty face may be enough to catch a man, but it takes character and good nature to hold him.”—Thomas More</p>
<h3>The meaningful look of love: “I can see the love in your eyes”</h3>
<p>“The sexiest part of the body is the eyes.” —Clive Owen</p>
<p>So far, I have compared the value of nonverbal aspects of voices and faces taken as a means of sexual communication. Now, I briefly discuss the content of it.</p>
<a>nonverbal communication</a>, facial expressions may alter plain faces, particularly those of the eyes, giving faces a greater impact upon attraction.
<p>Both voices and faces are a valuable means of communicating sexual desire or love. However, the eyes are by far, the most enticing.</p>

<h1> Is Rebound Sex Really So Bad? </h1>
<h2> The pros may outweigh the cons, with one major exception. </h2>

<li>Studies indicate that the benefits of rebound sex are usually greater than the damage it causes.</li>
<li>Unlike rebound sex, revenge sex is almost always harmful.</li>
<li>Dating a new person may help people to reaffirm their self-esteem and provide validation that they are attractive and worthy of love.</li>
<li>The advice to go back to the stormy romantic arena after separation is usually better than the advice to wait till the storm is over.</li>
<blockquote> <p>“In the middle of my miserable break-up, rebound <a>sex</a> was exactly the breath of fresh air I needed.” --Alex</p> </blockquote>
<h3>Why Could Rebound Sex Be Damaging?</h3>
<a>revenge</a> on, our ex. In this context, rebound sex is done for the wrong reasons and can be destructive.
<a>jealous</a>; you have frequent sex; the end of their former relationship was a shock to them; their interest in you runs hot and cold; you feel like you're constantly being evaluated; they very much like your
<a>attention</a>, while being completely un-attuned to you; you are in an on and off relationship with them; their behavior repeatedly lowers your
<a>here</a>). These problematic characteristics indeed express the damaging nature of relationships on the rebound.
<h3>Why is Rebound Sex Often So Good?</h3>
<blockquote> <p>“Casual sex doesn’t have to leave you feeling filthy. It can make you feel <a>optimistic</a> about your romantic possibilities with other people." —Tara Galeano</p> </blockquote>
<a>Dating</a> a new person may help them to reaffirm their self-esteem and provide validation that they are attractive and worthy of love and attention from others. Brumbaugh and Fraley further claim that the amount of time between a
<a>divorce</a> (or other serious breakups) and a person’s next serious relationship does not have any effect on the quality of the next relationship, or on the time of its dissolution.
<a>Alaburda</a> indicates further benefits of such sex: it takes your mind off the heartbreak; you break the spell your ex has over you; you suddenly realize there are other fish in the sea; and you finally get well-deserved closure.
<h3>Is Revenge Sex Healthy?</h3>
<blockquote> <p>“The best revenge, like the best sex, is performed slowly, and with the eyes open.” — Gregory David Roberts</p> </blockquote>
<p>“Sex revenge was the most fun I had. After my boyfriend of three years dumped me, I wasn’t looking for anything serious. I wanted to just let go. My post-breakup fling was therapeutic and helped me move on.” —Shalaka</p>
<p>Revenge sex is having sex with someone in order to “get back at” someone else—usually, the one who dumped you. Revenge sex is intended to be destructive toward a current or former partner.</p>

<li>Profound lovers are both patient and impatient, as profound love involves both the excitement of sexual desire and the calmness of friendship.</li>
<li>Both types of sex—impatient, wild and brief, and patient, prolonged and tender—are valuable.</li>
<li>Today, timing, which is an instantaneous point in time, has become more important than time, in which long-term processes take place. </li>
<p>“Perhaps there is only one cardinal sin: impatience. Because of impatience we were driven out of Paradise; because of impatience we cannot return.” —W. H. Auden</p>
<p>“Patience has its limits. Take it too far, and it is cowardice.” —George Jackson</p>
<p><a>Romantic love</a> is often described as both patient and impatient. Does this paradoxical description make sense?</p>

<a>sexual</a> desire, is central. This heart is sentimentally true, but wishes to escape the moment sexual satisfaction is achieved. The other heart, in which
<a>friendship</a> is central, endures patiently and compassionately whatever may come.
<h3>Romantic love, sex and friendship</h3>
<p>“Love is a friendship set to music.” —Joseph Campbell</p>
<p>“Patience is not sitting and waiting, it is foreseeing. It is looking at the thorn and seeing the rose, looking at the night and seeing the day. Lovers are patient and know that the moon needs time to become full.” —Rumi</p>
<a>procrastination</a>, which is the needless delay of tasks one intends to do.

<a>happiness</a> is positively associated with the length of the courtship period.
<h3>The impatient nature of modern culture</h3>
<p>“Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.” —Soren Kierkegaard</p>

<p>“Don’t rush into love, because even in fairytales, the happy ending takes place on the last page.” —Unknown</p>
<a>Orgasm</a>—or any other satisfaction—can be achieved quickly, but romantic profundity takes time and patience.

<li>For some people, robots may be helpful in the romantic realm and may subvert some traditional assumptions about love and monogamy.</li>

<p>Sex toys, sex dolls, and sex robots</p>
<p>"There are a number of mechanical devices which increase <a>sexual</a> arousal, particularly in women. Chief among these is the Mercedes-Benz 380SL convertible."—P. J. O'Rourke</p>
