<a>Prince Andrew</a> and former U.S. Presidents
<a>Epstein</a>. But the duke has denied any wrongdoing, and his attorneys have
<a>tried to get her lawsuit dismissed.</a>
<p>In response to Maxwell's conviction, Giuffre said, "I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be."</p>
<p>Other high-profile figures like Trump and Clinton have been <a>accused of traveling on Epstein's private plane</a>, though they too have denied any wrongdoing. But testimony in her trial could have possibly implicated them and others.</p>
<p>"Technically the conviction of Maxwell can't be used in court against any other person," Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, told Newsweek.</p>
<p>Plus, just because one jury found Maxwell guilty, he added, doesn't mean another jury would have done the same.</p>
<p>Gene Rossi, a former career federal prosecutor, told Newsweek that he doubts her conviction will endanger Prince Andrew either.</p>
<p>"There's absolutely no way that Prince Andrew is going to be charged," Rossi said. "Prosecutors, even the most aggressive ones, have some sense of proportion. It would be a suicide mission if a prosecutor were to indict."</p>
<p>Presently, Rossi said, the criminal evidence against Prince Andrew appears to be "relatively weak." The lack of evidence would present a nearly insurmountable hurdle for getting charges pressed against him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rossi thinks that if U.S. prosecutors were going to charge any other individuals connected to Epstein, they would have done so by now.</p>
<p>"Just because evidence came out at trial that implicates other people does not necessarily mean that they're ready to charge those other people," he said.</p>
<p>He also said it's rare that federal prosecutors will accept the help of people who have just been convicted in a trial. More commonly, he said, prosecutors will try to offer such plea deals and offers of cooperation to defendants before a trial.</p>
<p>However, attorney Nick Akerman disagrees.</p>
<p>Since Maxwell will soon face sentencing, possibly spending the rest of her years in prison, offering incriminating evidence against other Epstein associates could convince prosecutors to ask the judge for a more lenient sentence.</p>
<p>The challenge, Akerman said, would be whether investigators could corroborate her testimony, something that could prove challenging considering that her lead collaborator, <a>Epstein, died in August 2019</a>.</p>
<p>He believes prosecutors likely have lots of unanswered questions about what else Maxwell might know and who else might be involved in her and Epstein's exploits.</p>
<p>Former federal prosecutor, Michael Stern told Newsweek that Maxwell's conviction could increase the likelihood of prosecutors charging others, "especially if there is an overlap in witnesses."</p>
<p>"When the jury convicted Maxwell, it signaled to prosecutors that their witnesses were credible and in sexual assault cases, the verdict often relies heavily on the credibility of the victims," Stern said.</p>
<p>He added that it's difficult to know, ultimately, why Maxwell has yet to strike a deal with prosecutors. Reports have neither indicated that she sought a deal nor was offered one.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 60, was found guilty on five of six charges related to conspiracy and sex trafficking for deceased financier <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>Maxwell now faces up to 65 years in prison for her crimes.</p>
<p>Most visible throughout the trial were Maxwell's siblings, at least three of whom have spoken out about the case at one point or another.</p>
<p>The family has long claimed that Maxwell was subject to unfair treatment while in custody, and even sent the Justice Department a letter "urging Attorney Garland to intervene immediately today to grant the simple, fair and just remedies requested."</p>
<p>A number of these siblings have also been involved in criminal court proceedings of their own.</p>
<p>One of Maxwell's most vocal supporters was her brother Ian, 65. A former newspaper and publishing mogul, Ian Maxwell was arrested, charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, along with a number of other associates.</p>
<p>He was acquitted of these charges in court, however, and later started an anti-terrorism think tank with his brother Kevin Maxwell.</p>
<p>In a video on the support website, Ian Maxwell can be seen talking about his sister, once again stating that she was innocent of the charges.</p>
<p>He also told reporters that the media coverage of his sister would "poison" the jury in the lead-up to the verdict.</p>
<p>Maxwell's youngest living brother, Kevin, 63, was reportedly one of the major creators behind his sister's support website.</p>
<p>Despite his personal struggles, though, Kevin Maxwell was seen by his sister's side throughout her trial. At the beginning of December, he told reporters that being around his sister gave him "a tremendous sense of relief."</p>
<p>It was reportedly the first time that he had seen his sister in over a year.</p>
<p>Kevin Maxwell added that Ghislaine Maxwell was "looking pretty well, notwithstanding the conditions of detention."</p>
<p>Another one of Ghislaine Maxwell's ardent supporters was her sister Isabel, 71.</p>
<p>A serial entrepreneur and founder of one of the earliest search engines, Isabel Maxwell worked as a consultant for a variety of companies during her career.</p>
<p>Despite the guilty outcome, Maxwell's family said in a joint statement that they still believed that she was innocent, despite evidence to the contrary, adding that they had already begun the process of appealing the verdict.</p>
<p>"We believe firmly in our sister's innocence; we are very disappointed with the verdict," the Maxwell family said. "We have already started the appeal tonight and we believe she will ultimately be vindicated."</p>
<p>However, most legal experts believe that Maxwell will do considerable time despite the appeal, and one former prosecutor, Gene Rossi, told Newsweek that those who lose in federal court are rarely given the "luxury" of a plea bargain.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Rare Zoo Tiger Shot Dead to Thwart Attack on Man Who Was Petting or Feeding It, Police Say</h1><div> By Justin Klawans <time>On 12/30/21 at 12:24 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>A Florida sheriff's deputy was forced to shoot and kill a zoo tiger on Wednesday after the animal grabbed a man who was reportedly attempting to pet or feed the rare feline, police said.</p>
<p>The cleaning company that the man worked for was only responsible for cleaning the zoo's bathroom facilities and gift shop, and its crew members were not authorized to enter any animal enclosures.</p>
<p>After a number of unsuccessful attempts to free the cleaning man from the tiger's grasp, a sheriff's deputy was forced to shoot the tiger to get him to retreat. It is unclear how many rounds the deputy fired.</p>
<p>Upon being pulled away from the tiger, the man was medevaced to a nearby hospital with reportedly serious injuries. A spokesperson for Lee Health Systems stated, "I can only confirm that we are treating someone who was attacked by a tiger."</p>
<p>The tiger, meanwhile, reportedly fled to the back of his enclosure after being shot. Law enforcement officials flew a drone in to observe the feline, but found that he would not respond.</p>
<p>Sheriff's deputies only stated that a veterinarian had sedated the tiger and would approach him for an examination when it was deemed safe.</p>
<p>However, zoo officials confirmed late Wednesday evening that Eko had died from the gunshot wound.</p>
<p>The Sheriff's Department added that the public was never in danger, and the Naples Daily News reported that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers had also responded to the incident.</p>
<p>The big cat involved, Eko, the Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens' only tiger, and was reportedly sent to Florida from the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in 2019, according to zoo officials. </p>
<p>Eko was also a member of a subspecies, the Malayan tiger, that is rapidly disappearing and critically endangered.</p>
<p>As their name suggests, wild Malayan tigers only live on the southern tip of Thailand in the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to the Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens for comment.</p>

<p>Every year shoppers look forward to Dillard's New Year's Day sale, which has been dubbed the department store chain's biggest sale. The annual sale offers <a>an additional discount on items whose prices have already been reduced.</a></p>
<p>However, several <a>users on social media have questioned</a> whether the <a>sale event</a> is taking place in 2022.</p>
<h2>Is Dillard's New Year's Day Sale Happening in 2022?</h2>
<p>According to a note from the official <a>Twitter</a> account of Dillard's, the company's New Year's Day sale is not taking place in January.</p>
<p>Dillard's confirmed the news in a reply to a tweet by KUTV 2News anchor/reporter Jamie McGriff asking about the sale.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Alan Dershowitz Interview on Ghislaine Maxwell Leaves Viewers Outraged: 'Inexcusable'</h1><div> By Darragh Roche <time>On 12/30/21 at 4:28 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<a>Alan Dershowitz</a> as a commentator on the conviction of
<a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a> on five out of six counts relating to assisting
<a>Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the sexual abuse of young girls.
<p>Dershowitz appeared on BBC World News following the verdict in Maxwell's case on Wednesday and the U.K. network didn't note the accusations against him by Virginia Giuffre, who has also accused the U.K.'s <a>Prince Andrew</a> of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Giuffre <a>has claimed Epstein and Maxwell lent her out to powerful men</a> for sex, including Dershowitz and the prince. Both men have strongly denied the allegations against them.</p>
<p>During his appearance on the BBC, Dershowitz highlighted the fact that the government didn't call Giuffre as a witness. She is currently suing Dershowitz for defamation and he is countersuing.</p>
<p>"The government did not use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, who accused me, accused many other people because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth," Dershowitz said.</p>
<p>Dershowitz also said the Maxwell case "weakens the case against Prince Andrew considerably because the government was very selective in who it used."</p>
<p>Some social media users reacted with surprise and anger to Dershowitz's appearance on the BBC, and there was strong criticism of the TV network for the decision.</p>
<p>The BBC Press Office issued a statement to Newsweek on Thursday about Dershowitz' appearance.</p>
<a>witness they need on the Maxwell trial</a> is Alan Dershowitz. Who has taken the opportunity to say that it shows how accusations against him and Prince Andrew are wrong."
<p>"I couldn't believe it - totally inexcusable," former London mayoral candidate Siobhan Benita tweeted in response to Churchwell's comment.</p>
<p>British member of parliament Nadia Whittome tweeted: "Alan Dershowitz, who was accused of the same crimes as Prince Andrew, is on the BBC trying to <a>silence victims following Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction</a>."</p>
<p>"I can't believe this needs to be said but the BBC should not give a platform to people accused of child sexual abuse," Whittome said.</p>
<p>Dershowitz also appeared on <a>Fox News</a> to discuss the Maxwell case but as journalist Aaron Rupar pointed out on <a>Twitter</a>, the network mentioned Dershowitz's connection to Epstein.</p>
<p>Retweeting Gallagher, Rupar wrote: "Fox News at least acknowledged Dershowitz's connections with Epstein. Unfathomable that the BBC thought this was a good idea."</p>
<p>Newsweek has asked Alan Dershowitz for comment.</p>
<p>UPDATE 12/30/21 6:13 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include a statement from the BBC Press Office.</p>

<p>Federal holidays see many government offices shut for the day, while some private businesses may also be closed.</p>
<p>There are currently 12 permanent federal holidays in the U.S., according to the Congressional Research Service of the U.S. <a>Congress</a>. But does this include New Year's Eve?</p>
<h2>Is New Year's Eve a Federal Holiday?</h2>
<p>New Year's Eve (December 31) is not a federal holiday, while New Year's Day (January 1) is.</p>
<p>However, in 2022, January 1 falls on a Saturday. "If the holiday falls during the weekend, the government may observe it on a different day," says USA.gov.</p>
<p>When a holiday lands on a Saturday, it is generally observed on the Friday before it (while if it lands on a Sunday, it's usually observed on the Monday after it).</p>
<p>This means New Year's Day 2022 is observed on December 31, 2021.</p>
<h2>Do I Get New Year's Eve Off?</h2>
<p>Since New Year's Day 2022 is observed on December 31 this year, many people (including many federal workers) will get the day off in observance of the New Year's Day federal holiday.</p>
<h2>What Federal Holidays Are There in the U.S.?</h2>
<li>New Year's Day: January 1</li>
<li>Inauguration Day: January 20 (<a>a designated federal holiday for federal employees in Washington, D.C. and some parts of its surrounding areas</a>).</li>
<li>Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.: The third Monday in January</li>
<li>George Washington's Birthday (<a>also known as Presidents Day</a>): The third Monday in February</li>
<li>Memorial Day: The last Monday in May</li>
<li>Independence Day: July 4</li>
<li>Labor Day: The first Monday in September</li>
<li>Columbus Day: The second Monday in October</li>
<li>Veterans Day: November 11</li>
<li>Thanksgiving Day: The fourth Thursday in November</li>
<li>Christmas Day: December 25</li>
<h2>How Did Federal Holidays Begin?</h2>
<p>In 1880, Washington's Birthday was included among federal holidays. By 1885, Congress extended holiday coverage for some holidays to all federal workers, the Congressional Research Service explains.</p>
<p>Seven federal holidays have been added by Congress since 1888, including Juneteenth in 2021.</p>
<p>The Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968 was passed to "provide for uniform annual observances" of Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day.</p>
<p>The Monday Holiday Law established Columbus Day as the second Monday in October and in 1975, Veterans Day was designated by Congress to be observed on November 11, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>

<p>Ghislaine Maxwell says she had to give up showering because prison guards would watch her, in a newspaper interview as her Jeffrey Epstein-related trial nears.</p>
<p>The British socialite told the Mail on Sunday how a "friendly rat" visited her in her jail cell after a sewer was left uncovered.</p>
<p>She complained of rotting food, including an apple with maggots in, after repeated applications for bail were declined by Judge Alison Nathan.</p>
<p>Maxwell's trial is drawing near with jury selection due to take place tomorrow, November 16, 2021.</p>
<p>Epstein's former lover told the U.K. newspaper: "I used to go to the loo with an open sewer drain and a friendly rat would regularly visit.</p>
<p>"I told the guards, but nothing was done until the rat popped out and charged a guard who screamed in terror.</p>
<p>"Finally, the sewer drain was covered."</p>
<p>Epstein's former lover told the newspaper: "I used to take a shower every day but I've stopped because of the creepy guards who stand close and stare at me the whole time."</p>
<p>A $28.5 million dollar bail package was rejected in December 2020 and her previous offers also included paying for a private security company to keep her under armed guard.</p>
<p>However, the court has four times ruled Maxwell should not be released on bail because she poses a flight risk.</p>
<p>Maxwell's lawyers have also complained about the significant negative media attention the Epstein story has garnered, suggesting she may not get a fair trial.</p>
<p>She told the newspaper: "I'm terrified the overwhelmingly negative coverage will poison my jury pool and affect the outcome of my trial, despite the evidence which I feel confident will prove my innocence.</p>
<p>"I look forward to having my day in court to prove I played no part in Epstein's crimes. I am innocent."</p>
<p>The <a>FBI</a> arrested Maxwell in July last year at a house in New Hampshire and ever since she has been at the Metropolitan Detention Center, in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Lawyers have complained on her behalf that the water in the taps sometimes comes out brown and accused the guards of sexual assault, which the prison denied.</p>
<p>A February letter from Maxwell's lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim read: "Recently, out of view of the security camera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat-down search."</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Audrey Strauss refuted a raft of Maxwell's allegations, including that she had lost weight and her hair was falling out, in an April filing.</p>
<p>Strauss' letter to the court read: "The defendant is 5' 7", meaning that even her lowest weight of 133 pounds resulted in a BMI of 20.8, which is considered a normal weight for a person of the defendant's height.</p>
<p>"MDC staff have not observed the defendant experience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>"In short, MDC medical staff assess that the defendant is physically healthy."</p>
<p>Maxwell pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and perjury and awaits trial.</p>
