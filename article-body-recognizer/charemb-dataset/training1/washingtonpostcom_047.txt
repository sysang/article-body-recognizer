<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<a>few</a> have been vaccinated, people were less likely — 80 percent lower, according to
<a>one preprint study</a> posted in December 2021 — to be hospitalized for omicron than for other variants. In addition, the Biden administration has ordered

<p>U.S. hospitals continue to reel from surging volumes of <a>coronavirus</a> patients as the omicron variant drives a record-breaking flurry of infections in some regions — with medical workers bracing for more misery in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The New York City health department reported that the seven-day average of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases there has climbed to 17,334 a day, the highest recorded levels of the pandemic, and a roughly tenfold increase from a month ago.</p>
<div><div><p>Louisiana officials reported that the state’s covid-19 hospitalizations have <a>doubled</a> to about 450 patients since last week, with unvaccinated patients accounting for 80 percent of hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Florida, Miami’s Jackson Health System reported that as of Monday morning, 212 people were hospitalized with covid, up from 37 on Nov. 30.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And in Texas, Houston Methodist reported Monday that fast-spreading omicron accounted for 94 percent of its sequenced coronavirus cases, with health system leaders describing unprecedented demand for tests.</p></div></div>
<a>airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights</a> amid a surge in cases among crew members. While many of the cancellations were attributed to weather, the jump in virus cases continued to be a major culprit.
<div><div><p>“We’re going to have your back in any way we can,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Health-care workers responding to the increase<b> </b>in coronavirus cases say the new demands are further straining a health system already frayed from nearly two years of pandemic response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>David J. De La Zerda, intensive care unit medical director at Jackson Memorial Hospital, said the increase in patients at the Miami medical center has happened suddenly, and officials are bracing for difficult weeks ahead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is what we are seeing now that is different than before, and we are down a lot of nurses and physicians who cannot work for five to seven days,” De La Zerda said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>De La Zerda said health-care workers understand much better in this wave how to treat patients. “But the issue now is we don’t have enough personnel to do that,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Miami-Dade County, 57,675 new covid cases total were reported during the past week, up from 12,594 cases in the prior week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although Miami-Dade hospitals are nowhere close to running out of hospital beds, 183 patients were admitted on Sunday alone, a sixfold increase over the number weeks ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly two years into the pandemic, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava (D) said the omicron variant is forcing leaders nationwide to confront the unsettling reality that covid may be here for the foreseeable future.</p></div></div>
<p>“We have conflicting information from the federal government, versus the state government, and how that gets resolved may depend on the courts,” Levine Cava said, warning that residents end up confused about what precautions to take.</p>
<a>alert</a> Friday warning of the “striking increase” in children with coronavirus infections. Pediatric hospitalizations have roughly quadrupled in New York City this month.
<p>“The risks of COVID-19 for children are real,” acting state health commissioner Mary T. Bassett said in a statement. “We must use all available safe and effective infection control, prevention and mitigation strategies.”</p>
<div><div><p>“I hope it turns around as sharply as what we’ve seen in South Africa,” Fauci said, citing the <a>steep decline of omicron cases</a> there after an equally sharp surge of infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As omicron rapidly advances across the United States, public health experts and White House officials are closely looking at major metropolitan areas for clues about the outbreak’s spread and severity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden on Monday participated in a virtual call about the pandemic with 25 governors, on which he acknowledged the testing shortfall Americans are confronting amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After ticking through steps his administration has taken to improve the situation, Biden said that in hindsight, more should have been done to ramp up testing capacity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not enough. It’s clearly not enough. If I had, if we’d known, we would have gone harder, quicker if we could have,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Unfortunately, Omicron decided to play Scrooge and affected airlines at a terrible time,” said Henry Harteveldt, an airline analyst.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Major airlines asked the CDC last week to shorten the time crew members who test positive must spend in isolation, a move that airline unions oppose. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Despite the recent challenges to air travel, there was little indication that travelers were delaying their trips. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened more than 2 million people Sunday, approaching 2019 levels.</p></div>

<div><p>Five things about omicron that I want my friends and family to know</p></div>
<b> </b>and grappling with workers calling in sick. Multiple states have deployed the National Guard to help support stressed hospitals, often by simply managing administrative tasks such as helping deliver food or cleaning dirty rooms.
<div><div><p>The worsening situation has left some doctors fearing that patient care is at risk.</p></div></div>
<a>Omicron appears to cause relatively mild symptoms in many vaccinated people</a>, and while the fast-spreading variant is driving record infections,

<div><div><p>That staff flexibility could be essential given the uncertainties of omicron, said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, who served as chief of infectious disease at Massachusetts General Hospital for the pandemic’s first year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hospital associations called the measure necessary and proactive, given the possibility that hospitalizations will spike as omicron moves through the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But some health-care workers worry that rushing infected colleagues back<b> </b>to their jobs could pose new risks, such as spreading the virus to uninfected workers and patients.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Having people come back sick, I don’t agree with that at all,” said Joannie Yeh, a pediatrician who practices outside Philadelphia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘There’s no more words'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Minnesota, local doctors have painted a grim portrait of the worsening pandemic. Cases this month are setting records. More workers are calling in sick. Even <a>Gov. Tim Walz (D) reported a breakthrough infection</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The state’s hospitals issued a full-page plea in local newspapers on Dec. 12, warning residents that “overwhelmed” facilities couldn’t promise patients timely care.</p></div></div>
<a>Those concerns are echoed in Rhode Island</a>, where hospital leaders are warning of an “
<a>unprecedented crisis</a>” as cases climb amid significant staff shortages. In New York City, health workers say improvements in caring for covid patients matter little if caregivers themselves are spread too thin.
<div><div><p>Some doctors say they are fighting to fend off feelings of hopelessness.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stantz described a recent covid case involving a middle-aged father with respiratory failure who spent weeks in the ICU, hovering between life and death.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He told me that I saved his life. And the weight of that was profound,” Stantz said, adding that she has held on to that moment to spur her on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Still reeling from delta’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>All through December, hospital leaders have nervously eyed the nearly vertical increase in omicron infections, worried they will translate into new admissions when there’s little slack in the system.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I think the concern right now is, are we heading into a period where everyone comes back from their holiday travels with omicron infection?” Cox added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cox and others say they’re looking overseas, to countries such as England where omicron spread earlier,<b> </b>for clues to how the variant disrupted health-care staffing.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected by early next week to authorize booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds, according to two people familiar with the FDA’s plan.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Of course, the CDC will swiftly follow as soon as we hear from them, and I’m hoping to have that in the days to weeks ahead,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday on CNN.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Federal officials, public health experts and a growing number of parents have raised concerns that younger adolescents have been left disproportionately vulnerable to the fast-spreading omicron variant compared with other populations.</p></div>
<div><p>Older teenagers are already eligible for boosters, and younger children have more recently received their initial vaccine doses, which means they probably have retained more immune protection than children who were vaccinated earlier.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The omicron variant also has been linked to a <a>rapid increase in</a> pediatric hospitalizations this month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The FDA’s plan was first reported by the New York Times.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The FDA declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pfizer referred questions about the timing of booster shot authorization to the agency.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden administration officials have urged Americans to get booster shots to raise their immune protection against the omicron variant, which has been shown to evade antibodies conferred by prior infections or months-old vaccinations.</p></div>
<div><div><p>About 45 percent of the population age 18 and older has received a vaccine booster, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients said at a news briefing Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But as the doctors continually emphasize: Everybody who is eligible should go get boosted as soon as possible,” Zients added.</p></div></div>
<a>warned</a> that the fast-spreading omicron variant will challenge the nation’s health system.
<div><div><p>“By the time we could put in place vaccination locations and get kids scheduled, together with delayed improving immunity, [the omicron] surge is likely over,” Osterholm said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Jason Samenow</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Wes Junker</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 12:19 p.m. EST|Updated today at 11:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><b>11:00 p.m. — Upping our snowfall forecast from 1 to 3 to 2 to 4 inches</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After reviewing the afternoon and evening models, the general forecast ideas expressed below generally hold but we have a few fresh thoughts and developments to share:</p></div></div>
<li>Enough of the models show the potential for a heavy overnight burst of snow (Thursday night into Friday morning) that we’re increasing our projected totals from 1 to 3 to 2 to 4 inches.</li>
<li>The onset time for the snow Thursday has shifted slightly later with snow probably moving in between 11 p.m. and a little after midnight.</li>
<li>The likely window for heavy snow along with very difficult travel and low visibility is between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Friday.</li>
<li>The snow should end by around 4 a.m. in the immediate area and 5 a.m. in our eastern suburbs.</li>
<div><div><p>Here is what the latest models are projecting for the District:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>American (GFS): 5.5 to 6 inches</li><li>High-resolution NAM: 4 inches</li><li>HRRR: 3-4 inches</li><li>European: 2.5 inches</li><li>Canadian: 2.5 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>High-resolution Canadian: 2-2.5 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>2:55 p.m. — Winter weather advisory issued for Thursday night into early Friday</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Anticipating Thursday night’s snowfall, the National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for the entire region. The advisory takes effect at 9 p.m. Thursday and continues until 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A winter storm warning is in effect for parts of the Blue Ridge and Appalachian mountains, where up to five to nine inches is possible along with wind gusts to 35 mph.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original article from 12:45 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A fast-moving storm system will sweep through the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Thursday night, probably laying down about one to three inches of snow in the Washington and Baltimore areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s not out of the question that a few areas will see a little more or a little less, but this event will not be nearly as heavy as Monday’s severe snowstorm.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what made Monday’s snowstorm so severe</p></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should start between 8 p.m. Thursday and midnight, and end before sunrise Friday. Because temperatures will fall as it snows, roads are likely to become quite icy, causing delays and cancellations Friday morning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Our snowfall map, showing widespread amounts of one to three inches, represents a blend of the model projections, as it’s too early to know what areas will be hardest hit or just fringed by this system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is a chance of a locally heavy corridor of snowfall that produces up to three to six inches, but it will be Thursday before we have a better idea of where that might set up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Freezing rain snarls Northeast as it awaits another plowable snowfall</p></div>
<div><div><p>The National Weather Service’s snowfall map, pictured below, shows the potential for widespread amounts of two to four inches, which is a little higher than we’re comfortable predicting at this point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Snow timing and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>After midnight, however, temperatures should drop below freezing areawide, causing roads to ice over and become snow-covered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>8 p.m. Thursday to midnight:</b> Light snow develops west to east, possibly starting briefly as rain in southern Maryland. Temperatures: 31-37 (northwest to southeast).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 3 a.m. Friday:</b> Snow, moderate to possibly heavy at times. Peak rates of one inch per hour possible. Temperatures: 28-33 (northwest to southeast).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>3 a.m. to 6 a.m. Friday: </b>Snow tapers off. Temperatures: 24-29 (northwest to southeast).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most areas will see only about four to six hours of snowfall, with the heaviest and steadiest coming around or just after midnight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery overnight. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Discussion</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wednesday morning’s NAM and high-resolution NAM models both suggest one to three inches of snow, with the heaviest amounts north and west of Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest European model is a little heavier, predicting two to four inches of snow areawide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The American (GFS) model also projects two to four inches for most of the area but suggests a narrow stripe of four to six inches south and east of the city, in the same zone walloped by Monday’s storm.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The UKMet and Canadian models forecast a general two to three inches across the region.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Jason Samenow</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 12:36 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 5:48 p.m. EST</div></div>

<div><div><p><b>* </b><a><b>Winter weather advisory</b></a><b> 9 tonight through 7 a.m. Friday *</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Snow set to arrive within about an hour of midnight and end between 4 and 5 a.m.</li>
<li>A brief burst of heavier snow is possible between about 1 and 3 a.m.; roads will become slick as temperatures fall below freezing.</li>
<li>Accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are most probable (see map under “amounts” section below); we expect some school delays and cancellations Friday morning.</li>
<div><div><p><b>5:45 p.m. — Light snow arrives in western Maryland and eastern panhandle of West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be posted around 7:30 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4:10 p.m. — Forecast is on track as snow spreads into West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Radar shows snow falling over most of Kentucky and West Virginia as the storm system sweeps eastward. The snow is still set to arrive in our area between around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., or maybe a little later in our eastern areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Hannah Natanson</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Donna St. George</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Nicole Asbury</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 7:21 p.m. EST</div></div>

<div><div><p>Reports of the demise of snow days have proved an exaggeration.</p></div></div>
<p>As Americans slog and shrug into year three of this global nightmare, amid the onslaught of the omicron variant and facing a battery of boosters, it was the least the adults could do, said Frank Bellavia, spokesman for Arlington Public Schools.</p>
<div><div><p>“We wanted students to have some sense of normalcy,” he said, “which is why the decision to have snow days.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Region’s biggest snowstorm in three years ends, leaving more than 500K customers without power</p></div>
<i>.</i> And in Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools and Prince George’s County Public Schools, the two largest districts in the state.
<div><div><p>For 9-year-old Lucy Kaufholz and 10-year-old Eve Kaufholz, sisters who moved to Virginia from Florida this summer, Monday meant enchantment — and an early start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy woke up before the sun did, because “my brain gets up early on exciting days.”<b> </b>She got up at 5:54 a.m. on Christmas Day, for example. Monday saw her rise exactly three minutes later, at 5:57 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It wasn’t super snowy yet. Still, Lucy, Eve and their parents — Brianne Kaufholz, 40, and Eddie Kaufholz, 41 — bounded outside for a walk, where they discovered they had the entire neighborhood to themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy still cannot believe how much it snowed. At one point, she stuck her ruler into a drift in the front yard — and the snow swallowed it whole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brianne Kaufholz said she is glad Arlington called a traditional snow day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re young enough, they’re going to learn what they need to learn,” Brianne Kaufholz said. “Them experiencing the world on a snow day? That’s more important.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Several D.C.-area school systems will close again Tuesday after the snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>School officials offered similar explanations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bellavia of Arlington noted that his district has built six snow days into its academic calendar this year. Julie Moult, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax school system, said her district has allotted five snow days this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“FCPS believes that traditional snow days provide a memorable and much-loved childhood experience for our students,” Moult said.</p></div></div>
<a>the school system issued on Dec. 10</a>. The district is returning to pre-pandemic-style snow days, with no plan for virtual instruction as an alternative when physical classrooms close.
<div><div><p>“Students participating in learning is important,” he wrote in an email. “The best choice is dependent on the facts driving an operational decision.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Perhaps the most surprising declaration Monday came from Prince George’s County, where children are learning remotely. The district <a>reverted to virtual schooling</a> in mid-December because of rising coronavirus cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the district said three snow days had been built into this year’s school calendar — and officials decided to use one of them Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She gave no reason why a snow day was necessary if children were already attending school online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then again, maybe no reason was needed.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Besides, the quarantine rules are so restrictive that she would almost certainly have to spend the entire break isolated in a hotel room in Shanghai.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So, there’s no point,” He said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At colleges across the country, the coronavirus pandemic has upended holiday plans for international students. Faced with risk, hassle and expense, some decided they would prefer to stay on campus — even a cold and empty one.</p></div>

<div><div><p>At many schools, campus shuts down over break, prompting some students to write petitions and op-eds asking to be allowed to remain in their dorms.</p></div></div>
<p>School officials will<b> </b>also work with students to determine whether they could take a one-semester leave, if necessary, Hotchkiss explained, but most would probably need to take a year off if they could not return for spring 2022 classes.</p>
<div><p>After decades of increases, a drop in the number of international students in the United States</p></div>
<div><div><p>At Georgetown, He’s friends who are international students were all asking one another what they were going to do for the nearly month-long break this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a lot of anxiety and stress,” He said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Kelly He and two other students tackled the issue in class.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kenan Dogan, a junior from Missouri, knew he could easily get home for winter break — and that his partners in the class, He and Shurui Liu, could not.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“The biggest surprise we had as a group was just how much students were willing to pay to remain on campus for a month,” Dogan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Huang ultimately decided to room with a friend during the break, she said, but it was reassuring “to know we have the option to stay, and won’t feel homeless for the break.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He, meanwhile, was delighted: As the break began this week, she said, she and her friends just stayed in their dorm.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s super nice, super good,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>* </b><a><b>Winter weather advisory</b></a><b> 9 tonight through 7 a.m. Friday *</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Snow set to arrive within about an hour of midnight and end between 4 and 5 a.m.</li>
<li>A brief burst of heavier snow is possible between about 1 and 3 a.m.; roads will become slick as temperatures fall below freezing.</li>
<li>Accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are most probable (see map under “amounts” section below); we expect some school delays and cancellations Friday morning.</li>
<div><div><p><b>5:45 p.m. — Light snow arrives in western Maryland and eastern panhandle of West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be posted around 7:30 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4:10 p.m. — Forecast is on track as snow spreads into West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Radar shows snow falling over most of Kentucky and West Virginia as the storm system sweeps eastward. The snow is still set to arrive in our area between around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., or maybe a little later in our eastern areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Reports of the demise of snow days have proved an exaggeration.</p></div></div>
<p>As Americans slog and shrug into year three of this global nightmare, amid the onslaught of the omicron variant and facing a battery of boosters, it was the least the adults could do, said Frank Bellavia, spokesman for Arlington Public Schools.</p>
<div><div><p>“We wanted students to have some sense of normalcy,” he said, “which is why the decision to have snow days.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Region’s biggest snowstorm in three years ends, leaving more than 500K customers without power</p></div>
<i>.</i> And in Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools and Prince George’s County Public Schools, the two largest districts in the state.
<div><div><p>For 9-year-old Lucy Kaufholz and 10-year-old Eve Kaufholz, sisters who moved to Virginia from Florida this summer, Monday meant enchantment — and an early start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy woke up before the sun did, because “my brain gets up early on exciting days.”<b> </b>She got up at 5:54 a.m. on Christmas Day, for example. Monday saw her rise exactly three minutes later, at 5:57 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It wasn’t super snowy yet. Still, Lucy, Eve and their parents — Brianne Kaufholz, 40, and Eddie Kaufholz, 41 — bounded outside for a walk, where they discovered they had the entire neighborhood to themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy still cannot believe how much it snowed. At one point, she stuck her ruler into a drift in the front yard — and the snow swallowed it whole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brianne Kaufholz said she is glad Arlington called a traditional snow day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re young enough, they’re going to learn what they need to learn,” Brianne Kaufholz said. “Them experiencing the world on a snow day? That’s more important.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Several D.C.-area school systems will close again Tuesday after the snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>School officials offered similar explanations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bellavia of Arlington noted that his district has built six snow days into its academic calendar this year. Julie Moult, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax school system, said her district has allotted five snow days this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“FCPS believes that traditional snow days provide a memorable and much-loved childhood experience for our students,” Moult said.</p></div></div>
<a>the school system issued on Dec. 10</a>. The district is returning to pre-pandemic-style snow days, with no plan for virtual instruction as an alternative when physical classrooms close.
<div><div><p>“Students participating in learning is important,” he wrote in an email. “The best choice is dependent on the facts driving an operational decision.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Perhaps the most surprising declaration Monday came from Prince George’s County, where children are learning remotely. The district <a>reverted to virtual schooling</a> in mid-December because of rising coronavirus cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the district said three snow days had been built into this year’s school calendar — and officials decided to use one of them Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She gave no reason why a snow day was necessary if children were already attending school online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then again, maybe no reason was needed.</p></div></div>
