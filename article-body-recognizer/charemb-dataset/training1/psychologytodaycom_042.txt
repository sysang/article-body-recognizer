<p> The <a>DSM-5</a> classifies symptoms of anorexia nervosa as follows:</p>
<li>Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for one's age and height</li>
<li>Intense <a>fear</a> of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though one is underweight</li>

<a>eating disorder</a> can also be associated with a
<a>stressful</a> life event. For young adults, this may involve leaving home for college. For older women, similar life transitions—such as returning to work after raising a family, finding a new job, or separation and

<a>appetite</a> control and its alteration by prolonged overeating or starvation have uncovered enormous complexity; in time, their findings may lead to new pharmacologic treatments for eating disorders. Scientists suspect that multiple

<h1> My Spouse Won’t Agree to Divorce. What Can I Do? </h1>
<h2> Tips to deal with reluctant or resistant spouses. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Challenges of Divorce </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from a divorce</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Even if a spouse doesn’t want a divorce, most come to accept that it's inevitable if one spouse is determined to divorce. </li>
<li>Resisting spouses can thwart, control, or obstruct the legal process, or it can be a power struggle. They may deal with shame, fear or rage.</li>
<li>Seek legal advice to help engage the reluctant spouse in a non-adversarial process. Learn about your divorce process options.</li>
<p>Many of my clients have come to me with this situation. One spouse has decided to <a>divorce</a> and the other spouse doesn’t want to. Why does this happen and what can you do about it?</p>
<h3>It is unusual for both spouses to arrive at the decision to divorce together.</h3>

<a>anger</a> and resentment when your spouse does not cooperate. Guilt can lead you to make concessions that you might later regret and that are far outside the requirements of the law. Later that guilt can lead you to more resentment and conflict.
<h3>What can you do if your spouse does not want the divorce?</h3>
<li>Once you have made your decision to divorce, be prepared and clear with your spouse about your decision, without raising their hopes of reconciliation or giving a mixed message.</li>
<li>If your spouse is blindsided by your decision, they will want an explanation. Prepare yourself for a conversation that is calm, respectful, and compassionate.</li>
<h3>Remember that people survive divorce, even those who don’t want it.</h3>
<p>It is not your responsibility to make your spouse accept it, or to deal with their emotional upset. You are not responsible for their emotions.</p>
<p>Many people will assume that because you made the decision to divorce, that you will be happy. You may be seen by friends, in-laws, and family as the perpetrator and your spouse may be seen as the victim.</p>

<h1> Why You Should Just Pick Up the Phone </h1>
<h2> An old-fashioned phone call still has real power. </h2>
<li>Digital communication fails to convey nonverbal cues in the communication process.</li>
<li>Traditional forms of communication, like phone calls, can offer a faster path to effective communication.</li>
<li>Medical professionals use phone call reminders as an effective way to motivate their patients to action.</li>
<p>Like everyone else, therapists live in a digital world. As our job is to listen and communicate, it is important that we recognize the gaps in understanding that can sometimes arise over email.</p>
<p>That’s why I advocate for real-time communication—voice, video, or in-person—whenever possible. So my message is: Just pick up the phone!</p>
<h3>The Value of Real-Time Communication</h3>
<p>Here’s a recent example from my own life that drove home this point:</p>

<li>Researchers found that 34 percent of workers reporteded anxiety at least once during any month in 2018.</li>
<li>More than half of millennials and 75 percent of Gen Z workers have reportedly quit a job for mental health reasons.</li>

<p>Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton likely began their book, Anxiety At Work, before lockdown. They stated that 34 percent of workers reported anxiety at least once in any month in 2018. Eighteen percent reported a diagnosed anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>According to a 2019 study published in the Harvard Business Review, more than half of millennials and 75 percent of Gen Z reportedly quit a job for mental health reasons.<sup>2</sup></p>
<a>anxious</a> employees perform in subpar fashion or are less valuable is nonsense. Quite the opposite: They work harder. Mensa members reportedly suffer from anxiety disorders at twice the national average.
<a>passive-aggressive</a> drama (gossip, sniping, setups, and sabotage). Our own book, Overcoming Passive-
<a>Aggression</a>, includes a quiz to determine one’s performance style. Yes, whether you are direct and adaptable,
<a>shy</a> away from confrontation, or are indirect matters greatly.
<a>bullying</a>; 20 percent leave the field within three years.
<sup>4</sup> These are pre-pandemic statistics leaving us to assume even worse numbers now.
<p>If the global pandemic of 2020 had “one heartening result,” Shirley Weinstein at Kraft Heinz told Gostick and Elton, “it was the realization to managers at all levels that anxiety is a real business issue.”</p>

<p>Here’s a template for tackling anxiety in the workforce:</p>
<a>Attention</a> and Listen. At Kraft Heinz, they call this “
<a>empathy</a> and care.” Managers learn to understand that workers struggle with work/life balance,
<a>burnout</a>, anxiety, decreased energy, and
<a>depression</a>. They recognize the inability to concentrate, hypersensitivity, restlessness, over-checking, reassurance-seeking, and frequent somatic complaints as signs of anxiety.

<p>Meet uncertainty head-on. Learn six steps to combat this in Anxiety at Work. It’s okay not to have all answers. Ensure everyone knows work expectations. Keep the focus on what can be controlled. </p>
<a>Perfectionists</a> have way too much anxiety that can become obsessive as they hold themselves and those around them to unattainable standards. Poor email often shows a lack of communication skills.
<p>Encourage time off and help make it happen. The 2021 “Great Resignation,” where employees have asserted what they want and left positions to obtain just that, has complicated this, but time away is vital to a healthy workplace.</p>
<a>productivity</a> when they take short breaks during the day to exercise, socialize, or just grab a breath of fresh air,” they said.
<a>Wise</a> leaders recognize stigma-related
<a>prejudice</a>, chronic stress of being discriminated against, or hyper-vigilance fearing it. Good managers correct situations before they spiral into more significant concerns.

<sup>5 </sup>So too, the adverse health consequences mount such that there’s an entire chapter outlining them in Overcoming Passive-Aggression.
<a>gratitude</a>. No one needs the former due to its stress-inducing consequences. Gratitude, on the other hand, helps to reduce cortisol (stress
<a>hormone</a>) levels. We also know that when we pay attention to good or exemplary behavior, we’ll see more of it. Yes, recognize what’s right, and you will often see people work to achieve that and be far less anxious.

<h1> Signs of Passive-Aggressive Behavior in the COVID Era </h1>
<h2> How mask-wearing has become the new way to "compliantly defy" COVID protocols. </h2>
<li>Passive-aggressive persons often find ways to improperly wear masks in order to defy COVID protocols. </li>
<li>There is a range of ways that passive-aggressive people may follow the letter of the law, while violating its spirit entirely. </li>
<li>There are ways to recognize the most common red flags of passive-aggressive COVID protocol defiance. </li>
<a>passive-aggressive</a> "half-maskers" who have figured out how to compliantly defy COVID protocols. Here are some of the common ways anti-maskers have found to covertly flout virus prevention rules:
<li>Wearing their mask, but positioning it under their nose. </li>
<li>Wearing their mask, but positioning it under both their nose and mouth. </li>
<li>When someone asks them to pull their mask up over their nose and/or mouth, they dutifully do so, then immediately pull it down again once out of eyesight of the requestor. </li>
<li>Temporary dehydration: "I'll put my mask back on as soon as I am done drinking."</li>
<li>Long-term sipping: Holding a drink in their hand all. day. long. so as to justify why their mask is constantly pulled down.</li>
<li>Feigning an <a>apology</a>: "Oh, sorry. I was just having a snack. I'll put my mask back on as soon as I finish this last bite."</li>
<li>The longest last bite ever: Never, ever finishing that last bite on the plate makes for a convenient excuse to remain mask-free.</li>
<li>Removing the mask to talk: Whenever virus particles can escape the nose or mouth, disease can be transmitted, so it's especially hard to fathom the thin justification that, "I just remove the mask so that I can talk." </li>
<li>Removing the mask to cough or sneeze: We've all seen it—people who lower their masks when they cough or sneeze so as not to trap wetness inside their mask, which is exactly what the masks are designed to do. </li>
<p>While this post is in no way meant as a guide for how to subvert masking rules, it perhaps serves as a commentary for the range of ways that people, hostile at having to wear a face covering, have found to (ironically) mask their <a>anger</a>. </p>

<h1> How to Get a Positive Reaction from Negative Feedback </h1>
<h2> Does your feedback address these three factors? </h2>
<li>Providing negative feedback is a necessary but uncomfortable leadership responsibility. </li>
<li>Negative feedback usually fails to produce positive long-term behavioral results.</li>
<li>Awareness of three factors can increase the likelihood of positive reaction to negative feedback.</li>
<p>You have a scheduled meeting with a subordinate. The feedback is going to make the person squirm. In this blog, we will provide research-based suggestions to help you be more effective in giving negative feedback.</p>
<p>Their primary finding: “Contextual” factors outside of the feedback itself can mitigate the negative consequences. In other words, prior to giving negative feedback, ask yourself three questions:</p>
<p>• Does the employee view me as a credible source of information? </p>
<p>• Have I made my intentions clear?</p>
<p>• Am I providing clearly defined achievement goals?</p>
<p>Does the Employee View Me as a Credible Source of Information?</p>
<p>Reporting relationship and credibility are not necessarily the same thing. Are you credible in the eyes of your subordinate?</p>
<p>You may believe that you understand the employee’s job requirements and have in-depth knowledge about job factors for successful job performance. You may believe that your race, <a>sex</a>, and age should have no bearing.</p>
<p>Your self-perception may be valid—and irreverent. How does this subordinate perceive you? For example:</p>
<p>The CEO is in a dilemma. The VP’s technical contributions are so important that the CEO would like to retain him. On the other hand, the CEO cannot avoid confronting the VP about his dysfunctional behavior.</p>
<p>Have You Made Your Intentions Clear?</p>
<p>We recommend that you be clear in your conversation. Back it up with a written note to the employee. For example:</p>
<p>“On a scale of 1-5, your C-suite peers and I gave you an average rating of 2. When we measure how you are perceived by your peers this time next year, my goal is that you move the scale to 3. </p>
<p>“In other words, I expect you to be perceived as an “average” contributor to C-suite meetings and not below average.”</p>
<p>Are You Providing Clearly Defined Goals?</p>
<p>What positive behaviors do you wish to see? What is your timeline? How will you measure success? What resources are you prepared to offer to help the employee succeed?</p>
<p>In some jobs, success is easy to quantify. Sales is the most obvious example. In the case above, the CEO needs success about managing stakeholder perception. For example:</p>
<p>"Six months from today I am going to evaluate you on the following measures:</p>
<p>I have observed The VP look at issues from an enterprise-wide perspective:</p>
<p>The goal is to achieve an average rating of 3. "</p>

<h1> 5 Reasons Why People Act Passive-Aggressively </h1>
<h2> These common reasons help explain what makes people behave this way. </h2>
<ul> <li>Passive-aggression is anger, hostility, and/or learned helplessness in disguise.</li> <li>There are four subtypes of passive-aggressiveness.</li> <li>Causes of passive-aggression are often varied and situational.</li> </ul>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Phovoir/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>aggression</a> is comprised of anger, hostility, or
<a>learned helplessness</a> in disguise, expressed in a covert, underhanded way to "even the score," and with the hope of "getting away with it."
<p>Subtypes of passion-aggressiveness include disguised verbal hostility, disguised relational hostility, disguised task hostility, and hostility towards others through self-<a>punishment</a>.</p>
<a>self-harm</a>, and deliberate weakness to elicit sympathy and favor.
<sup>[1][2]</sup> below are five common reasons, with references from my books
<a>How to Successfully Handle Passive-Aggressive People</a> and
<li>Normalize Low Expectations. In some cases, a passive-aggressor wants to purposely frustrate a task in order to set low expectations, shed responsibility, and hopefully avoid being asked again. In this way, a low baseline is established.</li>
<li>Low Self-Esteem and Low <a>Self-Efficacy</a>. At some level, a chronically passive-aggressive individual may be signaling, “I’m not good enough to accept responsibly, so don’t ask me or I may fail your expectations.” </li>
