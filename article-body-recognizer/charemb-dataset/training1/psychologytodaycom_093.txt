<a>flirting</a> to one-night stands to
<a>marriage</a> and more. Some mating behaviors are deeply ingrained, hard-wired into the
<a>nervous system</a>, and operate without conscious awareness—attractions, for example—and some, like marriage ceremonies, are highly scripted, with every detail worked out in advance.
<h2> The Mate and Attraction Market </h2>
<div> <h3> How will I know if I am meant to be with someone? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is compatibility? </h3> </div>
<a>compatibility</a> is partners sharing and supporting each other's life
<a>dreams</a>. Some additional signs of compatibility include: You share the same values, know how to handle conflict, support each other's needs, feel secure, take responsibility and are accountable, among other factors.

<h2> Understanding Commitment and Monogamy </h2>
<div> <h3> Why are men commitment-phobic? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Are people mostly monogamous? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do male and female mating strategies differ? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Who is choosier, men or women? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Men desire and <a>seek numerous sex partners</a> and they are generally quick to consent to sex. However, when women pursue short-term mates, they appear to be motivated more by partner quality than by partner quantity.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is short-term mating? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>More men than women seek <a>short-term mating</a>, and for a reason. Evolutionarily speaking, males seek sexual access to fertile women to spread their sperm far and wide. This will ensure that a male’s genes are reproduced.</p> </div>

<p>Well, of course! That’s why most leaders are so awful and disappointing at their jobs.</p>

<p>The number of people with diabetes has more than tripled since 1980. The condition is closely associated with the rise in obesity worldwide. But there are still important unknowns about the disorder.</p>
<p>What is the real cause of diabetes?</p>
<p>How does your view differ from the conventional view?</p>
<p>If insulin resistance doesn’t explain diabetes, what does?</p>
<p>How does insulin resistance fail to explain diabetes?</p>
<p>What are the practical implications of your view vs. the conventional view?</p>
<p>What research supports your view?</p>
<a>diet</a> from their native foods on the plains to foods consumed on reservations. While they had no cultivated grains in their natural habitat, the majority of food energy in the reservation diet came from grain-based items.
<p>A recent study of mice also shows a correlation between liver glucose production and muscle fatty acid use in a dose-response manner when shifting from a normal to a high-fat to a <a>ketogenic diet</a>.</p>
<p>What does fat have to do with diabetes?</p>
<p>What are the important dietary implications for diabetics?</p>
<p>When someone inherits a family tendency to diabetes, exactly what genetic fault(s) are they inheriting?</p>
<p>If you had to pick one thing to tell anyone about diabetes prevention, what would it be?</p>
<p>If you could tell only one thing to someone with Type 2 diabetes, what would it be?</p>
<p>Spend eight weeks eating almost no grains and you will see your blood sugar levels decrease as well as lose weight.</p>

<a>Substance abuse</a> not only has a major impact on the health of the user but disrupts important family and social relationships. Just how much—if any—responsibility loved ones have for the problem has long been a highly controversial topic.
<p>What is <a>prodependence</a>?</p>
<a>attachment</a>-sourced view of dependency, addresses many of the shortcomings of the 35-year old codependency model, which was based in
<a>caregiving</a> loved one’s willingness to remain connected with a family member of a substance abuser while teaching the caregiver how to survive and help heal active substance abuse.
<p>The idea of codependency has always been controversial and rejected by science. What is your concern with it?</p>
<p>Why is it a mistake to think of addiction as a disease?</p>
<a>fear</a> of losing a meaningful attachment.
<p>Substance abusers use because they want to use. No family member is ever responsible for that.</p>
<p>Why do you think we as a culture are struggling so much with addiction right now?</p>
<p>What do you mean when you say addiction is an <a>intimacy</a> disorder?</p>
<a>self-regulate</a> unwelcome and uncomfortable emotional states. Healthy people turn to other people. Substance abusers, however, tend to cope with
<a>boredom</a>, attachment deficits, and, most of all, unresolved trauma by turning to addictive substances or behaviors. They do this because, for them, unresolved
<a>childhood</a> trauma (often preverbal) has poisoned the well of attachment. They fear and feel insecure with emotional dependency and intimacy; thus, they turn inward and isolate, using drugs or behavior to

<p>And what does that imply about helping those with substance-use problems?</p>
<p>Are there relationships that protect people from developing substance-use problems?</p>
<p>Without question, a child who experienced meaningful attachment to loving, supportive caregivers (parents) is far less vulnerable to addiction than someone who grew up with relational unpredictability and trauma as the norm.</p>
<p>Who is your audience for this book and why?</p>
<p>What is the single most important point you want readers to take away from this book?</p>
<p>You can never love too much! You can love ineffectively, you can love inadequately, you can love in less than helpful ways. But love too much? No way.</p>
<a>shame</a>, or investigate the
<a>motivation</a> of loving caregivers, because doing that alienates them. Why not just validate their love while redirecting it in more effective ways?

<p>Our lives are embedded in relationships. Often enough, we find ourselves struggling with the very people to whom we are most connected. How to navigate relationships safely and lovingly?</p>
<p>Your title, Relationship Sanity, implies that there is a lot of relationship insanity.</p>
<a>fear</a> opening ourselves up to others for fear of rejection and abandonment. But by actively, though unconsciously, protecting ourselves from such vulnerability, we also wall ourselves off from the possibility of experiencing
<a>empathy</a>, and emotional investments in others.
<p>Why did you write Relationship Sanity?</p>
<p>What kinds of relationship phenomena strike you as most insane?</p>
<p>Your previous book, Irrelationship, explained how fear of intimacy leads people into dysfunctional relationships. How does this book carry the theme forward?</p>
<p>What is real intimacy and why are people so scared of it?</p>

<p>Adolescence has long posed challenges to both parents and children. Today, parents must navigate those challenges in two worlds—the real one and the online one—and through a more extended course of adolescence.</p>
<p>That’s a provocative title: What message are you hoping to deliver to parents before they even open the book?</p>
<a>childhood</a> years when the foundation of trusting
<a>attachment</a> and commonality between them was built.
<p>Does your view differ from the conventional view of <a>parenting</a> and adolescence? </p>
<p>What are the four stages of adolescence, and what are important distinctions between them?</p>
<p>Associated with each stage is a developmental goal followed by specific challenges commonly associated with meeting that larger objective.</p>
<a>boredom</a>, active and passive resistance with parents, early experimentation to satisfy growing curiosity.
<a>lying</a> to get away with the forbidden, more physical self-consciousness from puberty, more
<a>peer pressure</a> and social cruelty at school.
<a>dating</a>, partying, and drug use; more emotional, romantic, and
<a>sexual</a> experience; more sadness over graduation loss of friends; more worries about readiness for independence.
<a>anxiety</a> from future uncertainty, lack of sufficient self-discipline to catch hold, losing footing and maybe boomeranging home.
<p>Has adolescence changed over the course of time—say between 1918 and 2018?</p>
<p>Over your years of practice, have you observed changes either in the way young people enter or course through adolescence or the way parents approach their adolescents?</p>
<p>Disorganization and distractibility are two things that tend to drive parents of teens wild. But you seem to have a more adaptive view of them. Please explain.</p>
<a>attention</a> to take it all in.
<p>Rather than rush to medicate early and mid-adolescent disorganization and distractibility, it can be worth trying an educational approach first—<a>coaching</a> and practice to learn new self-organizing and attention-paying skills. </p>
<p>Could you please explain why teens suddenly seem to lose <a>confidence</a>—and whether that plays into later mental health problems?</p>
<p>You deal with substance use. It seems to be a fact of life, but no parent welcomes it. What’s the most productive way to handle it?</p>
<p>The answer is, the hard way: accept it, know about it, talk about it, watch out for problem signs of it, and get counseling help for it if some of these occur.</p>
<p>Smart phones and social media take on a huge importance in adolescence that parents everywhere seem to be struggling with right now. What role is it playing in adolescent development, and is there a sane approach through this new phenomenon? </p>
<p>If you had to pick one thing to tell anyone about parenting adolescents, what would it be?</p>
<p>I know your book is aimed at parents, but if you had one thing to say to adolescents, what would it be?</p>
<p>“Think one day ahead.” At the outset of any adventure .ask: “Will I be glad tomorrow about the action I could be taking now?” If not, consider making a different choice.</p>

<p>For some people, perhaps even many people, disordered thinking shows up primarily in physical symptoms. At one extreme, such symptoms constitute conversion disorder. What do such symptoms means, and how are they best approached?</p>
<p>What does the title mean and what conditions fall in its domain?</p>
<p>Under what conditions do people convert psychological energy into physical symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it necessary to make people aware of the conversion in order to heal the psychic problem?</p>
<p>You use the word hysteria. I thought hysteria was an antique word in the mental health world. Why is it relevant today and what does it mean?</p>
<a>Freud</a> used extensively, and actually is a synonym for hysteria, which psychiatry wanted to get rid of (and did) in the 80s as
<a>psychopharmacology</a> took center stage. I like the idea of hysteria, and I love hysterical patients (being something of one myself) because essentially what the term means is a patient who is too alive, especially in their body and in relation to
<p>What has to happen in the mind of a patient before the physical symptom(s) can dissipate?</p>
<a>dreams</a> to desire to sexuality to
<a>trauma</a> and relationships, is what I find practically miraculous and keeps me going back to work every day.
<p>Could you describe the process of therapy, or at least the turning point?</p>
<a>wisdom</a> to a patient, but rather leaning on your own analytic work to be able to listen, really listen, to what someone says, something you can’t possibly know or understand in advance.

<p>A good relationship brings out the best in partners, is a boon to mental and physical health and a barrier to illness. But the foundation of a good relationship today is different from what couples needed a generation ago. What does it take now?</p>
<p>Let’s start with the title, We Do. What message are you delivering with that and how does it orient the reader to the book?</p>
<a>attraction</a>, and shared interests are not enough when considering the vicissitudes of life and all its unknowns.
<p>In what ways are relationship <a>goals</a> of couples evolving? What do couples want out of relationships today that they didn’t want so much, say, 15 or 20 years ago?</p>
<a>marriage</a>: Religion, duty, property,
<a>politics</a>, convenience, saving face, and of course,
<a>romantic love</a>. Many of the feudal reasons for marriage exist today. However, I would say that romantic love remains the most popular reason.
<a>loneliness</a> and isolation can. But secure functioning is the primary guiding principle underlying the book’s title.
<p>What does a psychobiological approach to relationships emphasize? And what does it attend to that other approaches do not?</p>
<p>So what is the secret of a successful marriage—and is there only one?</p>
<p>What are the things couples need to set up at the get-go for their relationship to succeed?</p>
<p>What in particular do partners need to know about each other for marital success? And why don’t they know it?</p>
<p>What do couples fight about—or is the content less important than some other element?</p>
<a>memory</a>, which, as I said, is unreliable. But the memory to which I am referring here is mostly implicit, which is to say, below consciousness. With all of these human error potentials, what could possibly go wrong? Anything and everything!
<p>A solution to the automatic brain issue is to be fully present and attentive, like we were in courtship, at the very least, when we’re trying to fall back in love or when we’re dealing with distress. Stay eye-to-eye and go slowly.</p>
<p>What vision of relationships do you want couples to enter marriage with?</p>
<p>Talk about load-bearing in a relationship. What do you mean by it, and how, ideally, does it work in a good relationship?</p>
<p>How do partners co-manage emotional states and why is that so important?</p>
<p>If you had one piece of advice for people about to be married, what would it be?</p>
<p>And what advice would you offer couples who have been married much longer, although not necessarily happily?</p>
