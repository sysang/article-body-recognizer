<p>• Listen to concerns; don’t dismiss children’s feelings. Just feeling heard is comforting.</p>
<p>• Limit children’s exposure to news of disasters and catastrophic events. Eventually children will develop the cognitive capacity to handle such information, but constant replay magnifies the sense of threat.</p>
<p>• Allow time for relationships. Anxiety results when children do not feel safe. Relationships of all kinds—with parents, with other family members, with peers, with teachers—are natural antidotes to anxiety.</p>
<p>• Offer specific skills for dissipating the discomfort anxiety creates. Teach kids deep breathing, which subdues the nerves of alarm. </p>
<p>• Help your children face the discomfort of anxiety to know that it won’t destroy them, rather than allowing them to avoid situations that give rise to worry. . </p>
<p>• Keep your own anxieties to yourself. Do not share them with your children. </p>
