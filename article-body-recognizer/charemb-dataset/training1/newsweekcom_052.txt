<div> World Tsunami <a>Bronze Age</a></div>
<p>A team of researchers recently found the 3,600-year-old remains of a man believed to have been killed by a Bronze Age tsunami.</p>
<p>According to Phys.org, the discovery was made at a dig site called Çesme-Bağlararası, which is located in western Turkey.</p>
<p>Scientists are confident that the tsunami in question was one created by the eruption of Thera—a volcano located in modern-day Santorini.</p>
<a>National Geographic</a> said of the "cataclysmic" event.
<p>Britannica further explained that ash and pumice from the eruption have been found in Egypt and Israel. The encyclopedia added that the event inspired the legend of Atlantis, as well as Biblical stories found in the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>Scientists are eager to pinpoint an eruption date, as this knowledge could help tie together the region's history.</p>
<p>"The volcano erupts and represents one short moment in time," Charlotte Pearson, an assistant professor of dendrochronology at the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, said in 2018.</p>
<p>Despite killing an estimated 35,000 people, scientists have yet to find the remains of any of Thera's victims. That is, until now.</p>
<p>While the man's remains have yet to be directly dated, researchers believe that they will align with radiocarbon dates found on materials sampled nearby, thereby tying it to the Thera tsunami, National Geographic explained.</p>
<p>In addition to the man's remains, researchers also found the remains of a dog, reported Phys.org. The man was found "pushed up against a wall" while the dog was found in a nearby doorway.</p>
<p>A video has gone viral this week showing guards at the Tower of London trample over a young child while marching through the grounds.</p>
<p>The video, posted by @user7312510220627 has been viewed over 2 million times and received thousands of comments.</p>
<p>As the two guards march side by side, a young child appears to step in front of them. The guard walks right into the child, knocking them to the ground, and then steps over and continues to walk without pause.</p>
<p>"I know it's their prehistoric job to walk like that, but that doesn't excuse them committing common assault on people in public places," one commenter said.</p>
<p>According to the website for Historic Royal Places, there are five regiments of guards that perform ceremonial public duties at the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, St. James's Palace and Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>The guards at The Tower of London stand outside the "The Jewel House" and the "Queen's House" to protect crown jewels and "ensure the security of the Tower of London."</p>
<p>The website for Historic Royal Places outlines that visitors to the Tower of London "are advised to be respectful and stand clear when the guards are marching and performing their official duties."</p>
<p>In the viral video, people are heard gasping as the guard makes impact with the child and an adult quickly rushes to the child as the guard continues to walk away.</p>
<p>"People defending 2 grown men stepping on a kid," one commenter said in response to those saying the guard's actions are justified as part of their "job."</p>
<p>"My sister used to be a royal guard and she had so many stories about people harassing her," another commenter added. "It's literally their job and they have to be like that."</p>
<p>In a statement to LADBible an Army spokesperson, from the Ministry of Defense, said they had been made aware of the incident.</p>
<p>"The Guardsmen on duty warned members of the public that a patrol was approaching but the child unfortunately ran out in front of the soldier unexpectedly. The soldier tried to step over the child and continued on his duty.</p>
<p>"Following the incident, the soldier checked on the child and was reassured that all was well."</p>

<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>The 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Easter Egg You Probably Missed from 'Hawkeye'</h1><div> By Roxy Simons <time>On 12/23/21 at 7:25 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Hawkeye came to an end on Wednesday, December 22, a few days after Spider-Man: No Way Home was released in theaters on December 17.</p>
<p>As fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are more than aware of by now, every film and TV show in the franchise is linked in some way, whether that be through a supporting character or event.</p>
<p>Hawkeye and Spider-Man: No Way Home share a number of these connections, like Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) appearing in the former while Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) made a cameo in the latter.</p>
<p>But these are the obvious connections between the film and Disney+ show, and there is one link that is so subtle fans probably didn't even realise it was one.</p>
<h2>The 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Easter Egg in 'Hawkeye' You Probably Missed</h2>
<p>After Peter is unmasked as Spider-Man by J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) following the death of Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) the government start to investigate him.</p>
<p>Its case leads the <a>FBI</a> to impound evidence from the Avengers compound, which is briefly shown being taken away in a number of trucks.</p>
<p>This is the one time the evidence is referred to in the film as the focus diverts away from the investigation and instead moves onto Peter's quest to get everyone to forget he's Spider-Man, only for Dr. Strange's spell to <a>go very wrong</a>.</p>
<p>However this small, blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene is actually crucial for the events in Hawkeye and how the show begins in the first place.</p>
<p>Kate becomes a part of Clint's life after she comes into possession of his Ronin suit, which her future step-father Jack Duquesne (Tony Dalton) and his uncle Armand (Simon Callow) were bidding over in a black market auction.</p>
<p>As well as the suit, Jack bids on Ronin's sword which he takes when the Tracksuit Mafia crash the event, and the gang also take a watch belonging to <a>Clint's wife</a>.</p>
<p>While it's not explained how the items went from the FBI's evidence room to the black market, it doesn't seem unreasonable that one member of the team (or several) thought they could make money by selling off the priceless items.</p>
<a>Netflix</a> series and Hawkeye, the villain could have easily escaped, blackmailed the FBI and taken his position at the top of the criminal underworld once more.
<p>Hawkeye is available to stream on Disney+, while Daredevil is available on Netflix, and Spider-Man: No Way Home is in theaters now.</p>
<div> News Animals <a>Nebraska</a> <a>Trees</a></div>
<p>A landscaping crew at the University of Nebraska found flying squirrels nesting in a dying oak tree they were cutting down on campus at the School of Natural Resource.</p>
<p>The crew from the university landscape services said they were cutting down the dying tree when they found not one, but four bizarre-looking squirrels and recorded what they saw, the Lincoln Journal Star reported.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the squirrels jumped off their tree and glided over to another oak tree and slipped out of view.</p>
<p>"We're like, 'What the heck is that?'" said Brian Dieterman, a member of the crew. "We're used to seeing squirrels in trees, but this didn't look like a squirrel."</p>
<p>The video made its way to conservation biology professor Larkin Powell, and he said he was surprised about the discovery partly because of the fact they're nocturnal.</p>
<p>"It's among the species that's harder to document because they're not out when people are around," he said. "And they're little dudes."</p>
<p>Nebraska does have a population of flying squirrels, but they're typically located about 90 miles away in the southeast part of the state.</p>
<p>"As a biologist, I've seen crazy things that animals can do. But it's very unlikely they made it here on their own," said Shaun Dunn, a natural heritage zoologist for the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>While it's a rare sight to see a flying squirrel in Lincoln, it's not the first time. Since 2018, Dunn said he has documented 15 sightings of flying squirrels.</p>
<p>Don Althoff has been studying the species for 30 years in Ohio. His expertise came to play when he was asked to share his blueprints of a nesting box for the Nebraska squirrels. The Journal Star reported Althoff was happy to help his alma mater.</p>
<p>"You just have to know if they were in that tree, and there were four of them," Powell said, "odds are they're in a lot of other places you don't see them."</p>
<p>It turns out the flying squirrels had been living undetected—until now—in the treetops just above the animal experts at the university's School of Natural Resources in Lincoln. The crew made the discovery earlier this month, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Though graceful in the air, the animals are awkward on the ground. Because their sail-like flaps run from wrist to ankle he said they move more like a hobbled horse.</p>

<p>Starbucks workers in a Buffalo, New York, store voted Thursday to unionize, which, if certified by the National Labor Relations Board, would make it the first U.S. Starbucks to do so.</p>
<p>Three stores in the area voted. The first store voted 19-8 in favor of unionizing. A second store voted against unionizing. The outcome at a third store was unclear Thursday night.</p>
<p>The three Buffalo-area stores' efforts to unionize began in August when they filed petitions with the board.</p>
<p>Casey Moore, a union organizer and Starbucks employee, told the Associated Press workers at the massive coffee shop chain currently "have no say."</p>
<p>"We have no accountability right now," Moore said. "With a union we will actually be able to sit down at the table and say, 'This is what we want.'"</p>
<p>Employees at the three Buffalo stores began voting by mail in November to decide whether they wanted Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, to represent them.</p>
<p>The labor board's certification process is expected to take about a week. Starbucks has long fought against efforts to unionize, insisting that it works best when communicating directly to employees.</p>
<p>"Every partner matters," Part of a Starbucks statement said. "It's how we built the company. And how we will continue to run the company."</p>
<p>The coffee giant went on to say it believes every partner in every market should have the right to vote on whether to join a union, though <a>Starbucks fervently worked to dissuade</a> the Buffalo outlets from choosing to do so.</p>
<p>The workers in the Buffalo area say Starbucks' stores had chronic problems like understaffing and faulty equipment even before the pandemic. They want more input on pay and store operations.</p>
<p>Starbucks asked the labor board to hold one vote with all 20 of its Buffalo-area stores, but the board rejected that request, saying store-by-store votes were appropriate under labor law.</p>
<p>In a letter to Starbucks' U.S. employees this week, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson reiterated the company's wish to include all Buffalo-area stores in the union vote.</p>
<p>"While we recognize this creates some level of uncertainty, we respect the process that is underway, and independent of the outcome in these elections, we will continue to stay true to our mission and values," Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>But backers of the union say Starbucks can do more.</p>
<a>Bernie Sanders</a>, a Vermont independent, in a recent
<a>Twitter</a> post. Sanders held a virtual town hall with Buffalo Starbucks workers earlier this week.
<p>Johnson earned $14.7 million in salary and stock awards in the company's 2020 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Starbucks or the union can contest individual votes in the election, which could delay the certification process by the labor board.</p>
<p>In some cases, companies have closed a location rather than deal with a union. But that's difficult for a retailer like Starbucks, since it would be illegal to close one store and then open another nearby, Creighton said.</p>

<p>Of the models coming to the U.S. upon launch, power is allocated depending on drivetrain. RWD models get 225 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque at the ready. Opting for AWD bumps that figure up to 320 horsepower and 446 pound-feet of torque.</p>
<p>RWD models can go 303 miles on a single charge. Ioniq 5 AWD versions have a 256-mile range.</p>
<p>The outlier in this set is the Ioniq 5 SE Standard Range model. All others are considered Long Range variants. The RWD-only base variant will go just 220 miles on a single charge. It has late availability.</p>

<p>This is perfectly translated into the center console, which moves forward and aft rather than just having its armrest slide forward. Its modular design, with heavy emphasis on functionality in everyday life, simply works.</p>
<a>Volvo C40</a>. That's about where each company's internal combustion engine vehicles fall in the seating comfort hierarchy as well.
<p>There's a fair amount of small item storage in the Ioniq 5. Like most other hot hatches, there's a perfectly suitable amount of cargo space.</p>
<a>Apple</a> CarPlay, Bluetooth, BlueLink connected car app linkage, five USB ports and two 12-volt power outlets are among the most sought-after items on the standard equipment list.
<p>The infotainment screen is responsive but the way the lack of physical buttons works out, some features are not as easy to find/use while on-the-go as they are in more traditionally designed vehicles.</p>
<p>Fancy new tech like a head-up display with augmented reality (similar to what is in the latest Mercedes-Benz E-Class) makes the Hyundai feel more cutting edge than some other EVs.</p>
<p>Dangerously, the system can rapidly slow down the car by 10, 20, or more miles per hour on the interstate when it thinks that the curve ahead, as mapped by the navigation system and translated into real time data, is too sharp for the current speed.</p>
<p>When this happens, it becomes up to the driver to intervene (Hyundai does not advertise this as a hands-off drive assist feature) and stomp on the gas pedal.</p>
<p>Though the system is next-generation in the Ioniq 5, it has similar issues in the Hyundai Sonata.</p>
<p>It's important to judge the Hyundai Ioniq 5 not as an electric vehicle, but as a vehicle, comparing it to everything else on the market. While it's not perfect, it is very good.</p>
<p>Its price point, power, and battery life put it squarely in the crosshairs of the <a>Tesla</a> Model 3, Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4. However, it is pricey. The base model starts at $39,700 and the full-loaded version tops out around $55,000.</p>

<p>The number of children in New York City hospitalized due to COVID-19 quadrupled over the past three weeks as the number of Omicron-related cases soared, according to the state's health department.</p>
<p>No fully vaccinated children ages five to 11-years-old have been admitted into a New York hospital since December 19, according to the statement. They first became eligible to take the vaccine in November.</p>
<p>About 23 percent of admitted patients ages 12 to 17 years old were fully vaccinated, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Most of the increase in pediatric hospitalizations is concentrated in New York City and its surrounding areas, the statement said.</p>
<p>Acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett warned in the statement: "The risks of COVID-19 for children are real."</p>
<p>Still, thousands of hospital beds remained open across the state. Twenty-two percent of beds were open as of Thursday, according to the health department's data.</p>
<p>The rising number of cases has prompted some school officials to <a>pivot to remote learning</a> in the weeks following winter break with the aim of limiting the virus' spread among children.</p>
<p>In total, more than 1,000 children in the United States have been <a>killed by the virus</a>.</p>

<div>Cyber Monday is on the horizon and will follow up Black Friday with bargains galore! Here is all you need to know about the event, including when it starts.</div>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday shortened isolation and quarantine guidelines from 10 days to 5 days for most people who have been exposed to COVID-19 or tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The new guidance aligns with evidence that people infected with COVID are most contagious in the one to two days before, and three days after, they first develop symptoms, according to the agency.</p>
<p>The decision also comes as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has driven a new wave of infections across the U.S., resulting in <a>significant labor shortages</a> and an <a>increased demand for testing.</a></p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the new guidelines:</p>
<h3>What To Do If You Tested Positive For COVID-19</h3>
<p>"Isolation relates to behavior after a confirmed infection. Isolation for 5 days followed by wearing a well-fitting mask will minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others," the agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The CDC did not announce shortened recommendations for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are showing symptoms of the virus. It previously said that symptomatic individuals should isolate away from others for a full 10 days.</p>
<h3>What To Do If You've Been Exposed To COVID-19</h3>
<p>If unable to quarantine for those 5 days, the agency recommends that an exposed individual should "wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure."</p>
<p>The CDC also said Monday that data from South Africa and the United Kingdom suggests that two doses of the vaccine are just 35 percent effective at preventing infection from Omicron, but a booster shot increases that effectiveness to 75 percent.</p>
<p>The agency maintains that getting vaccinated and boosted is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<h2> Photos: Raising the Concordia</h2>
<a> Launch Slideshow 8 PHOTOS </a>
<p>Salvage workers gathered in bars at the port, drinking beer and smoking huge cigars, to celebrate after completing one of the largest maritime salvage operations in history.</p>
<p>The 114,500-GT tonne wreck is due to arrive at a port near Genoa in northern Italy on either Saturday or Sunday, before being broken up for scrap. The once-gleaming white luxury liner sank off Giglio in January 2012 after sailing too close to shore.</p>
<p>Despite intermittent bad weather over the past week, the salvage crews have slowly lifted the Concordia from underwater platforms by pumping air into 30 large metal boxes, or sponsons, attached to the hull.</p>
<p>Franco Porcellachia, the engineer in charge of the operation, said on Tuesday that his team had done everything in their power to make sure the massive ship was structurally sound for the four-day journey.</p>
<p>"Once we are in Genoa, then I can relax," Nick Sloane, the South African salvage master who has coordinated the operation, told reporters.</p>
<p>The whole salvage operation is expected to cost the ship's owners - Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp - more than 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), its chief executive said earlier this month.</p>
<p>The wreck's departure removes both the physical remains, which prompted worries about pollution on the picturesque Tuscan coastline, and the visual specter of a chaotic evacuation of crew and passengers, some of whom jumped ship and swam ashore.</p>
<p>The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, is fighting charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck as he tried to "salute" the port, and abandoning ship.</p>
<p>During court proceedings earlier this year, the cruise company's crisis coordinator said Schettino tried to persuade him to pretend an electrical blackout had caused the wreck.</p>
<p>One person who was on the ship when it sank is still missing. Salvage organizers have said the search for the body will continue once the Concordia has left Giglio.</p>
<p>The ship was righted in September in a complex "parbuckling" operation in which the huge hulk was slowly lifted off the rocks. That took 19 hours and drew media coverage from around the world.</p>
<p>The demolition and scrapping will be done by a consortium that includes Italian oil-services group Saipem and Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio.</p>
<div> Culture Tiktok <a>Viral video</a></div>
<p>A woman attempted to dye her dog's fur but things didn't quite go as planned.</p>
<p>She shared the aftermath in a now-viral video that has left commenters divided.</p>
<p>The video, found here, was posted to TikTok on December 9 by Isa Beastly (@isabeastly), who wrote: "Help!" The post has since racked up more than 577,000 views and over 30,000 likes.</p>
<p>"I saw some girl dye her dog on TikTok and [I've] been wanting to dye my dog for a while," the video's text overlay read. "Omg my landlord is going to take my deposit. HELP ME!"</p>
<p>In the video, Isa Beastly showed viewers her bathroom, which was covered in red and orange hair dye.</p>
<p>At multiple points throughout the 15-second clip, her brightly colored dog can be seen running about, contributing to the mess.</p>
<p>While the aim of the video was to get advice on how to clean up the dye, a majority of commenters quickly zeroed in on the dog and criticized Isa Beastly for attempting to color its fur.</p>
<p>"Omg that is so not ok poor baby," said roserose1623.</p>
<p>"That poor dog. SMH," commented Celeste Sosa.</p>
<p>"Sorry but [people] who do this to dogs don't deserve dogs," added christy._.cala.</p>
<p>Karina asked: "Is that safe for the dog? I'm so confused and scared for it lol I hope it was!!"</p>
<p>Others argued that so long as the dye used was "dog friendly," the dog would be fine.</p>
<p>"If it's dog-friendly dye it's literally fine y'all," wrote chey.</p>
<p>"Y'all realize it's dye for dogs!?" asked Danielle.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the wrong products can have detrimental effects on an animal's wellbeing.</p>
<p>In 2018, a Florida-based animal service team shared that <a>a dog sustained "life-threatening injuries" after being dyed purple</a>. According to authorities, this is because the dog's owners used products intended for humans.</p>
<a>Facebook</a> post about the incident.
<p>"Chemicals in hair dye are TOXIC causing a wide array of external injury to your pet–possible burns, blindness and because an animal's first instinct is to lick, it can cause poisoning or internal burns. Just don't."</p>
<p><a>How Stuff Works stated</a> that there are, in fact, non-toxic dyes that can be used on dogs; however, the site recommended that pet owners consult a groomer to find the right products.</p>
<p>During a meeting Wednesday with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two nations will hold another joint session of war games next year.</p>
<p>Putin said the military training drills proposed by Lukashenko would likely happen in February or March, and details would be finalized later.</p>
<a>European Union</a> borders, according to Reuters.
<a>NATO</a> members like the U.S. near the Russian border of Ukraine.
<p>The drills added to the months of tension that have been building over tens of thousands of Russian troops amassing near that nation's border with Ukraine, prompting worldwide fears that Putin was planning to invade Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> and other world leaders.
<p>Speaking during a meeting with Lukashenko in St. Petersburg, Russia, he added that military officials will coordinate details.</p>
<p>Some officials in Ukraine have voiced concern that Russia may attack the country from the territory of Belarus.</p>
<a>EU</a> member Poland. The EU has accused Lukashenko of retaliating for its sanctions by using desperate asylum-seekers as pawns and tricking them into trying to enter Poland.
<p>In a show of support for Lukashenko, Russia conducted massive war games with Belarus in September and repeatedly sent its nuclear capable bombers on patrol over Belarus in recent weeks.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Russian and Belarusian fighter jets jointly patrolled Belarus' air space.</p>
<p>Last month, Lukashenko said that Belarus would be ready to host Russian nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>More than 3,400 years ago, a catastrophic eruption of the volcano Thera took place on the Greek island of Santorini. It was one of the largest volcanic events in Earth's recorded history.</p>
<p>"The volcano erupts and represents one short moment in time," Charlotte Pearson, an assistant professor of dendrochronology at the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, said in a statement.</p>
<p>For the latest study, the researchers used the latest radiocarbon techniques on trees in the United States and Ireland that were alive before, during and after the time that Thera was thought to have erupted (the period 1500 to 1700 B.C.).</p>
<p>By analyzing instances of these narrower rings, which could indicate a huge eruption, the researchers dated the Thera event to someplace between 1600 B.C. and 1525 B.C.</p>
<p>Pearson hopes that future research will be able to more accurately pin down a particular year for the eruption.</p>
