<div><div><p>Masks will be required in all state buildings in Maryland under a directive issued Monday by Gov. Larry Hogan (R) as the coronavirus surge continues with hospitals treating a record number of people with covid-19.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Anyone who works or visits a state building, including the State House or the Department of Motor Vehicles, will be required to wear a mask.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For months, the state’s largest union pushed for a mask mandate during its collective bargaining discussions but Hogan rejected the idea. On Monday, he announced that it would be imposed and that it would take effect immediately.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland has 2,746 patients being treated in hospitals for covid-19, the most the state has seen since the start of the pandemic. The seven-day testing positivity rate is at 26.87 percent, which is also a pandemic high.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During a television appearance Sunday, Hogan said Maryland could experience the “worst part” of the pandemic in the next four to six weeks.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>MOSCOW — Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said Tuesday that he was stepping down, touching off a potentially perilous period of transition in one of the world’s most geopolitically fragile regions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll remain with you,” Nazarbayev said. “The concerns of the country and the people will remain my concerns.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What happened here is essentially a change in the signage,” said Talgat Mamyrayimov, a political scientist based in the Kazakh city of Almaty. Nazarbayev “will continue to rule the country.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Underscoring that geopolitical balancing act, Nazarbayev noted in his speech Tuesday that Tokayev had studied in Moscow and spoke good English and Chinese. </p></div></div>
<p>“On the ruins of the U.S.S.R., we managed to build a successful Kazakh state with a modern market economy, and to create peace and stability inside multiethnic and multireligious Kazakhstan,” Nazarbayev said in his speech. </p>

<div><p>Threat of Russian invasion of Ukraine tests Biden administration</p></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. analysis of Russia’s plans is based in part on satellite images that “show newly arrived units at various locations along the Ukrainian border over the last month,” the official said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden said he is preparing measures to raise the cost of any new invasion for Putin, who has dismissed the U.S. warnings as rumors and said Russia is not threatening anyone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Russian military moves come as Moscow has raised eyebrows in Washington with a sudden mobilization of reservists this year and a dramatic escalation of its rhetoric regarding Ukraine.</p></div></div>
<a>warning </a>earlier this week from Blinken that Putin could quickly order an invasion of Ukraine and helps explain why Biden administration officials have been sounding alarms about the threat of imminent invasion for weeks.
<div><p>What you need to know about tensions between Ukraine and Russia</p></div>
<div><p>Lavrov, in public comments this week, echoed Putin’s warnings about U.S. military equipment and activity encroaching on Russia’s borders and said, “The nightmare scenario of military confrontation is returning.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The intelligence document also suggests that Russian forces may be leaving equipment behind at training facilities to allow an attack on Ukraine to commence quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Equipment may be left behind at different training ranges to enable a rapid, final buildup,” the document adds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Separately, a Ukrainian government official said that Russian military exercises conducted earlier this year near Ukraine’s borders helped Russian forces essentially rehearse an invasion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While laying the groundwork for an invasion, the Russian government has also been waging a propaganda campaign, the U.S. administration official said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his comments in Latvia, Blinken cautioned the Ukrainians not to give Russia a pretext for military action.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re also urging Ukraine to continue to exercise restraint because, again, the Russian playbook is to claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Putin has demanded the United States and its allies provide signed assurances excluding any expansion of NATO to include Ukraine and Georgia and limiting military activity near Russia’s borders, most notably in and around Ukraine.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The demands for a new European security pact come after Putin has suggested for months that U.S. and allied military activities in Ukraine and near Russia’s borders are crossing a red line for the Kremlin.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki rejected out of hand the idea that Washington would provide a guarantee that Ukraine will not enter NATO.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Alison Mutler | AP</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>March 2, 2018</div></div>
<div><div><p>BUCHAREST, Romania — Pro-EU leaders from Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia said Friday that the continued presence of Russian military in their countries was destabilizing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They said they were “profoundly concerned about Russian troops” in Moldova, “and Russian occupation and other forms of military intervention” in parts of Georgia and Ukraine.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In the statement, they also expressed displeasure at what they claim is Russia’s “coordinated foreign support for separatist movements,” and social media “operations” to discredit pro-European governments.</p></div>
<div><div><p> “After 26 years Moldova still has an occupied territory,” the country’s speaker, Andrian Candu said. “The same reality is faced by Georgia and Ukraine.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Russia has 1,000 troops and 500 peacekeepers stationed in the pro-Russian breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester, a sliver of land in in eastern Moldova.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Russian officials say they need to stay there to protect peace and to protect huge Soviet-era ammunition depots located in the area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Russia and Georgia fought a brief war in 2008, which led to two breakaway Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, declaring independence. Russia has since been supporting the regions financially and militarily.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But Ukrainian authorities are also asking what will happen if severe economic sanctions and strong backing from Ukraine’s Western allies fail to deter Russia from launching a full-scale attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Putin, Kuleba said, could weigh the risks and benefits and, in the end, decide it is worth it “to try to destroy or take over Ukraine, or to cut it in half.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuleba asked then what Ukraine and its allies next step would be.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“The whole world now knows that there is a war in Ukraine,” said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Before this, everyone thought that everything is fine here, but, in fact, the hot phase of war with Russia never stopped,” he added. “It’s basically been going on since February 2014.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since 2016, Hranitne had largely escaped the periodic shelling seen elsewhere along the front line. Then in October, Volodymyr Vesyolkin, the military civil administration head in Hranitne, crossed the Kalmius River.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was actually really joyful,” said Vesyolkin, who<b> </b>fled Horlivka, a coal-mining city about 85 miles northeast of Hranitne, when it came under the control of the pro-Russian insurgents in 2014.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Kyiv keeping calm and carrying on even as Russia boosts pressure on Ukraine</p></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after Vesyolkin’s visit to Staromarivka, the separatists fired on Hranitne.</p></div></div>
<p>Elsewhere in town, Nikolayeva’s nephews were on their way to the store when the first shells started dropping. Their father told them to get down, but they were just frozen. At the home of Nikolayeva’s parents, a shell fell in the yard.</p>
<div><div><p>Haytulova and her neighbors who live closest to the footbridge were hit the hardest. When an artillery strike obliterated her bedroom wall, parts of the ceiling started falling, too.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A day later, the fighting subsided. Eva, Nikolayeva’s daughter, now instructs her classmates on how to act in case of more strikes. Meanwhile, Nikolayeva decided to move elsewhere in town, farther away from the front line.</p></div>
<div><p>Piles of cinder blocks dot Haytulova’s street now. The yards are covered in craters from where shells landed. Some residents have started rebuilding. Others don’t see the point when another onslaught can come at any minute.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It was so quiet and then, bam, it started again,” said 63-year-old Liudmilya Kulik. “What is all this fighting for? What did we even do?”</p></div></div>
<p>If Haytulova could afford to leave this place, she would, she said. A Ukrainian soldier visiting her property told her not to cry, that she would move her to one of the many abandoned houses in the area. It would at least have some heating.</p>

<div><div><p>Western officials are privately expressing bafflement that the Ukrainian public has largely shrugged off the threat of an invasion from Russia — in contrast to the alarm expressed by the United States and Europe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Putin told senior officers at the Russian Defense Ministry on Tuesday that Russia will “take adequate military-technical response measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Ukraine’s front, a real war overshadows worries about a possible future one with Russia</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ukrainian authorities said this week they were placing Poroshenko under formal investigation for alleged state treason and “facilitating the activity of terrorist organizations.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Officials in Poroshenko’s political party reject the accusations. The government bodies involved in the investigation, such as the prosecutor general’s office, say they work independently of any influence from the president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Zelensky claimed last month that Akhmetov was being recruited to take part in a coup against the Ukrainian government. He didn’t provide evidence or further details.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zelensky did not say Akhmetov was planning the coup himself. Still,<b> </b>the billionaire was outraged.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a recent poll conducted by a <a>Ukrainian research consortium</a>, nearly half of those surveyed said they thought that oligarchs are “the greatest danger to the country.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ukraine wants to show Biden it’s serious about ending ‘oligarch era.’ That’s not so easy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>What’s less clear is whether Ukrainians trust Zelensky to get the job done, or support him right now, as Ukraine faces a military threat from Russia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In March, Zelensky, a former comedian who played an oligarch-battling president in a popular television series before he was elected, released a video in which he addressed the oligarchs directly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Are you ready to work legally and transparently, or do you want to continue to create monopolies, control the media, influence deputies and other civil servants?” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>At the time, only one member of the country’s super rich was directly affected by Zelensky’s crackdown on oligarchs: Viktor Medvedchuk, a close friend of Putin’s and leader of one of the country’s main opposition parties.</p>
<div><div><p>Ukrainian officials froze his assets and blocked transmission of three television stations connected to him for allegedly disseminating pro-Russian propaganda. Medvedchuk denies the stations are his.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In October, prosecutors accused Medvedchuk of treason in the same coal-purchase case that swept up Poroshenko.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Putin keeps Washington guessing as U.S. huddles with allies to prevent Ukraine invasion</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, which Zelensky heads, will make the final decision on who qualifies as an oligarch. The names of those designated oligarchs will be listed on a national register.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some political observers see a risk that the oligarch law could be used as a “club,” in Magda’s words, to limit funding for<b> </b>Zelensky’s political opponents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I support the move to combat corruption in Ukraine,” he said. “But this problem will not be solved by adopting controversial laws and making lists of ‘enemies of the people.’”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In recent weeks, Akhmetov’s television channels have become a platform for some of Zelensky’s sharpest critics, which appears to have fueled the animosity between them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Akhmetov says that he does not interfere with the channels’ editorial policy and that it’s the “guests who come to the channels” and not the channels themselves that criticize Zelensky.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister wants West to clarify its sanction threats to Moscow</p></div>
<div><div><p>In his annual state-of-the-nation address to parliament this month, Zelensky<b> </b>said the government would prevail in its “battle with the oligarchs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Ukraine will put an end to this,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Poroshenko on Tuesday released a video from Warsaw vowing to return to Ukraine in early January. He could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</p></div></div>

<p>MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a marathon news conference Thursday, blamed the West for tensions on the Ukraine border and fears of war, but stopped short of issuing any pronouncements likely to drive further escalation.</p>
<div><div><p>“We need to think about how Russia is going to live,” he added. “Are we supposed to always look behind our shoulder and wait?”</p></div></div>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry last week published sweeping demands it presented to the United States and NATO that would effectively bar all other former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, from joining or cooperating with the alliance.</p>
<b> </b>proposals — what Moscow refers to as “security guarantees” — as “positive.” He added that he expects to hold
<b> </b>negotiations with a White House delegation about Ukraine and NATO in Geneva next month.
<p>“Facts are a funny thing, and facts make clear that the only aggression that we are seeing at the border of Russia and Ukraine is the military buildup by the Russians and the bellicose rhetoric from the leader of Russia,” Psaki said.</p>
<div><p>With Russian troops massing on the border, Ukraine’s Zelensky focuses instead on internal foes</p></div>
<div><div><p>Psaki said the United States is looking to hold talks with Russia in early January.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The senior official said any conversations with Moscow would take place on the basis of reciprocity, with Washington also raising its concerns about Russian activities, and in close coordination with U.S. allies in Europe.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The questions ranged from the pandemic to Putin’s views on gender nonconformity (“a woman is a woman, a man is a man”) to whether Russians should prepare for a war.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Putin has warned NATO repeatedly against stationing missile defense systems in Ukraine similar to those in Romania and Poland, claiming that they could be secret offensive weapons capable of reaching Moscow within 10 minutes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Do we put our missiles close to U.S. borders?” he asked Thursday. “No! It’s the U.S. which has come to our house with its missiles — they’re on our doorstep already!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked about the comments, the senior Biden administration official declined to get into a “point-by-point with President Putin about what he meant by missiles and what he meant by ‘on his doorstep.’ ”</p></div></div>

<div><p>MOSCOW — A Russian court fined Google nearly $100 million Friday for “systematic failure to remove banned content” — the largest such penalty yet in the country as Moscow attempts to rein in Western tech giants.</p></div>
<p>The fine was calculated based on Google’s annual revenue, the court said. Roskomnadzor, Russia’s Internet regulator, told the court that Google’s 2020 turnover in the country exceeded 85 billion rubles, or about $1.15 billion.</p>

<div><div><p>Here is how Reid was remembered in the hours following his death.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Support for young Democrats</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Former president Barack Obama recalled Reid pushing him to run for the White House even as a first-term junior U.S. senator from Illinois.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you want to be president, you can be president now,” Reid recalled telling Obama in his 2009 biography.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is a centerpiece of Obama’s political legacy and was passed while Reid was the top Senate Democrat.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Harry Reid in retirement: Railing against Trump, bemoaning a broken Senate and making peace with Romney</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Humble Origins</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While he was known as the consummate inside player in the nation’s capital, Reid was also remembered for how his beginnings in the mining town of Searchlight, Nev., grounded his political career.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it,” Biden said in a statement. “That’s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades.”</p></div></div>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a longtime political foe of Reid, called his opponent’s rise a “quintessentially American story” that bore the marks of his “legendary toughness, bluntness, and tenacity.”</p>
<p>A onetime amateur boxer, Reid’s instinct to “fight for those hurting the poor and the middle class” guided his way, said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who was Reid’s successor as the Democratic leader in the Senate.</p>
<div><div><p>He “was tough-as-nails strong, but caring and compassionate, and always went out of his way quietly to help people who needed help,” Schumer said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) recounted a friendship with Reid that dated to their days in the Young Democrats organization.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Born in Searchlight, he grew up to become a beacon of hope and an example for so many who, like him, came from difficult circumstances but never stopped striving for the American Dream,” Hoyer said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Changing the nation’s political landscape</div></h3></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> the Las Vegas Review-Journal, a Nevada newspaper that has
<a> often clashed with Reid,</a> naming the exercise of “the ‘nuclear option’ of modifying the Senate’s infamous filibuster rule” among them.
<div><p>In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that Reid would be remembered “as one of the most impactful Leaders of the Senate in history, helping to steer this institution with reverence, principle and command.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“In the Congress, his strategic mind was legendary and unsurpassed — and he was a master of the legislative process during his service in both the House and the Senate,” Pelosi said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hidden warmth beneath a combative surface</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reid carried himself with a combativeness that once led columnist Molly Ivins to call him “charismatically challenged.”</p></div></div>
<a>tried to choke</a> the manager, Jack Gordon (later the husband of LaToya Jackson), before being pulled away by federal agents.
<a>died in a plane crash </a>along with seven others, including Ravitz’s boyfriend and a fellow Wellstone staffer.
<a>wrote</a> in a widely circulated Twitter thread. “The empathy and emotional fortitude he showed that day has stuck with me always.”
<a>Republicans recalled a less charitable moment</a>: Reid’s attack on Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) when the latter was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012. Reid
<a>had falsely accused Romney</a> on the Senate floor of not paying taxes for years, though Romney later released proof that he had paid millions in 2010 and 2011.
<div><div><p>When confronted by his false allegation years later, an unrepentant Reid defended his attack by saying, “<a>Romney didn’t win, did he?</a>”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Cheng</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:38 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Pope Francis lamented Wednesday that many<b> </b>couples are choosing to have pets over children, saying that a trend of forgoing child-rearing “takes some of our humanity away.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Today … we see a form of selfishness,” the pope <a>said</a>, according to translations in multiple reports. “We see that some people do not want to have a child.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Or, he said, they may have one or two kids — “but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>And last month, the pontiff warned that Italy’s declining number of births, which reached its nadir since the 1860s, may threaten the country’s future, Reuters <a>reported</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest</p></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, the alliance dispatched about 2,500 peacekeepers to Kazakhstan, the group’s secretary general, Stanislav Zas, told the Russian state new agency RIA. The report did not give a breakdown on nationalities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The stakes are especially high for Russia, effectively the leader of the alliance, as its presence risks alienating a public that is demanding a change in Kazakhstan’s regime but has yet to show any anti-Russian sentiment.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Kazakhstan will test Russia’s actual capabilities. It will be both distracting and sobering.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were been multiple reports of gunfire around the city throughout the day, and on Thursday evening Almaty police reported that additional “terrorists” were killed outside the Almalinksy district police station.</p></div></div>
<p>At least eight law enforcement officers have been killed, according to the Interior Ministry. More than 1,000 people have been injured in the protests, the Health Ministry said Thursday, 400 of whom have been hospitalized, with 62 in intensive care.</p>
<div><div><p>Kazakhstan’s Internet was blacked out Thursday and national banking services reportedly were suspended.</p></div></div>
<p>“It is a very awkward attempt to explain this threat in a very clumsy way so that it complies with the condition of the treaty that outlines the possibility of an intervention if one of the parties is under threat,” Dubnov added.</p>
<div><p>The alliance said forces from Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan would be deployed to Kazakhstan, with the primary goal of protecting state and military facilities. Moscow also sent paratroopers, the organization said.</p></div>

<div><div><p>State Department spokesman Ned Price called on all parties to resolve the situation peacefully.</p></div></div>
<a>previously complained</a> that such troops prop up pro-Russian separatist forces.
