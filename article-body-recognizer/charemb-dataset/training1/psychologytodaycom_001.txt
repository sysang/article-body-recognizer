<p>Published in the June issue of the Journal of Sex Marital <a>Therapy</a>, a <a>paper</a> by van Lankveld and colleagues explores intimacy as a predictor of <a>sexual</a> desire.</p>
<h3>Intimacy in a relationship</h3>
<a>romantic relationships</a>, we first need to define intimacy. To do so, it is helpful to refer to Robert Sternberg’s
<a>triangular theory of love</a>, which suggests love has three components: commitment, passion, and emotional intimacy.
<li>Commitment: Deciding that one loves another; the commitment to maintain the loving relationship.</li>
<li>Passion: Drives, impulses, and motivations leading to romantic <a>attraction</a> and sex.</li>
<li>Intimacy: Feelings of connectedness, closeness, and warmth.</li>
<p>Alternatively, we can think of emotional intimacy as emotional investment in one’s romantic partner and the romantic relationship itself.</p>
<p>As an aside, intimacy is important not just to romantic love but also to other <a>forms of love</a> (e.g., companionate love, consummate love) and other types of close relationships (e.g., between close friends, parent and child, siblings).</p>
<p>Intimacy plays a part in sexual relationships too; this will become clear as we explore the findings of the investigation by van Lankveld et al. concerning intimacy as a predictor of sexual desire in romantic relationships.</p>
<h3>Investigating the link between intimacy and sexual desire</h3>
<p>Sample characteristics: 134 individuals (87 females); mostly Caucasian (96% of men and 89% of women); average age of 42 years; average relationship duration of 15 years (1-47 years range).</p>
<p>Participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire for 7 days, 10 times a day (in response to a randomly emitted auditory signal from a specialized watch).</p>
<a>stress</a> related to daily hassles, and
<a>attachment</a> orientation (i.e.
<a>anxious</a> attachment and avoidant attachment).
<p>Intimacy was assessed using the following five items: “Towards my partner I now feel...‘intimacy’, ‘connectedness’, ‘love’, ‘tenderness’, and ‘warmth.’”</p>
<p>Stress related to daily hassles was measured by summing up the scores from these two items (regarding the activity the person was performing at the time): “I would rather do something else,” and “It takes effort to do this.”</p>
<li>Sample item from the anxious attachment subscale: “I worry a fair amount about losing my partner.”</li>
<li>Sample statement from the avoidant attachment subscale: “I try to avoid getting too close to my partner.”</li>
<h3>Intimacy as a predictor of sexual desire</h3>
<ol><li>Daily hassles and levels of anxious and avoidant attachment did not predict sexual desire.</li> <li>The level of intimacy did predict sexual desire an hour and a half later (this was no longer true three hours later).</li> </ol>
<p>Given the importance of intimacy, the next question is how to build intimacy (or strengthen it regularly).</p>
<h3>How can couples build intimacy?</h3>
<p>Intimacy has multiple components. In his seminal paper, Sternberg noted <a>intimacy </a>concerns the following feelings and behaviors regarding another person:</p>
<li>Having high regard for the person.</li>
<li>The desire to promote his or her welfare.</li>
<li>Able to count on him or her in times of need.</li>
<li>Sharing one’s possessions and innermost self with him/her.</li>
<li>Giving and receiving emotional support.</li>
<li>Intimate communication.</li>
<li>Valuing him or her in one’s life.</li>

<h1> Rebooting the Pleasure Brain: Why Good Sex Still Matters </h1>
<h2> Our ability to experience pleasure promotes well-being in times of stress. </h2>

<li>In the midst of the continuing coronavirus crunch, our political divide, and all things stressful, our capacity for healthy hedonism can heal.</li>
<li>Our relationship with our sexuality gives us a window into our relationship with pleasure, and the state of our emotional brain. </li>
<li>Sexual desire comes in different forms; we can have active desire and responsive desire. We need to understand this to manage our sexual selves.</li>
<li>Beyond active and responsive desire, there's another important factor that shapes our libidos: our unique erotic love style.</li>
<h3>Why pleasure still matters.</h3>

<p>As a sex therapist for many years, I’m frequently surprised and humbled by discovering something about <a>sexuality</a> that only a few years ago I would have misdiagnosed or not even imagined. </p>
<a>masturbate</a>?” If they say, “Yes, I do it regularly,” therapists look for pathology, psychological, or relationship issues with that person—maybe early
<a>trauma</a>—not understanding that they may just be
<a>therapy</a> has slowly inched closer to mainstream therapy, after being locked out for many years (though still not in some quarters) and, like looking through a microscope for the first time, we’ve found worlds we never knew.
<p>I’d like to address the world of asexuality here. </p>
<h3>Asexuality: It’s not just one thing</h3>
<p>Like other aspects of sexuality, it’s a spectrum. An asexual:</p>
<li>Can have a robust sex life, just with themselves. They have a strong desire and masturbate frequently but have no desire to be sexual with another person. </li>
<a>dopamine</a>, serotonin, phenylethylamine, and such—which diminishes over time. This is also known as limerence or, as young people call it, “love bombs.”
<li>Might be “demisexual.” That is, they are only sexually interested in people they have an emotional bond with. Without that, they do not have sexual desire or interest.</li>
<li>Is able to fall into <a>romantic love</a> but not have sexual desire. They can be and remain romantic without sexual interest with a partner or anyone else. </li>
<li>Might be “aceflux,” someone who fluctuates among the asexual spectrum. They go between asexual, graysexual, and demisexual. </li>
<p>Ready for even more labels? How about “allosexual”? These are people not on the asexual spectrum. When they fall in love with an ace, these sexual mismatches are being called “ace-allo” relationships. </p>
<h3>Why labels are important</h3>
<a>anxiety</a> over not knowing.

<h1> How Couples Dealing with Depression Can Still Find Sexual Fulfillment </h1>
<h2> A recent study tackles the issue of depression and sexual intimacy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Depression? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome depression</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Sexual dysfunction can result from depression and/or the antidepressants taken for depression.</li>
<li>Scholarship has examined relational uncertainty and interference as factors contributing to sexual issues in couples with diagnosed depression.</li>
<li>A Delaney study contributes sexual communication to the dynamics of sexual issues with depression.</li>
<li>Open sexual communication between partners is essential for effective problem-solving in couples with depression.</li>
<a>sexuality</a> is an essential step in obtaining greater sexual pleasure and dealing with issues that negatively impact one’s sexuality or relationship.
<p>A recent study brings communication to the forefront with issues of low sexual response for couples where one or both members of the dyad have <a>depression</a>.</p>
<a>antidepressants</a> or depression disrupt chemicals in the brain that may make sexual functioning more difficult. Symptoms of depression, such as
<a>stress</a>, can directly result in low libido. Whether it’s the condition itself or side effects from
<a>medication</a>, a doctor should be notified about sexual issues. But, that’s not the only part of the solution. Communication between partners also has a beneficial role in these matters.

<h3>Sexual Communication and Depression</h3>
<p>Together or separate, uncertainty and interference can cause a disconnect in a relationship, resulting in disrupting sexual functioning. Delaney suggested that there is a mediating variable to be considered — communication.</p>

<h1> How to Turn Yourself On: Tips for Erotic Living </h1>
<h2> Get your head in the game, and your body will follow. </h2>
<li>The first step in creating pleasure in and out of the bedroom is to cultivate a pleasure mindset. </li>
<li>Pleasure is not a luxury; it's a necessity for overall wellbeing.</li>
<li>Healthy hedonism is anything that feels good to an individual and is good for that person. It primes the pleasure mindset. </li>
<p>Pleasure is not a luxury; it’s a necessity for overall wellbeing. The subtitle of my book says it all: Understanding the Neuroscience of Pleasure for a Smarter, Happier, and More Purpose-Filled Life.</p>
<p>Designate time and space for feel-good fun. Block off a few hours each week to harness your <a>attention</a> and cultivate a healthy hedonism practice. </p>
<a>masturbation</a> or sex of any kind. Good sex–even with ourselves–starts outside the bedroom, and healthy hedonism primes the pleasure mindset.
<p>Turning On Starts With Tuning Into Your Capacity for Pleasure</p>
<p>If you have trouble sorting out how to prime your pleasure pump, just stay with the question: I wonder what could feel good and be good for me? </p>
<p>When we pose these kinds of questions, they can cook up in the crockpot of our awareness, stimulating our inner resources such that the creative juices–and new solutions–bubble up.</p>
<p>Start a Regular Self-Attunement Practice to Connect More Deeply With You</p>
<a>fantasies</a>, fears, wishes, and
<a>dopamine</a>–will dial up our lust for life.
<p>Create an Atmosphere of Seduction in Your Bedroom, Just for You</p>
<p>Nice clean sheets, a new comforter or blanket, soft lighting, candles, and incense can all help set the stage for the intention to celebrate pleasure.</p>
<p>Music primes joy. Create a mix of your favorite songs that get you in the mood. Play it for your partner when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Turn Off Social Media, Put Down the Smartphone, and Be Present</p>
<p>It’s the first requirement of getting turned on. Get your head in the game and your body will follow.</p>
<a>hormone</a> machine–the hypothalamus–which regulates everything, including our appetites for food and sex, our moods, even our waking and sleep cycles. Not getting enough natural sunlight has contributed to obesity,
<p>Fun fact: Did you know that sunlight goes directly from the back of the eye to the hypothalamus? </p>
<p>Walk outside for 15 minutes at least two times per day.</p>
<p>Do yoga. Do it by yourself or better yet with your partner. Focusing on the breath and the energy in the body is a fantastic way to get into an erotic frame of mind.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Connections Between Your Body and Brain’s Pleasure Centers</p>
<p>Experiment with learning how to play your own pleasure keyboard!</p>
<a>research</a> has shown, our bodies are wired for pleasurable sensations. You can dial up the volume of your sensations by strengthening the pleasure pathway, and repeated stimulation is key. Remember, neurons that fire together wire together.
<a>research </a>has shown the same is true in regard to the shaft and glans of the penis, testicles, and scrotum.
<p>We also have pleasure keys corresponding to areas adjacent to the genitals such as thighs, buttocks, and the small of the back. </p>
<p>Additional pleasure keys are wired to your non-genital erogenous zones such as lips, mouth, ears, and neck.</p>
<p>When you focus on specific keys, the sensations can differ. Connect the dots between pleasure places. When you play a number of these keys together, the sensations can blend, combine, and merge, into a crescendo.</p>
<p>Use Your Mind and <a>Imagination</a> to Turn Up the Volume on Pleasurable Sensations From Your Genitals.</p>
<p>My<a> research</a> participants lighted up their brain’s pleasure centers by just thinking about genital stimulation! For more details and instructions, see my good sex tool, <a>Touch Plus Imagery</a>.</p>
<p>Harness the Power of Relationship</p>
<p>Connect, connect, connect! From “hi there” to “hello, handsome,” the erotic begins with connection.</p>
<p>Start with your relationship with yourself. When you practice self-attunement, you’ll prime your pleasure pump. </p>
<p>Whether walking in the park or socially distancing in a store, when you're out, harness the fine art of small talk. A smile, a greeting, a <a>casual but pleasant interaction </a>have all been shown to boost mood, a great way to enhance our mojo. </p>
<p>Sizzle up Your Interactions.</p>
<a>sexual</a> potential and lifelong turn-on involves being willing to take risks with partners. Learn to be even more intimate, courageous, and
<a>assertive</a> in our relationships. Couples who learn how to take risks by penetrating each other’s psyches keep learning and growing together.
<a>resilience</a> and enhancing our ability to cope with stress, that it’s worth devoting time and energy to figure out what you would like to do simply because it’s fun.
<p>Pleasure and play–in and out of the bedroom–are keys to a life worth living!</p>

<h1> One Habit Brings Couples Closer </h1>
<h2> A ritual that can lead to greater empathy, and even intimacy. </h2>
<li>Women who read romantic fiction make love 75 percent more often than non-reading peers.</li>
<li>Eighteen percent of men read romances and download one-third of erotic audiobooks.</li>
<li>Romance in any story fosters relationship-centric conversations that might not otherwise occur without this pasttime.</li>
<li>Reading fiction, even memoir, adds to our understanding of social experiences, therefore enhancing our emotional intelligence.</li>
<sup>1 </sup>There are long-lasting health benefits when we lose ourselves in a book.

<a>stress</a> by 68 percent, according to University of Sussex researchers.
<sup>2</sup> What’s more, if you peruse text more than three and a half hours every week, you’re 23 percent more likely to live longer.
<p>Book sales have soared, providing mental escape; reading certain novels brought couples together figuratively, and then quite literally.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>A blogger, self-identified as a book snob who judged romantic fiction poorly, said, “Boy was I wrong, one good chapter can give my <a>sex</a> drive the boost it needs.”<sup>5</sup></p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Surprise: Both women and men read romantic fiction.</div> <div>Source: Lightfield Studios/123rf</div> </div> </div> </div>
<sup>6</sup> Women who read love stories make love nearly 75 percent more often than those who don’t read.
<p>When women relax their minds around loving emotion, heart rate, muscle tension, and <a>hormones</a> are influenced, tipping the scales toward a more erotic mindset. </p>
<a>intimacy</a> at risk. “Porn users are in danger of becoming attached to a mere fetish of impersonal sex,” writes John Gottman in What Makes Love Last, where he explains how porn rewires the brain and sabotages relationships.
<p>Publishers know these readers are savvy, educated, <a>empathic</a>. And not <a>shy</a> to communicate desires, which often equate to escape.</p>
<sup>12</sup> Perusing dialogue, interpreting character gestures forces us to stop, contemplate and connect with our real-life counterparts. This connotes higher
<a>emotional intelligence</a> (as is needed for intimacy) and positive health benefits.
<p>While fiction is fun, never underestimate a memoir, very much about human connection and often real love stories.</p>
<p>In No Time Like the Future, Michael J. Fox reflects upon his Parkinson’s, at the pinnacle of his <a>career</a>, and how he moved forward with his wife's help. </p>

<p>Recent novels with loving themes are plentiful. Wendy Wax lost her husband to COVID during lockdown as she worked on The Breakup Book Club, four unexpected female journeys, including the men in their lives.</p>
<p>Career ambition clashes with 20th-century reality as Belle da Costa Greene, born African American, passed as white, even to her lover. Without keeping her secret, she may never have become The Personal Librarian of J.P. Morgan. </p>

<p>More historical fiction shows the infamous protagonist in the past century's most talked about love story in a positive light if you read The Duchess: A Novel of Wallis Simpson.</p>
<a>psychoanalysis</a> and literature in How to Live, What to Do: In Search of Ourselves in Life and Literature. The back cover says: “Successful fiction, like successful
<a>therapy</a>, sets a mirror before us, in which we see not only the self we know but the self we don’t.”

<h1> If You Want an Orgasm, Stimulate This </h1>
<h2> Seeking the sweet spot for sexual climax. </h2>
<li>A cluster in the spinal cord known as LSt cells triggers sexual climax. LSt cells link stimulation in both the genitals and the brain.</li>
<li>Sexual climax is the same in males and females, both humans and animals.</li>
<li>Any part of the body, or the brain, can push LSt cells over the threshold to trigger an orgasm.</li>
<p>Who doesn’t want to have great sex and mind-blowing orgasms? This is an important concern for many, and in response, magazines and websites offer plenty of advice on how you can increase the frequency and intensity of sexual climaxes.</p>
<p>Men who want to please their partners are often told they need to pay <a>attention</a> to the clitoris. Indeed, for many women, clitoral stimulation is the best approach for achieving climax.</p>
<a>nervous system</a> that generates orgasm. Short for “lumbar spinothalamic,” LSt cells have been shown to activate whenever a male rat ejaculates.
<a>sexual climax</a> in humans, both male and female.
<p>In McKenna’s view, however, the explanation for female orgasm is quite simple. Both LSt cells and nipples are part of the basic body plan for mammals. In short, women have orgasms for the same reason that men have nipples.</p>
<p>Moreover, the genitals also have direct neural connections with the brain. This makes sense, given that sexual arousal can start from genital stimulation, but it can also begin with thoughts about sex.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean orgasm is inevitable if enough genital stimulation is applied. After all, both men and women can experience difficulty achieving orgasm, no matter how long they engage in sexual activity.</p>
