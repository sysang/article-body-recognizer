<h1> How Even a Bad Conversationalist Can Have Good Conversations </h1>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Ananian, Wikimedia, CC 3.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Some of my clients feel they’re bad at conversation. This composite essentializes it:</p>
<a>boring</a>. And then there’s that deadly silence—so awkward. So I tend to avoid talking to anyone I don’t already feel comfortable with. I know that hurts me professionally and personally but I don’t know how to improve.
<p>My clients have found these steps helpful:</p>
<p>1. Prepare a bit. What could you talk and ask about: family, work, current events, a hobby? Starting with small talk is just fine: It’s what helps people settle down.</p>
<a>climate change</a> but about the immediate environment: the room, the weather, the common reason the two of you are there. For example, “Hi, this is my first time at this meetup (or restaurant, conference, whatever.) You?
<a>attention</a> by asking a question. If you’ve screwed up, it's often
<p>I read this aloud <a>on YouTube.</a></p>

<h2> Even at a cliche gift time like Valentine's Day, a bit of smart planning helps. </h2>
<li>Avoid cliche gifts by considering what might evoke happiness, nostalgia, or comfort in the recipient. </li>
<li>Gifts related to the individual’s personality or personal needs may be appreciated. </li>
<li>The message contained in the card can be more important than the gift. </li>

<p>Of course, receiving a gift can feel meaningless, for example, the obligatory Christmas sweater, apology bouquet, regifted wine, and the cliche Valentine's Day candy,</p>
<p>But the right present and card can be much more.</p>
<p>It’s worth taking an extra minute to think. Put yourself in the recipient’s shoes. What would move the person, yes move the person, evoke <a>happiness</a>, nostalgia, or comfort? Examples:</p>
<a>career</a>-oriented person might welcome a personalized nameplate for their desk. The sensory person might welcome a scented beeswax candle in a shape you know s/he’d like, for example, a heart or an owl?

<p>Stress generally refers to two things: the psychological perception of pressure, on the one hand, and the body's response to it, on the other, which involves multiple systems, from metabolism to muscles to memory.</p>
<a>hormonal</a> signals, prepares an animal to meet a threat or to flee from it.
<a>fear</a> of losing your job when the boss yells—triggers a cascade of
<a>hormones</a>, including adrenaline and cortisol, that surge through the body.
<p>These hormones increase heartbeat and the circulation of blood to support quick action, mobilize fat and sugar for immediate energy, focus <a>attention</a> to track the danger, prepare muscles for movement, and more.</p>
<p>But this lifesaving response was meant to solve short-term, life-threatening problems, not extended difficulties such as daily traffic jams or marital problems—a few of the many challenges that can hijack the stress response today.</p>
<div> <h3> Why am I always stressed and anxious? </h3> </div>
<a>anxiety</a>. Society’s obsession with
<a>productivity</a>, the steady stream of digital information we consume, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and feelings of overwhelm may

<div> <h3> Why is education important for child development? </h3> </div>
<a>facilitate social learning</a>, build
<a>executive functioning</a> skills, and allow children to explore subjects they may not naturally be exposed to. Informal education typically allows them to cultivate their own interests and learn

<h2> What Makes Education Effective? </h2>
<div> <h3> Do “learning styles” matter in the classroom? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does movement promote learning? </h3> </div>
<a>children who are allowed to move in class learn better</a>, research shows, paying more
<a>attention</a> and achieving higher outcomes.
<div> <h3> Does homework help kids learn? </h3> </div>
<a>it should serve a specific purpose</a>—rather than just being busywork—and should be tailored to a child’s age and needs. 
<div> <h3> Is online learning as effective as in-person learning? </h3> </div>
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic—well-designed 
<a>distance learning</a> programs can bridge the gap. Research indicates that online programs that mix passive instruction with active practice, and that allow students to progress at their own pace, tend to be most effective.
<div> <h3> Is there a college mental health crisis? </h3> </div>
<a>suicide</a> per year. The reasons for this are complex, experts warn, but may be due to factors including the increased prevalence of social media, the financial and academic
<a>stress</a> of college, reduced economic opportunity upon graduation, and decreased
<a>resilience</a> among today's youth as a result of parental over-involvement.
<h2> How Can We Improve Education? </h2>
<div> <h3> Should school start at a later time? </h3> </div>
<a>later school start times</a> to account for this biological reality.
<div> <h3> Why do young children need recess? </h3> </div>
<a>cooperation</a> and conflict resolution skills.
<div> <h3> Do children need early academic training? </h3> </div>
<a>early academic training can produce lasting harm</a>. Some research has found that children in such programs do worse over the long term than children who spent preschool and kindergarten playing and socializing.
