<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Fact Check: Did Kyle Rittenhouse Prosecutor Point Gun at Jury, Telling Them to Convict?</h1><div> By Yevgeny Kuklychev <time>On 11/17/21 at 5:40 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Defense and prosecution delivered their closing arguments in the Kenosha County Court trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on Monday, November 15.</p>
<p>Rittenhouse is charged with five felonies including reckless homicide, intentional homicide and attempted intentional homicide. (The judge dismissed a misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.)</p>
<p>The defense insists Rittenhouse acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz during <a>Black Lives Matter</a> protests in Kenosha in 2020.</p>
<p>While making his closing statement, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger produced the weapon that Rittenhouse used during the shooting incident on August 25, 2020.</p>
<p>Binger then raised and pointed the weapon in the courtroom. The moment was captured by the court's cameras and multiple photographers in the room.</p>
<p>The video and images of the episode have since been widely shared online, accompanied by questions around Binger's handling of the firearm—including his appearing to put his finger on the trigger—and claims that he aimed the rifle at the jury.</p>
<p>One post on the r/Conspiracy subreddit, which gathered more than 2,800 upvotes as of Tuesday, included the courtroom photo with the caption: "This prosecutor pointed a gun at people and told them to find Kyle Rittenhouse guilty..."</p>
<p>Others accused Binger of "jury intimidation" and "recklessly break[ing] every gun safety rule known to man," with some outlets speculating that the rifle could have been loaded.</p>
<p>In the original <a>live broadcast</a> from the courtroom (timestamped at the two hours 46 minutes mark), Binger does indeed produce the firearm while demonstrating his assessment of Rittenhouse's actions in the run-up to the shooting incident.</p>
<p>Photos of that particular moment are limited to certain angles, as journalists are prohibited from taking photos of seated jurors in some states, including Wisconsin.</p>
<p>But pictures taken during breaks in the process show that there is a significant gap between the jurors' box and the public gallery—the gap that Binger appears to target.</p>
<p>Indeed, as several media outlets reported in their broadcasts of the trial, the weapon appeared to be pointed to the side of the courtroom.</p>
<p>"Binger [...] aimed the gun in front of the jury to demonstrate," Reuters reported in its coverage of the trial.</p>
<a>CNN</a>'s Omar Jimenez tweeted from inside the courtroom.
<p>"At one point, Binger raised the gun himself and pointed it at a wall to demonstrate the way Rittenhouse brandished his weapon in Rosenbaum's direction, which, according to Binger, provoked the fatal clashes," The Guardian wrote.</p>
<p>Additionally, the barrel of the rifle appears elevated to be significantly above the head level of seated members of the audience.</p>
<p>The claims that Binger was "intimidating" the jury to force a conviction are also inaccurate.</p>
<p>As is clear from the video, he is heard describing the events of the incident as he attempts to re-enact them. At no point during the demonstration does he say how the jury should vote.</p>
<p>Many of the posts claiming that the prosecutor failed to uphold gun safety protocols neglect to note that immediately before picking up the weapon, he clarified to the court that "I'm having detectives check it to make sure it is safe."</p>
<p>In fact, as Newsweek reported in its live feed, both the prosecution and <a>defense</a> attorneys at one stage wielded the weapon, and in both cases they "double-checked the gun was empty and safe."</p>
<p>While it is true that the prosecutor Thomas Binger did indeed briefly wield Kyle Rittenhouse's rifle in court, there is no indication that it was aimed at the jury.</p>
<p>The audio from the courtroom also confirms that at no point during the demonstration did Binger instruct the jury to produce a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no basis to the claims that the weapon was loaded or unsafe. Both Binger and—later—defense attorney Mark Richards stated that it was first checked by a weapons safety professional.</p>
<p>As the jury in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial deliberates, social media is awash with rumors about the planting of bricks across Kenosha amid concerns that protests could erupt after a verdict is delivered.</p>
<p>Social media and blog posts claimed that random unattended pallets of bricks were appearing in Kenosha. Some were accompanied by pictures and videos purporting to show the piles on the streets of the city.</p>
<p>Initial posts did not contain any visual evidence, but they referenced an audio file that was allegedly clipped from a publicly available database of Kenosha police communications, recorded between 12-1pm EST.</p>
<p>A Reddit post with the claim received nearly 2,000 votes before being archived, with several other posts on <a>Twitter</a> garnering hundreds of interactions.</p>
<p>It was also picked up and shared by a number of Telegram and 4Chan accounts, with limited engagement. Other posts, some containing images of brick pallets, continued to spread on Thursday.</p>
<p>The original claim appears to stem from a single piece of communication from a patrol officer on a police radio dispatch, which was clipped and shared on multiple social media sites as the basis for a wider narrative.</p>
<p>Newsweek was able to corroborate that the clip was indeed taken from the Kenosha County Public Safety online archive of police communications from November 16.</p>
<p>Taking the "bricks everywhere" phrase in its original context shows that they were not unattended nor did they "appear mysteriously" as some commentators claimed.</p>
<p>The phrase "bricks everywhere," though clearly referring to a single location that the officer investigated, was nevertheless taken out of context by those spreading the claims to imply that the patrol officer saw bricks all over the city.</p>
<p>The location of the alley ("near 22nd and 68th") mentioned in the dispatch is at least 1.4 miles away from the Kenosha County Courthouse.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment request from Newsweek, the Kenosha County Sheriff's office stated that it had not received any confirmed reports of "piles of bricks" in the area.</p>
<p>In an emailed response to a Newsweek inquiry, the Kenosha <a>Police</a> Department (KPD) stated that it has received "calls from concerned citizens reporting seeing these social media disinformation campaigns."</p>
<p>"We have been on the lookout for things that could be used as projectiles against police and infrastructure. Our officers have not found anything to substantiate any of the claims being made on social media," the KPD public inquiry officer wrote.</p>
<p>The KPD also published a Twitter update stating that it was aware of "numerous attempts by malicious actors to spread disinformation on various social media platforms," but that it found "no credible threat to public safety" to date.</p>
<a>Black Lives Matter</a> protests. Most of them have been debunked or shown to be misleading.
<a>confirm</a> discovering several piles of bricks amid George Floyd protests, though they emphasized that they did not find evidence that the materials were placed there by anyone linked to the protests.
<p>Notably, rumors that "authorities" would start "planting bricks" in Kenosha began to emerge in days prior to the time the police radio dispatch was sent.</p>
<a>George Soros</a> and Bill Gates, were behind the supposed provocations—echoing a common and debunked conspiracy theory trope popularized by QAnon.
<p>Most of the early posts on the topic didn't feature any visual evidence, instead linking back to the police radio call, or simply quoting, without full context, the phrase "bricks everywhere."</p>
<p>But those claims were later accompanied by images purporting to show the said piles, which in fact have been used misleadingly to support similar claims in past protests.</p>
<a>this</a> collage shows that it features
<a>images</a> that were previously
<a>shared</a> during the George Floyd protests last year (and even back then were used misleadingly), and some are even older.

<a>Donald Trump</a> has weighed in on the debate, contending that under President
<a>Joe Biden</a> California has seen gas prices surge to $7.50 a gallon, noting that people are paying four times more than when he was president.
<p>That's up from "$1.87 a year ago," Trump told Fox News on Sunday. "[People] knew they got gasoline for X dollars a tank, and now they can multiply it times four."</p>
<p>Gas prices have indeed been rising at a fast pace in recent weeks, driven by resurging demand as the U.S. economy recovers from the pandemic, supply-side constraints due to OPEC production cuts and lower domestic production in America.</p>
<p>Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration puts the regular gas price average in California at $4.532 per gallon as of November 15, while the national average was at $3.399 on the same date.</p>
<p>All of these figures, while indeed very high from the consumer's perspective, are significantly lower than what the former president said, regardless of which type of gasoline he may have been referring to.</p>
<p>Beyond the state averages, it is true that in individual counties or towns gas prices can be as much as double the national figure.</p>
<p>Last month's $7.599 price in Gorda, a small community in California's Monterey County, fueled outrage on social media.</p>
<p>While this price was extremely high, it was driven up by idiosyncratic factors—in this case, the town's remote location—and comparing outlier figures with national or state averages creates a very misleading picture.</p>

<p>First lady Jill Biden, an English professor, hosted a Christmas story-time session Monday with a group of Maryland schoolchildren, shortly after unveiling Christmas decorations at the White House, and the event has produced a controversial video.</p>
<p>Biden was filmed reading passages from a children's book she recently published, Don't Forget, God Bless Our Troops. Some of the footage emerged later in the video, which has gone viral.</p>
<p>The excerpt, which appears to be clipped from a full-length YouTube video of the reading, begins approximately six minutes into the recording. But the viral video has been doctored, with another audio track laid on top toward the end.</p>
<p>The child shouting the profanity, along with some adults screaming and cheering as the video slows down, can be heard at the 15-second mark. The audio is sourced from another viral video, dated June 18, 2019.</p>
<p>In the original clip, a young boy is heard screaming "Shut the f*** up!" at his teacher and calling her a "b****" during his school's end-of-year graduation party.</p>
<p>But in the Biden video, the first lady is not interrupted and goes on to explain her motives for writing the children's book.</p>
<p>Newsweek has not been able to determine who authored the edited video or for what purpose. Some accounts sharing it followed up with disclaimers that it is likely "<a>fake</a>," while others appeared to share it in earnest.</p>
<a>increasingly common</a> on social media and is sometimes used to target prominent political figures on both the left and the right. Even when shared as a meme or a joke, it can be weaponized and passed off as genuine by other accounts.

<p>The Biden Administration's economic policies have come under intense scrutiny following the release of the latest employment data, which significantly undershot the job growth expectations for November. President Joe Biden fired back at the critics.</p>
<p>Biden claimed that the U.S. is adding jobs at "record pace," with 6 million more employed since January.</p>
<p>"America continues to add jobs at a record pace and nearly 6 million new jobs have been created since I was sworn in on January 20. Our economy is moving in the right direction, but we have more to do," the President tweeted.</p>
<a>Eric Trump</a>, the son of former president
<a>Donald Trump</a>, calling it "the worst jobs number we've seen in a long time" in an interview with
<p>Though the two claims seem diametrically opposed, they are simply reflecting two sides of the same coin. Assessing the current state of the labor market, however, requires more nuance.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy added just 210,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the lowest since December 2020, and significantly below market expectations of 550,000.</p>
<p>The figures for the year so far, however, remain very strong. Unemployment across the country also fell by 0.4 percent in November; at 4.2 percent, the current level is closing in on the 60-year lows seen between 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p>For comparison, the highest annual employment growth of the Trump presidency was recorded in 2016 (+1.68 percent), while in his final year the COVID pandemic-induced hit on the jobs market resulted in a 5.86 percent drop.</p>

<a>report</a> by the Environmental Defense Fund in California on the state's natural gas infrastructure.
<p>The trove of around 9,000 pieces of communication from Meadows, which he provided to the committee before abruptly ceasing to cooperate, is continuing to fuel controversy.</p>
<p>One piece of evidence in the investigation—a text message sent by an unspecified "lawmaker," later revealed to be GOP Representative Jim Jordan—has come under scrutiny after several Republicans accused Schiff of "misrepresenting" its content.</p>
<p>Since then, several conservative politicians and outlets have attacked the chairman and the committee for supposedly misquoting the original text, with The Federalist appearing to inadvertently out Jordan as the sender.</p>
<a>Pentagon</a> Inspector General Joseph Schmitz. Russell Dye, Jordan's spokesman, claimed that the message was "altered" and "misrepresented" the original meaning.
<a>Donald Trump</a> Jr., have pounced on the claim, accusing Schiff of "
<a>doctoring messages</a>" and "
<a>evidence tampering</a>." Others took it even further, calling for the committee to be
<a>disbanded </a>and Schiff "indicted for conspiracy to commit treason by doctoring evidence."
<a>Fox</a> News legal expert, called for California State
<a>Supreme Court</a>'s ethics arm to consider revoking Schiff's law license.
<p>Schiff presented and read out an on-screen graphic of the message at the hearing, via video link.</p>
<p>It read: "On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the <a>Senate</a>, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all."</p>
<p>While Schiff didn't identify the lawmaker who sent the message by name, the Federalist's story on Wednesday appeared to identify Jordan as the sender and accused Schiff of purposefully distorting the text.</p>
<p>The message was provided to Newsweek by a committee spokesperson.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Jordan later confirmed that he was the sender and said the message was "misrepresented" because Schiff erased the final clause and the dash preceding it, replacing it with a period, and failed to disclose the edits.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Jordan's office for comment but did not hear back before publication.</p>
<p>A committee spokesperson, responding to a Newsweek comment request, admitted an error was made but said the graphic was not presented as an image or screenshot of the actual text sent by the lawmaker.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also explained that the graphic was provided to Schiff in that form, saying:</p>
<p>Legal experts appear skeptical about claims that the on-screen message amounted to a distortion of the evidence.</p>
<p>Eisen added that it is normal to excerpt portions of materials when you are presenting such material in graphic form during a congressional debate, as there wouldn't have been enough room for all the words in the original text.</p>

<header><div> <a>Health</a></div><h1>Fact Check: Have More Americans Died From COVID Under Joe Biden Than Donald Trump?</h1><div> By Yevgeny Kuklychev <time>On 12/21/21 at 7:52 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>The U.S. has hit another grim pandemic-related milestone, reaching 800,000 cumulative COVID-related deaths.</p>
<p>With cases rising again across the country as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus takes hold, politicians, journalists and social media users are taking stock of President Joe Biden's pandemic-handling abilities in his first year.</p>
<p>This week, multiple public figures and social media users attempted to directly compare how current and previous administrations fared in the battle against COVID by analyzing the cumulative number of deaths from the virus under each president.</p>
<p>Others simply posted death count figures that suggested more Americans fell victim to COVID under Biden than under Trump.</p>
<p>Some tied their claim to reports from Reuters and other outlets stating the total coronavirus deaths in the U.S. in 2021 have now topped those of 2020.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dated December 19, 2021, 803,593 people have died due to COVID since the beginning of the pandemic. </p>
<p>OurWorldInData's figure for December 19 is slightly higher, putting the total at 806,439 deaths. Of those, 351,754 deaths occurred in 2020, meaning that indeed there more deaths—nearly 455,000—in 2021.</p>
<p>While comparing the annual data is fairly straightforward, it becomes slightly more complicated when it comes to assessing the records of Trump and Biden's respective administrations.</p>
<p>December-January 2020 saw the strongest wave of the pandemic so far, meaning that those few weeks could tip the scales one way or another.</p>
<p>The inauguration of Biden marked the point at which his administration began implementing its own strategy to contain the virus.</p>
<p>Though some have argued that Biden's "real" count has to start two to three weeks later due to some cases being passed over from the previous administration, for the sake of simplicity we will choose January 20 as the dividing line.</p>
<p>On that day the cumulative U.S. COVID death count stood at 424,401, according to <a>CDC</a> data, meaning that fewer people have died under Biden—379,192 in total (up to December 19).</p>
<p>Finally, according to OurWorldInData, which relies on Johns Hopkins University figures, cumulative deaths stood at 412,892 as of January 20, still significantly more than the 393,547 recorded under Biden through to December 19.</p>
<p>Notably, the first confirmed coronavirus death to occur on U.S. soil was dated February 28, 2020. There were 327 days between the first American death and Trump leaving office, and 333 days from Biden's inauguration to December 19.</p>
<p>Using CDC data, 1,298 people were dying per day on average under Trump during his pandemic presidency, and 1,139 have died per day under Biden.</p>
<p>Inclusion of additional measures of the pandemic intensity, such as hospitalization rates, case numbers, and the strain on the health system, could also be considered in a more in-depth evaluation of the effectiveness of Trump and Biden's responses.</p>
<p>But focussing strictly on the death counts, the claim that more Americans were killed by COVID under Biden than under Trump is, at least as of December 19, inaccurate.</p>
