<h2>“WE DON’T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MEN”</h2>
<p>In the village of Nang Toeng, 45 embroiderers work with Bhukram. They are relatives, neighbours and friends who mainly farm for a living.</p>
<p>Embroidery is usually done when they are free and each piece can take weeks or months to complete. </p>
<p>The artisans are paid when they submit their work. The amount varies according to the intricacy and quality of the needlework.</p>
<p>For local women, this is a source of additional income for their families - one that does not require them to change their way of life.</p>
<p>Many people her age had to leave home to find jobs in Bangkok, she said, “but I don’t need to do that”.</p>
<p>Gradually, extra income from the commercial handicraft production has improved the life of many women in Nang Toeng. </p>
<p>“When my child asks me for money, the money comes from me - his mother,” Tavee said. </p>
<p>“We don’t have to wait for the men.”</p>
<p>Before the opening of the studio, Bhukram operated almost exclusively online through its Facebook page, which now has more than 33,000 followers.</p>
<p>Each collection contains a limited number of items. They are all unique and come with name tags and photographs of the artisans who created them - weavers, dyers, seamstresses and embroiderers.</p>
<p>A few days before the sale, photos of the garments will be posted online for customers to browse. Most of the products are usually taken within minutes once the sale begins.</p>
<p>Customers who cannot buy in time have to wait for weeks or months before a new collection is launched.</p>
<p>“I’m proud, especially when I receive compliments from customers. I’m even more proud when they want my work,” said embroiderer Areena Tabonglek.</p>
<p>Five years ago, she moved to Nang Toeng to take care of her mother. At that time, she had no job and only basic sewing skills. But working with Bhukram has changed that.</p>
<p>“Whenever Meaw posts our work online, I’ll keep checking it. When customers comment ‘Oh wow! It’s so beautiful!’ or write ‘Reserve’,” she said with a broad smile, “I’m proud, so very proud.”</p>
<h2>“I TRY TO IMITATE NATURE”</h2>
<p>Besides operating as a clothing brand, Bhukram also tries to communicate with society about preserving nature and the local way of life. </p>
<p>According to Meaw, the brand does it through its intricate designs, environmentally-friendly materials from nature and traditional production process that engages people in the community.</p>
<p>“I want people who see our clothes to think ‘the forest of Phu Phan is so beautiful and I want to tell others about it’. I want people in Sakon Nakhon to see how others appreciate it and how our brand is trying to talk about it,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>The message is also for its artisans - the local residents of Phu Phan. Their job requires them to closely observe the natural surroundings and use them as inspiration to create work.</p>
<p>For embroiderers like Tavee and Areena, they have to come up with their own design once they are assigned a concept for a piece of clothing. It could be a plain dress, jacket or scarf, which still needs to be decorated.</p>
<p>This is their canvas, where they tell a story of their home with needles and threads, feelings and imagination.</p>
<p>The wild daisy is her favourite flower because she used to make a crown out of them when she was a little girl. </p>
<p>Her embroidery may not exactly mirror its shape, she added, but she always tries to replicate its delicate petals and leaves, curves and gentleness when she works.</p>
<p>“I try to imitate nature as much as I can.”</p>
<p>In its early days, Bhukram had about 130 embroiderers. But as the brand grew, the number of its artisans has dropped to 45. </p>
<p>According to Meaw, every step of the production is time-consuming and requires attention to detail. Not only that, she added, the artisans also need to enjoy translating ideas into designs and keep improving their work.</p>
<p>“So, we only have perfectionists who stayed because they really love it,” she said.</p>
<p>In Thailand, Bhukram is popular among people who value nature-friendly handicrafts, as opposed to fast fashion.</p>
<p>Fast fashion refers to the mass production of inexpensive, trendy garments that are low-quality and disposable. The business model is common in Thailand and often employs low-paid workers.</p>
<p>Each year, various practices in the fashion industry have devastating impacts on the environment.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned every second and if nothing changes, “by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget”.</p>
<p>“Speed destroys many things,” Maew said. “Slowness, on the other hand, destroys the environment less.”</p>
<p>“I’m amazed by their embroidery, which requires a lot of attention and care. Their work isn’t produced en masse like other brands,” said Nitaya Onhan.</p>
<p>She took a flight from Bangkok to Sakon Nakhon with her friends and drove for an hour to the village so that she could meet the artisans and buy their work.</p>
<p>“There is plenty of apparel with embroidery but for many brands, it doesn’t tell a story,” said another customer, Chalunthorn Boonwattanaphon. </p>
<p>“What I really like about Bhukram is their stories, which often have animals like buffaloes and paddy fields. It’s like I was transported there and got to share the experience with the embroiderer.”</p>
<p>The new studio in Nang Toeng is full of people. </p>
<p>A hum of conversation can be heard on the ground floor, where customers gather around rows and shelves of garments.</p>
<p>Outside, a man in an indigo jacket fills the air with his music from a bamboo mouth organ. Above him, a curtain of raw cotton on white strings flutters in the breeze.</p>
<p>A group of local women sit in a circle on the grass. Their wrinkled hands move with precision as they work with cotton from the fields, turning it into fine threads. </p>
<p>One day, these thin fibres will turn into clothes and echo the story of nature and the small village where they grew.</p>

<h1> The Singaporean illustrator who brought art into Facebook’s offices </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Melson gave birth to her second child last year, just as the country went into its first circuit breaker. The pandemic and motherhood, she told me, created a hiatus that allowed her take a break, take stock and reinvent her work. </p>
<p>She’s back at it these days, but more selectively, taking on work that she finds really meaningful.</p>
<p>HI KRISTAL, WHEN DID YOU FIRST THINK YOU WANTED TO BUILD A CAREER IN ART AND DESIGN?</p>
<p>A few months before my O Levels. we had a graphic designer come in to speak to us and I was really mind-blown. Like, wait, that kind of work exists? I think I can do that! </p>
<p>I then worked really hard on my O Levels to make sure I got into the Visual Communication course at Temasek Polytechnic.</p>
<p>As I got older and my future was starting to define itself, my parents were concerned. Being an illustrator or designer wasn’t common at the time. </p>
<p>I always struggle with this title thing. Illustrator? Artist? Graphic designer? Doing a lot of things gets me pumped up and a great or fun idea energises me. </p>
<p>If I had to choose I would say artist because those ideals or belief systems are at the core of everything I work on.</p>
<p>DO YOU THINK IT’S HARD OR EASY FOR YOUNG ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS TO MAKE THEIR MARK TODAY? WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE THEM?</p>
<p>It’s a long game. You can’t define yourself overnight and you are constantly evolving. You are creating that conversation with yourself that you want to keep having. </p>
<p>I believe that having that discipline to keep working not only sharpens the work but also helps you to find ways to balance feeling satisfied. </p>
<p>YOU SPENT SIX AND A HALF YEARS WITH FACEBOOK AND TWO OF THOSE AS A CURATOR. THAT SOUNDS FASCINATING. WHAT DOES A CURATOR AT FACEBOOK DO?</p>
<p>Essentially, we curated art for the Facebook offices. I was a regional curator for the Facebook Artist in Residence programme.</p>
<p>YOU’VE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE SINGAPORE ART SCENE OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. WHAT ARE YOUR PERCEPTIONS OF HOW IT HAS EVOLVED?</p>
<p>I find most people who have an interest in collecting are keen to own a (Takashi) Murakami or a KAWS because there is a market for that hype and there’s definite resale value. I totally understand it because I’d love to own art like that.</p>
<p>I make notes constantly or make small sketches when I have an idea. I try to leave them for some time to "bake". </p>
<p>In the last few years, I have been trying to put more intent into the work, so there’s a lot of refinement and experiments before I feel something is ready.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT WHAT YOU DO?</p>
<p>WHAT IS AN AVERAGE DAY IN YOUR LIFE LIKE THESE DAYS?</p>
<p>Early mornings I spend with my kids, either breakfast or getting them ready if they are not staying home with me. I try to sketch or develop work that is ideation-based while I have the most focus. </p>
<p>I want to be very present as a mum so if I do say yes to a project, my rule is that it’s something that can be creatively satisfying.</p>
<p>WHAT INSPIRES YOU THESE DAYS?</p>
<p>Definitely my babies. I am experiencing things through them, which has been amazing because often I’m witnessing them seeing something for the first time. </p>
<p>My son is obsessed with marine life, so I think that is creeping into my work. We live in Katong, so I think that mix of old and new is a great backdrop for ideas.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU BUSIEST WITH NOW? ARE YOU FOCUSING ON YOUR ART OR TAKING UP MORE COMMERCIAL ASSIGNMENTS OR TAKING ON ANOTHER CORPORATE POSITION?</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Charity's staff missing in deadly Myanmar attack that left bodies burnt </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Aid group Save the Children said it was suspending operations in Myanmar's strife-torn Kayah state after two staff members went missing in an attack that left at least 30 people dead, including women and children, with many bodies burnt.</p>
<p>The two staff were travelling to their home villages for the year-end holidays when they were caught up in the violence in the eastern state, Save the Children said in a statement late on Saturday (Dec 25).</p>
<p>"We have confirmation that their private vehicle was attacked and burned out," the statement said.</p>
<p>Opposition groups on Saturday blamed the military, which seized power from a civilian government in February, for the carnage on Friday near Mo So village of Hpruso town.</p>
<p>Junta spokesman General Zaw Mun Tun did not answer his telephone on Sunday. Reuters could not independently verify Saturday's accounts of the attack from a local resident, media reports and a local human rights group.</p>
<p>State media reported army troops had fired on and killed an unspecified number of "terrorists with weapons" from armed opposition forces fighting the military government.</p>
<p>Photos shared by Karenni Human Rights Group and local media showed the charred remains of bodies on burnt-out truckbeds.</p>
<p>A villager told Reuters on Saturday that he had seen 32 bodies, while Save the Children said at least 38 people were killed.</p>
<p>The London-based charity said it had suspended operations in Kayah and parts of neighbouring Karen state and in the Magway region.</p>
<p>“We are horrified at the violence carried out against innocent civilians and our staff, who are dedicated humanitarians, supporting millions of children in need across Myanmar," said Save the Children's chief executive, Inger Ashing.</p>
<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military on Feb. 1 overthrew the elected government of Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been sentenced to four years' detention and faces multiple other criminal charges.</p>
<p>At least 1,375 people have been killed and more than 8,000 jailed in crackdowns on protests and armed opposition since the coup, according to a tally of the Association for Assistance of Political Prisoners.</p>
<p>The military government disputes those numbers and says soldiers have also been killed in clashes.</p>

<div> <p>CNA Lifestyle talks to the 30-year-old chef and entrepreneur about the passion that goes into making and reinventing heritage foods.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Earlier in the year, I began to notice that several of the ones that I trust — i.e. the ones who pay for their own food — were all ordering a gorgeous and authentic-looking Indonesian bakmie from a brand I had never heard of, Indocin Food.</p>
<p>TELL ME ABOUT YOUR UPBRINGING. YOU HAVE OPENLY TALKED ABOUT COMING FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS ON INSTAGRAM. WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE GROWING UP?</p>
<p>HOW AND WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER AND INTEREST IN FOOD AND COOKING?</p>
<p>YOU STARTED WORKING PRETTY YOUNG. WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB?</p>
<p>I started working at Burger King Parkway Parade at 13. Back then, they paid me S$3.30 per hour, but the free flow Coca Cola was what attracted me to stay for a year.</p>
<p>ON INSTAGRAM, YOU’VE SAID THAT FB IS A GREAT INDUSTRY FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE EXCELLED IN SCHOOL. CAN YOU ELABORATE?</p>
<p>From my personal experience, FB employers favour skills and commitment over academic achievements. We don’t need a degree to do mise en place.</p>
<p>CENTURY BAKKWA’S PACKAGING SAYS IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1988. I ASSUME YOU WERE NOT EVEN BORN THEN. IS THIS A FAMILY BUSINESS?</p>
<p>The Century Bakkwa master recipe was created 33 years ago. It was founded by a bakkwa maestro, who had been selling charcoal grilled handmade bakkwa since 1988. A friend introduced us and we hit it off right away.</p>
<p>He entrusted me with his recipe and craft and I am honoured to continue this tradition and carry on the heritage. This is how Century Bakkwa was born and how we are producing his original bakkwa, along with other variations and food items.</p>
<p>YOU’VE JUST OPENED A PHYSICAL STORE FOR CENTURY BAKKWA. DO YOU THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE AS OPPOSED TO BEING A PURELY E-COMMERCE OPERATION?</p>
<p>HOW AND WHEN DID YOU START INDOCIN AND MIE BIAN BIAN?</p>
<p>YOUR FB BRANDS (NOT COUNTING HEXAGON) SEEM TO CELEBRATE HERITAGE. HOW IMPORTANT IS HERITAGE TO YOU?</p>
<p>HOW MUCH RD GOES INTO THE PRODUCTS YOU SELL?</p>
<p>DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR? WHY RUN SO MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES CONCURRENTLY?</p>
<p>Actually no... I am just a cook. I just like to cook. I like experimenting with food. I work six days a week in the kitchen. On my off day, I will cook at home. I don’t know what I will do if I don’t cook.</p>
<p>AND YET YOU ARE ALSO A BUSINESSWOMAN.</p>
<p>YOU SEEM TO HAVE LED A COLOURFUL LIFE WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER. WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNT FROM THOSE DAYS?</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE HARDEST PART OF RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT YOU?</p>
<p>Despite being so outspoken on social media, people who have met me in person are often surprised by how quiet I am.</p>
<p>YOU SEEM TO HAVE REALLY LONG DAYS. CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH AN AVERAGE DAY IN YOUR LIFE?</p>
<p>On an average day, I will try to avoid bringing my son to school myself as he will often convince me make a detour to somewhere else, like McDonald’s! Hahah. I will go down to the wet market to hunt for fresh produce.</p>
<p>I LOVE HOW HONEST AND BLUNT YOU SOMETIMES ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS?</p>
<p>HOW DO YOU STAY MOTIVATED AND INSPIRED?</p>
<p>To be honest, my customers’ feedback is my motivation. I review every single customers’ feedback. The good feedback keep me motivated, the bad ones inspire me to be better.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE A YOUNG SON. IF HE SAID HE WANTED TO BE A CHEF OR A RESTAURATEUR WHEN HE GETS OLDER, WILL YOU ENCOURAGE HIM?</p>
<p>ANY COOL UPCOMING NEWS OR PLANS YOU WANT TO SHARE?</p>
<p>Currently we are entering our 3rd phase of RD for our Hainanese iberico satay. It will be available at Century Bakkwa in mid-September 2021 for a limited time only. Look out for it.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> More than 100 Japan flights cancelled due to heavy snow </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: More than 100 domestic flights in Japan were grounded on Sunday (Dec 26) due to heavy snow in the northern and western parts of the country, Japan's two biggest airlines said.</p>
<p>ANA Holdings had halted 79 flights as of 4pm local time (3pm Singapore time), affecting about 5,100 passengers, said Hiroaki Hayakawa, an operations director for the airline.</p>
<p>Japan Airlines Co had cancelled 49 flights as of 4pm local time, affecting 2,460 passengers, a representative with the airline's operations division said.</p>
<p>Worldwide, <a>thousands of flights have been cancelled</a> over the Christmas weekend because of the rapid spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant.</p>
<a>threat from Omicron</a>, has reported only about a dozen cases of community spread of the new variant and 231 total Omicron infections, including overseas arrivals, according to the health ministry.

<h1> Creative Capital: They have stylish paper furniture that people can actually sit on </h1>
<div> <p>These sit up to three adults but can fold up to the size of a dictionary. We had a chat with co-founder Dylan Eng on the story behind Singapore-based lifestyle brand PAPERplain Market’s unique offerings.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Yes, paper. The pieces that are sold by founders Dylan Eng and Fiona Foo, are made from paper, and yet nonetheless, have form, weight and can hold a pretty enormous amount of weight. </p>
<p>They are also classy and elegant. Even more impressive, most of the pieces can be folded up and put away, which makes them perfect for living in small spaces. </p>
<p>I caught up with 34-year-old co-founder Dylan Eng to chat about his unique company.</p>
<p>HI DYLAN, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF. WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, WERE YOU ALREADY INTERESTED IN DESIGN?</p>
<p>I came from a small village in Kuantan, Malaysia. Back in my younger days, I didn’t have a lot of opportunities to travel – my only “playground” would be my father's boat workshop where he built boats. </p>
<p>My father influenced me very much in having a heart for interiors. We made cute little stools and tables from leftover wooden planks. We even made doors sometimes. </p>
<p>HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN SINGAPORE AND WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE? </p>
<p>Singapore has sheltered me for nine years. Not to be cliched, but it was love that brought me here to Singapore. Needless to say, better work opportunities and higher salaries have also helped keep me here. </p>
<p>I went into engineering instead of interior design. Yet, I am now doing something in interiors. Expect the unexpected is one of my mantras.</p>
<p>That said, I would love to go to a design school. I just have a heart and head for cool and current stuff.</p>
<p>PAPERPLAIN IS A SIDE BUSINESS, YES? </p>
<p>Engineering is definitely my forte and I’m still at it. PAPERplain is more of a side project to fulfil something that has been circling in me for the longest time. It is kind of like an art project but also one that has commercial potential.</p>
<p>HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR BRAND? </p>
<p>I would love to say that PAPERplain is a design company, but we are not there yet. At present, we are more of a B2C platform for interesting art and living products. PAPERplain hunts down and discovers products with a tale to tell.</p>
<p>WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR PAPERPLAIN? </p>
<p>My co-founder and I believe that true luxury lies in real comfort at home. PAPERplain yearns to create aesthetically pleasing, yet functional, home and living products.</p>
<p>WHO IS YOUR CO-FOUNDER? </p>
<p>I started the business with my dear friend, Fiona Foo. PAPERplain is, in so many ways, the apple of her eye. We met each other ages back. She is actually so much more than just a good friend and a business partner, she is my family in Singapore. </p>
<p>In terms of the business, Fiona is responsible for all the “headache” accounting, purchasing and taking care of inventory. I handle the marketing and creative presentation parts, and running whatever random errands the business demands.</p>
<p>HOW ARE YOU CREATING THESE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY? </p>
<p>We’re fortunate that we are currently able to tap on OEM (original equipment manufacturer) designs. The factory we work with designs and manufactures the products according to our requests. </p>
<p>But, in the long term, we definitely have plans to develop our own collection. We already have designs in the pipeline and are very much looking forward to sharing our very own collection soon.</p>
<p>YOU GUYS LAUNCHED IN 2019? HOW HAS BUSINESS BEEN? </p>
<p>WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER? AS IN, HAS THERE BEEN A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC THAT YOUR WORK APPEALS TO MORE THAN OTHERS? </p>
<p>So far, the customers are quite varied. We have got young to old couples who just got their new BTO flats or condos and have been cracking their heads on how to host more guests with limited storage space for furniture. </p>
<p>WHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST PART OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY SO FAR?</p>
<p>Even though we have been selling our products online, the result is just not as great as compared to trade fairs, shows or markets. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have been very fortunate to have been able to consign our products to Etch Bolts. We always encourage potential customers to drop by to try the product before purchase.</p>
<p>AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST PART?</p>
<p>IS THERE A HERO PRODUCT?</p>
<p>In the construction field, honeycomb sandwich walls are well-known for their lightweight yet durable functionality. Most of our paper furniture is constructed with this honeycomb structure. </p>
<p>As an engineer myself, I am thoroughly amazed by the honeycomb paper structure that is able to withstand 300kg of weight per square meter, as well as the accordion design that makes the pieces so space saving. </p>
<p>One of the top-selling products is our LOUNGE III. When closed, it is about the size of a dictionary but, when expanded, it can accommodate three adults. Amazing, isn't it?</p>
<p>I AM ASSUMING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF YOUR PRODUCTS. JUST HOW DURABLE ARE THEY?</p>
<p>HAS THERE BEEN A DESIGN THAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO CREATE BUT IT JUST WOULDN’T WORK PHYSICALLY?</p>
<p>We have bold and imaginative ideas for our new collection. I would say everything is possible, it is just a matter of cost efficiency and development cost. We are slowly getting there though.</p>
<p>WHAT WOULD BE YOUR DREAM PROJECT?</p>
<p>A collaborated collection with talented people – that could be someone from fashion, fine arts, etc.</p>
<p>WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR PAPERPLAIN? </p>
<p>MUJI is a muse and inspiration for us. I hope that one day, PAPERplain comes to mind when people think of lifestyle. That would be amazing.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China replaces Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: China has replaced Chen Quanguo, who as Communist Party chief in the Xinjiang region oversaw a security crackdown targeting ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in the name of fighting religious extremism.</p>
<p>Chen, 66, is a member of China's politburo and is widely considered to be the senior official responsible for the security crackdown in Xinjiang. He was sanctioned last year by the United States.</p>
<p>On Thursday, US President Joe Biden signed into law a ban on imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labour, provoking an angry Chinese condemnation.</p>
<p>Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments, as well as the US secretaries of state in both the Biden and Trump administrations, have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs genocide.</p>

<h1> Creative Capital: This speech therapist wants people to 'drink serious teas less seriously' </h1>
<div> <p>No meditation and zen required, says Li Hongyuan of online teashop Pekoe Imp, who is taking a leaf out of coffee connoisseurs’ book to inspire appreciation for single origin teas.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Hongyuan herself had to overcome that in her own journey with tea. But this speech therapist is on a mission to change that. I love her motto, “drink serious teas less seriously”. </p>
<p>DID YOU ENJOY TEA AS A CHILD?</p>
<p>Not particularly. I had a simple childhood and tea didn't feature at all in my growing-up years. I have the same memory as many Singaporeans do and that is Chinese tea is that bitter stuff that you drink at the temple. </p>
<p>DID YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC TEA EPIPHANY?</p>
<p>Single origin refers to tea, whose harvest and production can be traced to a single region, farm or location. Single estate teas from Anglo-Indian regions then had the clearest indication of origins and harvest periods. </p>
<p>They invited us to sit down while they brewed tea for us. When they served it, we were blown away. It was an elegant darjeeling tea and I was all the more impressed because this was a through-and-through Chinese teashop. </p>
<p>TELL US ABOUT THOSE LESSONS.</p>
<p>It also helped that the other tea students were very helpful and we explored tea studies together. Some of the senior students took the time to explain the concepts to us. It was like a little tea community. </p>
<p>The latter is my preferred learning style, and the amalgamation of the two approaches helped me retain a cultural and spiritual appreciation for tea while working with it in a technical way.</p>
<p>HOW ELSE DID YOU BUILD YOUR EXPERTISE?</p>
<p>The sweet flavours were so clear and soft, while the texture of the tea was extremely smooth. I told my friend that I felt somewhat melancholic because that was a tea that I probably will never get to taste again in my life. </p>
<p>DOES PEKOE IMP FOCUS ON CHINESE TEAS OR ALL KINDS OF TEAS?</p>
<p>I have met tea enthusiasts who only drink Chinese tea because they feel that it has the longest history. Thus, the brewing techniques are the most polished and the teas, the best quality. I can understand why they think that way. </p>
<p>WHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN FROM RUNNING SMITTEN THAT YOU APPLIED TO STARTING PEKOE IMP?</p>
<p>Coffee folk taught me to taste and identify flavours, understand the organic chemistry behind how flavours work, and that a collaborative spirit is important to promote specialty coffee appreciation in Singapore. </p>
<p>IS PEKOE IMP YOUR FULL-TIME BUSINESS SINCE YOU ARE ALSO A SPEECH THERAPIST?</p>
<p>I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD A CO-FOUNDER PREVIOUSLY?</p>
<p>I met my co-founder J at Smitten. She was a regular customer and was into flavours in not just tea, but also other types of beverages and foods. </p>
<p>When we started Pekoe Imp, the focus was on tea workshops. Because we had spent a lot of effort learning about tea, we wanted to share the knowledge in a way that was approachable and fun. </p>
<p>J was with the business for two years and chose to leave to pursue other interests. But without her, I wouldn't have started Pekoe Imp.</p>
<p>DO YOU DEAL MORE WITH BUSINESSES OR DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS?</p>
<p>Good-quality single origin teas can be considered pricy to serve in a cafe setting compared to the usual blends, so I am very grateful that these cafes would like to serve these teas.</p>
<p>HOW DO YOU SOURCE YOUR TEAS?</p>
<p>HOW CAN SOMEONE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SO-SO, GOOD OR GREAT TEA?</p>
<p>One such tea is the Japanese gyokuro, which many can tell is complex and interesting because it can taste like sweet, brothy seaweed soup due to the umami, but they may not like to drink it. </p>
<p>WHAT IS THE BEST TEA TO GIVE SOMEONE WHO IS NEW TO SINGLE ORIGIN TEAS?</p>
<p>My friends and I always encourage new tea drinkers to try the dancongs first. These are a group of Teochew teas, which have naturally sweet and fragrant flavours that often mimic natural fruits or flowers. </p>
<p>The best dancong ambassador is definitely the Honey Orchid Dancong; it tastes of lychees. My current favourite of the dancongs is the Pomelo Blossom Dancong, which has a hint of pomelo as an end note.</p>
<p>YOU ALSO SELL BEAUTIFUL TEA CUPS, POTS AND ACCESSORIES. IS THAT AS MUCH OF THE BUSINESS AS THE TEAS THEMSELVES?</p>
<p>HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?</p>
<p>The pandemic has not affected my business too much, except that we do not get to do workshops or sell at events and markets, which takes away the in-person interaction with our customers. </p>
<p>I noticed that more people have picked up tea appreciation as a hobby due to the pandemic, so in a sense, the pandemic contributed to the growth of the single origin tea or kungfu cha community.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE COLLABORATED WITH FOSSA CHOCOLATE. HOW HAS THAT BEEN?</p>
<p>WHAT’S YOUR VISION FOR PEKOE IMP?</p>
<p>We definitely want to be the name that pops up when people talk about good single origin teas, and a teashop that is geeky but fun and approachable at the same time. </p>
<p>No meditation and zen required. I think our tag phrase sums up our values well. We drink serious teas less seriously.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> No trips for Afghan women unless escorted by male relative: Taliban </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KABUL: Afghanistan's Taliban authorities said on Sunday (Dec 26) that women seeking to travel anything other than short distances should not be offered transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative.</p>
<p>The guidance, issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also called on all vehicle owners to offer rides only to those women wearing Islamic hijabs.</p>
<p>"Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72km) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member," ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhajir told AFP on Sunday, specifying that it must be a close male relative.</p>
<p>The guidance, circulated on social media networks, comes weeks after the ministry asked Afghanistan's television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors.</p>
<p>The ministry had also called on women TV journalists to wear hijabs while presenting.</p>
<p>Muhajir said on Sunday that the hijab would also be required for women seeking transport. The ministry's directive also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles.</p>
<p>The Taliban's interpretation of the hijab - which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering - is unclear, and the majority of Afghan women already wear headscarves.</p>
<p>Since taking power in August, the Taliban have imposed various restrictions on women and girls, despite pledging a softer rule compared with their first stint in power in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In several provinces, local Taliban authorities have been persuaded to reopen schools - but <a>many girls still remain cut off from secondary education</a>.</p>
<p>Early this month, the Islamist group issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader <a>instructing the government to enforce women's rights</a>.</p>
<p>The decree did not mention girls' access to education.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> Hundreds queue for passports in bid to leave Afghanistan </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Activists hope that the Taliban's battle to gain international recognition and get aid flowing back into one of the poorest countries in the world will lead to them making concessions to women.</p>
<p>Respect for women's rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid.</p>
<p>Women's rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban's previous stint in power.</p>
<p>They were then forced to wear the all-covering burqa, only allowed to leave home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education.</p>

<p>JAKARTA: Weighing up to 150kg and growing up to 3m long, the Komodo dragons are the world’s largest lizards only found in Indonesia’s Komodo National Park and neighbouring Flores Island.</p>
<p>The cannibals eat deer and pigs, and are even capable of attacking humans with their shark-like teeth and poisonous venom.</p>
<p>Despite that, the scaly-skinned animals attract many people to the World Heritage-listed Komodo National Park, which is known for its unique savannah landscape.</p>
<p>“The Komodos are interesting because they have a character unlike any other animal,” tourist guide Yon Johannes in Labuan Bajo, Flores, told CNA, adding that they live on the edge of forests or savannahs.</p>
<p>It is believed the Komodos have existed for millions of years, but they face increasing threats from climate change and infrastructure projects. </p>
<p>There are only about 3,000 Komodo dragons in the wild and the IUCN said the impacts of climate change are threats to the rare animal.</p>
<p>Human activities such as cutting down forests to make way for infrastructure projects could also threaten the Komodos’ habitat and their existence, said researchers interviewed by CNA. </p>
<p>With IUCN’s reclassification of the monitor lizards, locals have called for the government to reconsider the ongoing projects and pay more attention to environmental protection. </p>
<p>The government, on the other hand, said the IUCN acknowledged that the lizards in the national park were well-protected. The infrastructure projects there were only meant to upgrade old facilities, a minister added. </p>

<h2>RISING TEMPERATURE, SEA LEVELS THREATEN KOMODOS’ HABITAT </h2>
<p>The IUCN announcement came after a peer-reviewed paper stressed that global heating would affect the Komodo dragons. Thus, urgent conservation actions are needed to save them from extinction. </p>
<p>The organisation said rising global temperature and sea levels as a result of climate change were expected to reduce the Komodo dragons’ suitable habitat by at least 30 per cent in the next 45 years. </p>
<p>Herpetology curator Evy Arida, who has researched the Komodos extensively, said IUCN’s classification is justified given the number of the Komodos. </p>
<p>“This endangered status is a warning that Indonesia does not take its endemic animals seriously,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr Wiratno, director general of natural resources and ecosystem conservation with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said he was aware of the findings.</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that the IUCN said Komodo’s subpopulation in the national park was stable and well-protected. </p>
<p>He claimed that the problem was with the lizards in Flores, which is not part of the Komodo National Park. The giant lizards there are under the care of the local government.</p>
<p>“We have been monitoring the Komodo’s population for 17 years in the national park.</p>
<p>“And we protect them by holding patrols, as well as by ensuring their prey such as deer and buffaloes are not being hunted,” Mr Wiratno, who goes by one name, said.</p>
<p>He claimed that the IUCN had never been to the Komodo National Park and he did not understand how the organisation came to its conclusion.</p>
<p>Mr Wiratno opined that the IUCN should have consulted the Indonesian government. </p>
<p>“We have installed chips on about 1,200 Komodo dragons, under their skin.</p>
<p>“We have something like a barcode and if we catch one, we know whether it is one which we have identified before or a new one. We have enough data,” Mr Wiratno told CNA. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, he said officials have yet to identify rising sea levels as a threat. </p>
<p>“We know the Komodos’ behaviours and habitats. It is dangerous for them to be near the beach. </p>
<p>“So we will need to predict the sea levels and how far the sea could reach,” said Mr Wiratno.</p>
<h2>ONGOING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS </h2>
<p>Mdm Arida of Bogor’s Zoology Museum said many human activities in Flores endanger the Komodos. These include hunting, smuggling of the animal and burning of the savannah, which causes deer, the Komodos’ prey, to migrate.</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is also concerned about infrastructure projects in the Komodo National Park.</p>
<p>About two years ago, the Indonesian government started to develop the Komodo National Park as part of an integrated tourism master plan for the site and Labuan Bajo, a town west of Flores which is the gateway to the park.</p>
<p>Some have dubbed the infrastructure project “Jurassic Park” after images of a Komodo believed to be on Rinca Island facing a truck went viral last year. </p>
<p>Speaking at a virtual press conference on Sep 6, Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno said the current constructions did not violate any World Heritage rules and were meant to repair rundown facilities. </p>
<p>“What has been done, including in the Komodo National Park, was repairing rundown facilities which were fragile and needed renovation, such as shelters for the rangers and so on. And these were according to the needs.</p>
<p>“And it is not like what people have been discussing, as if it is a massive development. We can guarantee it is not like that,” said Mr Uno. </p>
<p>The minister also said that the projects would be completed by October or November, in time for Indonesia’s G20 presidency as the park would be one of the meeting venues. </p>
<p>The new plan would entail certain restrictions to allow sustainable tourism, he added.</p>
<p>Commenting on the infrastructure projects, Mr Wiratno of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry said they were mainly to renovate the old information centre and build an elevated deck for visitors’ safety. These do not affect the OUV, he added.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are Komodo dragons there, but none of them have been a victim of the development,” he claimed, adding that the development projects were only on Rinca Island. </p>
<p>However, Mr Cypri Jehan Paju Dale, an anthropologist at Kyoto University’s Center for Southeast Asian Studies who researches on conservation, ecotourism and interspecies co-existence at Komodo, was not convinced. </p>
<p>“The Indonesian government and business communities should take the IUCN report and UNESCO’s reminder seriously. </p>
<p>“The central government should revise the whole master plan of tourism development inside Komodo National Park and annul all the business concessions,” he said.</p>
<p>Commenting on the environment ministry’s claim that the development projects only affected 1.3ha of Rinca island, Mr Dale said the effects of such activities were far-reaching. </p>
<p>While the giant lizards only live on several plots in the coastal areas with water sources and forests, the rest of the terrestrial and marine areas are the supporting habitat, he said. </p>
<p>The visitor centres and resort concessions said to be taking place at the islands would harm the specific habitat of the Komodo dragons, he added.</p>
<h2>DO NOT DISTURB THE KOMODO DRAGON: LOCALS</h2>
<p>Mr Johannes, the tour guide in Labuan Bajo, confirmed many developments were taking place in the town and its surroundings.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of developments here, from infrastructures to new properties, so the pollution levels here are unusually high,” said the Labuan Bajo native. </p>
<p>Another tour guide, Mr Ahmad Fadil, said he was concerned about the well-being of the Komodos.</p>
<p>Labuan Bajo-based Muhammad Sunardi said he was also very worried about climate change and the developments in the area. </p>
<p>He pointed out that the developments on Rinca Island, currently closed for visitors, could be useful for tourists, but the animals could suffer. </p>
<p>“As a local, I hope the government would consider developments that do not disturb the Komodo dragons. The government should not just think about itself and the stakeholders in developing this Komodo tourist destination.” </p>

<h1> Indonesian tofu seller who dropped out of school makes it his life mission to spread love for reading </h1>
<div> <p>Rudiat started off by giving children free tofu and lending them books at the same time. These days, he serves dozens of keen readers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kiki Siregar </a> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: It was 6am and the sun had just risen in Pasirhuni village, West Java, but Rudiat was already busy sorting out many books.</p>
<p>The tofu seller placed dozens of books in two boxes at the back of his motorbike, along with another box containing bundles of tofu. He then headed off to several villages in the rural Cimaung district.</p>
<p>Selling tofu has been Rudiat’s main source of income for the past decade or so. However, he regards spreading literacy as his life mission.</p>
<p>When he visits his customers in the villages, the 43-year-old also lends them books. </p>
<p>“I bring books which suit them. If I go to a village where the majority of my tofu customers are farmers, I will bring along books about farming like how to raise ducks.</p>
<p>“But if the villagers are mostly housewives, I will lend them books about parenting and topics like child rearing,” he told CNA. </p>
<p>Although he earns about 1.5 million rupiah (US$105) per month, lower than West Java’s minimum wage of about 1.8 million rupiah, he has always set aside 2.5 per cent of his income to buy books. </p>
<p>Rudiat, who goes by one name, has bought around 3,500 books since he started working 25 years ago. He also has about 2,500 books from donors who learned about his volunteer work.</p>
<p>“I call them tofu books. If there is tofu, there are books. Books make you smart and tofu makes you healthy,” he said, adding that he does not mind even if the books are not returned.</p>
<p>He even visits tea plantations in Pangalengan about 20km to 30km away from his home to bring tofu and books to villagers. The feather in his cap was a meeting with President Joko Widodo to share his experience.</p>
<h2>TAUNTED FOR DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL</h2>
<p>Rudiat was raised by his single mother who worked odd jobs. After finishing fourth grade, he had to drop out of school due to financial difficulties. </p>
<p>“Children in my neighbourhood would bully me. “They said I’m the dropout kid and called me mean names,” he recounted.</p>
<p>However, Rudiat refused to be demoralised. “I vowed to myself that I can still make it in life even though I didn’t finish school,” he said.</p>
<p>At the age of 19, he started working at a tofu factory and decided to set aside 2.5 per cent of his salary to buy books, inspired by the Islamic obligation of zakat.</p>
<p>Rudiat would bring them to work and read in his spare time. “I wanted to show that by reading, I can develop myself.”</p>
<p>A year later, Rudiat found the love of his life, a junior high school graduate who was also fond of books.</p>
<p>They tied the knot and each brought along three books when they moved in together.</p>
<p>He said when he was out of a job in early 2000, his wife did not mind spending 2.5 per cent of her monthly income from working at a paper recycling factory to buy books.</p>
<p>He later got a job at a garment factory but decided to quit in 2008 to make and sell tofu since he had the know-how from his previous job.</p>
<p>By then, Rudiat already had a collection of books and his neighbours would frequently borrow them.</p>
<p>Convinced that other villagers would have a love for reading - and especially since there is almost 100 per cent literacy rate in West Java province - he would fill his bag with five to 10 books daily for his tofu customers.</p>
<p>Initially, they were not that enthusiastic. He decided to approach the children first by giving them free tofu and lending them children books at the same time.</p>
<p>Slowly, the other villagers became aware of his gesture. He observed that people do have the desire to read, if the books are in line with their interests. </p>
<p>Thus, he decided to bring along books that dovetail with the professions or demographics of the villagers.</p>
<p>It took Rudiat about two years to cultivate a group of loyal readers. In 2010, he decided to install three boxes at the back of his motorbike so he could bring along more books daily and cater to their requests.</p>
<h2>RECOGNITION FROM THE PRESIDENT</h2>
<p>Over time, some officials in Bandung regency, West Java invited Rudiat to spread literacy to children in a few villages.</p>
<p>He was even tasked to educate youngsters in a village where there was a lower literacy rate and some instances of delinquency.</p>
<p>Local authorities also helped Rudiat to set up a small library next to his house and even a foundation. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, education ministry officials also learned about his initiative. In 2016, they offered him a scholarship to travel to Singapore and later write about what he had observed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Rudiat went to the immigration office to apply for a passport, he fell from his motorbike and injured his arm and chest. </p>
<p>Due to his injuries, he lost some of his strength and can no longer make toufu personally. Subsequently, he decided to purchase tofu from a manufacturer and resell them as he brought his books to the other villages. </p>
<p>The accident also forced him to cancel his trip to Singapore.</p>
<p>In 2017, Rudiat got another surprise. A man claiming to be the president’s assistant called him and said he was invited to the palace in Jakarta to celebrate National Education Day with Mr Widodo and a few other literacy activists.</p>
<p>“I first thought it was a prank," Rudiat recounted.</p>
<p>“When I saw the president, I thought I was dreaming. Is this real?”</p>
<p>“This is beyond my expectation because my dream was buried when I had to drop out of school.”</p>
<p>Rudiat revealed he is working towards a loftier goal. “I want to build a free school which can benefit a lot of people.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Climate education still a ‘peripheral topic’ in Southeast Asia’s syllabus amid calls to make it compulsory </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jack Board </a> </div> </div>
<p>“A big part of educating for sustainability is finding that reconnection with nature that humans have lost over the years. It’s embedded in everything we do,” said Sal Gordon, the school’s head of teaching.</p>
<p>“It’s the rain, it’s the mud, it’s the snakes, it’s the gardens, it’s the rice fields. Our campus and nature itself is part of our classroom.” </p>
<p>Learning facts and taking tests, elements of schooling ingrained in classrooms across the globe, are replaced by projects with real-world applications and impact.</p>
<p>“Education has been stuck in a time capsule for 200 years. It’s out of date but if you can change that model you will automatically start educating for a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>At upcoming climate change talks in Glasgow next month, a coalition led by non-governmental organisation EARTHDAY.ORG will be pushing for climate change education to be made compulsory in every classroom in the world.</p>
<p>Right now, it is largely absent from national curriculums and only taught piece-meal by enthusiastic teachers or forward thinking schools, the former spokesperson for the UNFCCC told CNA.</p>
<p>At present, Italy is the only country to have placed climate change and sustainability at the core of its school curriculum. Beginning in September last year, students aged between 6 and 19 have had these topics engrained into their daily lessons.</p>
<p>In addition, reductions in climate change vulnerability to extreme weather events and temperatures in the developing world could be realised simply by educating young women.</p>
<p>“Technology will get you so far, but what you need is a behavioural change that comes through education. Because you need citizens to be able to hold governments to account for their inspiring actions or their failed decisions,” Nuttall said.</p>
<p>“You need to build a green consumer movement and you also need to build the entrepreneurs and creative skills for the new kinds of technologies, policies, business models that some people broadly call the green economy,” he said.</p>
<p>“This case is being made very clearly right now. Why are we educating young people about climate change? It’s their future and it’s going to be a very different future.”</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, a region already feeling the impacts of climate change, the rollout of education programs with an emphasis on sustainability has been slow.</p>
<p>While some countries have provisions for sustainability in their education plans, there are gaps, inconsistencies and inequities. </p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) admits the hurdles are steep in this region, despite some positive signs of a willingness to take education on sustainable development (ESD) more seriously. </p>
<p>In a policy review report this year, it concluded that climate change education (CCE) “has not emerged as an independent field” and is “still very much in its infancy” in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The divide between urban and rural schools, international schools and state schools and those in national languages against ethnic dialects is a problem for education generally. But it widens when it comes to climate change topics.</p>
<p>“Already there are deeply embedded inequalities in education where access to equitable education for the poor is a major challenge,” said Faryal Khan, a programme specialist for education, based at UNESCO in Bangkok.</p>
<p>“Do they have access to climate change education? And are their teachers prepared? This is questionable. We can guess somewhat at the answers. It’s not a very equal situation.” </p>
<p>But Khan says there are signs of slow progress. The Adiwiyata Green Schools program in Indonesia tries to integrate ESD into the classroom and create an eco-friendly atmosphere for environmentally-conscious students.</p>
<p>Thailand and Vietnam both have sustainability built into their national education frameworks, while Philippine schools have largely focused on individual actions, with students taught to care for in-school gardens and understand waste management,</p>
<p>Activists there are hoping to persuade regional education departments to include tailored lessons about climate adaptation and broader science about the man-made causes of climate change. </p>
<p>While frameworks and guidelines are in place, UNESCO wants to see improved national level policies that filter down to schools of all kinds.</p>
<p>“While countries are making advances, some of the challenges that remain are at the policy level,” Khan said.</p>
<p>“ESD is interpreted with a very narrow focus on topical issues rather than with a holistic view and there are gaps between governments’ initial policy commitments and implementation.</p>
<p>HOW CAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS MOVE FASTER?</p>
<p>“That’s a big shift for national systems because they’re rooted in the idea of memorising content to prove you’re intelligent, you’re ready for the workforce and you’re ready for the world,” she said.</p>
<p>“It will take some of these young people to get into those systems and be given voices in those systems to really enable that change to happen.” </p>
<h2>CLIMATE MATERIALS FOR CHILDREN</h2>
<p>The lack of government-mandated climate education has opened the door to education entrepreneurs to fill a gap.</p>
<p>“Our whole mission and belief is that if you build these sustainable habits at a young age, then being a conscious citizen that cares about the planet comes as naturally to these kids as brushing their teeth,” Lamba said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of evidence that shows this is true. It can also nudge the adults around them as well,” she said. </p>
