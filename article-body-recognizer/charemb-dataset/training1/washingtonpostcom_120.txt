<div><p>Republican David Perdue traveled to Donald Trump’s Florida golf club, Mar-a-Lago, in February with his mind made up: He did not want to run for Georgia governor against his longtime friend, incumbent Brian Kemp, he told associates.</p></div>
<p>Trump hosted Perdue for two more golf outings in the months that followed, commissioned a poll to show that Perdue could win, and then urged him on at a September rally in Perry, Ga., both from the stage and during a private gathering of donors.</p>
<div><div><p>In a video released Monday morning, Perdue accused Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who both refused Trump’s entreaties to reverse his defeat in Georgia last year, of dividing Republicans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Look, I like Brian,” Perdue said. “This isn’t personal. It’s simple. He has failed all of us and cannot win in November.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Privately, the governor’s allies blasted Perdue for losing his Senate seat and said Republicans should not to be swayed that looking backward to 2020 is the way to hold on to the governorship.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Either way, both candidates will emerge from the primary “bruised and broke,” another strategist said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Brian Kemp has failed Georgia,” the former president added. “He caved to Stacey Abrams before the 2020 Election and allowed massive Election Fraud to take place.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump wants to campaign in Georgia next year as part of the race, according to an adviser: “He’ll take any chance he can get to criticize Brian Kemp.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Erick Erickson, a GOP radio show host in Georgia, said he received overwhelmingly negative calls about Perdue jumping in, with most of the callers saying they do not want to see a bruising primary.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As Abrams enters governor’s race, Georgia becomes a key 2022 battleground</p></div>
<div><div><p>Compounding the challenge for Republicans: Abrams faces no competition for her party’s nomination.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who leads the Republican Governors Association and has also incurred Trump’s wrath for certifying his state’s 2020 result, has indicated that the group would back the incumbent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Former vice president Mike Pence recently addressed the RGA and said he would help all incumbent Republican governors get elected, according to people with knowledge of his remarks.</p></div></div>

<div><p>An update on what the Jan. 6 commission has learned so far. And how the pro-Trump Internet descended into infighting in the year since the attempted insurrection.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ashley Parker</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jacqueline Alemany</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 15, 2021 at 9:04 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>But now his proximity as Trump’s former gatekeeper and top aide has thrust Meadows into legal jeopardy — even as the revelations in the texts and his new book also threaten his standing with Trump.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> test was kept hidden. And Meadows has now stopped cooperating with the Jan. 6 committee after first supplying thousands of pages of damning material, leading to a House vote this week holding him in contempt of Congress.
<div><p>The panel’s months-long investigation has revealed the myriad ways in which Meadows is inextricably bound to the Jan. 6 attack, serving less as chief of staff than chief enabler to a president who was desperate to hold onto power.</p></div>
<div><p>New details emerge on Meadows’s role in trying to overturn election</p></div>
<div><div><p>But former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that, as with past Trump chiefs of staff, there was probably a limit in how much he could control access to the president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A representative of Meadows declined to comment, and a representative for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<p>One person who interacted directly with Meadows said he regularly served as a conduit for information from conspiracy theorists and others who believed the election was stolen, often sharing the information with Trump and others in the government.</p>
<a>“Italygate”</a> — about how an Italian defense contractor had somehow conspired with senior CIA officials to rig the election by switching votes from Trump to Biden.
<div><div><p>“He was trying to please the president,” said Pillsbury, describing Meadows’s role. “He was living and breathing to serve Trump.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The juicy Mark Meadows texts Liz Cheney just disclosed</p></div>
<a>a Washington Post analysis</a>.
<p>Trump is also particularly upset about a passage in which Meadows describes him sitting in bed sick with covid-19 in the White House residence, writing that Trump had “red streaks” in his eyes and that “his hair was a mess.”</p>
<div><div><p>“This guy is talking about what I look like, in my bedroom,” Trump griped recently to one confidante.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A 51-page report released by the committee Sunday night, as well as other disclosures, paint a more complete picture of just how integral Meadows was in the days leading up to insurrection, as well as on Jan. 6 itself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meadows also oversaw a West Wing staff that, in the post-election period, regularly perpetuated false claims of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Jan. 6, Meadows served as a key point of contact for panicked lawmakers, allies, journalists and even Trump family members, who sent desperate texts pleading with him to convince Trump to call off the angry mob at the Capitol.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m pushing hard. I agree,” Meadows responded to Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., after he said his father needed to condemn the violence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, said Wednesday that the committee was startled by the information Meadows was trafficking.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The GOP plotted to overturn the 2020 election before it was even over</p></div>
<div><div><p>Thompson added, however, that it still remains unclear whether Meadows provided these fringe theories and documents directly to the president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s something we want to look at,” Thompson added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People who worked with Meadows accused him of engaging in rhetorical gymnastics, often tailoring his message — and even his facts — to please his audience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meadows also disseminated information about alleged election fraud in Pennsylvania to some Justice Department officials that they later determined to be unsubstantiated, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At other times, Meadows shared information about fraud claims with senators, asking them to study the material.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meadows was also key to recruiting Cleta Mitchell, a prominent conservative lawyer who argued on Trump’s behalf and was present on the call with the Georgia secretary of state, a senior campaign official said.</p></div></div>
<a>gathered at the Willard Hotel</a> a block from the White House in advance of Jan. 6 to strategize on how to overturn the election.
<div><div><p>Whipple argued that Meadows has earned himself an inglorious spot in the history books.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It used to be that there were a lot of contenders for worst chief of staff in history,” Whipple said. “That’s no longer the case. Meadows owns it by a country mile.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>GOP candidates are flocking to Mar-a-Lago to pay Trump for the privilege of hosting their events</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Josh Dawsey</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>David A. Fahrenthold</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 16, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<b> </b>pool, U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker of Georgia raised more than $1 million for his campaign and an allied super PAC.
<div><div><p>The following evening, Donald Trump dined at his private Florida club with about 20 couples, each of whom paid $250,000 to the Make America Great Again Again super PAC, a group run by close allies of the former president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two days later, Turning Point USA, a conservative group for young Americans, held a sprawling event at Mar-a-Lago, where organizers said Trump’s presence was the key to attracting 750 guests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The disclosures will also show that the total number of fundraisers held at Trump properties in 2021 is far greater than the 30 identified so far by The Post, according to club members and Trump advisers familiar with the events.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said the rush of paid GOP events at Trump’s club is “indicative of how powerful of a hold he has on the party.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zelizer noted that while other former presidents have given paid speeches or taken seats on lucrative boards, they did not rent property to candidates while serving as GOP kingmaker and contemplating another White House run.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It‘s like a party boss, with one of his homes being the place for wheeling and dealing and picking the next Senate candidate,” Zelizer said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Taylor Budowich, a Trump spokesman, said the former president’s properties — including his Bedminster club in New Jersey — are sought after by those running for office on the right.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vast majority of the fundraisers held at Trump properties this year have taken place at Mar-a-Lago, the members-only club that now doubles as Trump’s home for much of the year.</p></div></div>
<p>Other groups have paid Trump’s business to host events that honor him or former first lady Melania Trump. And sitting U.S. senators have held events at his properties, even as he attacks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).</p>
<div><p>Trump’s D.C. hotel made millions from foreign governments but still struggled, federal documents show</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some candidates have gravitated to Mar-a-Lago because donors are eager to visit the club and meet Trump, and because Palm Beach is a place where many wealthy contributors live.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some candidates hold events at the club because they are still hoping to get his endorsement, according to consultants familiar with their thinking.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>had been endorsed by him by the time of their fundraiser. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), was endorsed by Trump on the very day he held a lunch fundraiser at the club in April.
<div><div><p>Holding an event at a Trump property doesn’t guarantee a candidate will get his backing.</p></div></div>
<a>backing </a>Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) for the Senate seat. Brooks, who had loudly echoed Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election, held his own fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago two weeks after Trump’s endorsement. (Blanchard has since
<a>ended </a>her Senate bid and launched a campaign for governor.)
<div><div><p>A Trump spokesman did not respond to a question about whether candidates who hold events at his properties have a better chance of getting his endorsement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The club has drawn business this year from both federal and state candidates, including nine people running for Senate, six running for the House, four for governor and one for state attorney general.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Paxton was indicted in 2015 on charges of felony securities fraud, a case that has not yet gone to trial amid numerous legal challenges. Paxton’s campaign did not reply to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When Trump took office, Mar-a-Lago was the center of Palm Beach’s busy — and lucrative — charity ball circuit. It hosted dozens of events a year, including galas that cost $250,000 or more.</p></div></div>
<a>canceled </a>their events, and most
<a>stayed away</a>, reducing one of the club’s largest income streams.
<a>shrink </a>by four locations, and it is now seeking to
<a>sell </a>a fifth — Trump’s hotel in Washington, which lost millions during his presidency as his politics drove some customers away.

<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic in 2020, Mar-a-Lago’s revenue actually went up that year to its highest level since 2017, according to Trump’s financial disclosures.
<p>“He can bring people to the table who will write checks,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who held a golfing fundraiser with Trump in May that raised more than $1 million, according to the Graham. “He has real juice.”</p>
<div><div><p>Blake Masters, a U.S. Senate candidate in Arizona, held a fundraiser at the club in November. Trump has not endorsed a candidate his race.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was joined by at least five other candidates for different offices who also attended the Walker fundraiser, Trump advisers said. A representative for Mandel did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Dec. 4 Turning Point event marked the fifth time the nonprofit group had held its gala at Mar-a-Lago, spokesman Andrew Kolvet said.</p></div></div>
<a>video </a>taken at the event, Trump called Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley a “f---ing idiot” for the way he oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
<div><div><p>Guests included country singer Travis Tritt, who sang a patriotic tune for the crowd, and attendees were able to view a Heisman trophy and greet football player Doug Flutie.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Contributors who paid for access to a private dinner were served <a>Trump wine</a> with their meal, and the former president took photos with at least 50 donors who had contributed the highest amounts.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Rosalind S. Helderman</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 16, 2021 at 12:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the investigators reexamining the 2020 election results in Wisconsin on behalf of the GOP-led state legislature is the president of a group that unsuccessfully sued to overturn the vote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another worked as a deputy in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, which was known for weeding out people perceived as disloyal to President Donald Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A third is an Arkansas lawyer who represented Trump’s campaign during last year’s Wisconsin recount, a process that <a>confirmed</a> President Biden won the key swing state by roughly 20,700 votes.</p></div></div>
<a>to reexamine the 2020 election nationally</a>, makes little pretense of neutrality and is being led by figures who have shown allegiance to Trump or embraced false claims of fraud.
<p>The former president personally lobbied state lawmakers to pursue the Wisconsin investigation and spurred on other ballot reviews around the country, leaning on legislators to revisit the vote more than a year after Americans went to the polls.</p>
<div><div><p>“It would be a crisis,” Mandell said. “People haven’t been paying attention because there are bigger fires elsewhere. But there aren’t more fires anywhere.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>'It is a threat'</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Election experts say Wisconsin has now lapped Arizona — where <a>a Republican-commissioned election</a> review drove national headlines for months — as the leading front line in the war over the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p>
<i>is</i> a threat. I think it’s designed specifically to try to intimidate.”
<p>On Monday, Wisconsin state Sen. Kathy Bernier (R), who chairs the Senate’s elections committee, urged Gableman to quickly conclude his investigation, calling the “constant drumbeat” of fraud accusations “a charade.”</p>
<div><div><p><b> </b>“There’s a simple explanation for almost every single thing that people accuse election officials of doing,” said Bernier, who previously served as a county clerk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she feared Gableman is ginning up voter anger based on falsehoods.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gableman did not respond to requests for comment. He has said publicly that he’s not trying to overturn the election and believes no legal mechanism exists to return Trump to office.</p></div></div>
<p>During testimony to a legislative committee earlier this month that occasionally turned combative, Gableman said he will ultimately be judged only on his team’s final product, which he said has been delayed by uncooperative local officials.</p>
<div><div><p>No substantive evidence has emerged of problems in the vote in Wisconsin, and multiple past reviews have confirmed Biden’s narrow win there.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A recount of the ballots in Wisconsin’s two most Democratic-leaning jurisdictions requested by Trump last year failed to alter the outcome. <a>State</a> and <a>federal</a> judges also rejected challenges to the state’s vote.</p></div>
<p>In addition, two lengthy reports produced in recent months examining the conduct of the Wisconsin vote both recommended changes to rules over absentee balloting and other practices, but found no support for theories that the election was stolen.</p>
<div><div><p>Vos and other state lawmakers also say they hope to use Gableman’s final report to guide new legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Tuesday, the Assembly speaker <a>told</a> the Associated Press that Gableman’s probe will take longer and cost more than he originally predicted, blaming uncooperative Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A sweeping review</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gableman, who served on the state Supreme Court for a decade, was hired by the Republican-led Assembly in August and authorized to spend as much as $680,000 on his review of the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He has said his investigation will take any steps necessary to review all aspects of how the 2020 election was administered.</p></div></div>
<a>Documents</a> obtained through public records acquired by the watchdog group American Oversight
<a>revealed</a> that Gableman is running his investigation out of a Wisconsin strip mall office space that is shared through a subleasing agreement with the Thomas More Society,
<a>a legal nonprofit that had ties to Trump’s legal team</a> and was involved with lawsuits last year seeking to overturn the election.
<div><div><p>Gableman told the Assembly that the arrangement will save taxpayers money.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the discussion, Gableman complained about criticism of his efforts and Democratic resistance to his inquiries and asked for support for his investigation, according to the people.</p></div></div>
<a>urged </a>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” votes necessary for him to win the state.
<div><div><p>Mitchell declined to comment, saying in a text message that she doesn’t “speak to callers from leftwing fringe outlets.”</p></div></div>
<a>“interim report”</a> of his findings that he posted to his team’s website —
<div><div><p>During his Dec. 1 presentation to the state legislature, he told lawmakers that he believed election officials in Wisconsin may have committed wrongdoing, in part because of their resistance to his subpoenas.</p></div></div>
<a>when the office worked to hire</a> Trump loyalists to the government.
<div><div><p>In April, Kloster wrote <a>an online column</a> about Wisconsin’s election that began: “Right off the bat, let me say this: the 2020 presidential election was stolen, fair and square.”</p></div></div>
<a>his resume</a>, which was submitted to Gableman and posted online by American Oversight.
<div><p>Lancaster also represented an Arkansas woman who sued Biden’s son Hunter, alleging that he fathered her child. Hunter Biden agreed to pay child support, settling the politically embarrassing case not long before the 2020 election.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Lancaster declined to comment. Kloster and Heuer did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>'We did not break the law'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gableman has said his team has an open-door policy to hear complaints of possible problems with the election,<b> </b>and that the focus on his staff is an attempt to distract from legitimate concerns about the vote.</p></div></div>
<a>formally recommended</a> that the county’s district attorney charge the five commissioners who voted for the procedure before the November election with election fraud and misconduct in public office, both felonies, along with three misdemeanors.
<div><div><p>Racine County District Attorney Patricia Hanson, an elected Republican, did not respond to a request for comment about whether she plans to accept his recommendation and press charges.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“You can say, ‘There was no election fraud and the election was the most safe and secure in the history of the country,’” he said. “And they will say, ‘Well, what about Racine?’ ”</p></div>

<b> </b>according to three people familiar with their meeting.
<div><div><p>Political consultant Jeff Roe, who clashed with Trump in 2016 while working for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), at the time a Trump campaign rival, made the trip in recent weeks after the former president agreed to see him.</p></div></div>
<p>Trump had complained to aides that he wasn’t getting enough credit for helping Youngkin (R) secure his Nov. 2 win, according to the three people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>
<div><div><p>“Trump was upset that he didn’t get proper credit,” one of the three said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Between Trump acolyte and suburban dad: Inside the many faces of Virginia GOP’s Youngkin</p></div>
<div><div><p>It was not clear whether Roe, founder of Axiom Strategies, made the trip at Youngkin’s behest. Roe declined to comment, as did a Youngkin spokesman.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Roe has many other clients — and a palpable desire to capitalize on the win in Virginia, where he helped a political novice beat veteran Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a state that Joe Biden had won a year earlier by 10 points.</p></div>
<div><div><p>During his meeting with Trump, Roe asked the former president to endorse some of his other clients, according to two Trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Roe also critiqued some of the president’s current advisers, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, and said he wanted to return and see Trump soon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump remains skeptical of Roe, said two people familiar with the former president’s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But after winning the GOP nomination and Trump’s endorsement, Youngkin stopped dropping Trump’s name while still leaning into the culture-war themes popular with the ex-president’s fans.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>in the immediate aftermath of the election. He granted his first post-election interview to a Trump favorite — Fox News’s Tucker Carlson — and gave a nod to Trump, though just in passing and not by name.

<div><div><p>The payments are expected to continue over the coming months, and the executive committee could approve amounts beyond $1.6 million if it chooses, the people familiar with the decision said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>James and Vance have said their probes are not politically motivated. James has promised in the past to use her perch to investigate Trump and his company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Campaign finance experts said there appeared to be nothing illegal about the payments. The RNC was free to pay for Trump’s legal fees, they said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The decision also shows the party continuing to help the former president ahead of what could be a competitive primary process in 2024, with Trump eyeing another bid.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“To pay the legal fees for someone who isn’t a candidate, and isn’t an employee — I’ve never seen that happen,” said Brett Kappel, a campaign lawyer at the firm Harmon, Curran, Spielberg Eisenberg.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In its first payments, in October, the RNC paid Ronald Fischetti, who has acted as Trump’s personal lawyer in the investigations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And while some members have called for the party to be more independent from Trump, a large majority of the party’s 168-member committee continues to support him, according to members and party officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We could have used that money in New Jersey,” he said, of paying Trump’s legal bills.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An RNC official said the party spent more in the state in the final days of the race but did not alert Palatucci personally, although it did inform the state party. </p></div></div>
<a> have interviewed Trump’s longtime banker and accountant</a>, and James has demanded a deposition from Trump in a separate civil case. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
<div><div><p>Since Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the RNC has spent more than $2.6 million at Trump’s hotels and clubs, according to campaign-finance data.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p> Trump has more than $100 million in his PAC and could pay his own bills, should he choose to do so. Trump has attacked James repeatedly, saying her investigation is a political “witch hunt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Ryan said no such ban applies to political parties.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So the RNC can pay Trump’s legal bills, even for an investigation unconnected to his time as president.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Amy Gardner</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Emma Brown</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 22, 2021 at 5:38 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The onslaught is exhausting and troubling, officials said, as they launch preparations for the 2022 midterm elections — and is further eroding faith in the nation’s voting systems.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the ‘shadow reality world’ promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen</p></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the year, the two men have been pressing their case with state and local election officials around the country and gaining meetings with many of them, according to people familiar with their activities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The doubts that Lindell, Frank and other Trump allies have whipped up about the vote have taken root across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re trying to prove voter fraud off of nonexistent issues,” Wilcox said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even as election officials rebut the growing conspiracy theories, the demands from some of those pushing false claims are escalating — and their rhetoric is becoming more extreme.<b/></p></div></div>
<a>he wrote</a> that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who has refused to entertain his claims, should face a jury “capable of dispensing capital punishment.”
<div><div><p>In an interview last week, Benson said she views the latest escalation as an assault on democracy. She said she intends to spend next year fighting back, and urging Americans to do the same.</p></div></div>
<p>Benson called the pressure on election officials “a political strategy to break down our democracy and put people in charge of our states who are unaccountable and will act in a way that doesn’t reflect the will of the people.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Leading the charge</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Trump is leading the ongoing assault on the integrity of the 2020 election, regularly firing off statements in which he falsely asserts that the vote was rigged and using the issue as a litmus test for which candidates he endorses.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement Tuesday, he said that the real “insurrection” happened not on Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, but on Nov. 3, the day Americans elected Biden.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When Frank met with LaRose’s senior staffers in May, he twice told them that he would be calling the former president immediately afterward to provide an update, according to the recording.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Frank told The Post last week that when he told Ohio officials he would be calling the former president, he didn’t mean it literally. He said he meant to show that he had connections to powerful people who could be helpful.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I didn’t mean it as a threat. I meant it as an opportunity,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a text to The Post, Frank disputed that he spoke to the former president at the rally.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lindell interviewed Trump at his Florida club this fall for a show <a>streamed </a>on Lindell’s website, and the former president has praised the MyPillow executive for “fighting” for him, a Trump adviser said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the Trump rally in Ohio this summer, Lindell could be heard telling throngs of Trump fans that he would be showing more evidence “soon” as they mobbed him for photos.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump allies work to place supporters in key election posts across the country, spurring fears about future vote challenges</p></div>
<a>Tina Peters</a>, the clerk in Mesa County, Colo., “and showed her how her election was hacked,” Frank previously told The Post.
<b> </b>of sabotaging his effort.
<p>In a statement, RNC spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez called his criticism “reckless and completely false,” saying the national party financed 50 election-related lawsuits in the last election cycle and is pursuing more than 30 suits now.</p>
<div><div><p>“We will continue to act and get results while others continue to do nothing more than talk,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b><b/></b>Numerous election security experts have dismissed the fraud allegations made by Lindell and Frank, but the claims have found traction among some Republican legislators.</p></div></div>
<p>In North Carolina this fall, a Republican state lawmaker sent officials an ominous-looking map of the state showing red lines identified as “remote connections” emanating like laser beams from all of the state’s 100 counties.</p>
<div><div><p>State officials said there is no merit to the document, which attributes the information to retired Army colonel Phil Waldron, another Trump ally who has challenged the results of the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waldron did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Election denier who circulated Jan. 6 PowerPoint says he met with Meadows at White House</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>'They seek me out'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve been going state to state and showing them evidence directly, and they all want to do audits,” Lindell said at the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frank said he is often asked for help by local activists who have seen his presentations online or his posts on the social media site Telegram.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Someone will call from a state and say, ‘Dr. Frank, our elections are ripped off. Will you come help us?’ ” he told The Post last month. “They seek me out; I’m not seeking them out.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ashcroft declined to comment, as did several other Republican officials whom Lindell or Frank said they contacted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other state officials have handled the outreach gingerly by agreeing to listen to the election deniers but then stating publicly that there is no evidence of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Merrill said he personally knows a couple of the voters living at Big Oak Ranch whose names were presented to him as evidence of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A simple Google check would have told you what these places are,” Merrill recalled telling the pair. “Instead you reached a supposition that voter fraud occurred.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frank acknowledged that the meeting did not go well. “We have since changed our approach as a result,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re going to be circling back to Alabama, obviously, long before the 2022 election and show him that the machines are defective,” Lindell said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Attempted breach of Ohio county election network draws FBI and state scrutiny</p></div>
<p>State officials pushed back, explaining that voters actually received forms to request absentee ballots, not the ballots themselves. Frank quickly backtracked, conceding he did not yet have the evidence about the ballots, according to the recording.</p>
<div><div><p>“We can arrange for that” in Ohio, he said, according to the recording.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview in November, LaRose offered a blunt assessment of Frank’s theories.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b/>Even in states that Trump won overwhelmingly, officials have been compelled to address fraud claims.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ziriax requested an independent investigation that found no merit to those claims, he told members of the state legislature in a <a>letter </a>in October.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In early October, they counted a sample of ballots in a larger county, and Houck issued a second <a>news release </a>declaring Lindell’s claims “without merit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That posture was an unpopular one for Houck, who recently dropped out of the running for secretary of state in the deeply Republican state. But he said it was important to speak out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You put the facts out and you let the chips fall where they may,” he told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said that Idaho Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck is running for secretary of state. In fact, Houck dropped out of the race on Dec. 17, citing family reasons.</i></p></div>

<div><div><p>“I can assure you that if a criminal referral would be warranted, there would be no reluctance on the part of this committee to do that,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The New York Times reported <a>this week</a> that the panel was looking at a possible criminal referral for Trump and others as part of its investigation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Thompson has not previously discussed the issue or what information will be key to making the decision, raising the stakes for the committee’s work and who should be held accountable for the violence of that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“As with all criminal referrals, we will evaluate the matter based on the facts and the law, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution,” the statement said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Role as gatekeeper puts Mark Meadows in legal jeopardy</p></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) accepted Pelosi’s invitation to join the committee, which also has seven Democrats, making them outcasts in their party.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A criminal referral, Eliason said, is mainly meant to “inform DOJ about something Congress has uncovered, if and when that might be useful.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Eliason said the committee’s focus on criminal referrals could also boost the claims of those resisting subpoenas that lawmakers’ inquiry doesn’t have a legislative purpose, but rather, is meant to uncover crimes.</p></div>
<div><p>A Washington Post <a>investigation found</a> that Trump resisted calls to intervene on Jan. 6 while watching the riot play out on television for 187 minutes before finally released a video calling on his supporters to stand down.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Former president Donald Trump has canceled the news conference he planned to hold on Jan. 6 to mark the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.</p></div></div>
<p>In a statement released Tuesday by his Save America PAC, Trump blamed the media and the bipartisan congressional committee that is investigating the attack. Trump’s lawyers are fighting the panel’s efforts to obtain his records.</p>
<div><p>The Jan. 6 committee: What it has done and where it is headed</p></div>
<div><div><p>The former president had been planning to speak at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida on Thursday night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was launched by a mob trying to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden’s electoral college win. It resulted in five deaths and injured about 140 members of law enforcement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his statement, Trump perpetuated his widely debunked claim that the 2020 election was stolen, the false allegation that spurred many of his supporters to invade the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In recent days, some Senate Republicans <a>had voiced unease</a> about Trump’s plans for a news conference on the anniversary of the attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hopefully his comments will be helpful, not harmful,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) <a>told reporters Tuesday</a>.</p></div></div>
<header><div/><div><div><a>Politics</a></div></div><div><h1>How Republicans became the party of Trump’s election lie after Jan. 6</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ashley Parker</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Amy Gardner</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 5, 2022 at 6:09 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>He wrote that there was probably some fraud and illegal votes cast, but concluded, “Was it anywhere near enough to change the result, no.”</p></div></div>
<p>Moreno is emblematic of the modern Republican Party, echoing former president Donald Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen — a position that has become the unofficial litmus test for good standing within the GOP.</p>
<div><div><p>At least five candidates for the U.S. House were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riots, including Jason Riddle of New Hampshire, whom federal prosecutors have accused of chugging wine inside the building that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Riddle added that if he’s sentenced for Jan. 6 crimes, “I’ll run from jail. It will give me something to do.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But, in fact, what we’ve seen is very much the opposite, in which a lot Republican politicians have begun to think it is in their interest electorally to support the lie,” Ziblatt said.</p></div></div>
<a>decertify the election</a> and demand a criminal investigation.
<div><div><p>“There is always going to be pressure on the RNC to try to do more than it has,” Riemer said in a recent interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump has been frustrated that some in the GOP, particularly prominent Republicans in the Senate, have not been willing to echo his claims — and that an overwhelming majority of the body voted to certify the election.</p></div></div>
<p>According to a <a>Washington Post-University of Maryland poll</a> in December, 58 percent of Republicans think Biden’s election was not legitimate, and 62 percent think there is solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.</p>
<div><div><p>Moreno said “the door was flung open” to fraud and abuse during 2020 and he, like Trump, is still trying to answer one key question: “How much actual fraud was there?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Rewriting the narrative</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The whitewashing of Jan. 6 began that very night.</p></div></div>
<p>Just hours after the insurrection — which resulted in five deaths, including a police officer — <a>139 House members and eight senators</a> returned to the desecrated Capitol and voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>
<div><div><p>Trump and his allies, too, began rewriting the narrative almost immediately.</p></div></div>
<a>“a normal tourist visit.”</a> And some Republicans rebranded those arrested in the aftermath of the insurrection as “political prisoners.”
<div><div><p>Nonetheless, the former president struck a defiant note, saying in the statement that protesters descended on Washington last Jan. 6 to fight “the fraud of the 2020 Presidential Election.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This was, indeed, the Crime of the Century,” he wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>‘I think Trump won’</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not one of the five hopefuls clearly stated that Biden had won the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The next day, on his radio show, Hewitt posed the same question to Josh Mandel, a Republican senatorial candidate in Ohio.</p></div></div>
<a>Mandel replied</a>. He went on to say that the results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin still need to be “fully investigated — and none of them have.”
<div><div><p>In his endorsement, Trump attacked Detmer’s GOP opponent, incumbent Lana Theis, who helped produce a legislative report finding that allegations of election fraud in the state were “demonstrably false.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>‘Long-term, I think we’re screwed’</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Boyer said he expects Republicans to do well in the 2022 midterms but that “long-term, I think we’re screwed as a party.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“When you’ve got Trump telling the base the system is rigged, don’t vote, they believe him, and that’s why we lost control of the U.S. Senate, that’s why we lost the two Georgia seats,” Boyer said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“But I’m just so tired,” Boyer said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Since it was first detected in southern Africa late last year, the highly contagious coronavirus variant has sparked restrictions on business activity in several countries.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, confounding, overheating economy of 2021</p></div>
<div><p>“The mood in the market is that it’s not going to be that big a deal economically,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. “The hope is it’ll be over in a month.”</p></div>
<div><p>More than 1,700 flights canceled Wednesday as airlines' problems persist.</p></div>

<div><div><p>With omicron threatening, the hotel limited attendance to 15 to 20 percent of capacity and sent non-guests home at 11 p.m., said Adam Zembruski, program director for Hospiamo, an adviser to the Horton’s owners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, four out of the hotel’s roughly 25 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and managers are eyeing additional restrictions if needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an everyday conversation. We could close the bars. We talked about that just last night,” he said earlier this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the virus poses an acute problem for businesses that deal with the public, manufacturers also are crafting new strategies to keep their machines turning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Business is good at J.V. Manufacturing, a die and component maker in Natrona Heights, Pa. As orders flooded in over the past year, the company added about 40 new employees, taking its payroll to 137 workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the company is considering an increased push for robotics and digitization to make production less vulnerable to missing workers, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I definitely think it’s here to stay,” she said of the virus. “It’s just about finding a way to balance it, finding what risks are worth taking and what risks aren’t worth taking.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There aren’t more people to come to help right now,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a Made-in-the-USA supply chain crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>Elsewhere, executives worry about a possible resurgence of global <a>supply chain bottlenecks</a> triggered by harsh coronavirus clampdowns in China, where the government maintains a “zero-covid” policy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The greatest risk to the U.S. economy is how non-U.S. governments choose to respond to it,” said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist for Manulife Investment Management.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company purchased scores of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, and spread its workers across two shifts in a bid to avoid infections. Later, it added air-quality monitors and filtration devices to meet a shifting threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, Habco went months before seeing its first worker test positive and had only a handful idled before omicron appeared. In the past few weeks, more employees tested positive as the variant ran wild in Connecticut.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re doing everything we can to protect our employees,” he said. “My concern is more what I can’t control.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Habco’s production depends upon a number of local parts suppliers. If just one or two of their workers are taken ill, it might paralyze their production of critical components, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Habco gave employees plenty of time to deal with family responsibilities. But as the virus appears to be evolving into a less lethal form, Montanari wonders how long that stance can be sustained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve got a business to run,” he said. “I’ve got customers who need product and they don’t care about my employees’ child-care problems.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ann E. Marimow</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Robert Barnes</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>vaccine policies</a> affecting nearly 100 million workers. Most already have made the choice to be vaccinated, but Biden has said the numbers are not good enough.
<div><div><p>One measure requires large private companies to implement a vaccination requirement or impose a masking and weekly testing regimen. The second applies to health-care workers at facilities that receive certain federal funding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Together, <a>the cases test a signature aspect of the White House’s response to the pandemic</a> that has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s an overview of the cases, the history and the issues that the justices will consider Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Can the U.S. government force private companies and health-care facilities to require vaccinations for their workers?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has never before tried to impose a vaccine-or-test policy on U.S. companies and their workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employers must provide paid time off to get vaccinated, but they are not required to pay for coronavirus testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rules were set to take effect Jan. 4, but OSHA pushed back the date in response to the litigation and said it would not immediately issue citations for those not in compliance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other policy from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires vaccinations for more than 17 million health-care workers at 76,000 facilities that receive federal money tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who is challenging the vaccination policies and why?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Any delay, according to the Biden administration, will “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vaccine mandate for health-care workers, opponents say, is “plainly unlawful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Have workplace safety requirements previously been issued on an emergency basis?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>OSHA, the federal safety agency, has used its <a>emergency authority infrequently</a> after mixed results in court in the 1970s and ’80s in response to rules to regulate exposure to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The term “grave danger” is not defined in statute, and courts also have not provided clear guidance about the term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hasn’t the Supreme Court upheld vaccination requirements for college campuses and those imposed by local officials?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, the justices have generally been supportive of vaccination requirements by local governments and universities. For instance, it allowed New York and Maine to mandate vaccinations for their health-care workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the court has also been skeptical when it comes to federal agency power generally, and with respect to the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The justices, for instance, rejected an eviction moratorium — first imposed by the Trump administration and extended by Biden — because it said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>What have lower courts said about Biden’s policies?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They are divided.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the administration announced the rules for private companies in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked enforcement of the policy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But lawsuits sprung up around the nation and were consolidated for review by a different court. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit dissolved the 5th Circuit’s stay, saying the rules could go into effect.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Opponents then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower courts also were divided on the health-care worker mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit dismissed a request from Florida to stop the requirement. But a district judge in Missouri stopped the rules, and the 5th Circuit agreed with a challenge from Louisiana.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the Supreme Court, a coalition of Republican-led states said the rules should be blocked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Biden administration said its authority is clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What about the Supreme Court’s own coronavirus policies for the justices and court visitors? </b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The courthouse has been closed to the public since March 2020. All nine justices have been vaccinated and received boosters. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had covid before she was confirmed to the high court in September 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After returning to in-person oral arguments this past fall, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh participated in some from home after he tested positive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The justices have not required lawyers arguing cases and credentialed reporters observing the proceedings to be vaccinated. But they must have received negative test results and be masked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The health-care worker cases are <i>Biden v. Missouri </i>and<i> Becerra v. Louisiana</i>. The OSHA cases are <i>National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor </i>and<i> Ohio v. Department of Labor</i>.</p></div></div>

<b> </b>and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. “There was a lot of violating content that did appear on the platform that wouldn’t otherwise have.”
<div><div><p>Pusateri denied that the company had pulled back on efforts to combat violent and false postings about the election after the vote. He did not comment on the quantitative findings of the ProPublica-Post investigation.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“And DEMS Are Pushing For Vote By Mail. Another Way For Them To Steal The Election,” he wrote in August 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Are you going to do away with their free speech?” Smith said. “If someone thinks it’s not a fair election … why can’t they have their opinion on whether it’s a fair election or not?”</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Facebook enforcement slowed before Jan. 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook’s fact-checking favors conservatives in election lead-up</p></div>
<p>The next day, Nov. 6, the Group Task Force gathered virtually to celebrate its efforts, former employees said. Days later, a task force member published a Workplace post titled “Some Reflections on US2020” to bring attention to its work.</p>
<div><div><p>“Along with heroic efforts from other teams across the company, I truly believe the Group Task Force made the election safer and prevented possible instances of real world violence,” said the post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the focus on U.S. political groups and content undermining the election wouldn’t last.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Months after the Capitol was breached, Facebook still was working to remove hundreds of political groups that violated company policies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of those was Smith’s United Conservatives for America, which continued to carry posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden’s election until Facebook removed it in May.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like its predecessor, the new United Conservatives for America group was racking up strikes for violations of Facebook’s rules, according to a post Smith made to the group in September.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I'm Not Blaming Our Members,” Smith wrote. “I’m Blaming FakeBook!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Late last month, after being asked about Smith’s account and group, Facebook said it banned his profile and removed United Conservatives for America, citing unspecified violations of its community standards.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Politics</a></div></div><div><h1>Biden to squarely blame Trump for Jan. 6 assault</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Annie Linskey</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:39 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>White House finds lack of intelligence-sharing hurt Jan. 6 response</p></div>
<a>canceled the event</a> after being advised that it would generate negative press. He blasted the “total bias and dishonesty” of Democrats and the media, and promised to discuss the Capitol assault at a rally on Jan. 15.
<p>A Trump spokesman said that Biden is using the moment to distract from domestic problems he’s facing, including a fresh round of school closures from the <a>coronavirus</a>, rising consumer prices and high homicide rates in major cities.</p>
<div><p>Garland: DOJ will hold Jan. 6 perpetrators to account</p></div>
<div><p>In the past, Psaki has said that Biden has been wary of calling out Trump too often or too forcefully because he has not wanted to elevate the former president or give credence to his inaccurate view that the 2020 election was rigged.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Paski signaled that Biden will take a different approach Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He sees January 6th as a tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country,” Psaki said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He will, of course, speak to the moment, to the importance in history of the peaceful transfer of power,” Psaki added. “But he will also reflect on the role his predecessor had.”</p></div></div>
<p>She also said that Biden will “forcibly” push back “on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters as well as distract from his role in what happened.”</p>
<p>For all that, it remains unclear if Biden will call out Trump explicitly by name. He has done so before, but at other times he has referred to his predecessor indirectly, on one much-noted occasion calling him “the former guy.”</p>
<div><div><p>Psaki did not say whether that would change Thursday, adding that the speech was still being finalized. But she added, “I think people will know who he’s referring to.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>What is the Electoral Count Act, and why are people calling for it to be reformed as we near Jan. 6?</p></div>
<div><div><p>This week’s expressions of support, modest as they are, amount to the most significant Republican backing for modifications to the nation’s democratic infrastructure in response to the stresses of the 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no substitute. Period,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sinema holds firm in support of the filibuster, imperiling late voting rights push</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manchin, however, said Wednesday that he was supportive of the burgeoning bipartisan chatter about the Electoral Count Act.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He expressed openness to modifying the Electoral Count Act, but only in conjunction with other, more thoroughgoing voting rights protections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I still think the law’s relatively clear, but if we can eliminate ambiguities that would lead a Trump-like person to try to raise hell, then that would be a good thing,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ahead of Jan. 6, Willard hotel in downtown D.C. was a Trump team ‘command center’ for effort to deny Biden the presidency</p></div>
<div><p>But Pence concluded that he had no such power, a position he made public in a letter released shortly before the count began — and shortly before the mob stormed the Capitol, with some rioters calling for Pence’s execution.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Multiple Republicans said Wednesday that, at a minimum, the Electoral Count Act could be clarified to make crystal clear that the vice president has no actual power to accept or reject electoral votes.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>How Republicans became the party of Trump’s election lie after Jan. 6</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>“If there was an election bill that had any chance of actually becoming law, it would be unfortunate to miss the opportunity,” Blunt said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The onslaught is exhausting and troubling, officials said, as they launch preparations for the 2022 midterm elections — and is further eroding faith in the nation’s voting systems.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the ‘shadow reality world’ promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen</p></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the year, the two men have been pressing their case with state and local election officials around the country and gaining meetings with many of them, according to people familiar with their activities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The doubts that Lindell, Frank and other Trump allies have whipped up about the vote have taken root across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re trying to prove voter fraud off of nonexistent issues,” Wilcox said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even as election officials rebut the growing conspiracy theories, the demands from some of those pushing false claims are escalating — and their rhetoric is becoming more extreme.<b/></p></div></div>
<a>he wrote</a> that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who has refused to entertain his claims, should face a jury “capable of dispensing capital punishment.”
<div><div><p>In an interview last week, Benson said she views the latest escalation as an assault on democracy. She said she intends to spend next year fighting back, and urging Americans to do the same.</p></div></div>
<p>Benson called the pressure on election officials “a political strategy to break down our democracy and put people in charge of our states who are unaccountable and will act in a way that doesn’t reflect the will of the people.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Leading the charge</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Trump is leading the ongoing assault on the integrity of the 2020 election, regularly firing off statements in which he falsely asserts that the vote was rigged and using the issue as a litmus test for which candidates he endorses.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement Tuesday, he said that the real “insurrection” happened not on Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, but on Nov. 3, the day Americans elected Biden.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When Frank met with LaRose’s senior staffers in May, he twice told them that he would be calling the former president immediately afterward to provide an update, according to the recording.</p></div></div>
