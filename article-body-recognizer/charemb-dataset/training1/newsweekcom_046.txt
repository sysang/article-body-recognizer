<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Natural COVID Immunity vs Delta Variant: Is It Enough To Protect You?</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 10/4/21 at 9:41 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<div> Tech Science Delta variant <a>Vaccinations</a></div>
<p>As the Delta variant continues to account for the vast majority of cases of COVID in the United States, Google Trends data shows users are asking if natural immunity could protect against what is proving to be the most virulent strain of the virus.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>) currently estimates that the Delta variant is behind as much as 99.8 percent of the country's total COVID cases.</p>
<p>Experts predicted that this form of <a>COVID would overwhelm other variants</a> such as Mu in the U.S., just as it did with Alpha in the U.K., and that appears to have <a>occurred.</a></p>
<p>The CDC study that Assoumou referred to shows that individuals in Kentucky who had already had COVID and had not been vaccinated against the virus were over twice as likely to be reinfected in comparison with people who were fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine at UCSF and an infectious disease physician in San Francisco, California, also warned against relying on natural immunity to protect against COVID.</p>
<p>In addition, natural immunity may not protect well against all variants of COVID. A person infected with a new variant may not have immunity from a previous infection with a different strain of the virus.</p>
<p>"People have even had chickenpox 'parties' where a kid with chickenpox will interact with other kids who come over to get exposed and then acquire chickenpox and the corresponding immunity naturally."</p>
<p>He said this approach has serious drawbacks. "Chickenpox can sometimes cause more severe disease like pneumonia and kids with natural chickenpox are not happy campers, plus they have to miss school. The vaccine is so much better."</p>
<p>Dr. Assoumou said the best course of action in protecting against Delta is the one already being employed: vaccination.</p>
<p>Chin-Hong echoed this sentiment: "The best protection against Delta is science. And of course, vaccines. One million percent."</p>

<p>A teenager who tweeted a photo of herself when she was seriously ill with COVID-19 is still getting abused online four months later.</p>
<p>Maisy Evans, a 17-year-old from Wales, sent a series of tweets from her hospital bed in August, urging others to get vaccinated. She also revealed that the infection had left her with a blood clot in her right lung.</p>
<p>Evans wrote: "This virus is not a joke for young people and those eligible must get vaccinated."</p>
<p>She listed the medications she had been prescribed, emphasizing the effect the infection can have even on young and healthy people. Evans posted: "I'm 17 years old and I'm currently taking antibiotics, steroids, morphine, and blood thinners.</p>
<p>"Please continue to take this virus seriously, even if you consider yourself generally fit and well like myself."</p>
<p>Initially, Evans received many messages of support from <a>Twitter</a> users. But these were soon overwhelmed by angry and abusive posts.</p>
<p>The Welsh teenager told Business Insider: "Soon, the anti-vaxxers, the keyboard warriors, came across my tweet. I received thousands of comments and messages—many of them kind, but many of them hurtful.</p>
<p>"I know I was called Satan, a Nazi, an actress paid by the government to push vaccines and, most painfully, I was told I would be personally responsible for any deaths caused by the vaccine."</p>
<p>"These anti-vaxxers are like mice – they come in hordes."</p>
<p>Many of the responses to Evans' tweets suggested that her hospitalization and the blood clot were the result of her receiving the vaccination. This is despite the fact that Evans said her doctors had assured her they were not related to the shot.</p>
<p><a>In October, Newsweek reported</a> that the Johnson Johnson single-dose COVID vaccination had been connected with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), an extremely rare blood-clotting condition.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found only 50 cases of the blood-clotting disorder across the U.S., out of the 16 million doses of the JJ <a>vaccine</a> administered up to November 10.</p>
<p>The fact that TTS was so rare led the <a>CDC</a> to conclude that the risks of COVID vastly outweighed the risk presented by the vaccine.</p>
<p>The CDC has also reported that there are no TTS cases related to the Pzifer vaccine, which Evans received.</p>
<p>Even two months after leaving hospital, Evans said she was still experiencing some symptoms and must have regular scans on her lungs.</p>
<p>She added: "Some days are better than others. I often wake up with a tight chest, but I seem to be getting better as time goes on.</p>
<p>"I hope to make a full recovery but I'm mindful that it may take time."</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Nu B.1.1.529 Variant: WHO Greek Alphabet COVID Naming System Explained</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 11/26/21 at 5:01 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> Tech Science <a>Coronavirus</a></div>
<p>A worrying new <a>"heavily mutated" COVID variant</a> has emerged in Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong, prompting the World Health Organization to schedule an emergency meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>At the <a>WHO</a> meeting, delegates will discuss the variant, named B.1.1.529, and its <a>implications for vaccines, testing, emerging symptoms and medicinal therapies</a>.</p>
<p>If the organization determines that B.1.1.529 is a variant of interest or concern, it will be assigned a Greek letter name—just like Delta, Alpha and Beta before it.</p>
<p>The B.1.1.529 variant is already being called "Nu" in some quarters, but it remains to be seen if this will become its official name. Nature said Nu was the likely choice as it is the next available letter in the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>The Greek naming system for COVID variants of interest and concern was introduced by the WHO on May 31, 2021. The idea was to ensure that variants had easy-to-say and remember labels.</p>
<p>The labels don't replace scientific names for variants. Beta—which emerged in South Africa during its second wave in 2020—is still called 501Y.V2, B.1.351, 20H/501Y.V2 or GH/501Y.V2, depending on which naming system researchers use.</p>
<p>These names, assigned by scientific organizations such as GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango, convey important information, so are still used in research. Scientists use the Greek names too, however, especially when communicating with the public.</p>
<p>The naming system is designed to avoid geographical stigma being assigned to a COVID variant. When Beta <a>first emerged</a>, many media outlets and even some scientists were referring to it as "the South African variant."</p>
<p>Naming a virus for a geographic region can also be confusing, according to Nature, especially in regions that are battling more than one variant. "South African variant" could now refer to Beta or the newly emerged B.1.1.529, for example.</p>
<p>The use of geographical names even discouraged some nations from running tests for emerging variants to avoid the risk of stigmatization, Nature reported.</p>
<p>Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician and director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform in Durban, South Africa, told the magazine in June:"The geographical names, we have to stop with that—really."</p>
<p>He added that he was aware of countries in Africa where health ministers had been reluctant to announce the discovery of new variants for fear that this would result in their country being made a pariah.</p>
<p>Before deciding to use the Greek alphabet, the WHO consulted experts who work on existing naming systems, as well as virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities.</p>
<p>With only 24 letters in the Greek alphabet, however, there is the grim possibility that the WHO may run out of names for variants. It has already used 12 letters, with <a>Mu named in September</a>.</p>
<p>If B.1.1.529 is given a Greek letter at Friday's meeting, there will be just 11 left to choose from.</p>
<p>The WHO's technical chief for COVID-19, Maria Van Kerkhove told The Telegraph in August that the organization was already considering possible COVID naming schemes that could be used next.</p>
<p>One option, Van Kerkhove said, was naming variants after constellations. So, in the future, we could see reports about variants Taurus, Gemini or Orion alongside Delta, Alpha and Beta.</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Variants of Concern Vs Variants of Interest—as Omicron Spreads, What's the Difference?</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 11/29/21 at 10:44 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> Tech Science Coronavirus <a>Omicron</a> <a>Delta variant</a></div>
<p>On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) met to discuss a new COVID variant named B.1.1.529, which was first identified in southern Africa. The WHO named it Omicron, and labeled it a variant of concern.</p>
<p>The WHO tracks new COVID variants and their properties, such as how easily they spread, how severely infected people fall ill, and how effective vaccines and other measures are in curtailing their spread.</p>
<p>To assist in the tracking of variants and informing the general public and authorities about these variants, both the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (<a>CDC</a>) and Prevention have different classifications for variants.</p>
<p>This means that the virus could be more efficient at reinfecting people who have already had COVID and it could also help it slip through the immunity conferred by vaccination.</p>
<p>There is also currently limited evidence of Omicron meeting another CDC criteria for a VOC, as it seems to demonstrate an increased level of transmissibility.</p>
<p>Other VOCs as defined by WHO are <a>Delta</a>—still responsible for the vast majority of current COVID infections—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.</p>
<h2>What is a Variant of Interest?</h2>
<p>Current VOIs identified by WHO are Lambda and Mu, with the Eta, Iota, and Kappa variants having dropped out of this category after the risk they posed reduced.</p>
<a> VOC to a VOI</a>. But, in the worst-case scenario that the Omicron variant proves to be even riskier that thought, it could rise into the as of yet unoccupied VOHC category.
<p>VOHCs could also demonstrate significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple Emergency Use Authorization therapeutics or other treatments, as well as presenting more severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>As Omicron Variant Spreads, Will the COVID Pandemic Ever End?</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 11/30/21 at 10:01 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>On November 26 the World Health Organization converged to discuss an emerging variant of COVID-19. The highly mutated variant, given the name Omicron, first emerged in South Africa and has since been found in at least 15 other countries.</p>
<p>The discovery of this new variant follows the observation of the Mu variant in January 2021, and the emergence of the Delta variant in December 2020, which is still responsible for the vast majority of COVID infections.</p>
<p>The identification of yet another new variant coincided with a spike in searches by Google users asking: "When will COVID end?" But, even when the global pandemic ends, what are the chances of things returning to the way they were before it began?</p>
<a>Nature asked 100 scientists</a> in the field of immunology, infectious-disease researchers, and virologists working with COVID if the virus could be eradicated.
<p>Jit also compared the future of COVID as a virus to the flu. He said: "Flu was actually one of the leading causes of mortality in the U.K. prior to 2020, and partly responsible for a big spike of hospital and ICU admissions in winter.</p>
<p>"We dealt with it mainly by trying to get people vaccinated every winter, especially healthcare workers and the most vulnerable people. In the long run, we might deal with COVID in a similar way."</p>
<p>Jit adds that despite potential similarities in the response to COVID and flu, he believes that the former will remain the more severe disease of the two for at least the next few years.</p>
<a>evolve</a> into a less severe virus, McKee expressed doubt. He told Newsweek: "It is possible, but it is certainly not inevitable. There are some who argue that viruses
<a>mutate </a>to become less dangerous. However, this is based on a highly selective view of history."
<p>He added that given that much of the transmission of COVID results from people who are asymptomatic, scientists can't be sure where the evolutionary pressures on the virus will arise from, and so how it will evolve.</p>
<p>Likewise, according to McKee, the evolution of our society as a result of COVID is tough to predict. "The pandemic has been an opportunity for people to reassess how they live their lives.</p>
<p>"I suspect that we will see more remote working, now people have realized what is possible over Zoom and other platforms. We may see some political changes, although this is especially difficult to anticipate."</p>
<p>"It might actually help keep the circulation of many other viruses as well as SARS-CoV-2, if people voluntarily wear masks more often in crowded places, or if it becomes more unacceptable to go to work if you aren't feeling well."</p>
<p>With regards to ending the pandemic, both Jit and McKee are in agreement—vaccination is vital. Jit said: "The most important thing we can do is to get vaccinated. All other measures will just buy us more time although that can be important too.</p>
<p>"Vaccination at high coverage is the only long-term exit strategy we have."</p>
<p>McKee said: "Do everything possible to get numbers down and keep them down. Get vaccinated, get boosted, avoid situations where the virus transmits, like poorly ventilated indoor spaces."</p>
<p>Both Jit and McKee also agree that if anything positive emerges from the COVID pandemic, it could be a greater sense of solidarity, especially between nations.</p>

<p>"How many bath sheets do you need to own if you keep the temp at 82 degrees while you sleep?" one user wrote.</p>
<p>Then there were those who were more upset with Titus for sharing the report than the report itself. "Who are you and what bulls**t is this?" another wrote.</p>
<p>But, as a counterpoint, another Twitter user responded, "Take your 'report' and burn it for heat in the winter or something. That's all it's good for. My house, my thermostat, my electric bill, my rules. Period."</p>
<p>See some of the most hilarious responses to the recommended air-conditioning settings below.</p>
<p>The Arica and Victory Pass projects were approved in California's Riverside County, and would generate as much as 465 megawatts of electricity, enough to power an estimated 132,000 homes, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Officials requested nominations of about 140 square miles of land within "solar energy zones" in the three other states.</p>
<p>Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning said officials are considering around 40 "large-scale" solar energy proposals in the West.</p>
<a>Deb Haaland</a> said. "We are rebuilding that capacity."
<p>Approval of a third California solar farm—planned for 500 megawatts and known as Oberon—is expected in coming days, officials said.</p>
<p>The solicitation of interest comes as officials under Democratic President <a>Joe Biden</a> <a>promote renewable wind</a> and solar power on public lands and offshore to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.</p>
<a>Joe Manchin</a> tanked the administration's centerpiece climate and social services legislation.
<p>During a Tuesday conference call with reporters, Haaland did not directly address a question about the faltering bill and instead pointed to clean energy provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law last month.</p>
<p>"We fully intend to meet our clean energy goals," Haaland said, adding that the administration was trying to make up lost ground.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Land Management oversees almost a quarter-billion acres of land primarily in Western states.</p>
<p>In early December, the agency issued a draft plan to reduce rents and other fees paid by companies authorized to build wind and solar projects on public lands.</p>
<p>In Nevada, where the federal government owns and manages more than 80 percent of the state's land, large-scale solar projects have faced opposition from environmentalists concerned about harm to plants and animals in the sun- and windswept deserts.</p>
<p>Stone-Manning said solar projects on public lands are being sited to take environmental concerns into account.</p>
<p>But solar power developers warn costs have been rising due to constraints on supplies of steel, copper, semiconductor chips and other construction materials.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<div> U.S. Joe Biden <a>Georgia</a> <a>Infrastructure</a></div>
<p>As the holiday season gets into full swing, the Democratic Party appears to be promoting President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s Build Back Better infrastructure package using travel-related billboard advertisements.</p>
<p>One of these billboards, just south of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, stresses the importance of rebuilding the nation's infrastructure as the busy holiday travel season continues to ramp up.</p>
<p>"Stressed about travel?" the billboard asks. "President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law will deliver: better airports, safer roads, smoother travel."</p>
<p>In a statement sent to Newsweek, the Democratic National Committee said that "the new billboard campaign is the latest step the DNC has taken to make sure Americans know how they stand to benefit from President Biden's infrastructure law."</p>
<p>The billboards are designed to highlight "how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by President Biden and <a>Democrats</a> will create smoother future holiday travel with better airports and safer roads," the DNC added.</p>
<p>The DNC said that similar billboards will be erected near airports in Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As a part of Biden's largest Build Back Better agenda, the bill, officially known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, set aside $1.2 trillion in spending to improve a variety of public works across the United States.</p>
<p>This includes a $25 billion investment in upgrading American airports. The White House noted that U.S. airports "lag far behind our competitors," adding that "no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide [in some rankings]."</p>
<p>Hartsfield-Jackson officials told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it would handle about 3.7 million passengers over the holiday season, which was on par with travel numbers seen before the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>The White House went on to refer to the funding as "the single largest investment in repairing and reconstructing our nation's bridges since the construction of the interstate highway system."</p>
<p>The package is also aimed at making the roads safer, as the deal includes a first-of-its-kind program to help reduce traffic fatalities. Deaths on the roadway numbered at least 20,000 in the first half of 2021, according to the White House.</p>

<a>Netflix</a> and it's fair to say, the critics are divided on whether Adam McKay's disaster movie is actually a total disaster or if it's a critically-acclaimed masterpiece. Newsweek has a recap of all of the reviews below.
<h2>What the Critics Have Have Said About Don't Look Up </h2>
<p>Writing for<a> Deadline</a>, Pete Hammond praises McKay for bringing humor to a serious subject and praises the movie's "killer cast."</p>
<p><a>The Hollywood Reporter</a> did not have such a positive take on Don't Look Up, describing Adam McKay's movie as "a cynical, insufferably smug satire".</p>
<p>Writer David Mooney also was not totally dazzled by the stars cast, penning in his review: "The squandering of a dizzying assembly of marquee talent alone is aggravation enough."</p>
<p>He added: "The film gets so cluttered with surplus characters and gratuitous star casting that any satirical heft is pretty much steamrolled."</p>
<p><a>Digital Spy</a> awarded Don't Look Up, 3 stars out of 5.</p>
<p>He also praised the movie's cast, in particular Mark Rylance, describing his performance as "transformative."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sandwell was not such a huge fan of the movie's editing, believing some scenes end "abruptly" and overlap for "no obvious reason."</p>
<p>He adds: "There's a looseness to Don't Look Up though that means some jokes drag on far longer than they should, and large chunks of the middle section could be lost with little impact to the story."</p>
<p>As for<a> Vulture </a>writer, Alison Willmore, took issue with the plot of the movie as a whole.</p>
<p>Willmore added the movie fails to consider the climate change crisis is not only caused by climate change deniers but by years of "industrialized existence."</p>
<p>Simran Hans writing for<a> The Observer</a>, described Don't Look Up as an "A-List apocalyptic mess."</p>
<p>She writes: "An ensemble cast stacked with A-listers is no guarantee of a good time. Neither is McKay's bombastic, shake-you-by-the-shoulders direction."</p>
<p>Ian Freer, writing for <a>Empire</a> awarded Don't Look Up a high 4 stars out of 5.</p>
<p>Freer even believes casting director Francine Maisler would be a "shoo-in" for the 2022 Oscar for casting Adam McKay's latest project. It's just a shame the award doesn't exist.</p>
<p>As for the movie itself, Freer praises in particular McKay's ability to take aim at the Republican politicians in the form of President Orlean and her Chief of Staff, who happens to be son, Jason (Jonah Hill).</p>
<p>Don't Look Up is streaming on Netflix now.</p>

<p>In total, 60 officers were placed on the list for truthfulness, while 12 were placed for criminal conduct. Falsification of records, excessive force, ore dereliction of duty was also cited as some of the reasons for some officers' inclusions.</p>
<p>Ninety officers were named on the newly-disclosed list, with the second batch of names expected to be released in March 2022.</p>
<p>The new law's provisions match a recommendation by the Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community and Transparency that was established in the wake of the police killing of <a>George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Williams was struck four times by the gunfire and had to receive surgery. Three women and a man who were nearby at the time were also wounded.</p>
<p>"This is just a very unfortunate incident that is completely out of character for our area," Oak Brook police Chief James Kruger said.</p>
<p>Alex Gay, 23, was inside the mall at the time of the shooting. She said that she didn't hear any gunshots, but was almost trampled when people began fleeing.</p>
