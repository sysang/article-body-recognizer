<h1> Top 5 Relationship Red Flags </h1>
<h2> Identifying unhealthy or even dangerous patterns can empower us when dating. </h2>
<li>Due to a history of normalizing unhealthy behaviors, trauma survivors may struggle to identify red flags in potential dating partners.</li>
<li>Recognizing critical red flags can help prevent attachment to a potentially unhealthy partner. </li>
<li>Identifying red flags early, and stepping away, can help empower trauma survivors find the relationship they deserve.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Navigating relationships can be difficult. But knowing what signs to look out for can make the journey easier.</div> <div>Source: art by Kaytee Gillis</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>As a therapist, I often talk to my patients about red flags—those gut feelings you have when you know something is off—and how to help them align with your self-identified deal breakers.</p>
<a>dating</a>. Many survivors may not know how to filter out unhealthy behaviors due to a history of normalizing or even denying the abuse they experienced.
<p>Here are five things to look out for that trauma survivors may tend to normalize:</p>
<h3>1. Bashing their ex-partner/parent of their child.</h3>
<p>In my work with family trauma and <a>domestic violence</a> survivors, we discuss the best way to approach their <a>traumatic</a> history with a new partner, who will undoubtedly need to know about their past if the relationship moves further.</p>
<a>anger</a> and resentment. Remember: If they do it to others, they can do it to you.
<h3>2. “So let’s talk about you. What do you think of me?”</h3>
<p>I once went on a date with someone who didn’t notice I had not ordered anything until the server brought the check. Of course, they asked me to split it.</p>
<h3>3. Making decisions without your consent.</h3>
<p>Are they unwilling to compromise on decisions or hear your views? All relationships need compromise, and communication is essential to bridge the gap between different ideas and desires.</p>
<h3>4. Pay attention to their sense of entitlement.</h3>
<p>Malcolm S. Forbes once said, "You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.”</p>
<h3>5. Feeling uncomfortable about or around them.</h3>
<p>How do you feel when you are around this person? Anxious? On edge? Unseen? That will say a lot.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true: If you feel that they are perfect or too good to be true, they probably are. All of us have imperfections, and someone presenting themself as being perfect represents a red flag in itself.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the amount of time you spend trying to decipher untruths or lies. When you catch yourself saying, "That just does not make any sense," trust that feeling. </p>
<a>goals</a> can be discussed and explored healthily, but maltreatment and abuse cannot be compromised.
<p>It’s easier to get out of a potentially toxic relationship when it first begins.</p>

<p>“What’s the point of getting upset?” This is a question I frequently hear within the walls of my therapy office.</p>
<a>anger</a>, or any other distressing emotion. But when it comes to problems bigger than momentary setbacks, the human psyche cannot be easily distracted or
<a>humor</a> to find temporary respite from their distress. And looking for positives or seeking out feel-good activities can indeed be helpful in climbing out of unhappiness,
<a>anxiety</a>. But consistently being avoidant can cause problems.
<p>To understand this better, consider these five tips for cultivating <a>happiness</a>, all of which include attending to your distress:</p>
<p>1. Acknowledge your emotional pain—it cannot be willed away. </p>
<p>Just as you can force a stoic look on your face when punched in the gut, you can make yourself appear unphased by an emotional blow. But superficial appearances, as well as efforts to distract, do not change the fact that you feel pain. </p>
<p>Once you acknowledge your unhappiness, the purpose of feeling it becomes clear. To not feel it is to deny reality—and while you might fool others, you can never fully deceive yourself. </p>
<p>2. Stop pushing your pain away and accept it. </p>
<p>It’s understandable that you don’t want to be upset, but denying it will prevent you from seeing the thorn in your heart. You will have a sense that something is wrong, but you won’t understand what you are feeling.</p>
<p>As a result, they have at least doubled their problems. They are sad or hurt, or whatever, about something in their life. But they don’t let themselves know that—so in addition, they are confused by their unhappiness. </p>
<p>3. Get to know what is upsetting you because you can only heal what you can truly see. </p>
<p>The less you know about your unhappiness, the less you will be able to heal it. This means that becoming self-aware is extremely important.</p>
<p>So, attend to what you sense in your body. Take time to consider your thoughts. Sit with your feelings. Observe your actions. And try to understand what these experiences tell you about why you respond as you do. </p>
<p>4. Nurture <a>empathy</a> and compassion for yourself. </p>
<a>sibling</a>. Or it might mean accepting that you cannot change a difficult situation and allowing yourself to feel the pain. For example, as you grieve over a loved one dying, you might share bittersweet memories with others.
<p>5. Sometimes it is important to take a respite from facing your hurt. </p>

<a>ADHD</a>? Well, there is increasing, though not yet definitive, evidence of a connection between reports of fatigue and ADHD in adults.
<h3>Why fatigue is so common with adult ADHD</h3>
<a>Short-term memory</a> is one component, but so are
<a>decision-making</a> and emotional
<a>management</a>—both up- and down-regulating feelings and
<a>motivation</a> are intimately connected with emotions—and all of these processes guide behavior, including task initiation, persistence, and/or switching.
