<h1> "I Have Not Fallen in Love for Years" </h1>
<h2> Why do people fear falling in love? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Fear? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to combat fear and anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>“We can easily <a>forgive</a> a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.” —Plato</p>
<p>Falling in love is an exciting and pleasant experience for most people. Why then, do so many people <a>fear</a> falling in love?</p>
<a>Romantic love</a> involves intense
<a>attraction</a> and meaningful
<a>friendship</a>, enabling personal development and self-fulfillment. Fear of falling in love (philophobia) involves a dissonance between intense attraction toward someone and the worry of the failure of achieving a profound bond.
<p>Factors underlying the fear of falling in love</p>
<p>“In falling in love, I let down all of my defenses, becoming mentally and physically naked. I trust a man and emotionally depend on him, but have no security net. If he lets me down, it will greatly hurt me.” —Helen</p>
<p>“There is no reason for women to fall in love after 40; it is better that the man loves you more than you love him. The fear is not of falling in love, but of an asymmetrical love.” —Anat</p>
<a>trauma</a> or neglect, abuse, and sickness or death of a parent, generate the fear of falling in love. I will not discuss these factors, but rather focus on the risks of the romantic process itself.
<p>The paradox of falling in love</p>
<p>“Falling in love again, never wanted to, what am I to do? Can't help it.” —<a>Marlene Dietrich</a></p>
<p>“What do you get when you fall in love? You only get lies and pain and sorrow, so far at least until tomorrow, I'll never fall in love again.” —<a>Dionne Warwick</a></p>

<p>"I fear falling in love very much, as I fear being abandoned. As a result, I twice ended up in marriages, where there was a lack of infatuation or space for me to grow and thrive.” —Lucy</p>
<p>“Even though I felt painful rejection from the love of my life, I kept my heart open, for I knew the benefits of love over the symptoms of a life without intimacy.” —Rebecca</p>

<p>“I am now in a wonderful romantic relationship with a divorcee with a child, but I cannot stand the thought that her ex-husband is a senior manager, while I am merely a low-ranking manager.” —Abraham</p>
<p>“My two husbands had low <a>self-esteem</a>; they were jealous of my previous lovers. My next three lovers had high self-esteem and did not ask me about it.” —Raya</p>
<a>romantic relationships</a>, which expresses not merely feeling good, but also the feeling of growth and development within that relationship, is more than merely surviving—it involves implementing and nurturing our values and capacities.
<p>“My self-esteem does not depend on my lover:” Self-esteem and romantic thriving</p>
<p>“I wanted my lover very much, but I knew that my self-esteem would be destroyed if he ever slept with another woman. He had low self-esteem and was constantly looking for the next conquest.” —Rose</p>
<p>“I have high self-esteem, and I am attracted to my lover because of his achievements. My self-esteem does not depend on him, but is enhanced by him.” —Ruby</p>
<p>“My self-esteem increased when knowing that my lovers had been with many women.” —Robin</p>
<a>jealousy</a>, insecurity, hostility, conflict and
<a>narcissism</a>, in which people have an inflated sense of self-importance and constantly need
<a>attention</a>, confirmation and excessive admiration, while lacking
<a>empathy</a>. The narcissist is like a bucket of water or an inflated balloon, where every minor stabbing (such as a negative comment about them) causes water to leak or the balloon to burst.
<p>“Please do not turn on the light:" Self-confidence and romantic thriving</p>
<p>“A genuine self-confidence involves calmness; extravagant, excessive self-confidence tries to hide a lack of self-confidence. Those with genuine self-confidence do not hide their vulnerability and are able to cope with it.” —Dina</p>

<h1> Why Some People Refuse to Kiss During Casual Sex </h1>
<h2> “I don't allow men I sleep with to kiss me." </h2>

<li>Most people see kissing as an essential part of a sexual encounter, but in casual hookups and commercial sex, some avoid kissing altogether.</li>
<li>While some sex workers refuse kissing, others do kiss, as part of providing a facsimile of relationship intimacy.</li>
<li>In hookups, people may eschew kissing because they don't want to feel intimacy, or find kissing without real intimacy distasteful.</li>
<p>“If there is no profound <a>intimacy</a>, I cannot kiss men during casual sex; they are human vibrators for my <a>sexual</a> release.” —Lilian</p>
<p>“My best, most passionate kissing, involving open wet lips and tongues touching, was during a casual sexually experience.” —Mia</p>
<p>Intimate kissing is central in romantic and sexual experiences. Why then, do some people avoid kissing during casual sexual experiences?</p>
<p>Should kissing be part of casual sexual experiences?</p>
<h3>Intimacy and kissing in commercial sex</h3>
<h3>Intimacy and casual sexual experiences</h3>
<p>“Kissing is the most intimate activity. I cannot kiss and have sex with someone I have no deep emotional bond with.” —Susan</p>
<p>“In casual sex, I allow men to cuddle and kiss me in any place on my body but the mouth, which is disgusting!!” —Grace</p>

<h3>Should casual sex include French kissing?</h3>
<p>“In my many casual sexual experiences, women have never refused kissing. If it happened, I would be insulted.” —Ethan</p>
<p>Here are several possible reasons:</p>
<a>orgasm</a>, they may not wish to sleep over, or share breakfast. However, it can be argued that even if kissing somewhat prolongs sexual experiences, it is not to the extent of modifying their brief nature.
<p>Likewise, others may be disgusted French kissing without strong intimacy. However, we may question whether kissing on the lips is less revolting when in loving relationships. And is oral sex less disgusting than kissing on the lips?</p>
<p>“Kissing is the most intimate activity; nevertheless, I do not consider kissing as sex or cheating. I would also not consider intimate conversations as such.” —Margaret</p>

<p>“I have always been attracted to older men; the age gap is good for me, as it keeps me younger.” —Omer</p>
<p>“Sexually? Younger guys are better (23 is the Goldilocks in my experience!) Relationship? Same age as me or slightly older.” —Mary</p>

<p>Here are several answers provided to the question, “How did you feel after sex with an ex?</p>
<li>“I am <a>sleeping</a> with my exes until I meet a new partner. The sex is an emotional turmoil including regret the morning after.”</li>
<li>“It’s honestly just made everything worse. I do not recommend it.”</li>
<li>“I slept with my ex just once. I am not attracted to my exes as each one belongs to a different period of my life where I was in a different developmental phase.”</li>
<li>“I usually do not enjoy sex with an ex. I am more excited by sex with my partner, who makes me feel like I’m at home, despite our many differences.”</li>
<li>“It made me realize that my ex should stay my ex.”</li>
<li>“The only difficult part of having sex with my ex, which I do every weekend, is that I don’t want to go out and look for a new lover because I love my ex’s body.”</li>
<li>“I continued having sex with my ex-husband after our <a>divorce</a>, and while neither of us had another partner. We both knew that it would not lead to remarriage, but the pleasant sex helped us realize that we were not enemies.”</li>
<li>“It is a mistake to go back to the past and an ex. I did it once, and I regret it.”</li>

<h1> Why Some Couples Love Having Sex Outdoors </h1>
<h2> Why do people love outdoor sex? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The most comfortable and easy location to have sex is in bed, in your bedroom. Why, then, do so many people prefer to have sex outdoors?</p>
<p>“In bed, sex is a given, and immediately afterwards, people fall asleep. After outdoor sex, people don’t go to sleep — they are too excited.” —Jenifer</p>
<p>“I love doing everything in bed. Having sex outside my bed is leaving my comfort zone.” —Grace</p>
<a>sexual</a> desire: a new partner typically generates greater sexual interest than a familiar one. The atmosphere, including the location, is significant in generating
<a>intimacy</a>. Sex in one’s own bed can be most intimate. As a divorcee said: “I bring only those I am in love with to my bed and want them to stay overnight. Casual, or emotionless sex, will never take place in my bed.”
<p>What was your most exciting sexual experience outdoors?</p>
<p>Here are few answers to the above question:</p>
<p>“The first time I had sex was extremely exciting, next to the pool, while the song ‘<a>Nights of White Satin</a>’, was playing. I married and <a>divorced</a> him within few years.”</p>
<p>“On the beach and inside the sea.”</p>
<p>“On a flight from New York to Paris.”</p>
<p>“Dentist’s chair.”</p>
<p>“Eiffel Tower.”</p>
<p>“While driving 70 mph down the I-95.”</p>
<p>“In the car during an automatic car wash.”</p>
<p>“The sexual experiences I had on the train, beach, a restaurant restroom, a colleague’s office and under the table in a pub, were amazing.”</p>

<p>Strangers on the train: Intense desire and profound intimacy</p>
<p>“I lived in Siberia, and often took the night train to Moscow. At night on the train, I met various people and sometimes had sex with them.” —Victoria</p>
<p>Casual sex is often considered a superficial experience, focusing on sexual release. Meeting strangers on a train (or plane) may create not only intense desire but also profound intimacy. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Sex in the car: Privacy in the public domain</p>
<p>“My lover and me were naked while making love in my car. A policeman saw us; he smiled and asked us not to do it again.” —Lydia</p>
<p>There are different levels of privacy in the public domain—the more limited the privacy, the more problematic the sex is, both legally and morally. Compared to the privacy of a car, sex under the table of the pub is a clearly public setting.</p>
<p>“My most exciting sex was during a jog on a trail. My partner and me were used to running together, and we always found a hiding place by a rock or under a tree. It was fast, exciting and daring.” —Maya </p>
<a>the environment</a>, it involves ignoring our social environment. During outdoor sex, lovers are similar to children—they do not care about others, but rather focus on themselves, while breaking social conventions.
<p>Outdoor sex does not eliminate the value of sex in bed at home, but it merely adds an exciting flavor that, when performed in suitable locations and doses, enhances romantic intimacy.</p>

<h1> What Makes a Good Flirt? </h1>
<h2> The seductive power of flirting. </h2>
<p>”I flirt all the time. I like men! I don't think we can do without them.”—Nina Simone</p>
<p>What makes a good flirt? Though one might argue flirting is merely an enjoyable and playful romantic game, in actuality, it encompasses many contradictory aspects, which an ambitious flirt must master in order to be successful.</p>
<h3>The Nature of Successful Flirting</h3>
<p>“I hate arrogance so I am disgusted by men telling me how rich and successful they are the first time I meet them.”—Grace</p>
<li>Nonverbal behavior including the right amount of eye contact, smelling good, and smiling;</li>
<li><a>Intelligence</a> expressed in <a>humor</a>, wit, level of <a>education</a>, and interesting conversation;</li>
<li>A gentle approach including respectful, mature, and polite behavior;</li>
<li>Cheerfulness relating to companionship and fun;</li>
<li>Romantic intent associated with sweetness and tenderness;</li>
<li>Courage and determination accompanied by <a>confidence</a> and persistence;</li>
<li>Commonalities of values and fields of interest, enabling smooth dialogue;</li>
<li>Good looks generating an initial <a>attraction</a>;</li>
<li>A mysterious allure encouraging a continuation of the bond.</li>
<a>sexual</a> character. When women flirt, they use a richer variety of nonverbal behavior including smiling, eye contact, touching their partner, and other kinds of
<h3>The seductive power of words</h3>
<h3>Should flirting be mysterious and vague?</h3>
<p>“I do not say what I wish on a first date. I want him to sweat a little bit. That’s why I will not allow him to touch me on a first date. However, if I like him, I will put my hand on his knees on a second date.”—Shulamit </p>
<p>“When a man flirts with me, I want him to be sincere and open. When I flirt, I am more careful and keep my cards to my chest.”—Iris</p>
<a>conform</a> to any standard and being able to delay satisfaction without offering total satisfaction.
<a>romantic relationship</a> should reveal a commitment to invest time and effort for nurturing the relationship—creating a feeling of uncertainty in the other is not necessarily advisable.
<h3>Seduction, courting, and marketing in flirting</h3>
<p>“The first date isn’t a <a>marketing</a> event, but a game intended to increase the desire to meet again.”—Diana</p>
<p>“Sales agents barge through the door, but the flirt wants to settle in your heart.”—Julia</p>
<p>“If you don't flirt, you're probably dead inside.”—Katharine Towne</p>
<p>“I love to flirt, and I've never met a man I didn't like.”—Dolly Parton</p>
<a>friendship</a> (in addition to sex) and so sincerity and mutual self-exposure are essential. People who are courting have no urgent
<a>goals</a> to achieve and are ready to patiently wait while investing time and resources for nurturing the relationship (Ben-Ze'ev, 2019).
<p>People can, of course, improve their flirting technique, but more important is maintaining gentle and respectable behavior. A big smile and open heart would suffice for a good beginning.</p>

<h1> How Picky Should You Be About a Romantic Partner? </h1>
<h2> The difference between extreme and healthy pickiness in dating. </h2>
<li>Pickiness is necessary in romantic relationships to some extent.</li>
<li>Extreme pickiness can be harmful to relationships, but moderate pickiness is healthy and can help people find a suitable partner.</li>
<li>Healthy pickiness involves looking for a suitable rather than perfect partner and focusing on deal-maker and deal-breaker traits.</li>
<li>Healthy pickiness also involves integrating emotional intuition with rational considerations and focusing on bringing out the best in each other.</li>
<p>"I’m not picky, I just know what I deserve.” —Angelo Caerlang</p>
<h3>The Nature of Romantic Pickiness</h3>
<p>“You see how picky I am about my shoes and they only go on my feet.” —Alicia Silverstone</p>
<a>divorced</a>, or even worse, be miserable within
<a>marriage</a>. We are picky about our car, clothes and food. Why should we not be picky about our romantic partner?
<a>fear</a> if they fail to do so. They tend to quickly disqualify people and are likely to miss out on suitable candidates because of superficial shortcomings.
<h3>What Does Healthy Pickiness Look Like?</h3>
<p>“Most people can't find love because they're picky, they overanalyze and they find things wrong in people. We call them ‘flaw finders’.” —Patti Stanger</p>
<a>intuition</a> with rational considerations; and bringing out the best in each other.
<p>1. Looking for the suitable rather than the perfect partner</p>
<p>“If you look for perfection, you’ll never be content.” —Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>2. Focusing on deal-maker and deal-breaker traits</p>
<p>3. Intuition combined with rational considerations</p>
<p>“A rational person would know that, under certain conditions, it is better to follow her emotional intuition than to engage in elaborate intellectual gymnastics.” —Jon Elster</p>
<a>decision-making</a> process, in which long-term factors are considered.
<p>4. Bringing out the best in each other</p>
<p>“I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.” —Elizabeth Barrett Browning</p>
<h3>Does Romance Require Pickiness?</h3>
<p>“My mother was very picky in recommending my ideal wife. She wanted me to marry a physician, but as she got older and needed constant help, she recommended a nurse.” —Aaron</p>
<p>“Pickiness shouldn’t focus on isolated traits but on an emotional bond. It is a pity that I wasn’t pickier before my marriage.” —Audrey</p>
<p>Picky people based their uncompromising attitude upon their wish to only have the love they see in the movies. Does romance necessarily need such extreme pickiness?</p>
<a>romantic relationships</a>. The essence of love resides not in the isolated traits of a person, but the person as a whole.
<p>Even if someone is wise, beautiful and rich, we still may not be attracted to them. In matters of the heart, gut feeling is a better guide. We can, to a certain extent, nurture our heart in order to fulfill what we want.</p>

<h1> Navigating Feelings of Romantic Inferiority </h1>
<h2> When you envy your successful spouse. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>One partner's ongoing success can sometimes damage the quality of the relationship. Occasional accomplishments don't have the same effect.</li>
<li>Successful men often choose to marry women who are marginally more successful than they are, but not significantly more successful.</li>
<li>People can try to find joy in their partners' happiness and maintain equal decision-making power as the relationship progresses.</li>
<p>“I married beneath me, all women do.” —Lady Nancy Astor</p>
<p>“I have always preferred a partner whom I consider superior to me in various ways. The gap motivates me to enhance my strongest characteristics. I can’t respect women who choose men inferior to them.” —Iris</p>
<a>Envy</a>, at its core, is the experience of feeling undeservedly inferior. Feelings of inequality and inferiority are particularly damaging in enduring
<a>romantic relationships</a>, as any shared experiences between the couple can be impacted (Ben-Ze’ev, 2000; 2019). According to John Gottman’s studies, unequal relationships are laced with contempt, which significantly correlates with
<a>divorce</a>. Other research suggests that unequal relationships generate more extramarital affairs for both partners (Prins et al., 1993).
<a>shy</a> partner with his easygoing counterpart or an absent-minded partner, whose lover is organized. Of course, taken to the extreme, differences can be harmful, especially if they expose considerable gaps in essential aspects of life, such as
<a>intelligence</a> or the ability for personal growth. In the latter examples, envy is more likely to arise.
<a>sexual</a> desire, like many differences often do. However, in the long-term, it may become an obstacle to experiencing enduring meaningful, shared activities (Ben-Ze’ev, 2019).
<h3>Why Competition Is Harmful in Relationships</h3>
<p>The biblical claim that “writers’ envy increases <a>wisdom</a>” assumes that <a>competition</a> makes people learn and improve. In romantic relationships, the situation is more complex and in most instances, competition is fatal.</p>
<a>generosity</a> and sympathetic joy for the beloved’s success. Thus, people do not envy their children’s success – rather, they are happy and even consider themselves part of that success. A sympathetic joy in your partner’s
<a>happiness</a> is also possible in romantic love when you are not part of such happiness. This is the case in the emotion of compersion, more common in
<a>polyamory</a>, and expresses joy in your partner’s happiness with another lover.
<h3>Development and Self-Fulfillment in Romantic Relationships</h3>
<p>“Be with someone who wants to see you grow.” —Tony Payne</p>
