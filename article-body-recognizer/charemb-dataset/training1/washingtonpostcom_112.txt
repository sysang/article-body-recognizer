<div><h1>How extreme climate conditions fueled unprecedented Colorado fire</h1></div>
<h2>Record warmth and extreme drought, intensified by climate change, set the stage for the devastating blaze</h2>

<div><p>‘Total devastation’ after wildfire charges through Colorado towns</p></div>
<div><div><p>According to climate scientists, extreme fires tend to be “climate-enabled and weather-driven”; this was a classic case and one that is projected to become more frequent as the planet warms.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado and Wyoming see record blizzard, historic snowfall in Denver and Cheyenne</p></div>
<div><div><p>The timing of drought onset was unusual. Rapid increases in drought severity in Colorado typically occur in the spring and summer months. Seeing this deterioration in the fall and winter was much more rare.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The drought level where the fires erupted was “extreme,” the second-highest category.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unusually warm conditions intensified the drought; they began this summer and continued through this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“From June 1-Dec 29, the Front Range has been the warmest on record (by far),” tweeted Russ Schumacher, Colorado’s state climatologist on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Between June and November, Colorado’s statewide temperatures ranked in the top 10th percentile.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The combination of warm and dry conditions led to worrisome indicators of fire danger.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Rip-roaring winds</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gusts exceeded 70 mph at Boulder Airport on Thursday afternoon, and even topped 100 mph at more open, exposed areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These types of downslope wind storms, sometimes called Chinooks, are not uncommon in the Colorado Front Range. But this event was on the strong end of the spectrum.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Climate change connections</div></h3></div></div>
<p>This historic and devastating fire isn’t a one-off event, but fits into a pattern toward larger fires in both Colorado and other parts of the West in recent years, as well as an expansion of the fire season to practically year-round.</p>
<div><div><p>Scientists have published numerous studies tying more extreme fire behavior to higher temperatures and more intense drought, both linked to human-caused climate change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“With CLIMATE CHANGE, there is no FIRE SEASON anymore,” tweeted Mike Nelson, chief meteorologist for Denver7, the city’s ABC affiliate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This fire disaster also casts light on the danger of building and development into the zones prone to wildfire or what scientists call the wildland-urban interface, which is becoming more vulnerable with climate warming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Climate change only increases the risk from fire to people residing along this perilous interface.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our warming climate is enabling more opportunities each year human activities / infrastructure are providing ignitions,” tweeted Phil Higuera, a professor of fire ecology at University of Montana.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Twitter’s new strategy to fight climate lies: Give users accurate information first</h1></div>
<h2>The platform says it is using prebunks — “reliable, authoritative hubs of information” — to get ahead of misleading narratives.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Gregg</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 1, 2021|Updated November 1, 2021 at 6:32 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Twitter says it is attempting to combat climate disinformation by steering its massive user base to reliable information with more context, a strategy the company calls “pre-bunking.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Despite spills and air pollution, fossil fuel companies award CEOs for environmental records</p></div>
<div><div><p>“These pre-bunks will surface authoritative context across a range of key themes, like the science backing climate change and global warming realities,” Busby said</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The platform is focused on elevating credible information from global experts, Busby said. The idea is to prime users with reliable data before someone else can spam them with falsehoods.</p></div></div>
<p>Corporate interests have sought to discredit climate science for decades, employing a variety of means to politicize the subject and undermine efforts to limit emissions, according to a <a>2015 report</a> from the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
<div><p>These self-described trolls tackle climate disinformation on social media with wit and memes</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some companies have moved to contain their reach.<b> </b>Last month, YouTube, a Google subsidiary, rolled out a policy designed to prevent people from making money off content that denies climate change.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>accurate posts and building information hubs. In late September, the platform
<a>kicked off</a> a glossy video campaign to elevate information put out by climate activists. It also added to a company-branded
<a>Climate Science Center</a> designed to give users a centralized source for accurate information on climate change. In some cases, the company has added information labels to posts that redirect people to the Center.
<div><div><p>Facebook also announced a $1 million investment in a new grant program, administered by the International Fact-Checking Network, to support organizations working to combat climate misinformation.</p></div></div>
<a>exacerbated by its platforms</a> and exposed
<a>vulnerable communities</a> to a cocktail of dangerous content. A whistleblower last month turned over tens of thousands of internal company documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
<div><p>Facebook keeps researching its own harms — and burying the findings</p></div>
<div><div><p>Twitter’s announcement Monday made pointed references to “climate change and global warming realities” and a commitment to “keep pace with the urgency of the climate crisis.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Busby, the Twitter spokeswoman, did not respond to questions about whether climate misinformation had ever triggered a platform violation on the basis of platform manipulation.</p></div></div>
<p>A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that former president Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord in January 2017. He announced plans in June 2017. This article has been corrected.</p>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>

<div><h1>Democrats' climate provisions meet the 'Byrd bath,' as Manchin targets the methane fee</h1></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Maxine Joselow</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 9, 2021 at 8:14 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Today we're wondering if buying a castle in Connecticut would be cheaper than renting an apartment in D.C. 😅 But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Democrats' climate provisions may survive the ‘Byrd bath,' but not Manchin</div></h4></div></div>
<p>The Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, is reviewing this week whether the climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act fit the rules for reconciliation — a special budget process that allows Democrats to bypass a GOP filibuster.</p>
<div><div><p>The “Byrd rule" or "Byrd bath," named after the late Senate majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), requires that reconciliation bills have a direct effect on the budget, such as through new taxes or spending. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said yesterday that he thinks a $320 billion package of clean energy tax credits — the most significant climate provision in the House-passed version of bill — satisfies that rule.</p></div>
<div><div><p>"This is clearly in the area of tax policy. It is a federal expenditure well over $300 billion," he told reporters. "And this is, of course, the linchpin in terms of the current effort to try to deal with climate change."</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wyden added in no uncertain terms: "I'm confident we'll clear the Byrd bath requirements."</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The reconciliation bill includes Wyden's <a>"Clean Energy for America Act,"</a> which would extend three technology-neutral tax credits aimed at encouraging clean electricity, clean transportation and energy efficiency.</p></div></div>
<a>expressed concerns about the bonus EV tax credit</a>, saying it discriminates against foreign automakers whose workers are not unionized.
<div><div><h5><div>Sen. Smith is feeling good</div></h5></div></div>
<p>Democrats already dropped a central climate provision for the power sector — dubbed the Clean Electricity Performance Program, or CEPP — from the bill because of Manchin's opposition, <a>The Climate 202 previously reported</a>. </p>
<div><div><p>But Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), the main architect of the CEPP, told The Climate 202 yesterday that she is "confident" the clean energy subsidies will survive scrutiny from both Manchin and MacDonough.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>"I think the hardest working parts … are the clean power tax credits, which seem to me clearly fitting under the constraints of reconciliation," Smith said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Manchin targets the methane fee</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, Manchin told reporters yesterday that he continues to have concerns about a fee on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can leak from oil and gas wells.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchin reiterated that he thinks the methane fee would be duplicative of new methane regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>"If they’re basically complying with the regulations, then they shouldn’t be subject to the fee," he said of oil and natural gas producers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchin made a similar argument when he objected to the CEPP, as CNN's Ella Nilsen noted:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the House, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) has <a>emerged as another vocal foe</a> of the methane fee:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for Cuellar and Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), whose panel has jurisdiction over the methane fee, did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Clean energy leaders' push</div></h5></div></div>
<a>letter</a> shared exclusively with The Climate 202.
<div><div><p>In particular, the letter calls on Congress to create good-paying manufacturing and construction jobs in the clean energy sector as the country recovers from the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs are at stake,” the letter says. “Our nation’s workers, and our climate, cannot afford the cost of inaction.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The leaders signing the missive included Lynn Abramson, president of the Clean Energy Business Network, and Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Pressure points</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden wants the federal government to be carbon neutral by 2050</div></h4></div></div>
<a>The Post's Anna Phillips reports</a>.
<div><div><p>The administration laid out a timeline of how it will meet its target:</p></div></div>
<li>By 2027: The government stops buying gas-powered passenger cars.</li>
<li>By 2030: The administration will have leveraged its buying power to cut government carbon emissions by 65 percent. Federal operations at this point run entirely on carbon-free electricity.</li>
<li>By 2035: The government’s fleet of roughly 645,000 vehicles goes green, as the government stops buying gas-powered vehicles and switches to zero-emission heavy-duty trucks and cars.</li>
<li>By 2045: Most of the buildings owned or leased by the government no longer contribute to carbon pollution.</li>
<div><p>The plan met with opposition from some Republicans. Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said the executive order would hurt states with large fossil fuel reserves. </p></div>
<div><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce responded more cautiously, saying it was still reviewing the plan. And some left-leaning groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and the Sunrise Movement, said the order did not go far enough.</p></div>

<div><h1>Cutting emissions from buildings is a key part of 'building back better'</h1></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Maxine Joselow</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 10, 2021 at 8:18 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good morning and happy Friday! As a quick scheduling note, The Climate 202 won't publish on Monday. We'll be back in your inboxes on Tuesday. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Congress and New York City are tackling climate pollution from buildings</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>In climate policy circles, it's popular to focus on the need to reduce emissions from transportation. That means we often hear about electric vehicles as climate solutions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But another major source of planet-warming emissions in the United States — buildings — is poised to get some love from policymakers in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Burning fossil fuels for electricity in buildings accounts for roughly 13 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, although some experts put that figure even higher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The developments on Capitol Hill and in New York are welcome news to Ben Evans, the federal legislative director at the U.S. Green Building Council, an advocacy group.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Building back better — literally</p></div></div>
<li>A $500 million critical facility modernization program would provide a bucket of money that schools or municipal buildings could dip into to reduce their energy use.</li>
<li>A $300 million grant program at the Department of Energy would help states and municipalities adopt the latest building codes, as well as zero-energy building codes.</li>
<div><div><p>These provisions could make it up to $10,000 cheaper for Americans to convert their homes from fossil-fuel-based to electricity-based heating and cooling, according to a fact sheet from the Sierra Club.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A senior House Democratic aide expressed confidence that these provisions would meet the rules for reconciliation — a special budget process that allows Democrats to bypass a GOP filibuster.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We've been working very closely with the Senate to make sure these meet all the reconciliation requirements," said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the deliberations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The Big Apple goes big on buildings</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, the New York City Council is expected to vote next week on legislation to ban natural gas hookups in new construction. </p></div></div>
<li>The bill requires new buildings less than seven stories to go electric by Jan. 1, 2024, and taller ones after July 1, 2027. Construction projects that get permits approved before those dates will be exempt.</li>
<p>Pete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at New York Communities for Change, one of the groups that pushed for the bill, told The Climate 202 that the measure will protect the planet and the health of millions of New Yorkers.</p>
<div><div><p>"It's nice to live in a building that doesn't kill you," Sikora said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Industry pushback</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the country, the natural gas industry has lobbied heavily against gas bans, going so far as to pay Instagram influencers to gush over gas stoves, <a>Mother Jones reported</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>These are the top climate stories of 2021</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>But as 2022 approaches, Democrats are still scrambling to pass their key climate legislation amid intraparty divisions, while the U.N. climate summit punted many of the thorniest issues in international climate diplomacy to next year.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, the effects of climate change continued apace, with extreme weather causing devastating flooding and heat waves. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here's a look back at the biggest stories this year:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>1. The goal of 1.5 degrees is alive but on life support after the U.N. summit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>World leaders, delegates, activists and celebrities from nearly 200 nations descended on Glasgow, Scotland, at the end of October for what was certainly the biggest climate event of the year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the two weeks of fierce negotiations over emissions commitments, carbon trading and reparations for climate damage was not enough to put the world on track to avoiding catastrophic climate change. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>"[W]e can say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees within reach, but its pulse is weak,” COP26 President Alok Sharma said after the summit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sharma appeared emotional on the final day of the summit when China and India mounted a successful last-minute change to the text, <a>weakening the language around coal</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I apologize for the way this process has unfolded,” he told negotiators, his voice almost breaking. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>2. President Biden has moved to undo his predecessor's environmental actions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden came into office promising a full, government-wide effort on climate change. And he started with a bang, signing measures to rejoin the Paris climate accord and block the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he wants to pass Democrats’ roughly $2 trillion economic package, which includes $555 billion in climate funding, before Christmas. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But that may be a tall order. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the Senate, and Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has not yet committed to voting for the bill.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Air pollution still disproportionately harms communities of color, study says</h1></div>

<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! We're still waiting to see if Congress will pass the Build Back Better Act before Christmas. More on that below. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A new study found that people of color face higher exposure to six air pollutants. Biden wants to address that.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the air in the United States has gotten cleaner since 1990, people of color are still exposed to six major air pollutants more than White people, according to research published today.</p></div></div>
<p>The <a>study</a> by University of Washington researchers, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, is one of the most comprehensive looks to date at the racial and ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure nationwide.</p>
<p>It comes as President Biden seeks to prioritize environmental justice by steering federal investments in clean energy toward communities that have borne the brunt of pollution for decades, including low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.</p>
<div><div><p>Their main findings were:</p></div></div>
<li>While overall pollutant levels have dropped since 1990, when Congress amended the Clean Air Act, people of color are still more likely to be exposed to all six pollutants than White people in all 50 states and D.C.</li>
<li>In 2010, Black Americans faced the greatest exposure to PM2.5, while Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans had the greatest exposure to NO2.</li>
<li>These racial and ethnic disparities persisted even when the researchers accounted for income level distributions.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>History of environmental racism</div></h5></div></div>
<div><p>The researchers didn't identify the causes of the disparities. But a large body of academic literature shows that people of color are more likely to live near power plants, toxic waste sites, factories and other polluting facilities.</p></div>
<div><div><p>There's also growing evidence that decades of racist housing policies are to blame.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Biden's environmental justice push</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after taking office, Biden issued an <a>executive order</a> that took aim at these long-standing inequities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“What is surprising and disturbing,” he said, “is that our government has allowed this to continue to happen in the face of voluminous evidence pointing to these kinds of racial disparities and health disparities.”</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Climate solutions</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>First in The Climate 202: Report finds big climate benefits from protecting natural areas</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>The <a>research</a> by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank closely aligned with the White House, illustrates the value of conserving natural areas so that they can store carbon and slow the rate of the Earth's warming.</p></div>
<a>paper</a> published yesterday in the journal Nature Communications Earth Environment by researchers at Oregon State University. The paper identified several Western U.S. forests that could store the most carbon and safeguard the most biodiversity.
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Senate Democrats huddled over the climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, it appears increasingly unlikely that Democrats can pass BBB before Christmas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Agency alert</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Granholm told oil executives that an export ban is not under consideration</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm reassured oil executives that the Biden administration is not considering reinstating a ban on the export of crude oil, <a>Bloomberg's Ari Natter reports</a>. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, welcomed the comments:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, said the administration's stance betrayed a lack of urgency about the climate crisis:</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Climate change has transformed the Arctic and Antarctic, creating ripples that will affect the entire planet,<a> The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other end of the world, research shows that a crucial ice shelf in the Antarctic could collapse <a>within three to five years</a>, potentially causing a dramatic rise in sea levels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Biden will visit Kentucky to survey tornado damage</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden will travel to Kentucky today for a briefing and then to survey damage caused by the deadliest December tornado outbreak on record.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The science linking tornadoes to climate change is not as robust as the evidence linking it to wildfires or flooding, but experts say warmer temperatures<a> could fuel</a> more intense storms and tornadoes.</p></div></div>
<a> The Post's Sean Sullivan and Annie Linskey report</a>. While activists see the deadly tornadoes as yet more evidence for urgent climate action, Republicans are quick to criticize any claim of a climate connection that goes beyond what is verifiable.
<div><div><p>“We have to be very careful — we can’t say with absolute certainty that it was because of climate change,” Biden said Monday.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>It's a turbulent time for coronavirus and Congress</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 8:08 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Today we're exploring what we know — and don't know — about omicron and diving into Biden's recent actions on everything from Obamacare to drug pricing. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Welcome to 2022 and lots of shifting fault lines in the health-care world</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the country: Coronavirus cases are surging. Hospitals fear staffing shortages. Americans are scrambling to find tests. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here in Washington: Tensions over passing President Biden’s economic package reached a boiling point in the wake of opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The omicron challenge</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>That poses a massive challenge for the Biden administration. Officials are trying to balance curbing the spread of infection with ensuring essential services stay open, but those efforts are already facing backlash. </p></div></div>
<li>Last week, federal health officials recommended shortening the isolation period for people with asymptomatic coronavirus infections — or if their symptoms are resolving — to five days.</li>
<div><div><p>But now, health officials could change course. Fauci said Sunday that the CDC is considering adding a testing component, The Post’s Jeff Stein reports.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci on ABC’s “This Week”:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Where are the tests?</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Americans would need to be able to find tests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The holidays exposed the limits of the country's testing capacity, as appointments filled up and Americans scoured retail stores and the web to find rapid at-home tests. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill…</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats will attempt to salvage Biden’s legislative agenda. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Quote of the year</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Thanks to everyone who voted for our first quote of the year. The results are in … and the winner is West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) for his clear-eyed assessment of who should get a booster shot. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In my opinion, if you're breathing, you can qualify,” Justice said even before federal officials endorsed booster shots for all adults. His comments were captured in this Politico story. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>What we know — and don’t know — about omicron</div></h4></div></div>
<p>Coronavirus cases are skyrocketing to their highest levels during the pandemic, largely due to the contagious omicron variant. And those record numbers are happening despite the fact that many cases detected via home tests go unreported. </p>
<p>Still, a small share of a large number can leave hospitals reeling. Hospitalizations have risen 31 percent over the past week, and that’s at a time when some health-care workers are out of commission because they, too, have tested positive.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Agency alert</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>ICYMI: The Biden administration released a slew of decisions aiming to put its stamp on Obamacare and rescind Trump-era moves on drug pricing and Medicaid. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s a quick rundown:</p></div></div>
<p>New rules of the road for Obamacare: The Biden administration is proposing to ban health insurance issuers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity — an effort representing a reversal from the Trump era.</p>
<div><ul><li>In a statement, a CMS spokesperson said the agency will “continue to carefully consider” comments it received on the measure as it explores ways of paying for medical treatments.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>No Medicaid work requirement for Georgia: The Biden administration decided Georgia’s partial Medicaid expansion can’t include a work requirement or charge people premiums. Read CMS’ letter here.</p></div></div>
<li>The Trump administration approved the state’s plan to extend Medicaid up to 100% of the federal poverty line. But the measure hadn’t yet gone into effect amid negotiations with Biden’s CMS over the controversial work rules.</li>
<li>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, plans to fight the agency’s decision in court, per The Atlanta-Journal Constitution.</li>
<div><div><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Our top holiday reads</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Twitter suspended the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) over covid misinformation, The Post’s Brittany Shammas reports.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Daybook</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what we’re watching to kick off the new year:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early this week: The Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize booster shots of the of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds, per The Post's Dan Diamond. (The New York Times first reported the news.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wednesday: The Senate HELP committee will consider the nomination of Robert Califf for FDA commissioner. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Friday: The Supreme Court will hold a special hearing to consider challenges to the Biden administration’s vaccine or testing mandate for private businesses and its vaccine requirement for health care workers.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>A 500-year-old tree in Alaska could be cut down</div></h4></div></div>
<a>The Post's Juliet Eilperin reports</a> in the fifth installment of the
<a>Invisible investigative series</a>.
<div><div><p>Under former president Donald Trump, the U.S. Forest Service chose the tree to be cut down and removed by helicopter. But under Biden, large-scale old-growth logging in the Tongass has been halted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Mexico's wheat fields are feeding the world — and warming it</div></h4></div></div>
<a>The Post's Joshua Partlow reports</a> as part of the Invisible series.
<div><div><p>Mexico's emissions of nitrous oxide may be double or even quadruple what the country reports to the United Nations — a problem the Mexican government acknowledged to The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A glacier in Antarctica is in trouble</div></h4></div></div>
<a>Rolling Stone's Jeff Goodell reports</a>. The Thwaites glacier is the size of Florida and holds back enough ice to raise sea levels worldwide by 10 feet. 
<div><div><p>“Ten feet of sea level rise would be a world-bending catastrophe,” Goodell writes. “It’s not only goodbye Miami, but goodbye to virtually every low-lying coastal city in the world.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>John Kerry wants to close the emissions gap</div></h4></div></div>
<a>interview with The Post's Steven Mufson, Brady Dennis and Michael Birnbaum</a>.
<div><div><p>🚘 Our favorite line from the interview: “Kerry, who drives a Tesla and nearly pulled away with its recharging device as he spoke to The Post by phone," called for greater accountability in emissions reporting.</p></div></div>

<a>our friends at The Early 202 reported this morning</a>.
<a>spoke with Manchin</a> after the centrist senator came out firmly against BBB on “Fox News Sunday,” although it's unclear how much the two have been in touch since then.
<p>BBB contains a $555 billion package of tax credits, grants and other policies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions and boosting clean energy. If passed, it would be the largest piece of climate legislation ever enacted in the United States.</p>
<a>The Post's Jeff Stein and Tyler Pager reported</a>.

<a>Jason Samenow, Jacob Feuerstein and Becky Bolinger report for The Post</a>.
<div><div><p>Warm weather and drought conditions through the fall, combined with a historic lack of snowfall, turned vegetation into a tinderbox. These conditions were exacerbated by a ferocious windstorm with gusts over 100 mph.</p></div></div>
<p>The devastating fire is part of a pattern of more extreme blazes. Four of the five largest wildfires known to have affected Colorado have occurred in the past three years, according to data from the state's Division of Fire Prevention and Control.</p>

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 7:44 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good morning — we hope you enjoyed yesterday's winter weather as much as this panda rolling around in his first snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: The FDA authorized booster shots for 12-to-15-year-olds, and coronavirus cases are spiking on Capitol Hill. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Forecasters say omicron peak could come this month</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest surge of coronavirus cases could peak as soon as this month while the highly contagious omicron variant speeds through the U.S. population.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The nation’s case count is already reaching record levels, as the omicron variant tears through the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Forecasting the future</div></h5></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“It’s spreading much faster than we ever expected,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at IHME.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>The caveat: Some health experts are quick to note the virus has proven itself to be unpredictable time and time again. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>An important indicator</div></h5></div></div>
<li>“The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” Fauci said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”</li>
<div><p>Data on case counts and hospitalizations serve different purposes, some say. For state officials, infection rates are important to understand where the virus is spreading and the demographics of the populations most impacted. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Some governors are already sounding the alarm, as they ready for what's likely to be a brutal next few weeks as the country enters Year 3 of its pandemic response. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for 12-to-15-year-olds</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>On tap Wednesday: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers are expected to review the moves, with the agency director, Rochelle Walensky, expected to sign off as soon as that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Here's what else we're watching:</div></h4></div></div>
<li>More than 3,000 flights were canceled yesterday as airlines grappled with winter weather and staffing shortages tied to surging coronavirus cases, per our colleague Lori Aratani.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Coronavirus cases skyrocket on Capitol Hill</div></h4></div></div>
<div><ul><li>House and Senate offices should telework much as possible, Monahan wrote, and those on the Hill should upgrade their masks, using more protective KN95 or N95 masks instead of cloth or surgical masks.</li></ul></div>
