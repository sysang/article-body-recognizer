<h1>Body of missing Canadian woman found in hotel water tank, officials testing drinking water</h1>
<p>LOS ANGELES – Canadian tourist Elisa Lam had been missing for about two weeks when officials at the historic Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles found her body in a water cistern on the hotel roof.</p>
<p>Guest complaints about low water pressure prompted a maintenance worker to make the gruesome discovery Tuesday, and officials were trying to determine if the 21 year old was killed or if her death was just a bizarre accident.</p>
<p>Powell said the likelihood of contamination is minimal given the large amount of water the body was found in, but the department is being extra cautious.</p>
<p>LAPD Sgt. Rudy Lopez called Lam's death suspicious. Before she died, hotel surveillance footage showed her inside an elevator pushing buttons and sticking her head out the doors, looking in both directions.</p>
<p>Lam, of Vancouver, British Columbia, traveled alone to Los Angeles on Jan. 26 and was last seen five days later by workers at the 600-room hotel near Skid Row.</p>
<p>The cisterns are on a platform at least 10 feet above the roof. To get to the tanks, someone would have to go to the top floor then take a staircase with a locked door and emergency alarm preventing roof access.</p>
<p>Another ladder would have to be taken to the platform and a person would have to climb the side of the tank. Lopez said there are no security cameras on the roof.</p>
<p>Lam intended to travel to Santa Cruz, about 350 miles north of Los Angeles. Officials said she tended to use public transportation and had been in touch with her family daily until she disappeared.</p>
<p>British tourist Michael Baugh and his wife said water had only trickled from the tap for days before the body was found.</p>
<p>"The moment we found out, we felt a bit sick to the stomach, quite literally," Baugh said.</p>
<p>"We're just going from one dodgy place to another," Baugh said, resigned, "but at least there's water."</p>

<h1>Netflix’s ‘Night Stalker’ series criticized by viewers for graphic nature</h1>
<h2>Richard Ramirez died in 2013 after decades on death row</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Fox News Flash top entertainment headlines for January 14</a></h4> <p>Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.</p></div></div>
<p>Many are taking to social media to share their displeasure at <a>Netflix</a>’s new limited docuseries, "<a>Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer</a>."</p>
<a>Richard Ramirez</a>, a serial killer known as the Night Stalker who terrorized Southern California in the mid-1980s. Ramirez ended up being convicted of 13 murders, five attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries in 1989.
<p>The story of Ramirez’s reign of terror is brutal in itself, but a number of viewers who pressed play on Netflix’s re-visitation of the Night Stalker found the program to be too much to handle and many had to turn it off.</p>
<p>"Watching the new Netflix ‘Night Stalker’ series. No need for them to include the victim crime scene photos, and slo-mo blood splatter shots, it’s not necessary," <a>wrote</a> one Twitter user who couldn’t stomach the grisly visuals.</p>
<p><a>HORRIFIC DETAILS OF THE NIGHT STALKER'S CRIMES</a></p>
<p>The four-part series’ production featured gory re-enactments and displays of actual crime scene photos – everything true-crime fans generally love when exploring a mystery, but many were turned off.</p>
<p>"Not sure if I can get through all of #NightStalker on Netflix," admitted <a>another viewer</a>, adding, "This is tough viewing."</p>
<p><a>NOW ON FOX NATION: THE DAY DIANNE FEINSTEIN JEOPARDIZED 'THE NIGHT STALKER' INVESTIGATION</a></p>
<p>Another indulger said they even had trouble sleeping after watching the series: "#NightStalker is wildddddd ... couldn't sleep last night."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some folks said they wouldn’t even subject themselves to the trauma, giving the title a hard pass.</p>
<p>"Not sure I wanna see The Night Stalker doc series [because] I remember living through it and being terrified that summer of '85," <a>tweeted</a> writer Gary King, adding in <a>another tweet</a>, "that was a crazy summer."</p>
<p><a>BEWARE THE NIGHT STALKER</a></p>
<p>And other true-crime buffs said they were locked into the spectacle.</p>
<p>"I love True Crime docs but even I’m finding this one extremely dark twisted," <a>wrote one.</a> "Impossible to stop watching though!"</p>
<p>Ramirez <a>died in 2013</a> while on death row.</p>
<p>Netflix did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.</p>

<h1>California would-be victim manages to get robbers' gun, uses it against them shooting one dead</h1>
<h2>Three armed men in South Los Angeles attempted to rob the man early Saturday morning</h2>
<p>A man near the University of Southern California fought back against three armed would-be robbers, killing one of them with a gun they dropped during the altercation. </p>
<p>Three armed men in their 20s exited a vehicle early Saturday morning in South Los Angeles and attempted to rob the unidentified man, <a><u>Los Angeles Police Department</u></a> spokesperson Norma Eisenman told the Los Angeles Times. </p>
<p>An altercation broke out after the victim resisted complying with the suspects. One of the <a><u>suspected robbers</u> </a>then dropped his handgun, and the victim picked it up and shot the suspect, according to police. </p>
<p><a><u>CALIFORNIA FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERS WORE ‘POLICE-TYPE’ GEAR WHILE FORCING VICTIMS INSIDE AT GUNPOINT, VIDEO SHOWS</u></a></p>
<p>The two other would-be robbers fled. The man who was shot was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>
<div> <div><p> LAPD badge (LAPD)</p></div></div>
<p>The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed, the Los Angeles Times reported. The victim was questioned by police and released. </p>
<p>The attempted robbery in Los Angeles comes as numerous brazen theft cases have plagued the city and other areas in the state, most notably smash-and-grab lootings. </p>
<p><a><u>CALIFORNIA BURGLARS POSING AS LANDSCAPERS TARGET ASIAN-AMERICAN HOMES, POLICE SAY</u></a></p>

<p>With homeowners now holding more tappable equity in their home, they can access this money through a cash-out refinance. <a><u>Visit Credible to compare your refinance options</u></a> and find your personalized interest rate for a new mortgage.</p>
<p><a><u>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RAISES 2022 FHA LOAN LIMITS SIGNIFICANTLY</u></a></p>
<h2>Getting a cash-out refinance is safer than ever</h2>
<p>The report explained that the safety of cash-out refinances has gone up as underwriting standards are now much stronger and the average credit scores of cash-out refinance borrowers are 50 points higher than those in 2005.</p>
<p>"The average borrower’s mortgage debt is now just 45.2% of their home’s value – the lowest total market leverage we’ve ever recorded, going back to at least the turn of the century," Black Knight said. </p>

<h2>Tech mogul recently bought another 110 acres of land on Kauai</h2>
<p><a>Facebook</a> founder Mark Zuckerberg’s already-sprawling Hawaii compound has just gotten even bigger. </p>
<p>The $17 million purchase comes after Zuckerberg spent $100 million on 700 acres in Kauai in 2014 and then $53 million on 600 nearby acres in April, the newspaper adds. On that combined 1,300-acre property is the couple’s Hawaii residence. </p>
