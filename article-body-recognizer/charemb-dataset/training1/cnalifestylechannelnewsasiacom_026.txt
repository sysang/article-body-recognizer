<p>“So I did, and people were still reaching out and trying to recruit me, so I guess it doesn’t matter for them,” she said. </p>
<p>The people closest to her were generally supportive, she said, or nonchalant. </p>
<p>Lim was only able to recall one cold response to her work. As part of her initial research, she had sent surveys to friends and acquaintances via group chats.</p>
<p>In general, “I had more supporters than otherwise”, she added. </p>
<p>Lim was raised in a “typical family”. Her parents, an engineer and a secretary at a bank, weren’t big spenders, she said. </p>
<p>At 28, Lim has a firmer grasp of self than I can only hope for at 35. </p>
<p>She already knows she’s “a huge risk-taker” and is passionate about nurturing others. But when her partners dropped out of the project and she found herself being a solo founder, she learned “a lot” more, including how disciplined she really was. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Lim found the balance she needed when Good Vibes merged with sex toy retailer Hedonist, making Jacqueline Kee her co-founder. Altogether, the sister brands have sold 3,000 toys since they launched. </p>
<p>“It’s nice to have someone you trust with your business, someone you can discuss your ideas with. It’s worth investing in having the right people on board because it’ll push you to do more and grow faster," said Lim.</p>
<p>"We plan to achieve S$1 million in sales within the next three years," she added.</p>

<h1> How 3 friends in the Philippines and Singapore are helping disadvantaged mums earn a living </h1>
<div> <p>Meet the women behind Mori, a social enterprise that bridged two countries. CNA Women discovers their story that involves long-distance friendship, inspiring mums and lots of sewing machines.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>When Mitzi Uy left her marketing job in Manila back in 2011, she would spend a lot of her free time at home, armed with a journal and simply writing and reflecting on things.</p>
<p>During those “soul-searching” years, as the 35-year-old Filipino described it, there was one moment that would eventually change her life – and a lot of other people’s lives, too.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> One of my friends saw the journal that I made for myself and said, ‘maybe you can turn this into a business’. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Uy recalled how, one morning, she saw her house helper crying – her sick daughter was back in her hometown and there was no one to take care of her.</p>
<p>The conversation struck a chord with Uy, who recalled thinking that no mums should be away from their children and that she would try to do what she could to help other Filipino mothers facing the same situation.</p>
<p>And the opportunity soon came from two deceptively simple things: Uy had always loved to create her own journals – and she found out her helper wanted to learn how to sew.</p>
<p>MORI WAS LAUNCHED AS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE</p>
<p>“One of my friends saw the journal that I made for myself and said, ‘maybe you can turn this into a business’,” said Uy.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a success, with all pieces quickly snapped up, and that was when Uy realised it could be a potentially viable business.</p>
<p>But more than just that, she wanted it to be a social enterprise that would specifically help stay-home mums earn a living through sewing, without leaving their homes – or their children.</p>
<p>While Uy’s house helper and first partner-in-crime had planned to go back (and be with her children the following year), Uy decided to go ahead and materialise her plan.</p>
<p>When the new year rolled in, she wasted no time and immediately went to look for women from Manila’s urban poor communities.</p>
<p>Working with the government, she eventually launched her new social business Mori, a variant of the Biblical name Moriel, which means “God teaches”.</p>
<p>In early 2012, she started working with four mothers first, training them to sew quality pursebooks, which would then be sold in selected stores and online.</p>
<p>More importantly, the new business would help ensure that the mums were getting paid according to the local minimum wage.</p>
<p>EXPANDING THE BUSINESS TO SINGAPORE</p>
<p>The story doesn’t stop in the Philippines. Three years later, National University of Singapore graduate Rachel Lin stumbled upon Mori’s products online.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old had an e-commerce platform called Matcha5, which focused on social enterprises. It seemed like a perfect fit, so she reached out to Uy. </p>
<p>The two started chatting online and quickly became friends. “I really like Mitzi’s pursebooks, and somehow we just hit it off,” said Lin, whose interest in social entrepreneurship began during a school trip to the Philippines in 2008.</p>
<p>While Lin’s start-up eventually closed down, the two continued to stay in touch. And in 2017, their business paths crossed once again. Both Lin and Uy took part in a social enterprise accelerator competition in the Philippines.</p>
<p>“We tried to join the competition because during that time, I felt like a lone wolf,” said Uy. “As a social enterprise, or as a normal entrepreneur, you're working on your own right? So you really need to have that support system.”</p>
<p>After two weeks of “bootcamp” with hundreds of other social enterprises, both of them reached the Top 10 – which inspired the two women to join forces and grow Mori even further.</p>
<p>Mori’s group of enterprising mums has now grown to 28. And some of those who were part of the early years of the business are now even training other mums and also helping to develop new products.</p>
<p>One of these is Ate Remy, a 48-year-old mother of three, who used to make cloth rags to sell before joining the team. She’s now Mori’s head trainer and community lead in her area, and also earning at least 10 times what she used to.</p>
<p>Like the other mothers, she makes Mori’s signature products such as the pursebook and the dual-zip sling bag – proudly tagged with her name, which customers can see when they buy these in both the Philippines and Singapore.</p>
<p>Case in point: 35-year-old Miranda Ling, one of Lin’s university friends who was having difficulty in finding a job when she returned to Singapore last year during the pandemic.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>Ling left her job as an insurance manager in 2018 before following her husband overseas for a work posting. During the close to two years that she was away, she home-schooled her two toddler sons.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>“I was actively looking for a job when I came back to Singapore, but I was depressed for a while as there weren’t many jobs available in the market,” said Ling.</p>
<p>“When I went for job interviews, I was really upset because a lot of employers asked me: How's your childcare arrangement going to be like? Who's going to take care of your children?”</p>
<p>She reached out to Lin and eventually joined in 2020 as the co-creator of Mori Mini, a lifestyle arm of the e-commerce business focusing on kids’ products.</p>
<p>“Since I have children, I understand their persona, and so, it's easier for me to create (and modify) the products,” added Ling. </p>
<p>Their first few creations together include the doodle bag and Christmas activity box to encourage family-bonding time.</p>
<p>This year, Mori also trained and hired a Singapore mum who works on custom lettering stencils to personalise the products with names. </p>
<p>She was referred to Mori by Fei Yue Family Service's Thread of Courage, a non-profit initiative that enables lower-income individuals to earn a living from sewing opportunities.</p>
<p>MAKING THE RELATIONSHIP WORK IN TWO COUNTRIES</p>
<p>Running a social enterprise is hard enough as it is – but doing so from two countries might seem even more challenging. So how do they do it?</p>
<p>It’s all about playing to one another’s strengths. “Coming to know our personality and working styles is kind of a breakthrough for me, as technically we’re like in a long-distance relationship,” said Lin.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> What’s beautiful about our partnership is that we started out as people from different countries, but with the same values – and the same heart for people and beautiful products. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>On the practical side of business, Uy continues to focus on the training and production side of things in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Lin and Ling are responsible for the demand side in Singapore.</p>
<p>And business has been good for Mori – in fact, Lin said that the orders have grown from about 100 in Nov 2019 to 600 orders last month.</p>
<p>Their husbands play an important role in Mori’s success, too, Lin said, from being their sounding boards to lending logistical support.</p>
<p>“That's why Mori was created with a mission and ambition to provide productivity and livelihood to women from different walks of life.”</p>

<div> <div> <p> Commentary </p> <h5> Commentary: Should women trying to get pregnant be given leave? </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <p> Commentary </p> <h1> Commentary: Should women trying to get pregnant be given leave? </h1> <div> <p>Birth rates are dropping at an alarming rate, and reproduction leave may the answer to it, say University of Sydney experts.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Marian Baird </a> , <a> Elizabeth Hill </a> <a> Sydney Colussi </a> </div> </div>
<p>SYDNEY: Balancing the competing demands of work and care, or “production” and “reproduction”, is traditionally a burden carried by women.</p>
<p>But beyond the personal cost, there is an impact on the economy, workplaces and gender equality.</p>
<p>In Australia, this is reflected by declining fertility rates and the withdrawal of women from the labour market in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Future fertility rates are predicted to drop to a record low of around 1.6 babies per woman, one of the lowest rates on record. This is below “replacement level”, putting additional pressure on an already strained workforce.</p>
<p>After decades of growth, women’s participation in employment is also falling, likely driven by the ongoing strain of lockdowns and a recalibration of work and care responsibilities .</p>
<p>These trends paint a grim picture of the state of production and reproduction in Australia. But we can make policy changes to better help young people navigate work and care. One of these is reproductive leave.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS REPRODUCTIVE LEAVE?</h2>
<p>In Australia, as well as countries such as the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand, “reproductive leave” has emerged as an innovative response to the tensions between work and human reproduction.</p>
<p>These policies aim to assist workers in balancing their paid work obligations with their reproductive needs, sexual health and overall well-being.</p>
<p>These policies may offer support to workers who are trying to start a family, or to anyone who is managing some of the complex needs of the human body, which requires different levels of attention and maintenance over the life course.</p>
<p>For example, there is evidence Australian women struggle to balance the demands of IVF treatment with paid work obligations. There is also data to suggest painful periods may contribute to absenteeism.</p>
<h2>UNIONS, PRIVATE COMPANIES LEAD THE WAY</h2>
<p>We are starting to see a wide range of workplace policies in this area.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Health and Community Services Union in Victoria began a push for reproductive health and well-being leave as part of their enterprise bargaining process.</p>
<p>This claim includes paid leave and flexible working arrangements for menstruation, menopause, miscarriage and stillbirth, fertility treatments, vasectomies, hysterectomies and gender affirmation therapies (negotiations are ongoing).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ethical superannuation company Future Super announced paid leave for menstruation and menopause, as did the Australian-owned period underwear brand Modibodi.</p>
<p>Global music streaming platform Spotify also made headlines recently for its generous “family formation” benefits that provide employees with a lifetime allowance for IVF treatments, donor services and fertility assessments.</p>
<h2>PART OF A GLOBAL MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>But there is a renewed energy surrounding reproductive leave, demonstrating an increasing acceptance of the complex entanglement of work and personal life.</p>
<p>There is a drive to bring the body into the modern workplace and to pay attention to biological and social reproduction as a means of assisting in economic production.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, we will not have a future generation of workers and taxpayers if we fail to accommodate the reproductive needs and activities of today’s workers and taxpayers.</p>
<p>These policies are also part of a global movement to normalise and accommodate the body at all stages of life and for all people across the sex and gender spectrums, including cisgender, transgender, gender diverse and non-binary people.</p>
<h2>SOME PEOPLE HAVE OBJECTIONS</h2>
<p>But how well accepted will these policies be?</p>
<p>Acknowledging the potential drawbacks of reproductive leave must be part of the policy conversation. These policies must be approached cautiously and designed in a way that minimises the risk of gender stereotyping.</p>
<h2>THE FUTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE LEAVE IN AUSTRALIA</h2>
<p>Despite significant developments within trade unions and private companies, there are limited provisions for reproductive leave in national legislation. For many workers their only option is to claim personal leave: That is, “sick” leave.</p>
<p>Recent announcements by the federal and NSW governments that parents who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth are now eligible for paid bereavement leave is a start – but they need to go further.</p>
<p>For example, we could explore a “model clause” for reproductive leave in modern awards or a legislative amendment to the National Employment Standards to include a gender-inclusive reproductive leave provision.</p>
<p>This provision would conceivably provide days of unpaid or paid job protected leave, in a similar manner to the origins of parental leave and more recently domestic and family violence leave.</p>
<p>We must take the opportunity of COVID-19 to reconfigure our gender contract. It is clear that without policies that enable people to work, care and reproduce, Australia will be a poorer and smaller nation.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Women </p> <h5> Ready to start investing? We explain what style works best for you – active or passive </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Ready to start investing? We explain what style works best for you – active or passive </h1>
<p>Before making any decision, figure out if you want to be an "active" or "passive" investor, and it depends on your financial goals, appetite for risk, and how much money and time you have. CNA Women breaks it down for you.</p>
<p>In partnership with UOB.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Dawn Cher </a> </div> </div>
<p>If you are new to investing, one of the first decisions you’ll need to make is whether an active or passive approach would work for you. These terms refer to the method in which your funds are managed, that is, actively or passively.</p>
<p>Are you someone who gets anxious when you lose money? How much capital loss can you tolerate without losing sleep at night?</p>
<p>If you’re busy with other commitments in your life, such as scaling the career ladder or raising young children, you may also want to consider how much time you have to study and monitor your individual investments.</p>
<p>WHAT IS ACTIVE INVESTING?</p>
<p>Active investing, as it suggests, means your funds are actively managed by human portfolio managers with the aim of outperforming the market. </p>
<p>Some portfolio managers do this by picking individual stocks that they think will give them outsized gains, while others adjust asset allocations by investing in sectors or industries that they believe will do well. Some employ a mix of both.</p>
<p>Of course, a higher level of expertise and deeper analysis is usually needed to manage such a portfolio. As a result, you pay higher expenses – in the form of active management fees – to have someone else manage your investments on your behalf. </p>
<p>There are a few ways you can embark on active investing. You could choose to invest on your own, in unit trusts, insurance-linked policies, or even directly into the stock market. </p>
<p>Also common, especially for those beginning to take an interest in investing, are investment-linked policies from insurance companies, where your funds are invested in portfolios managed by the insurer. </p>
<p>There’s also the option of investing directly with portfolio managers instead of making an investment via a sales agent, which may sometimes end up with you paying higher fees on your actively managed investment. </p>
<p>“These funds are often managed by experienced asset managers who take a hands-on approach to researching and selecting investments, as well as monitoring and rebalancing those investments.”</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING PASSIVE INVESTING </p>
<p>On the other hand, passive investing is an approach where you invest in passively managed funds such as broad market indexes. These funds are designed to track market performance, rather than outperforming it. </p>
<p>Today, these are often automated, so they require minimal human oversight and hence charge lower fees. </p>
<p>Some investors execute this approach by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – such as those offered by Vanguard or iShares – by themselves, where they have to manage their own buy or sell transactions. </p>
<p>It may sound confusing but just remember that globally, the term “passive investor” refers to those who invest in passively managed instruments, even if they do their own (that is, active) buying and selling of these ETFs, like the above example.</p>
<p>Passive ETFs use algorithms with minimal to zero human intervention to buy the shares in the ETFs, by tracking the underlying sector, region or market. </p>
<p>What if you choose to buy such ETFs on the open market via a direct brokerage? You would then be actively managing your portfolio but investing in passively managed, globally diversified funds.</p>
<p>In order to determine if the robo advisor you are looking at is truly passive or active, you may need to study its investment approach and the underlying funds it invests in. </p>
<p>Well-known investors such as Warren Buffett or Cathie Wood are examples of active investors who directly choose which companies to invest in.</p>
<p>While skilled portfolio managers such as Buffett or Wood may be able to consistently deliver outsized returns, there is no guarantee that investors who choose actively managed funds will always outperform the market.</p>
<p>Given their lower cost and accessibility, more money has flowed into passive investing instruments in recent years. However, that does not mean that active investing is dead – both strategies exist for a reason. </p>
<p>The best portfolio strategy might just be a blend of both. </p>
<p>Financial controller Brian Halim, who has been actively managing his own investments for the last 12 years, said he decided to manage his own portfolio because he wanted to beat the market through his own picks.</p>
<p>“I enjoy studying the business model of a company and trying to understand how management is driving the business,” said the 36-year-old.</p>
<p>However, Halim acknowledged that he easily spends at least four hours a day managing his investments as he reads the news, studies the company’s annual report, financial statements, and keeps up with quarterly earning calls.</p>
<p>Half of the female respondents perceive themselves to be lacking in knowledge and indicated it as their greatest barrier to getting started.</p>
<p>To counter this problem, Lim recommended UOB SimpleInvest, where one can choose from three solutions created by UOB Asset Management, depending on their investment objectives and risk appetite. </p>
<p>“You can then benefit from investments that have been researched and selected by asset managers such as Fidelity International, JPMorgan Asset Management and UBS Asset Management that manage almost US$10 trillion in funds,” said Lim. </p>
<p>“They will be keeping a watchful eye on the investments and make adjustments when market conditions change.”</p>
<p>With as little as S$100, such a solution makes actively managed funds easily accessible for retail investors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chuin Ting Weber, the chief executive officer of bionic financial advisory MoneyOwl, believes in adopting a passive approach to her investments so that she can focus on her work and family.</p>
<p>“Life is too short to be always stressing over investments, especially as a working mother,” she said.</p>
<p>Instead, Weber deposits money into her portfolio each month via a standing instruction and invests into suitable long-term portfolios.</p>
<p>“I leave the market to do the work and I don’t touch it or look at it, because I understand that the global market goes up in the long run,” she said.</p>
<p>Halim’s tip: “If you’re not passionate about investing but realise the importance of it, then you should perhaps get into passive investing and use your time for other things you value in life.”</p>
<p>PASSIVE INVESTING DOES NOT MEAN YOU DON’T NEED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE</p>
<p>“There is a misconception that robo advisors are generally passive because some of them use ETFs. However, this is not really true,” noted Weber.</p>
<p>Instead, she recommended that women first get a comprehensive financial plan done as a first step, and get advice from a trusted adviser who has no conflict of interest and can coach you through managing your risks in times of market volatility.</p>
<p>Regardless of which method you choose, you should know that you will not be able to simply outsource your entire investment portfolio to someone else, whether that is a human portfolio manager or a robo advisor.</p>
<p>You should review your portfolio on an annual basis, or at least, once every few years. This can help you decide whether you wish to keep the status quo, or move your funds into other investments instead.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Women </p> <h5> Women and self-care: Tips to recharge and get your mental wellness back on track </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Women and self-care: Tips to recharge and get your mental wellness back on track </h1>
<div> <p>Taking time off for self-care, whether several minutes a day or for a short escape, will do you wonders. CNA Women looks at how you can truly embrace your mental health days.</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>After close to two years of working from home, I can safely say that finding the balance between work and life has been challenging. </p>
<p>Knowing where to draw the boundaries between rest time and workis easier said than done. And yet, that’s the key to protecting my mental health. </p>
<p>Benedict Lim, the chief executive officer and chief psychologist at iGROW, described the pressure of responding to work when you’re on leave as an “always on” culture, where employees may find it challenging to get their much needed downtime.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We need to make time to do things that fill up the cup again, nourishing our wellbeing. This is self-care. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>“Poor mental wellbeing over a long period of time may lead to burnout, depression, anxieties and other associated mental illness,” he added.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why, in a recent joint survey done by cloud technology company Oracle and HR research and advisory firm Workplace Intelligence, 68 per cent of 1,000 Singapore respondents said 2021 was the most stressful year at work ever.</p>
<p>Moreover, 58 per cent of those surveyed struggled more with mental health at work in 2021, compared to 2020.</p>
<p>So how do we find the sweet spot for self-care? And how do we carve out time for it?</p>
<p>BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT FINDING THE BALANCE </p>
<p>Self-care essentially means taking care of ourselves – our physical, intellectual, emotional, and social needs – so that we can be as healthy as possible, said Goh. </p>
<p>Think of our wellbeing as a cup full of water.</p>
<p>“Many of our responsibilities, tasks and activities drain that cup of water, leaving it empty. We need to make time to do things that fill up the cup again, nourishing our wellbeing. This is self-care,” she explained.</p>
<p>To help address stress and burnout, it’s important to intentionally create small pockets of time to attend to your own self, advised Kunzru. It is an important aspect of finding an internal balance which promotes health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>Start by scheduling time for self-care into your calendar, said Kunzru, or sharing your intent to make time for self-care with your family and colleagues.</p>
<p>“This will increase your own commitment towards self-care, and it will also set boundaries for other people,” she added. </p>
<p>What does the state of your finances have to do with your mental wellbeing? For one, not needing to worry about your current and future expenses will give you peace of mind. </p>
<p>For another, being able to manage your budget well means you can freely indulge in self-care activities such as taking a short holiday or enjoying a spa day.</p>
<p>The UOB Lady’s Card, which is catered to women, allows you to earn cashback when you spend, including on self-care activities ranging from beauty to wellness, travel and family.</p>
<p>You can also tap on the UOB TMRW app (previously called UOB Mighty) to help you manage your budget.</p>
<p>The rewards you earn would translate into savings that could go into your self-care budget, in the form of UNI$ (you earn UNI$1 for every $5 spent) or rebates. You can easily view and track earned rewards and cashback per transaction on the app.</p>
<p>But do remember that while self-care is crucial to our mental wellbeing, so too, is knowing that we have the what-ifs covered: Hospitalisation, critical illness and disability, and whether your family can survive if you were to lose your income. </p>
<p>For peace of mind, Chung Shaw Bee, Head of Deposits and Wealth Management at UOB, has these tips:</p>
<li>Settle your hospitalisation coverage first, regardless of the life stage you’re in. </li>
<li>If you have dependents, ensure your liabilities are covered. </li>
<li>Think about your daily expenses. Set aside 10 to 20 per cent of your salary in preparation for any unforeseen circumstances.</li>
<p>SELF-CARE TIP #1: PLAN A SHORT ESCAPE </p>
<p>Getting away from your routine is always a good idea, no matter the location.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is the idea of being able to take time off from our usual commitments to pause and relax, and prioritise our well-being for a few days,” said Goh from Sofia Wellness Clinic. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> It doesn't really work if your mind is occupied with work or your household while on staycation. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>The key is to take a break from your regular routine. “It allows you to indulge in fresh rituals and practices which are relaxing and nourishing for your physical, psychological and spiritual well-being,” Kunzru added. </p>
<p>A staycation is an excellent opportunity to “fill up” whatever has been depleted, she added.</p>
<p>Whether you do a hotel staycay, a holiday overseas (now that the VTLs are opening up travel options to Singaporeans), or even spending it entirely at home, it’s the time you’re dedicating to this escape that counts.</p>
<p>Just remember that for this escape to work, how you do it matters. Said Goh: “It doesn't really work if your mind is occupied with work or your household while on staycation.”</p>
<p>SELF-CARE TIP #2: INVEST IN A NEW HOBBY </p>
<p>“Hobbies are a very important part of self-care,” said Kunzru. “They relax us because we enjoy them.” </p>
<p>“Hobbies reduce our stress levels, give us a sense of purpose in life (outside of work), develop new skills and help us form friendships with people who share our interests.”</p>
<p>A new hobby allows you to broaden your own boundaries and experiences, and increases self-confidence and self-esteem, she added.</p>
<p>Learning something new is, in itself, the act of setting aside time for yourself to have a moment in the week that prioritises your own interests and wellbeing, Goh said.</p>
<p>SELF-CARE TIP #3: SET ASIDE SMALL POCKETS OF TIME IN THE DAY</p>
<p>Kunzru suggested some ideas:</p>
<li>Practice gratitude to increase overall happiness and satisfaction.</li>
<li>Create a few rituals you can follow regularly – for example, a skincare routine or visiting your favourite coffeeshop before or after work</li>
<li>Meditate to help you to reduce stress and anxiety, increase attention span and improve sleep.</li>
<p>SELF-CARE TIP #4: TRY VOLUNTEERING </p>
<p>Experts told CNA Women that research has shown that giving back not only makes us happier, it reduces depression and has a positive impact on our overall wellbeing and self-esteem.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We should approach volunteering with the mindset that every little bit helps. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>When you feel more positive about yourself by giving to others, said Goh, you will also start noticing more positivity around you, which bolsters your emotional well-being.</p>
<p>“It is a good way to help the community and also take care of our own emotional needs,” she added.</p>
<p>Giving back also helps you to stop focusing on your own issues, giving you the space to focus on causes that you are passionate about, said Kunzru.</p>
<p>“While we cannot solve all the problems of the world, we should approach volunteering with the mindset that every little bit helps,” she said.</p>
<p>For example, giving.sg is a good place to start, suggested Kunzru, adding that there are multiple avenues in Singapore for those interested in volunteering.</p>
<p>The platform allows you to explore more than 300 online volunteering opportunities, from video editing to tele-befriending services. </p>
<p>SELF-CARE TIP #5: TAKE LEAVE FROM WORK (AND DON’T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT) </p>
<p>When was the last time you enjoyed a day off – without thinking about work at all?</p>
<p>“In today’s reality, the biggest concern that hinders a properly executed leave day is workload, which is exacerbated by the fact that when you do take time off, you can see the work piling up in real-time on your phone,” said Lim of iGROW.</p>
<p>But time-off can be a fantastic way to ignite innovation, he said, and bring the next great idea to your organisation.</p>
<p>He added that poor mental health also affects one’s physical well-being, leading to unhealthy lifestyles and chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer.</p>
<p>“In the long run, (having time-off) will be beneficial for the employee and the employer alike because it helps to reduce ill-health and absenteeism,” said Lim, adding that companies also end up paying the price. </p>

<h1> How to put a capsule wardrobe together: Dressing to impress with fewer outfits </h1>
<div> <p>Now that we need fewer outfits since we’re going out less, how do we reorganise our wardrobe to utilise only the essentials – while reducing our environmental footprint at the same time?</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>When it comes to buying new clothes, the pandemic has certainly changed consumer trends and behaviour. It has, for one, significantly curbed my appetite for shopping.</p>
<p>It has also pushed me to reflect on what I really need – and what I don’t. </p>
<p>It’s no surprise that others – from fashion designers to consumers – also feel the same way. We’re falling back on a few quality pieces that take us seamlessly from work-from-home Zoom meetings to wellness activities like yoga. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> People are questioning if they truly need that many clothes. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>And we’re happy with these pared down options.</p>
<p>In a podcast by management consulting firm McKinsey Company discussing the post-pandemic state of fashion, Achim Berg, a senior partner at the organisation, uses the term “casualisation” – where dresses have become “much more casual”.</p>
<div> <div><p>“But that is not an invention of COVID-19. It’s a trend we’ve seen for a long while: Moving away from more formal wear, having casual Fridays not only on Fridays but also from Monday to Thursday,” said Berg in the podcast. </p></div> </div>
<p>Berg added that the pandemic has resulted in us “lacking many occasions” which we used to dress up for, such as weddings and concerts. </p>
<p>“All of that has an impact on how we dress, what we shop for, and how we shop for it.”</p>
<p>The brand’s latest "wear" category includes comfort wear and accessories such as muscle tees, resort-style shirts and bottoms, caps, bucket hats and statement earrings. </p>
<p>BEING MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU BUY</p>
<p>The pandemic has motivated us to make clearer choices about what we buy, from clothes to beauty products and food – and to consciously look for brands that champion sustainability.</p>
<p>Where our wardrobes are concerned, people are questioning if they truly need that many clothes, said Raena Lim, the chief operating officer and co-founder of Style Theory, a designer clothes and bag rental service in Singapore.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is also due to findings that an estimated 73 per cent of consumers around the world are willing to change their consumption habits to reduce environmental impact, according to a 2019 Nielsen report.</p>
<p>In this regard, a capsule collection refers to a “very small drop” of approximately two to three designs. </p>
<p>As people become more conscious about their impact on the environment, there’s been a rise in the sharing economy, fuelling a general acceptance of pre-loved luxury, said Lim.</p>
<p>She added that people understand the value of clothing and bags in the sharing, circular economy, where goods go beyond one-time use, utilising the reusability of each item. </p>
<p>WHAT’S A CAPSULE WARDROBE? </p>
<p>A good capsule wardrobe is one that’s been edited – and curated intentionally, said Tsi. These are items that you’re willing to wear on repeat.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> The goal of building a capsule wardrobe is not to be an expert at it. It’s to help you become more mindful of what you’re wearing. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>ADAPTING TO CHANGING STYLES AND PREFERENCES </p>
<p>Creating a capsule wardrobe doesn’t mean getting rid of every piece of clothing you have and starting from scratch. “It means pruning items that no longer work for you and replacing them mindfully,” advised Jaffer. </p>
<p>You shouldn’t feel the need to change up your capsule wardrobe every season. Neither should it be about being “on-trend”. </p>
<p>“I would try to steer away from trendy items as they will go out of style and they counter the whole concept of having a capsule wardrobe,” Tsi said. </p>
<p>She advised that you stay away from seasonal colours too, as they are more likely to go out of style. Opt for a neutral colour palette, such as white, black, grey, navy, brown and earth tones.</p>
<p>What is key is investing in high-quality and timeless pieces. These allow you to wear them for a longer period of time, reducing the cost per wear of all your clothes, said Jaffer.</p>
<p>Fewer clothes to plan outfits around also means less decision fatigue – you don’t have to struggle with a wardrobe full of clothes, yet still feel like you have nothing to wear, Tsi explained.</p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD GO INTO A CAPSULE WARDROBE? </p>
<p>There isn’t a hard and fast rule but experts recommend sticking to well-known formulas such as the 10 x 10 challenge, especially if you’re new to it.</p>
<p>The challenge involves you picking out 10 items (for example, a jacket, a dress, a few versatile tops and two pairs of shoes), and creating 10 different outfits out of them, for a period of 10 days. </p>
<p>“Doing a 10 x 10 capsule wardrobe challenge back in 2017 helped me train myself to organise my wardrobe and curb my shopping habit,” Tsi recounted.</p>
<p>Note that your capsule wardrobe is “deeply personal” and there is no “one size fits all” solution, Jaffer advised. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it has to work for the person wearing it. So if you are mainly working from home (where you attend many Zoom meetings), yours may include more home and comfort wear, and fewer bags and shoes.</p>
<p>Another challenge you can consider is Project 333 by author Courtney Carver that requires you to select 33 items – and make the pieces work for you over the next three months. </p>
<p>Whichever approach you choose, building a capsule wardrobe forces you to work with what you have, reducing both the space you need in your closet and the time needed to assemble an outfit. </p>
<p>Tsi suggested the following basics for a capsule wardrobe:</p>
<li>A t-shirt or tank top </li>
<li>A jacket or cardigan that allows you to layer and add interest to any outfit</li>
<li>A well-fitting pair of jeans</li>
<li>A simple dress that can be styled up or down for both formal and casual occasions</li>
<p>And no, your capsule wardrobe doesn’t have to be boring – even if you’ll be repeating and restyling your clothing as a rule. </p>
<p>“You don’t have to be a minimalist to create a capsule wardrobe,” said Jaffer. Go ahead and get as creative as you want, even incorporating prints and patterns into your capsule.</p>
<p>You should still be able to express your personal style and fill it with items you love wearing such as a classic pair of hoop earrings that pair with anything, or a vintage-looking shoulder bag that transcends seasons, she added. </p>
<p>GETTING STARTED AND LEVELLING UP</p>
<p>Tsi said that her favourite part of curating a capsule wardrobe is the idea that it’s a “slow and dynamic” process, where people can shop with intention and look for clothes that they absolutely love.</p>
<p>“The goal of building a capsule wardrobe is not to be an expert at it. It’s to help you become more mindful of what you’re wearing,” Jaffer said. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> You don’t have to be a minimalist to create a capsule wardrobe. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Before you click “add to cart” to buy new pieces for your wardrobe, Tsi recommends taking the following steps first:</p>
<li>Do an audit of what you already have. What do you wear regularly and what have you never worn?</li>
<li>Look into your current lifestyle and activities to help you determine what should stay (and go). </li>
<li>Think about what your style is, your favourite colours and which types of clothing flatter your body.</li>
<li>Decide on the number of clothing you want to add to your capsule wardrobe – and be disciplined about sticking to it.</li>
<li>Donate, sell or pass on clothing you’ve never worn or want to exclude from your capsule wardrobe.</li>
<li>Make sure the future pieces you add to your carefully edited wardrobe can fit seamlessly into your existing capsule.</li>
<p>Once you start the process of curating your capsule wardrobe, you’ll realise that your shopping habits will change as well, where you’re likely to buy only interchangeable items to match what you already have.</p>
<p>“(It) will help you to inherently save money because you do not have to go shopping often – to find a top to match a bottom, for example,” said Tsi. </p>
<p>And when you do shop, consider the UOB Lady’s Card to score more savings in the form of UNI$, earning 10 times UNI$ for every S$5 spent on your purchases. </p>
<p>The credit card, which caters to women, not only allows you to earn rebates, it also offers privileges such as an interest-free installment plan for six or 12 months, and protection coverage for your online purchases.</p>
<p>MAKE RENTING PART OF YOUR PLAN </p>
<p>While a capsule wardrobe is usually versatile enough to cover a wide variety of needs and occasions, dressing up for one-off events like a wedding, concert, or even a theme party (when COVID-19 social restrictions ease) may prove trickier.</p>
<p>Consider clothes rental, which gives you more opportunities to explore and experiment with different styles to complement your wardrobe, said Lim of Style Theory.</p>
<p>“Clothes no longer have limited lifespans – giving the flexibility to rent outfits that are more elaborate in nature and suited for formal occasions, but may not be suited for everyday use,” she added.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Women </p> <h5> How women can plan for retirement: If you're starting in your 20s, 30s, 40s and even beyond </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> How women can plan for retirement: If you're starting in your 20s, 30s, 40s and even beyond </h1>
<div> <p>It’s never too late – or too early – to make sure you have enough for your nest egg, whether you intend to continue to work after retirement age or not.</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Dawn Cher </a> </div> </div>
<p>In the past, we would study for 20 years, work for 40 years, and then live off our savings for the remaining 20-plus years.</p>
<p>But with longer life expectancy and advances in medicine, it is likely that most of us will live to 90, if not beyond. Women also tend to live longer than men.</p>
<p>Being able to live for longer has its perks. We get more time to be with our loved ones and watch them start new families of their own, we can travel around the world and even pursue our passions. </p>
<p>However, this dream will only be possible if we have enough finances to see us through our golden years.</p>
<p>The question then is, will your savings be enough? The answer is probably no (unless, of course, you’re a high-income earner with very low expenses). </p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that due to inflation and the rising costs of living, everything will likely become more expensive in time to come. This is why saving cash alone may not be enough for most, as the value of your cash will decline over time.</p>
<p>Choosing to work in your 60s or 70s may not be an option available to everyone either.</p>
<p>The smarter way would be to invest so that your cash can work for you.</p>
<p>Starting early will also allow you to compound your money over time to a sizable sum. </p>
<p>STARTING IN YOUR 20S AND 30S</p>
<p>As you enter your 30s, there will be plenty of big-ticket items to pay for – your wedding, your first home, delivery expenses for your children, preschool fees, and more.</p>
<p>It is easy to get overwhelmed and thus put retirement planning on the backburner, but you just need to commit a small amount each month so that it becomes more achievable.</p>
<p>For instance, setting aside just a few hundred dollars each month can go a long way. And if you struggle to put aside this amount, you can either reduce your expenses or take on side hustles to grow your income so that you will have enough.</p>
<p>You may want to consider United Overseas Bank’s (UOB) SimpleInvest, which allows one to simply choose between three solutions (Liquidity, Income or Growth) and start investing with as little as S$100 each month. </p>
<p>The Growth solution invests in equity funds that tap on megatrends shaping the future of the world, such as healthcare and artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>If you’re in your 20s and 30s, robo-investments are also an option to help you grow your money while you juggle work and family – especially if you have young children and elderly parents to look after.</p>
<p>“I also bought an Investment-Linked Policy (ILP) with my financial advisor, and only started buying other industry-specific unit trusts and robo-investing into overseas exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and equities after that.”</p>
<p>Today, many young investors tend to favour high-growth strategies, as one can always restart even if your investment goes to zero in the worst-case scenario. </p>
<p>This is why growth stocks are so popular among millennials, who are less fearful of investing in companies even if they have yet to turn profitable. </p>
<p>With a longer investment horizon when you start in your 30s, you can afford to take on higher risks in exchange for higher expected returns.</p>
<p>If you start in your 40s, you may have less time to learn (or recover) from your investing mistakes and still grow your pot of gold. </p>
<p>Taking on too much risk in your portfolio can potentially be detrimental, so you may want to go for investments in larger companies with proven track records instead.</p>
<p>“I estimate an annual dividend income of S$50,000 should be sufficient for my family to live comfortably without having to draw down on my investment portfolio,” said Yang, who works as a portfolio manager.</p>
<p>He also said that his aim is to ensure the portfolio continues to grow more than the inflation rate after retirement, and that his dividend income can also grow in tandem to offset the effects of inflation.</p>
<p>But even if you did not start in your 20s like him, it is still not too late.</p>
<p>This is because investing in your 40s means that you are likely to have more savings to invest, compared to when you were much younger. With at least 20 more years before hitting your 60s, you still have time to catch up. </p>
<p>That can still give you S$888 to S$1,300 each month, if you spread that out over 30 years. </p>
<p>STARTING IN YOUR 50S OR 60S</p>
<p>Fixed income instruments such as an annuity plan or high-quality bonds are also popular among retirees. </p>
<p>For investors who actively invest in equities, many also tend to switch to a dividend investing strategy in their later years, so that they can start to get cash from their investments and use it to fund their living expenses.</p>
<p>Asset allocation now becomes a crucial strategy. You will need to hold the right mix of equities, unit trusts, bonds and cash, so that you can continue to grow your money during your retirement years, which could last longer than you expect.</p>
<p>ADJUSTING YOUR INVESTING STRATEGY OVER TIME</p>
<p>As you get older, there is nothing wrong with choosing investments that are less volatile. After all, you wouldn’t want to take too many risks with your funds at this stage, considering that you will need them in a few years’ time.</p>
<p>“As women get closer to retirement, they might need to consider their risk appetite and having sources of passive income,” advised UOB Portfolio Counselor Michele Fong.</p>
<p>“They could also consider reducing their debt level, such as by allocating their annual bonus towards paying their mortgage so they do not have significant debts when they enter retirement.”</p>
<p>The best way to ensure this is to regularly review the performance of your investments, at least yearly, and adjust where needed. </p>
<p>REMEMBER TO MAKE USE OF YOUR SRS ACCOUNT</p>
<p>As you chart out your next steps on how to invest for your retirement, many experts also recommend that you incorporate your Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) account into your plan as well. </p>
<p>“Whatever tax savings you get from your SRS contributions can immediately go towards growing your retirement kitty,” suggested Fong.</p>
<p>Since you can only withdraw your SRS savings after you reach the statutory retirement age (which is currently 62), this can help to enforce discipline and ensure you will not be able to spend the money prematurely. </p>
<p>While 50 per cent of your withdrawals are subject to income tax, the idea is that if you have stopped working by then and have little to no income, you will likely be subject to significantly less income taxes than before. </p>
<p>As the statutory retirement age will be raised to 63 next year, if you would like to withdraw your funds at 62, you may want to open your SRS account and make a deposit of any amount before then.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, regardless of your starting capital, age and risk appetite, the common goal that each of us has is to invest so that we have enough for retirement.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is not to be discouraged – it is better to start now than not at all,” said Fong.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Women </p> <h5> How I survive Christmas stress every year: A working mum’s hopeful game plan </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> How I survive Christmas stress every year: A working mum’s hopeful game plan </h1>
<div> <p>Every year, CNA Women editor Penelope Chan turns into a raving Christmas-making machine bent on producing the best festive season her family has ever had, becoming Santa, Mrs Claus, and all their elves and reindeer rolled into one.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Penelope Chan </a> </div> </div>
<p>Because that’s how a working mum like me manages Christmas, and the stress and expectations (all self-induced) that come with it. Why all the stress? Why not just take it easy?</p>
<p>The ironic answer is that I enjoy the season greatly. So I’m more than willing to put up with the suffering needed to make it an ever memorable experience for my family. Every single year.</p>
<p>It’s like a badge of honour. #isurvivedChristmas2021.</p>
<p>I envy friends who simply string up some tinsel in the shape of a Christmas tree on a wall and have a small intimate family dinner to mark the season. Or better yet, head out to a restaurant.</p>
<p>In my extended family, this is a time of get-togethers and celebrations, a traditional Catholic Christmas. Everything, from the parties to the food and noise, is huge. So is the love and warmth. </p>
<p>In my own family, the December craziness is compounded by the start of the birthday cycle – three birthdays in a span of two weeks. Exhaustion is my middle name.</p>
<p>TRYING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE (NO, I CAN’T)</p>
<p>“Ooh, Mummy, the gift tags are really cute this year. Can we get them?” </p>
<p>“Mummy, can we get those sparkly baubles? We broke quite a few last year.”</p>
<p>“Look, look, look, this wrapper design is running out, let’s buy more – just in case.”</p>
<p>And just like that, I’ve Alice’d myself and fallen down the rabbit hole that’s Christmas in my household. And I have no hope of clawing myself free until Boxing Day. Such a happy time.</p>
<p>It’s a distracting time too. When you have something as big as Christmas (and all those birthdays) looming, it’s hard to focus. So making it out alive and sane means proper planning and quick decisions (one of them being: Buy first, regret later). </p>
<p>I zigzag between doing actual work and filling up my ever-expanding to-do list, covering gift buying, gift wrapping, putting up the tree, planning the menu and cooking schedule, and every other minute detail. </p>
<p>PLANNING CHRISTMAS WITH EVERY KID IN MIND</p>
<p>A piece of advice to fellow parents: Do not start anything new for Christmas if you have no intention of repeating it the next year, and the next, and the next, and … Just, don’t. Say no. Use distraction tactics. Walk away and do not look back.</p>
<p>When I had just one child, the rituals were all about her – bringing the wonder of the season to the little one and helping her form warm memories of her childhood. As my family has grown, so too have our Christmas rituals and traditions. </p>
<p>We never used to have a fresh wreath. I bought one last year on a whim, and this year, well, welcome new fresh wreath. Same goes for Christmas crackers. </p>
<p>So remember, if you introduce something new, it becomes a tradition forever. But will that stop me? I suspect not.</p>
<p>THE STRESS OF GIFT SHOPPING AND WRAPPING</p>
<p>Christmas shopping is so much fun, and I admit I probably enjoy it too much. But it’s also stress-inducing of the hair-pulling, nail-biting variety, even though I think I’ve refined my game plan.</p>
<p>My list runs long, hovering around the 60 pax mark, not including helping my husband shop for his gifts for his team.</p>
<p>This part of Christmas is also where my children and I disagree the most. My aim is to get the presents wrapped quickly. Their aim is to have the most fun doing it. Every gift needs to be decorated and ribboned.</p>
<p>Perfection is not required.</p>
<p>It’s all part of the charm of getting a gift from my family – you never know what you’re going to end up with. And who will wrap your gift. Maybe I should make a “Lovingly wrapped by ______” stamp next year.</p>
<p>I regret introducing Santa to our household. It started when my firstborn was three and it seemed like a cute idea to talk about Santa with his presents, and for us to leave a cookie and a drink for Rudolph and him. </p>
<p>This has led to a very sorry situation where I have to lie through my teeth every time. Even my answers sound hollow and illogical to my own ears. </p>
<p>Child: “Mummy, how does Santa come into our house? Does he have our key?”Me: “Santa comes through the window.” </p>
<p>After we made the switch to a digital lock: “Mummy, is Santa’s fingerprint in our lock?”Me: “Let’s go check whether we have enough wrapping paper for the presents.”</p>
<p>This year, I’m expecting pandemic-related questions: “Does Santa have to wear a mask when he’s on his sleigh?”, “If Santa doesn’t pass his PCR test, will other children have no presents?”, “What if Rudolph gets COVID-19?”. </p>
<p>And, yet, when the older kids try to be “helpful” and clue their younger siblings into the Santa fantasy, this is what happens.</p>
<p>Older kid to younger sibling: “Santa doesn’t exist. It’s Daddy who eats Santa’s cookie.”</p>
<p>Older child gets my death glare. </p>
<p>The festive season isn’t festive without family. Same goes for the prep. I may sound like a one-woman Christmas machine, but I don’t do it all alone. I wouldn't want to either.</p>
<p>And my younger kids, shall we say they’re finding their niche (and making happy messes at the same time). I hope to one day pass on the present-wrapping baton to one of them. Someone will be promoted to Head Elf. </p>
<p>But that’s for another story because I just remembered I have one last Christmas present to wrap. From my family to yours – happy holidays.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Women </p> <h5> This young mum taught herself to sew and started a sustainable kids clothing shop </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> This young mum taught herself to sew and started a sustainable kids clothing shop </h1>
<div> <p>Mother-of-two Raeann Heng launched Cheeky Feys to reduce fabric waste and address the impact of fast fashion for kids. CNA Women speaks to her in this newest instalment of our women in sustainability series.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annie Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>“A child between the ages of two and four may go through two clothing sizes each year. Multiply that by the number of pieces they own and you may be disposing 60 to 100 clothing items for a single child alone yearly,” said the 27-year-old.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded when fast fashion items are priced so cheaply that parents don’t think twice about buying multiple items with similar designs and functions. Some of these items may only be worn a few times and are not made to last.</p>
<p>HER MUMPRENEURSHIP JOURNEY</p>
<p>With a passion for the environment, the stay-at-home mother decided to pick up sewing to test her theory that well-thought designs, and customised, comfortable and durable clothes would substantially reduce fabric wastage.</p>
<p>Over a period of two years, she also sewed some 30 pieces of clothing for her daughters. When friends expressed interest in her designs, she launched Cheeky Feys.</p>
<p>SLOW FASHION FOR CHILDREN</p>
<p>Tapping into her styling experience, she curates patterns from indie designers, makes fun edits such as adding bubble sleeves to a particular design, and sources for fabrics with interesting textures and prints. </p>
<p>After orders are placed, she takes one to two weeks to complete the order, often working from 10pm to 2am when her children are asleep.</p>
<p>She added: “There is a surge of fast-fashion brands because it is convenient – you just walk in and buy something because it is cheap. According to BBC, the average American throws away 37kg of clothing each year."</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE FABRICS SOURCING</p>
<p>To support a circular economy, Heng sources for most of her fabric from small local shops in Chinatown. This ensures that the money and material circulates within the country and strengthens the local economy, she explained. </p>
<p>She uses natural fibres exclusively. “Natural fibres are more comfortable and also more biodegradable than most synthetic fibres. Some synthetic fibres like polyester or rayon also release toxic substances when produced,” she said.</p>
<p>Where possible, Heng sources for pre-loved or unwanted fabric with interesting prints at Goodness Me! Fabric Destash Facebook Group. </p>
<p>One of her more interesting finds was a textured ivory cotton costume, which she turned into unique pieces of children’s clothing. To deep clean such upcycled fabric, she soaks them in boiling water, detergent and baking soda.</p>
<p>"This group allows us to swap fabric with no money involved,” she said.</p>
<p>She uses the bigger pieces to make clothes and smaller scraps to make reusable dish sponges, which she sells at her shop as well.</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE SEWING PRACTICES</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, Heng doesn’t stockpile clothes and only produces each piece when she receives an order.</p>
<p>Each piece is sewn to last. Heng doubles French seams in some cases and physically stretches each piece to stress test it. She also offers a lifetime seams warranty.</p>
<p>“I realised fast fashion children’s clothes didn’t last when my second child got hand-me-downs from her sister. While the fabric seems fine, the waistbands and hems were coming apart,” she noted.</p>
<p>MINDFUL CONSUMPTION STARTS WITH CHILDREN</p>
<p>Since Heng generally only sews up to 20 pieces a month, she admitted that her production is not large enough to make a significant dent on carbon emissions. But she hopes that teaching children healthy consumption habits can have a ripple effect.</p>
<p>“As a parent, this is a good time to start teaching children that more is not always better, and that it is important to think about their purchases,” she said. </p>
<p>To teach the value of quality over quantity, Heng has even built a capsule wardrobe for her daughters. </p>
<p>If parents teach children about mindful consumption, sustainability, and encourage them to think before buying, this can reshape the way these children consume for life, she said. </p>
<p>“This child will go on to live for 80 to 90 years. Imagine the impact their daily choices will have on the environment over decades.”</p>

<div> <p>Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis, also starring in the series sequel And Just Like That…, released a joint statement in support of the women who had come forward to accuse Noth of sexual assault.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Siti Rohani </a> </div> </div>
<p>The stars of Sex And The City (SATC) and its sequel And Just Like That… have spoken up about the sexual assault allegations against co-star Chris Noth.</p>
<p>The statement read: “We are deeply saddened to hear the allegations against Chris Noth. We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences. We know it must be a very difficult thing to do and we commend them for it.” </p>
<p>The statement was signed by all three actresses. </p>
<p>Both accusers, who do not know each other, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter separately in a story that broke last week, with both saying they were triggered to do so after watching him on the new series, which started airing on HBO on Dec 9.</p>
<p>Noth, who reprised his Mr Big role from SATC, has denied the allegations, calling them “categorically false”. He said the encounters were consensual. </p>
<p>"These stories could've been from 30 years ago or 30 days ago – no always means no – that is a line I did not cross,” he said.</p>
<p>He also questioned the timing of the stories coming out. “I don't know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women."</p>
<p>The Los Angeles police has said no investigations are taking place over the alleged assaults as no official reports have been made. </p>

<h1> Love at first pretzel: The women behind Auntie Anne’s family-run outlets in Singapore </h1>
<div> <p>As the brand celebrates its 25th year anniversary, the Sulaeman sisters talk to CNA Women about their journey – from a pretzel-filled childhood to taking over the business from their mum, aka Singapore’s original “Auntie Anne”. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>All it took was one bite of an Auntie Anne's soft pretzel for Alice Sulaeman to fall in love with it. </p>
<p>This was in 1992 and Sulaeman was attending a business conference in Las Vegas, United States, with her husband. She was then 31 years old, and pregnant with their fourth and youngest child Olivia. </p>
<p>“Auntie Anne’s in the US was a very small family business then, so they asked us to come back in two years,” she said.</p>
<p>INTRODUCING SOFT PRETZELS TO SINGAPORE </p>
<p>At the time, it was difficult for the local market to accept the idea of a “soft pretzel”, Alice Sulaeman recounted. </p>
<p>People were perhaps more familiar with hard New York or German-style pretzels, Olivia Sulaeman added, and nastier comments even likened it to dog food. </p>
<p>But things did improve, said Alice Sulaeman. The brand managed to secure prime locations such as Takashimaya and Suntec City, and Auntie Anne’s grew in popularity. </p>
<p>Her husband, who was occupied with running the couple’s other businesses at the time, continued to lend his wife his support until Auntie Anne’s became more stable. </p>
<p>The sisters oversee a team of close to 40 staff across eight outlets here, including its latest stores in Northpoint City and Ang Mo Kio Hub, which opened last year during the pandemic. </p>
<p>CNA Women chatted with the Sulaeman women about family and business, growing up eating soft pretzels and more. </p>
<p>DO PEOPLE OFTEN ASK IF YOUR MUM’S NAME IS ANNE?</p>
<p>OLIVIA: People always do. Many people are not aware that the brand is from the US – my parents developed the business even before the American Auntie Anne’s gained international awareness.</p>
<p>NATASHA: In the US, the original owner’s name is, yes, Anne. But my mum is the Auntie Anne of Singapore.</p>
<p>ALICE:A lot of countries want to franchise our business. I tell them this is not my brand, so you have to contact the founders. Then they’d say: But I want yours! This is because our menu is different and localised. </p>
<p>HOW ARE THE ROLES DIVIDED NOW? ARE MUM AND DAD STILL INVOLVED?</p>
<p>ALICE: My husband and I started the business together but once it stabilised, I took the lead. Then, I passed the operations side of the business, including staff training, to Natasha. </p>
<p>OLIVIA: And I do everything outside of operations. </p>
<p>NATASHA: Mum is like the consultant, playing the advisory role now.</p>
<p>WHAT’S YOUR BEST MEMORY OF THE BUSINESS WHILE GROWING UP?</p>
<p>NATASHA: Kids dragging their parents, and saying: “Mummy, I want this!”. Some of our staff would also remember these kids – they’d buy the pretzels and go back to their mums.</p>
<p>OLIVIA: It became a place where parents can trust their kids to go to. It’s nice to see that. </p>
<p>DO YOUR FRIENDS GET FREE PRETZELS? </p>
<p>OLIVIA: But I guess that also reflects the general love for the brand. When we were in primary and secondary school, we would walk to Parkway Parade after school and our friends would ask us: “Can we have free pretzels or not?”</p>
<p>I’d tell them: “Don’t ask me, ask my mum!” My mum was all-hands on deck and was running the first outlet at Parkway Parade when it first opened. Both Natasha and I would help out whenever we could after school or during our school breaks. </p>
<p>WHO’S THE CREATIVE ONE IN THE FAMILY?</p>
<p>OLIVIA: That’s everyone, actually. Sometimes, we get inspired by flavours we come across when we’re overseas.</p>
<p>NATASHA: Olivia would have an inspiration and ask me if we can try it. I’d be the baker and test it out. Then, I will pass it back to Olivia to try. </p>
<p>ANY SINGAPORE-INSPIRED FLAVOURS THAT YOU’RE PROUD OF? </p>
<p>NATASHA: Olivia was the one who came up with the seaweed flavour. When we were young, she asked Dad: “Why don’t we have seaweed?” </p>
<p>ALICE: I like the Cinnamon Raisin.</p>
<p>NATASHA: Very difficult … but I’ll go with the Chocolate Eclair. Or if I am up for something sour-ish, Zesty Roselle. </p>
<p>OLIVIA: Mine is the Chocolate Mint and Cheezy Turkey. </p>
<p>NATASHA: Cannot have two, you must only choose one! </p>
<p>OLIVIA: One sweet and one savoury, right? </p>
<p>PEOPLE OFTEN SAY IT’S TOUGH TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOUR FAMILY. DO YOU AGREE?</p>
<p>OLIVIA: Our parents educated us that family is very important. I think the hardest part was, all we did was play together. And then suddenly, you have to work together. It’s like figuring out how to build that chemistry. </p>
<p>NAME A PET PEEVE YOU HAVE OF YOUR SISTER. </p>
<p>OLIVIA: A simple one: Sometimes she doesn’t calm down – it’s like there’s too much energy (laughs). Sometimes I’d be so tired, I’ll tell Natasha: “Can you come back tomorrow?”</p>
<p>NATASHA: For me it’s the opposite, I’d need to talk to Olivia about something, but I know she’s busy, so I just let her be. </p>
<p>DID YOU BOTH ALWAYS WANT TO RUN THE FAMILY BUSINESS OR WERE THERE OTHER CAREER OPTIONS IN MIND? </p>
<p>OLIVIA: I wanted to do consulting and stay in the US for a few years after graduation and then come back to Singapore. </p>
<p>But the business has been such a big part of our lives, especially mine. I literally grew up with it – and I can’t imagine what my life would be like if we no longer had Auntie Anne’s in it.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Our parents educated us that family is very important. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Coming back home, I knew I wanted to help with the business, but of course I wouldn’t be able to run it on my own. Olivia has more of that business mindset to help it grow.</p>
<p>OLIVIA: As we began gaining more interest in taking over the family business in 2014, Mum started to focus on other businesses, too.</p>
<p>ALICE: At that time, we thought that we weren’t able to grow the business anymore. But now they’ve made it better (laughs) – in fact, much better.</p>
<p>THAT’S REALLY NICE TO HEAR. WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE FOR YOU NOW?</p>
<p>ALICE: For me, it’s to have family bonding. It will reflect on your business, too, as you’ll have the peace of mind to focus on it. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> I can’t imagine what my life would be like if we no longer had Auntie Anne’s in it. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>HAS RUNNING A BUSINESS TOGETHER CHANGED THE DYNAMICS IN YOUR FAMILY?</p>
<p>OLIVIA: You see each other every day at home – breakfast, lunch, dinner – and at work. You are basically together every minute of the day. </p>
<p>NATASHA: When we get off work, sometimes Olivia and I would try to not talk about work.</p>
<p>ALICE: My husband and I are always talking about the business. During dinner or breakfast, the kids would complain: “Why are you always talking about the business?” </p>
<p>OLIVIA: And when we travel, there’s no holiday. Dad is easily inspired, and he’d say: “That’s great, why don’t we think about doing this?”</p>
<p>NATASHA: For example, the first two weeks would be a holiday, then the rest would be half-holiday, half-work. I remember the time we went to Japan, and he loved the pumpkin pie there. He came home and said: “Tasha, try to make it?”</p>
