<li>Compulsive Facebook use, and compulsive social media use in general, has become concerning and merits further research. </li>
<li>Compulsive Facebook use may share some of the same symptoms as addiction to cocaine, gambling, or alcohol.</li>
<li>Loneliness significantly moderates the association between Facebook addiction and the development of depression symptoms, research suggests.</li>
<a>smoking</a> and disease was inconclusive. Although the scientific evidence to counter Mr. Zuckerberg’s claim is growing, the findings are entirely correlational. Correlation never proves cause-and-effect.

<p>Compulsive FB use, or other variants of social media, has become a common concern. It is a concept that merits further study, but it is not currently an official <a>psychiatric</a> diagnosis.</p>
<a>addiction</a> believe that it may share the symptoms as addiction to cocaine, gambling, or
<a>relapse</a>. FB addiction even shows evidence of tolerance. Like cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol, FB addiction is behaviorally and genetically linked to
<a>depression</a>, loneliness, and poor sleep quality.
<p>Which came first, excessive FB use, loneliness, poor sleep quality, or depression?</p>
<a>circadian rhythm</a> and sleep. The FB addicts in this study slept less and had overall poor sleep quality. Thus, FB use, per se, was not the cause of the depression.
<a>insomnia</a>, tendency to sleep late, sleep disturbances, and drowsiness during the day. Mr. Zuckerberg may be correct that FB is most likely not the cause of depression.
<a>social isolation</a>, and then creates depression. Whether certain individuals who carry an inherited risk of depression are more vulnerable to Internet addiction remains to be investigated.
<p>Taken together, previous theories and current evidence suggest that the risk of depression and insomnia might be reduced if individuals restrict their use of all social medial and avoid blue light exposure in the evening.</p>

<h1> Why You Should Keep Drinking Coffee </h1>
<h2> New findings about the benefits of coffee for your brain and body. </h2>
<li>Coffee is a blend of biologically active compounds that have health-promoting properties.</li>
<li>There is a significant association between increased coffee consumption and reduced brain tumor risk, research shows.</li>
<li>Higher coffee consumption is also associated with a lower prevalence of small brain infarcts related to ischemic strokes. </li>
<li>Coffee—or just caffeine alone—has been shown to improve long-term memory and reduce the lipid peroxidation in the brains of the elderly.</li>
<p>The popular author Michael Pollan recently recommended giving up coffee. His main concern is its effects on sleep. </p>
<p>Most drugs, including coffee, have unintended consequences on health—both positive and negative. Here are a series of recently published studies that will make you want to keep drinking coffee.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Drinking Coffee</h3>
<a>antioxidant</a>, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative in terms of its ability to prevent certain brain cancers. Let’s take a look at the recent literature on coffee.
<p>Numerous studies during the past forty years have reported a similar dose-dependent protection from coffee. For example, the incidence of Parkinson’s disease also decreases a coffee consumption is increased up to 5 cups/day.</p>
<a>long-term memory</a>, reduced the lipid peroxidation of brain membranes, and increased the
<a>diet</a>-induced deficits in glucose-tolerance response, improved brain mitochondrial energy metabolism, and actually positively influenced a number of
<a>genes</a> in the brain that play a role in cellular energy metabolism.
<p>Science writers often spin a good story, but too often get the science wrong. There is simply no good reason to give up your coffee consumption. </p>

<h1> Do Psychedelics and Prayer Activate Similar Brain Regions? </h1>
<h2> A series of recent studies have defined the potential brain regions involved. </h2>
<li>Psychedelics and prayer both produce alterations of perceptions and mood, and both have anxiolytic, analgesic, and antidepressant properties. </li>
<li>Following a week-long intense spiritual retreat, there were significant changes in the cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortexes.</li>
<li>Ayahuasca, DMT, psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline acutely activated the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cingulate gyrus.</li>
<li>Similar brain regions facilitated each culture’s communication with their gods via the trance-like state they induced by either prayer or drugs.</li>
<h3>What Research Says About Prayer</h3>
<h3>What Research Says About Psychedelics</h3>
<a>neural</a> basis of the effects of psychedelics is not well understood. (If you would like to learn more about the actions of these drugs, please see the first reference below.)
<a>sex</a> and age, greater volumes of anterior cingulate best predicted the emotional experience of the psychedelic being studied.
<a>psilocybin</a>, LSD, or mescaline discovered that all of these drugs acutely activated the frontal lateral and medial cortex, temporal lobe (which controls
<a>memory</a>), and occipital cortex (which controls vision). These studies also reported evidence of long-term anatomical changes in the cingulate cortex.

<li>our brains use gamma waves (40 Hz) for specific functions that are not yet fully understood</li>

<h1> Why You Don't Always Lose Weight With Exercise </h1>
<h2> A new study finds that obesity makes it harder to exercise the weight off. </h2>
<li>Energy expenditure and physical effort are not linearly related in the human body.</li>
<li>Our bodies evolved compensatory mechanisms to balance the energy required to exercise with the energy available for key biological processes.</li>
<li>The body automatically compensates during exercise and holds back at least 25 percent of the calories we might expect to expend.</li>
<li>Additional body fat makes losing weight even harder due to these evolved compensatory processes.</li>
<p>The compensation was even greater in obese adults. Their bodies tended to reduce by 50 percent, or more, the actual number of calories burned by exercising.</p>
<p>Overall, these novel discoveries are consistent with numerous previous studies showing that exercise alone is often not an effective way to lose weight. Usually, people will also have to eat less.</p>
