<p>She asked him, “Walk me through your life. Start with just the positive. What are your life’s most pleasurable moments? Start at the very beginning.”</p>
<p>I remember when I was five, seeing a sidewalk of light gray and then a block of it that was darker gray. I stepped on it and it made an imprint of my foot, and when I came back the next day, it was still there. I loved that.</p>
<a>intelligence</a> was way above average. That did more to make me feel good about myself than anything, even Love is the Answer.
<p>It also really felt good when they asked me to sing The Star Spangled Banner at junior high school graduation.</p>
<p>From high school on, of course, the big thing was having that hit, but it was like a coke high: awesome but short and the crash is hard and long.</p>
<p>What have been your best moments? Any way to amplify their effects now? Any way to duplicate some version now?</p>
<p>Have you been living on a past accomplishment and should look for a new goal?</p>
<p>Have you been rationalizing inaction, wishing it were the good old days?</p>
<p>If you consider yourself a has-been, should you aim high yet again? Or focus on acceptance and just appreciate smaller wins?</p>

<h2> When you can’t just buck up and take the next baby step forward. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Daria Nikolaeva/Wikimeda Commons, CC 4.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>You’ve lost your job. Or a loved-one. Or had a health setback. What if you can’t just buck up?</p>
<p>The best approach depends on why you can't just buck up:</p>
<p>Are you afraid you’re incapable, for example, of landing another decent job in this job market, or that you’ll have too much trouble learning what's required in the new job?</p>
<p>But let’s say your fear is exaggerated, for example, that you will not find decent work. For you, would any of the following help?</p>
<li>Start by writing your resume. That reminds you of what you bring to the table</li>
<li>Dream big. Might there be a job so appealing that you’d be motivated to work hard to get it?</li>
<li>Would you be motivated by trying to prove wrong the person who dumped you?</li>
<li>Have an accountability partner, someone you’d check in with daily?</li>
<a>shame</a>. Guilt is when you feel bad about what you did or perceived you did. Shame is when you feel bad about your action’s impact on others. In either case, you may feel you should punish yourself. Would The
<a>Wise</a> One say you deserve continued
<a>punishment</a>? After all, the best restitution is—even if you were an axe murderer—constructive actions moving forward.
<a>Substance abuse</a>. Sometimes, moving forward is inhibited by substance abuse. If that might be true in your case, what do you want to do: Accept that you need that anesthetic? Moderate? Quit, by yourself or with a program? The government
<a>has </a>a 24/7/365 helpline plus an easy-to-use service locator.

<h1> Might the Unexamined Life Be Worth Living? </h1>
<h2> Can ignorance be bliss? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: ThreeMilesPerHour/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>A client said, and I'm paraphrasing, “I’ve tried living the examined life and have gained insight but my life is no better. Actually, I may be a bit less happy."</p>
<p>To summarize the low-musing ethos, they’re pleased that they delve no more deeply than sports, family, pop culture, fashion, sitcoms, travel, faith, or <a>gratitude</a> that they had minimal side effects from the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>I must admit to valuing the examined life. Indeed, a number of my posts encourage that. So, if you'd like your life to be a bit more examined than what was described in the previous paragraph, you might try one of these recent short posts:</p>
<p><a>The Scale: How Does Your Life Measure Up?</a> It invites you to inventory all the good and bad you’ve done and then opine on where the scale tips.</p>
<p><a>Increasing Your Self-Awareness</a>. That encourages you to inventory your triggers, habits, and blindspots.</p>
<p><a>The Museum of You</a> invites you to list your life’s significant concrete objects, from <a>childhood</a> to today, as a way of learning about yourself.</p>
<p><a>What Have Been Your Life's Best and Worst Decisions</a>? That encourages you to review your life’s biggest decisions: the ones that turned out well and the ones that didn’t, in search of lessons learned.</p>
<p><a>The Half-Hour Autobiography</a> invites you to list the "glads" and "regrets" from each of your life’s decades.</p>
<p>So, might you want to live a more examined life even if doesn't necessarily lead to greater <a>happiness</a>? Or would you rather minimize introspection in favor of a possibly surer route to happiness?</p>

<h1> 4 Keys to Making a Relationship Work </h1>
<h2> The Gottmans' core advice: My yes-ands and yes-buts. </h2>
<li>Not all conflicts are resolvable. It's important to decide which should be accepted as immutable, and which should be tackled. </li>
<li>If your personality tends to the negative, that's tough on a relationship. Consider reminding yourself of that when conversing with your partner.</li>
<li>Asking your partner open-ended questions such as, "Tell me a story about you, now or in your past," can help a relationship. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Garry Willmore/Flickr, CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>John and Julie Gottman have studied, with unusual rigor and for 40-plus years now, what makes relationships work. Their findings are summarized in the book Eight Dates.</p>
<a>dreams</a>. Some of my clients, as well as my wife and I, have done some variant of the eight dates, and we all feel it's been worthwhile.
<p>Here's additional core advice from the Gottmans, plus my take.</p>
<li>Tell me a story about you, now or in your past.</li>
<li>Do you have any dreams, not necessarily when <a>sleeping</a> but about your future?</li>
<li>Do you ever wonder if that’s all there is, I mean <a>career</a>-<a>wise</a>, relationship-wise, otherwise?</li>
<li>Your parents don't display much emotion, and you’re kind of that way. Has that served you well?</li>
<li>You want to have kids more than I do. What, deep down, do you think is the main driver of that?</li>
<li>I know you’re a Democrat, but why are you a Democrat?</li>
<li>You believe in God. In the face of evidence to the contrary, what makes you have faith in God?</li>
<li>How are you feeling about your substance use?</li>
<p>Or you could ask something quite general, for example,</p>
<ul><li>How are you feeling?</li> </ul>
<p>2. Conflict is inevitable. Key is accepting the immutable and attempting to resolve the others in a statesman-like way.</p>
<p>You: We argue a lot about your spending, my rushing in sex, and my being less enthusiastic than you are about spending time with your parents. Do you think those issues are in the 69% or the 31%?</p>
<p>Your partner: Maybe it's easiest if we start with the issue of visiting my parents.</p>
<p>Your partner: No. So, it sounds like you're making me mainly go see them by myself.</p>
<p>Your partner: It depends on how often you think it's important for you to go. I'm afraid you'll want to go just once or twice a year. I like visiting them every two weeks.</p>
<p>You: What if we aim for my going half the time, say once a month. Can you live with that?</p>
<p>Your partner: Well, we can try it. But, in a month, let's agree to revisit the plan.</p>
<p>You: Fair enough. (If it feels right, give your partner a hug.)</p>
<p>3. Successful couples emphasize the good times, and minimize the bad. In my experience, that's a manifestation of the partners' personality in general: They are people who tend to focus on the positive or negative in all aspects of life.</p>

<h1> Do You Often Succumb to Self-Serving Bias? </h1>
<h2> Reduce self-deception and figure out your next steps. </h2>
<li>Some people tend to overestimate their role in positive outcomes and overestimate the power of external factors in negative outcomes.</li>
<li>For example, people who were fired may blame their boss, coworkers, and employer rather than take responsibility for their role in the firing.</li>
<li>Reflecting on how an outside observer would perceive one's successes and failures can help reduce self-serving bias.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Robin Higgins, Pixabay, Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Self-serving bias occurs when you overestimate your role in your positive outcomes and overestimate the power of external factors in your negative outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve had clients who had been terminated. They tend to blame externals: the boss, coworkers, the employer, being of the wrong race or <a>gender</a>, or some other form of bad luck.</p>
<p>I’ve had clients who have <a>divorced</a>. They tend to mainly blame their spouse.</p>
<a>heuristic</a>, a brain shortcut, that makes you feel comfortable. But here, I invite you to slow down, breathe, and consider, in a statesmanlike way, the extent to which you have succumbed to self-serving bias.
<a>emotional intelligence</a>. Or would that observer say that your success was mostly a matter of externals: for example, lucking into good jobs?
<a>substance abuse</a> problem, or are unduly negative about most things. Or would that observer say that your life’s overall lack of success has mainly been caused by externals: for example, early
<a>trauma</a>, being in an undesired demographic group, or the economic system?

<h1> How to Improve Self-Discipline </h1>
<h2> Author Brian Tracy offers suggestions—plus yes-ands and yes-buts. </h2>
<li>Some people do well to block out 15 minutes a day toward achieving an important goal that could otherwise be left undone.</li>
<li>A potent tool for growth: Meet regularly with a trusted person for a half-hour a week in which you discuss each other's goals.</li>
<li>Make it harder to do what you're trying to avoid.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Geralt/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Brian Tracy has written 80 self-help books with a core interest in self-discipline. He distills his advice on that in a video: 5 Hacks to Improve Self-Discipline This Year. </p>
<p>Here are those five tips plus my yes-ands and yes-buts.</p>
<p>"Set aside 15 minutes a day to work on your goal. Treat it as any appointment and show up on time…. After one month, you'll have spent seven hours on your goal."</p>
<h3>2. Get an accountability partner</h3>
<p>"Someone who will check in with you periodically, and you can check in with them to help them with their goal. Many of us find it easier to let ourselves down than to let someone else down."</p>
<p>Still don't feel like asking someone? Then do you want to try sharing your goal with your social media followers? Just honestly report your progress or lack thereof.</p>
<p>"Remove what will challenge your focus. If you're trying to lose weight, remove unhealthy foods from your home. If you're trying to cut spending, set aside a budget and put the rest in savings."</p>
<a>attractiveness</a>, or to feel more comfortable in your clothes? If it's spending less, is it to avoid poverty, so you can live consistent with your professed environmentalist/non-materialistic values, or to stop your spouse from
<a>guilt</a>-tripping you for overspending? If you want to stop your
<a>substance abuse</a>, is it mainly to help your health, relationships, or work life? Try saying your mantra three times in the morning, again at lunch, and before you go to bed.
<h3>4. Have an aim, a purpose</h3>
<p>"Tackle your ugliest tasks first. If your start your day with that, the rest will seem easier."</p>
<p>Here, I don't agree. One size doesn't fit all. Morning people who don't have more time-sensitive tasks to do might tackle a frog first. But other people might save their frogs for later in the day when it feels right.</p>
<p>Is there at least one idea here that you'd like to try?</p>

<h1> How to Fight Nicely in Couple Conflicts </h1>
<h2> 3 conflicts that couples often face: sample dialogues and embedded principles. </h2>
<li>Key to a relationship's success is not whether the couple has conflicts, because all couples do, but how they're addressed.</li>
<li>Making a point as a question rather than as a statement is less accusatory and allows the partner some agency.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a passive response is a useful tactic, for example, allowing silence, ignoring a barb, or invoking the partner's values.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Ion Chibzii/Flickr, CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Here are three thornier conflicts: about <a>sex</a>, about money, and about <a>parenting</a>. Most of my clients learn best by example, so here are sample dialogues plus embedded principles.</p>
<p>Partner 1: I always feel you’re rushing to the "main event.”</p>
<p>Partner 2: I’m attracted to you. I can’t help it.</p>
<p>Partner 1: If that's truly beyond your control, OK, but might there be anything you could do? It would make me feel more loved, not to mention more excited.</p>
<p>Partner 2: Do I really have to think about baseball scores while we're having sex?</p>
<p>Partner 1: I’m wondering if the following might be a better alternative. You’re goal-oriented in everything: work, sports, and, yes, sex. Is it realistic to ask you to make our goal to make the pleasure last longer?</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I doubt it, but maybe I could try focusing exclusively on you for a few minutes more so I won’t be quite as eager for the, ahem, main event.</p> <p>Partner 1: I would love that.</p> </blockquote>
<p>There’s a time to be “deaf.” Partner 1 wisely chose to ignore “I doubt it” but supported Partner 2's suggestion.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I’m not committing to staying with that, only to trying it as an experiment.</p> <p>Partner 1: That’s all I could ask.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 was reasonable in accepting only a minimal commitment for starters. If that helps, Partner 1 might not even have to ask Partner 2 to continue the experiment.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: I look at our credit card bills and cringe. You’re spending on yet more unnecessary stuff, expensive stuff, and we are saving zippo. I thought you cared about security.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 tried to appeal to a core value of Partner 2…to no avail.</p>
<p>Partner 2: I work too. I deserve it.</p>
<p>Partner 1: Of course, you deserve a good life, but might there be a less risky way to get it that will last longer than shopper’s high? No sooner have you bought one unnecessary thing than you buy another.</p>
<p>It was good that Partner 1 started with a question, but the statement that followed would likely make Partner 2 defensive. And it did.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: What do you want me to do, meditate?</p> <p>Partner 1: What might you want to do?</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 doesn’t break the silence, giving Partner 2 time to think and to reduce the defensiveness.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I like shopping. Maybe I could buy less expensive things and get almost the same benefit.</p> <p>Partner 1: What do you think?</p> </blockquote>
<p>J.W. Marriott called "What do you think?" the four most powerful words in the English language. Also, Partner 1 didn’t enthuse, which would have reduced Partner 2's sense of ownership in the idea.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I guess I could try it. Nothing to lose by trying.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 just nodded so Partner 2 would retain agency.</p>
<p>Again, Partner 1 wisely chose not to jump in, hoping that Partner 2 might, on a roll, say something else constructive.</p>
<p>Partner 2: And, just maybe, rather than giving Amazon all my money, I could start investing in Amazon.</p>
<p>Partner 1: It’s expensive: $3,500 a share. but some brokerages—for example, Schwab and Fidelity—let you buy fractional shares, even just $5 worth, and commission-free.</p>
<p>Partner 2: That might be fun to try, but, again, this is just an experiment.</p>
<h3>Strictness in Parenting</h3>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: Why are you crying?</p> <p>Partner 2: It hurt me to see you make Johnny have his dinner in his bedroom just because he said he needed five more minutes to finish his video game.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Saying “It hurt me to see you send Johnny to his bedroom…” was more compelling and less engendering of defensiveness than, for example, “I can’t believe you sent Johnny to his bedroom…."</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: He always needs five minutes. He’s gotta learn. </p> <p>Partner 2: Do you think he and maybe you’ll pay a price for being so strict?</p> </blockquote>
<p>Making the point as a question rather than as a statement is less accusatory and allows Partner 1 some agency.</p>
<p>Partner 1: No. Lack of respect for parents is one of those things that’s ruining this country. Johnny needs to learn that he’s not the center of the universe.</p>
<p>Partner 2: I agree. Do you think that you and I need to create a united front on what we will and won’t be strict about?</p>
<p>Partner 2 started the response with a legitimate point of agreement. S/he then came up with a reasonable idea, but again presented it as a question.</p>
<p>Partner 1: Of course, but you want to be quite laissez-faire, and I want to set reasonable boundaries.</p>
<p>Partner 2: Might it help if you and I made a list of what we think would be behaviors that are just on either side of the boundary? I mean, it’s a no-brainer than if he stole from us, we’d not let that go. What do you think?</p>
<p>Partner 2 didn’t take the bait but instead deflected by making a statesmanlike proposal that would allow both partners to have a say in the matter.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: I guess.</p> </blockquote>
<p>That’s as much as Partner 2 could reasonably expect.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: What if we agree that when we ask Johnny to do something, we’ll give him no more than two minutes leeway?</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 2 wisely began the negotiation with a sign of good faith: starting by capitulating a bit to Partner 1's viewpoint. That made it more likely that Partner 1, too, would be gracious:</p>
<p>Partner 1: Maybe it's even better if we tell him a few minutes in advance—for example, “Johnny, dinner will be in two minutes. Fair warning.”</p>
<p>Partner 2: Sounds great. Want to suggest another behavior that's on the boundary?</p>
<p>Of course, not all conflicts will be addressed so readily, but the sample dialogues and embedded principles can be a good place to start.</p>

<h1> The Art of Fighting With Your Partner </h1>
<h2> Sample dialogues for dealing with lack of caring, affairs, and substance abuse. </h2>
<li>Start with small asks before moving on to greater requests. That creates commitment bias.</li>
<li>When facing a pervasive problem, start by tackling one small example of it.</li>
<li>Even if you don't get immediate assent, it's often wise to accept that you've planted a seed. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Ion Chibzii/Flickr/CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>My recent posts offered sample dialogues for dealing with conflicts about sex, parenting, spending, and <a>relatives. </a></p>
<p>Here, we turn to three other sources of conflict: lack of caring, having an affair, and <a>substance abuse</a>. As with the previous installments, I note embedded principles.</p>
<p>Partner 1: I do so much for you, yet when I’m talking with you, you don't even stop looking at your phone.</p>
<p>Partner 2: I do plenty for you.</p>
<p>Partner 1: Perhaps, rather than our counting up kindnesses, is it of any value for you to hear that I'm feeling uncared about?</p>
<a>bias</a>, which makes it easier to then make a larger request. That’s something that every fundraiser knows.
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I hear you, but I'm doing the best I can.</p> <p>Partner 1: Might there be anything you feel OK about doing to make me feel more cared about?</p> </blockquote>
<p>Questions are often better than suggestions. And rather than trying to tackle a big problem globally, it’s often better to try a small specific at a time—How do you eat an elephant? A bite at a time.</p>
<p>Partner 2: I guess I could stop doing what I’m doing when you come home and at least say hi.</p>
<p>Partner 1: That would be great. May I push one bit further: When I’m talking with you, can I ask you to put your phone down?</p>
<p>Partner 2: I can multitask.</p>
<p>Partner 1: I know, but it makes me feel not cared about. Plus, it’s hard to process what I’m saying if your <a>attention</a> is divided.</p>
<p>Partner 2: I can try, but I reserve the right to multitask, for example, to clean the kitchen or, yes, look at my phone while you’re talking.</p>
<p>That statesman-like compromise paves the way for Partner 1 to also be statesman-like, and it works:</p>
<p>Partner 1: How about it's OK for you to multitask except when I need your undivided attention? I'd signal that by saying something like, “I need your advice here.”</p>
<p>Partner 2: We can try it.</p>
<p>Partner 1: Fair enough. How about we see if that’s working by checking in with each other late tonight or tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Partner 1 is <a>wise</a> in settling for an experiment. Also, it was wise to promise a check-in soon. Yet another plus is that Partner 1 gave Partner 2 a choice, some agency.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: Tomorrow night is soon enough.</p> <p>Partner 1: OK. Now, let’s turn to you. Want to tell me about your day?</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 wisely knew when to let well-enough alone. S/he thus turned to an act of kindness but not presumptively: Rather than using the declarative, “Tell me about your day,” s/he asked, “Want to tell me about your day?”</p>
<p>Partner 1: I found a stranger’s underwear under our bed. I had a feeling you were having an affair, and now I know.</p>
<p>Partner 2: It was brief, and it’s over.</p>
<p>Partner 1: No surprise, I’ve lost trust in you! We're married and agreed to be monogamous.</p>
<a>dreams</a>—and, where needed, to agree on a baby step(s) to improve things. What do you think?
<p>Partner 2 provided needed reassurance and a practical step forward, ending with the helpful, “What do you think?”</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: I need time to process all this. Go away.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 2 would be wise to not push the subject but, rather, wait for Partner 1 to bring it up, which would increase Partner 1’s buy-in. And, indeed, that’s what Partner 2 did:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I understand. I am sorry for having hurt our relationship and want to say again that I am committed to us and making our good relationship ever better. I love you.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 walks away sad.</p>
<p>That’s about as good as Partner 2 could expect. S/he might then do something else that Partner 1 would appreciate: perhaps Partner 1’s favorite among Gary Chapman’s “love languages:”</p>
<li>An act of service: for example, vacuuming the house, which Partner 1 normally does but dislikes</li>
<li>Quality time: for example, later, when Partner 1 cools down a bit, taking a walk together and being a good listener</li>
<li>A gift: If there’s something that Partner 1 has long wanted, this may be a good time to buy it.</li>
<li>Words of affirmation: for example, a handwritten note citing all the good about Partner 2 or the relationship</li>
<li>Physical touch: for example, making love in the way Partner 2 most enjoys it</li>
<p>Partner 1 phrases the concern as a question, which engenders less defensiveness than “I’m worried,” let alone “You have a substance abuse problem.”</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I’m fine. Things have been <a>stressful</a>: work, the kids, you know.</p> <p>Partner 1: I just wanted you to know that I’m feeling a little scared.</p> </blockquote>
<p>In the face of Partner 2’s resistance, Partner 1 decided to be declarative yet softened it with, “I’m feeling a little scared.”</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: I said I’m fine.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 2 is making clear that s/he’s not open to dealing with substance use, so, for now, Partner 1 would be wise not to push it:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 1: I understand. I just want you to know that if you’d like to talk about it, maybe kick around what sort of help to get, if any, I’m here for you.</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Partner 2: Thank you.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Partner 1 has planted seeds of concern, caring, and not being punitive. That’s as much as can be expected in that first conversation about a most touchy subject.</p>
<p>Is there at least one idea in these sample dialogues or the embedded principles that you’d like to keep in mind or even try out?</p>

<h1> How to Make Your Holiday Cards Actually Appreciated </h1>
<h2> Ideas for psychologically attuned holiday cards that bring comfort and joy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Eric Mesa, CC</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Holiday cards are rife with danger—well, at least rife with the potential for eye-rolling.</p>
<p>Then there’s the holiday letter designed to impress with accomplishments and photos of a preternaturally happy and successful family. Like many Facebook profiles, it just makes you feel inferior.</p>
<p>There’s also the converse: the holiday letter that tries too hard to be humble in the spirit of the season. That can evoke feelings of guilt: Am I too willful? More likely, it’ll just yield eye-rolling.</p>
<p>Whether the letter is self-aggrandizing or self-effacing, it can additionally roll eyes if it's a tome. That makes it likely to be deleted or to go into recycling before the reader has finished the missive.</p>
<p>And then there’s the card that’s perfectly reasonable but perfectly forgettable amid the flurry of others.</p>
<p>What’s a person to do?</p>
<h3>Ideas for making your holiday cards more psychologically attuned</h3>
<a>gratitude</a>. Well, COVID obviously sucks, but a silver lining is that it can make us feel more grateful for every healthy day.
<p>In any event, keep your holiday letter short. Remember, your letter is probably just one of many that people have to wade through. Yes, less is more: Say what’s important and perhaps amusing.</p>

<h2> Thoughts for parents of college-bound teens. </h2>
<li>Universities often acquire their brand name heavily on factors having little to do with the student experience. </li>
<li>More important considerations may be selectivity, location, politics, and cost. </li>
<li>Due to Omicron accelerating, families should also consider the potential impact of remote classes and limited extracurricular opportunities. </li>
