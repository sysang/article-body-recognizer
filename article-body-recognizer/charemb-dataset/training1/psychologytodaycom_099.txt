<h1> Getting Stuck in Negative Emotions and Relationship Patterns </h1>
<h2> You can escape how your brain confirms the worst in other people and situations. </h2>
<li>Our current moods set up “emotional filters” that only let thoughts, memories, and emotions that are congruent with those moods through.</li>
<li>Competing (maybe positive) thoughts, memories, and emotions get filtered out by your attentional system when you are feeling down. </li>
<li>Developing emotional intelligence and learning to direct your attention and thoughts away from negative cues can let you shift your experience. </li>
<p>You are having a bad day. Like most days lately, you feel anxious and worried — maybe even a bit hopeless and <a>depressed</a>. Nothing seems to be going right. You might think, “My life just sucks.”</p>
<p>Now ask yourself: Why do I have to wake up tomorrow feeling the same way I did today? The truth is that you don’t.</p>
<h3>Changing Your Negative Experience and Thoughts </h3>
<p>The main reason for the continuation of negative experience lies in how your brain’s <a>attention</a> and <a>memory</a> systems work. But each day you wake up, you don’t have to tell yourself the same painful story.</p>
<p>Our current moods set up “emotional filters” that only let thoughts, memories, and emotions that are congruent with those moods through. Competing (maybe positive) thoughts, memories, and emotions get filtered out.</p>
<p>In a recent paper on <a>happiness</a> at Widener University, clinical psychology doctoral students David Albert, Amanda Blazkiewicz, Ariful Karim, and Ariana Swenson, uncovered the following:</p>
<h3>How to Break the Negative Emotional Cycle and Have a New Type of Experience</h3>
<li>Practice being aware of your present real-time mood states (your emotions). If you don’t know what you are feeling, then you won’t know what to be on the lookout for.</li>
<li>While holding and observing your emotions in your physical body, realize that your thoughts do not have to be in line with them. Work on gently letting go of your negative/hurtful thoughts and shift them in a positive direction.</li>
<li>Decide what you want to spend your time dwelling on and practice doing just that. If you can’t slow your thoughts down or stop ruminating, then ruminate and dwell on your plans for tomorrow, not your misgivings about yesterday or today.</li>
<li>Bring yourself into the present moment. Look around yourself; is there something wrong with what you see? (Or, are you sitting on the sofa with a loving pet looking out of the window?)</li>
<h3>A Note on Your Present State of Reality</h3>
<a>consult a mental health professional,</a> access needed medical or drug/alcohol treatment, or call your county or local
<a>domestic abuse</a>/crisis center. (In the United States, call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233), text "LOVEIS" to 22522, or go to

<p>We all must deal with disappointment, but some people have had more than their share, and deal with it better...or worse.</p>
<p>This composite illustrates. It's drawn from my clients, friends, and me.</p>
<p>Here's how I might respond. Perhaps these questions will help you:</p>
<p>Do you benefit from the status-quo of giving up? After all, change is hard. It’s been said that the only person who likes change is a wet baby.</p>
<p>Moving forward, imagine that a new law required you to take steps forward. Any ideas of what those might be?</p>
<a>caretaker</a> and take care of yourself for a change? That philosophy could manifest in myriad ways such as improving your health, getting more massages, or savoring rather than wolfing down your meals.
<a>gratitude</a> for the good, and take baby steps forward so as to yield even more good and less disappointment.

<h1> Let's Talk About Erectile Dysfunction </h1>
<h2> How my prostate cancer experience is helping make ED more discussable for me. </h2>
<li>Erectile dysfunction impacts about half of all men aged 60, and many much younger. </li>
<li>Prostate cancer is known as "the couple's disease" because treatment has a major impact on intimacy.</li>
<li>Good starting points for men and their partners facing ED: We can still make love without erections and there is no shame in body changes.</li>
<p>It is very awkward talking about erectile dysfunction (ED). Hardly anybody does, except in derisive jokes. Yet it is extremely common after prostate cancer treatment, and some level of ED affects about half of all men by age 60.</p>
<p>Surprisingly large numbers of <a>men under 40 are also affected</a>. It's a big deal, especially when you factor in the impact of ED on partners and intimate relationships. Yet it remains mostly undiscussable.</p>
<p>My prostate cancer journey makes it easier for me to talk about erectile dysfunction. Somehow for me as a man, it is much easier to say "I can't get it up because of cancer surgery," than to just say I can't get it up.</p>
<a>prostate surgically removed</a> just over a year ago, by which time the cancer was at Stage 3a. Right after surgery, I thought I was one of the lucky ones who escaped without ED, but my erections faded progressively in the following two months.
<h3>Breakfasts with Cialis</h3>

<a>medication</a> for erectile dysfunction. I mean, I am not an ED type of guy. Right? I am a fit, strong married man enjoying a healthy sex life and a strong libido. That's certainly how I saw myself until my surgery.
<h3>Talking about erectile dysfunction and manhood</h3>
<a>traumatic</a> conflict at work. I was shocked when my erection simply vanished in the middle of lovemaking with my wife, and I felt absolutely mortified. I certainly didn't tell anybody about it.
<a>grateful</a> about is that my wife's immediate response at the time my erection turned to jelly was "don't worry, we can still make love even if we can't have penetration." I cried, and I am not a crying kind of man. Cried for the
<a>humiliation</a> that I was expecting. Cried with relief that she made the choice not to shame me. Cried as I realised how deeply I expected erectile dysfunction to be my most shameful moment ever.
<p>I'm also very grateful that I recovered within a week or two back then, no doubt largely thanks to my wife's wonderfully supportive, flexible, and non-shaming response.</p>
<p>Now the ED is coming back, and this time as a (hopefully temporary) response to the inevitable nerve trauma during an <a>otherwise highly successful</a> robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. It really helps to start from these two places:</p>
<ul><li>We can still make love even if I don't have an erection; and</li> <li>I don't have to be ashamed about changes in my body. It is normal to change.</li> </ul>
<h3>Beyond talking about ED: Questioning my manhood </h3>
<p>Through all this, I wonder what makes me a man. I am missing my favourite part of manhood (sex) but I do realise there is much more to manhood than just sex, and much more to libido and sex than just erections and penetrative sex.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and months, I will keep you posted on what emerges in all aspects of recovering from prostate cancer and rediscovering what it means for me to be a man.</p>

<h2> The Psychology of Crime </h2>
<div> <h3> What causes a person to commit crimes? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do criminals choose victims? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can you prevent being the victim of a violent crime? </h3> </div>
<a>avoid being the victim of a crime</a>. On a psychological level, working to project calm assuredness, moving with purpose, or blending into a larger crowd may help someone reduce their chances of being victimized.
<h2> How Psychology Influences the Law </h2>
<div> <h3> How are psychology and the law related? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do most people obey the law? </h3> </div>
<a>obey the law</a> so as to better coordinate with others around them and society at large, or they may do it to signal their beliefs or
<a>morality</a>. For most law-abiding people, their reasoning is likely a combination of the above factors.
<div> <h3> Can psychological research cause laws to be changed? </h3> </div>
<a>California’s law mandating later school start times</a>. This law was directly tied to psychological and neurological research on the developing brain that highlighted the need for children—and
<a>teenagers</a> in particular—to get more sleep.
<div> <h3> Can laws change people’s beliefs and attitudes? </h3> </div>
<a>changes to the law can precede larger shifts in societal attitudes,</a> though the direction of cause-and-effect is not entirely understood. One study, for instance, found that antigay attitudes reduced much more rapidly after
<a>marriage</a> equality laws were passed than they had before.
<div> <h3> How do lawyers make use of psychology? </h3> </div>
<a>Forensic Psychology</a> page.
<div> <h3> Can eyewitness recollection always be trusted? </h3> </div>
<a>eyewitness testimony</a> is often a key element of criminal trials, psychology has consistently demonstrated that it cannot always be relied on. Eyewitnesses may misremember key details—or even
<a>invent new ones</a>. Despite this, a seemingly credible witness can be highly persuasive; thus, legal professionals continue to use them, particularly when other evidence is lacking. 
<div> <h3> Why might a witness remember something that didn’t happen? </h3> </div>
<a>Memory</a> is imperfect even in the best of circumstances.
<a>convincingly shown that false memories can be implanted.</a>
<div> <h3> How do so-called “repressed memories” affect the judicial system? </h3> </div>
<a>Repressed memories may be submitted as evidence</a> in certain locations. However, because
<a>false memories</a> can be implanted and it’s often difficult to distinguish true memories from false ones without corroborating evidence, it’s rare for charges to be filed based on them alone.

<div> <h3> How can the families of the mentally ill seek help from the legal system? </h3> </div>
<a>mental health-focused legal expert</a> for guidance and assistance.
<div> <h3> What are some concerns about the ways mentally ill individuals may be treated by law enforcement? </h3> </div>
<a>many activists are seeking to shift this responsibility to psychological professionals</a>.
<div> <h3> Does anti-bias training for police officers work? </h3> </div>
<a>bias</a> training has received significant attention in recent years, especially as concerns about racial biases in policing have grown. However, there is
<a>little evidence that implicit bias training reliably reduces bias</a>; indeed, some researchers have found that certain kinds of bias training may actually increase bias in daily life. 
<div> <div> <a> The Serial Killer BTK and the Concept of Cubing </a> </div> <div> As I talk about my work with the "BTK" serial killer Dennis Rader, I hear the same two questions over and over. The answer to both is complicated. </div> </div>
<div> Is childhood trauma a necessary part of the narrative to understand men with sexual convictions? Or is sexual abuse simply a means of trying to excuse abhorrent behaviour? </div>

<h1> 2 Essentials for Parenting Through Chaos </h1>
<h2> Kids now need what they've always needed: structure and love. </h2>
<li>The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have declared a mental health emergency.</li>
<li>Unconditional love is the single most important factor for helping children cope and thrive in difficult times.</li>
<li>Predictable structure and rituals, including chores and rules, make children and adolescents feel safe and help them cope.</li>
<p>Stressed parents. Frazzled teachers. News stories droning in the background about rising death tolls, breakthrough infections, and society in chaos.</p>
<a>Psychiatry</a>, and the Children’s Hospital Association issue
<a>a joint declaration</a> that children are experiencing a mental health emergency.
<p>No, it's not just your family.</p>
<p>In this post, I focus on two core elements researchers have identified as touchstones that help children and adolescents thrive in the worst of times: structure and love.</p>
<h3>Someone Who Is Crazy About You </h3>
<p>Unconditional love. No matter what the child does, they know that "irrational" adult will hold them close, accept them for who they are, help them to be better, and fight the world to keep them safe. </p>
<p>The thing that the children in your life need more than anything right now is for you to be that person for them.</p>
<p>Things are changing all the time. My students are trying to plan whether they will take a class in person or online two weeks from now so they know whether to make plane reservations and go home. And they don’t know.</p>
<p>One rock kids need to hold onto is love. Another is structure. </p>
<p>Dinner time slides from 5:30 to whenever. We went from eating together at the table to together on the couch. To together in the house.</p>
<p>And that "no cell phone during meals" rule? Well...</p>

<h1> The Evolution of Pornography </h1>

<p>Without question, we are in the midst of a digital porn explosion. And no, I’m not exaggerating when I use the word explosion. In their 2012 book, <a>A Billion Wicked Thoughts</a>, researchers Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam write:</p>
