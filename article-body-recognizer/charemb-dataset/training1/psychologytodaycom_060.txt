<h2> The Science of Being Virtuous </h2>
<div> <h3> Are people born with morals and ethics? </h3> </div>
<p>We used to think that people are born with a blank slate, but research has shown that people have an innate <a>sense of morality</a>. Of course, parents and the greater society can certainly nurture and develop morality and ethics in children.</p>
<div> <h3> Can you have morals without religion? </h3> </div>
<a>atheist’s conception of morality</a> may depart from that of the traditional theist.
<div> <h3> Do animals have morals? </h3> </div>
<a>animals are more moral</a> than humans.
<div> <h3> What is the difference between moral psychology and moral philosophy? </h3> </div>
<a>examination of moral psychology</a> involves the study of moral
<a>philosophy</a> but the field is more concerned with how a person comes to make a right or wrong decision, rather than what sort of decisions he or she should have made. Character, reasoning, responsibility, and
<a>altruism</a>, among other areas, also come into play, as does the development of morality.

<h2> Understanding Forensic Psychology </h2>
<div> <h3> What does a forensic psychologist do? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What role do forensic psychologists play in criminal justice? </h3> </div>
<a>Forensic psychologists </a>can play a significant role in almost any level of the legal system. They may consult with legal professionals on mental health, criminal
<a>motivation</a>, or risk assessment; they may assess or treat accused criminals or prison inmates for mental health disorders. They may also work in jury selection, legal research, or crisis
<div> <h3> What is forensic psychopathology? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between a forensic psychologist and a criminal psychologist? </h3> </div>
<a>Criminal psychology</a>, by contrast, focuses specifically on criminal behavior. A criminal psychologist may research why crimes happen, help police assess crime scenes, or gauge the probability that specific crimes will occur.

<div> <h3> How long does it take to become a forensic psychologist? </h3> </div>
<a>Most forensic psychology doctoral programs</a> take at least 6 years to complete. Master’s programs may take less time—one to two years, generally—but many career paths in forensic psychology continue to require a doctoral degree.
<div> <h3> How can I decide if forensic psychology is the career for me? </h3> </div>
<a>career in forensic psychology</a> should determine whether its unique combination of clinical work, public speaking, and research syncs with their

<a>attention</a>, many people assume that all forensic psychologists assess criminal behavior; however, while criminal psychology is an important area of the field, it is not the only career path a forensic psychologist can take.
<div> <h3> What are the psychological reasons that people commit crimes? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a>, or a sense of entitlement can all motivate criminal behavior. Some criminals are under the influence of drugs and thus behave irrationally; others have mental illnesses that distort their worldview, triggering illegal acts.

<h2> The Transgender Experience </h2>
<a>adolescence</a>, or beyond, may also contribute to one’s gender identity, or at least to one’s awareness of it and comfort disclosing it.
<div> <h3> What is gender dysphoria? </h3> </div>
<p>While some children who experience such feelings do not go on to identify as transgender in adulthood, long-standing gender dysphoria is a common experience among adults who do identify as transgender.</p>

<div> <h3> Are trans people also homosexual? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual orientation</a>. Trans people, like any other individuals, may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, or none of the above. Trans people commonly refer to their
<a>sexual</a> orientation in terms of their gender identity: For example, a trans woman attracted to women would most likely consider herself to be a lesbian or gay woman.
<div> <h3> Do trans people date heterosexual nontrans partners? </h3> </div>
<a>transphobia</a> and resistance to such pairings among the heterosexual, cisgender population. For example, in one recent study, less than 3 percent of heterosexual cisgender people said they would consider
<a>dating</a> a trans individual, while 12 percent of nontransgender gay men, 29 percent of nontransgender lesbians, and slightly more than half of people who identified as bisexual, queer, or nonbinary, reported that they would.

<h1> Are You Religious or Spiritual? Both or Neither? </h1>
<h2> Does this distinction matter to you, or to humanity? </h2>
<p> Posted January 2, 2022 </p>
<li>Religion, or the belief in and worship of a God(s), and spirituality, a sensory/mood/cognitive experience, are not one and the same. </li>
<li>Religious people feel that their "spirituality" derives from their close relationship with a Supreme Being and from the words of a sacred text.</li>
<li>Spiritual enlightenment or transcendence can be achieved through God, but can also be realized by a variety of intense experiences.</li>
<li>Life can be challenging or rewarding; humans have always been on a preternatural quest to to understand the origins and meaning of life.</li>
<p> You’ve probably heard someone say with some degree of confidence, “I am not religious, but I am spiritual.” If so, were you in any way enlightened by those <a>assertive</a> words? </p>
<p>Can a person be spiritual and not religious? How about religious and not spiritual? Can someone be both, or neither? How do you define yourself within this dichotomy?</p>
<p>We seem to agree on the meaning of the word religious, which, simply put, refers to a belief in the existence of a Supreme Being, an omniscient and omnipotent God who somehow introduced humans to this planet. </p>
<p>From archaeological, anthropological, and historical records, we’ve learned that human beings have always wondered about our origins and the purpose in our lives. </p>
<a>consumerism</a>. They look for meaning beyond the material in life, something uplifting, transcendent, even transformative.
<p>Over the centuries millions have found solace in a Supreme Being, especially in times of crisis. They have found inner peace and security in their worship of and personal relationship with God. </p>
<a>philosophy</a>, or other spheres of
<a>wisdom</a>. The newly aloft James Watt Space Telescope, much more powerful than the Hubble, is now seeking answers to these questions of our origins.
<a>ethics</a>, humanistic values, or benevolent interpersonal principles.
<a>creativity</a> in all the arts, and, yes, into both religion and spirituality. We seek new ways of thinking about our spaceship Earth, about each other, and about the cosmos.
