<p>According to the <a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), in order for pedophilic disorder to be diagnosed, the following criteria must be met:</p>
<li>Recurrent, intense <a>sexual fantasies</a>, urges, or behaviors involving <a>sexual</a> activity with a prepubescent child (generally age 13 years or younger) for a period of at least 6 months.</li>
<li>These sexual urges have been acted on or have caused significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
<li>The person is at least 16 years old, and at least 5 years older than the child in the first category. However, this does not include an individual in late <a>adolescence</a> involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.</li>
<p>Additionally, a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder should specify whether the individual is exclusively attracted to children or not, the <a>gender</a> that the individual is attracted to, and whether the sexual urges are limited to incest. </p>
<a>pornography</a> is a useful diagnostic indicator of pedophilic disorder. Additionally, genital sexual arousal can be measured in a laboratory setting through sexual stimuli and is based on the relative change in penile response.
<p>Paraphilias as a group have a high rate of <a>comorbidity</a> with one another and an equally high rate of comorbidity with <a>anxiety</a>, major <a>depression</a> or mood disorders, and <a>substance abuse</a> disorders.</p>

<div> <h3> What factors are associated with elder abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>increases the likelihood of elder abuse,</a> because the senior may be more vulnerable or family members may be overwhelmed by the responsibilities of
<a>caregiving</a>. On the part of the perpetrator, factors associated with elder abuse include mental illness, substance abuse, chronic employment, and stress due to caregiving.
<div> <h3> What prevents people from reporting elder abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>elder abuse go unreported</a>. The reasons why include feelings of
<a>embarrassment</a> and shame, being unaware that abuse is occurring, believing that they are somehow responsible for the abuse, thinking that others won’t believe their allegations, and fears of retaliation or being moved from their home.
<p>Older adults can take the following precautions to help keep themselves safe from abuse:</p>
<li>Stay open to opportunities. Make new friends. Continue participating in community activities.</li>
<li>Retain control over your telephone and mail. If your mail is being intercepted, discuss the problem with postal authorities.</li>
<li>Organize your belongings so you can keep track of everything. Make sure others are aware that you know where everything is kept.</li>
<li>Try to be in control of attending to your personal needs. Keep regular appointments with your doctor, dentist, barber, or hairdresser.</li>
<li>Maintain financial control. Arrange to have your Social Security or pension check deposited directly to a bank account in your name.</li>
<li>Be sure to ask for help when you need it. Discuss your plans with your attorney, physician or family members.</li>
<li>Don't leave your home unattended, or if you do, don't leave signs that you are not home, such as a note on the door. If you must be away for a long period, notify the police.</li>
<li>Don't leave cash, jewelry, or other valuables.</li>
<li>Don't accept personal care in return for the transfer or assignments of your property or assets, unless a lawyer, advocate or another trusted person acts as a witness to the transaction.</li>
<li>Don't sign a document unless someone you trust has reviewed it, and don't allow anyone to keep details of your finances or property <a>management</a> from you.</li>
