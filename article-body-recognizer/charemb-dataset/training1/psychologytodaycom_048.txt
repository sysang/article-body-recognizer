<h1> Herman Melville and the Question of Bipolar Disorder </h1>
<h2> Part III of a series examining Melville’s life and struggle with mental illness. </h2>
<li>The most common interpretation of Herman Melville's troubled life is that he experienced a form of bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>If there is an association of bipolar disorder with creativity, its frequency compared to the rarity of great art suggests other factors at work.</li>
<li>Creativity may be enhanced when symptoms of bipolar disorder ally with personality traits and the milieu of the times.</li>
<a>Part II</a> of this series, I described Herman Melville’s life, including his early years as a sailor in the South Pacific, his growing fame as a writer of adventure tales, his
<a>productivity</a> in which he was remarkably energetic, often euphoric, and grandiose. In this final installment, we will look at how his experience has been viewed in terms of mental illness.

<a>hypomanic</a> state, then edited later when euthymic or mildly depressed (1). At other times, he was profoundly depressed, which he likened to when a Catskill eagle descends into the "blackest gorges."
<h3>What bipolar illness could mean about Melville's work</h3>

<h1> What Does Bipolar Disorder Look Like? </h1>
<h2> Bipolar disorder may strain relationships and lower one's quality of life. </h2>
<ul> <li>There are four types of bipolar disorder.</li> <li>Not all individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience depressive states.</li> <li>Medication is typically required for effective maintenance of these disorders.</li> </ul>
<a>depression</a>, this is classified as Bipolar I. However, an episode of depression is not necessary in order to diagnose a person with this disorder If the swing between moods include depressive episodes, but the "highs" reflect
<a>hypomanic</a> behaviors, not full blown
<a>manic episodes</a>, this qualifies as Bipolar II. Cyclothymia is a type of this disorder that is defined by the presence of symptoms of both depression and mania that last for two or more years in adults.
<h3>What is it like to have bipolar disorder?</h3>
<a>substance abuse</a>; difficulty thinking through decisions and issues in a logical, lucid manner; and problems with anxiety. These individuals might also show unexpected reactions to
<h3>10 specific types of bipolar disorder</h3>
<p>Bipolar disorder can manifest in different ways, such as the following.</p>
<p><a>Anxious</a> distress: At least two symptoms of anxiety (worry, tenseness, restlessness, etc.) are present during a mood episode.</p>
<p>Mixed features: A mood episode reflects a mixture of both depressive and manic symptoms during the same period.</p>
<p>Melancholic features: This is characteristic of severe depression and would include symptoms such as weight loss, lack of interest in activities once found pleasurable, <a>insomnia</a> or early rising, and feelings of overwhelming <a>guilt</a>.</p>
<p>Atypical features: Unexpected symptoms are present, such as oversleeping, overeating, being super sensitive to rejection or criticism, and actually feeling worse during pleasurable activities.</p>
<p>Mood-congruent <a>psychotic</a> features: This describes the appearance of psychotic features, including delusions and hallucinations, that are clearly reflective of the current mood state.</p>
<p>Mood-incongruent psychotic features: Alternatively, some individuals may exhibit psychotic behaviors or experiences that are incongruent with their mood.</p>
<p>Catatonia: Hallmark symptoms of catatonia include unresponsiveness, muscle rigidity, restless and purposeless movements, and uncommunicativeness.</p>
<p>Peripartum onset: The disorder occurs shortly before or after childbirth; the <a>hormonal</a> changes some women experience can significantly affect mental health.</p>
<p>Seasonal pattern: Symptoms of the disorder may only show up during certain times of the year, typically when there is less daylight, much as seasonal affective disorder (SAD) shows up for some.</p>
<h3>What type of therapy works best?</h3>
<a>ketamine</a> might be an effective treatment for this form of depression as well as major depressive disorder. Ketamine infusions have shown great effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms and reducing
<a>suicidal</a> ideation and behavior. It also positively affects work
<a>productivity</a> and decreases days missed due to symptoms—important
<a>goals</a> for clients trying to manage this disorder and get their lives back on track.
<a>psychotherapy</a> as a treatment for this disorder, a meta-analysis of the literature (Miklowitz et al., 2021) revealed that
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy, family therapy, and psychoeducation contributed positively to treatment outcomes when combined with
<a>medication</a>. These forms of therapy are effective when the focus is on learning skills that help the client manage their illness or help families work together towards this goal.
<h3>Supporting someone you care about with bipolar disorder</h3>
<li>Be consistent in your interactions with them, and don’t give up just because they refuse support in one instance. Be patient and continue to show your willingness to be there for them.</li>
<a>sleeping</a>, encourage them to get rest to help them feel more in control of their lives. Work on small steps that can have significant positive effects.
<li>Let the person you care about know how caring for them is important to you and that it is hard for you when they turn down your offers of support. Let them know it’s hard for you to see them feeling less well than they might.</li>
<li>Seek the support you need so that you don’t <a>burn out</a> or grow so resentful of the individual that you can no longer offer them the care that you normally would.</li>

<h1> Holidays During the Pandemic </h1>
<h2> Ideas on how to get through this holiday season. </h2>
<ul> <li>Holidays are tough when you’re depressed, fatigued, ill, and uninterested in the busyness of the season.</li> <li>Pace yourself, do what you can, and learn to say “no” without feeling guilty. </li> </ul>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Preto Perola/Bigstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>guilt</a>, disappointment, and more stress, not pleasure.
<p>Be prepared that your decision might not sit well with others, make sure you reassure them that you love them and want to see them but that you have to limit your contact this year. </p>
<p>For those who are balancing <a>depression</a> or another mental health condition, think about where you are with your mental illness, and what you can do now for yourself and your family. </p>
<li>Take care of yourself. Maintain a regular schedule of daily activities, including diet-<a>nutrition</a>, sleep, exercise, and self-care. Try relaxation and self-soothing techniques. </li>
<li>Make an effort to connect with your own circle of friends, no matter how small. </li>
<li>Limit your exposure to any stressful or toxic activities, events, or person(s). </li>
<li>Enjoy the holiday food but don’t over-eat or drink and be sorry later. </li>
<li>Set out small <a>goals</a> for your holiday season, ones that are attainable. Break each one down into small steps. Create your own traditions. Keep it simple and you and others will enjoy it more. </li>
<li>Pace yourself, do what you can, and learn to say “no” without feeling guilty. </li>
<a>humor</a> to distract your mind, a funny book or movie can get you through these times.

<h1> Can Atypical Major Depression Signify Bipolar Disorder? </h1>
<h2> Part 5: Identifying and understanding major depression subtypes. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Depression? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome depression</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Atypical features include an ability to brighten in mood, oversleeping, and overeating.</li>
<li>Major depression with atypical features is the most associated form of depression in bipolar disorders.</li>
<li>Episodes of atypical features tend to be more chronic and have more severe symptoms. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Git Stephen Gitau/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Does Atypical Mean Rare?</h3>
<p>The term atypical features does not indicate it is uncommon. It is noted in the <a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, 5th edition (DSM-5), that:</p>
<a>appetite</a> loss; here, it's just the opposite.
<a>bipolar disorder</a> (Singh Williams, 2006; Barlow Durand, 2015, Buzuk et al., 2016). This, of course, does not mean that everyone with atypical features will develop bipolar disorder, however.
<p>Atypical features present an interesting MDD subtype. Aside from the ability to experience some level of a good mood, we also encounter the unusual symptom of leaden paralysis, like Barbara:</p>
<p>Thankfully, Jack had an understanding boss, and he could work from home on those days. Despite her feeling down, Barbara would maintain a level of brightness when Jack was home during these periods.</p>
<p>The official criteria for atypical features, according to the DSM-5, are as follows:</p>
<li>Mood reactivity must be present. Coupled with at least two of the following:</li>
<li>Excessive appetite/weight gain</li>
<li>Leaden paralysis is especially felt in the extremities.</li>
<li>A sense of interpersonal rejection that is present even when the person is not in a depressive episode</li>
<h3>Treatment Implications</h3>
<p>As with <a>melancholic features</a> and <a>anxious distress</a>, atypical features have special considerations for therapists and evaluators.</p>
<a>hypomanic</a> symptoms as we get to know the patient. As you're probably aware, bipolar disorders are highly correlated with
<a>suicide</a> risk. Also, as noted in Durand Barlow (2015), people with atypical features seem more apt to have co-occurring
<a>anxiety</a> disorders, compounding their misery. Imagine feeling weighted down to the point it is hard to move, as weight piles on from overeating, further sinking your
<a>self-esteem</a>. Add to this feeling no good to the point you believe the world is rejecting you, coupled with a co-occurring anxiety condition! Assessing for risk of suicide is very important in the presence of atypical features.

<a>psychiatry</a> is exceptionally important here. This is because of the significant hypersomnia, over-eating, and psychomotor abnormalities, symptoms that often respond well to
<a>medication</a>. Getting a patient to have the energy to attend
<a>therapy</a> is a big step. Curbing the appetite will help with self-esteem issues and managing the sugar spikes and crashes many seem to experience from indulging in comfort foods, which surely doesn't help the moodiness.

<p>It’s Halloween again. When thoughts turn to witches, ghosts, and fantastic creatures. The sorts of preternatural beings that make up the world of Harry Potter. And among them, one of my favorite characters: Remus Lupin.</p>
<p>Even in a world where it’s possible to voluntarily transform yourself into any animal you can imagine, werewolves still face prejudice and discrimination. In fact, J.K. Rowling <a>has stated</a> that:</p>
<a>intelligence</a>. He proved himself to be a talented and effective professor at Hogwarts who was highly regarded by many of his students before feeling forced to resign when news of his condition became public.
<p>Although Rowling envisioned the types of stigmatized illnesses symbolized by Lupin as “blood-borne conditions,” I think that Lupin also provides a particularly apt metaphor for <a>bipolar disorder</a>.</p>

<a>one or two cycles per year</a>. Medications such as lithium or Wolfsbane Potion can lessen the severity of the transformation, and going off of those medications can have

<a>fear</a>. For Lupin, the Boggart took the form of a
<a>drug abuse</a>, certain medications, relationship conflicts,
<a>hormonal</a> changes, or a change in the seasons. In other words, the form that my Boggart would take may be different from someone else with bipolar disorder.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Weird Tales (November 1941)/Wikimedia Commons.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Physical transformation</h3>
<a>someone with bipolar disorder</a> experiences changes in various neurotransmitter and hormone levels, such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and
<a>dopamine</a>. These changes affect an individual’s mental state, ability to sleep, and energy level, and can prompt extreme variations in weight and personal hygiene.
<p>And the physical transformation associated with lycanthropy results in an interesting aspect of Lupin’s character: He loves chocolate. Rowling has <a>stated that</a>:</p>
<a>happiness</a> out of their surroundings.
<p>However, chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, which are <a>toxic to canines</a>. So when Lupin eats chocolate, it not only provides him with an endorphin boost like the rest of us, but also allows him to savor his humanity.</p>
<p>So have a happy Halloween. And if you have bipolar disorder, try to find something that helps you remember that you are more than your disease. Find your chocolate.</p>

<h1> How to Be Overwhelmed by Happiness When You’re Bipolar </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Should I be worried that I'm so happy? </h2>
<li>People with bipolar disorder have to be vigilant about their moods, including joy.</li>
<li>Checking whether there are objective grounds for happiness can be a safeguard against mania.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder deserve to be overwhelmed by good emotions, just like everyone else.</li>
<p>When I write those words, they’re usually followed by a lengthy diatribe on depression. Not today. Today I’m overwhelmed by <a>happiness</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, that has me worried.</p>
<a>Bipolar disorder</a> is a great mimicker of moods—I know all too well that what feels like joy might actually be incipient
<a>mania</a>. When I want to fling open my arms to the universe and sing and dance for sheer delight, perhaps I should really be popping a pill and checking in with my psychiatrist.
<p>When I let a black cat cross my path and don’t once think how it reflects on my luck, perhaps I’ve let my guard down too far, and it’s time to fortify my mind against a cruel, cruel world. Perhaps.</p>
<a>attention</a>, beauty, and marvelous feeling that life is actually here to enjoy.
<a>education</a> he gave me, which lets me know what a celery root remoulade is or the difference between a Manet and a Monet. He made me feel safe and protected, and mental illness robs me of that feeling far too much of the time. I miss it.
<a>suicidal</a> or overtly symptomatic. Quality of life becomes an afterthought, not a primary goal. This isn’t right, nor do I think it’s necessary.

<p>In today's post, I've teamed up with mental health advocate <a>Gabe Howard</a>, who experiences the condition himself, to talk about some things he wishes people, especially providers, knew about bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>1. Besides that it is inaccurately perceived, what's the biggest misunderstanding about bipolar disorder that you've encountered?</p>
<p>2. What could treatment providers do better for bipolar patients?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>manic episode</a>. Then what? What about keeping stable? It shouldn't be, "You're stable now. Out you go." Getting stable is easy; keeping stability is the challenge and where the
<a>therapy</a> really is. Patients often aren't coached on developing a smoke alarm for sensing symptoms coming on. Or we don't want to because we've been stable, and thinking about being unstable is scary. It's
<a>denial</a>. Providers have to work with bipolar patients on accepting taking responsibility and that it is a lifestyle now to manage the illness.
<p>3. If you could drive home the most meddling thing about the bipolar experience you think providers need to understand, what is it?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Geralt/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>medication</a> kicks in, so be it. Then, the real work of keeping them stable can start, using the experience they're coming out of as fresh
<a>motivation</a> to work on lifestyle changes that can help keep episodes at bay, or developing a smoke alarm system to detect the tiniest signs an episode may be starting and seek out providers as soon as possible.

<p>Inside, I was alone in the large open room. Hidden speakers softly filled the air with the sound of monks chanting in Vietnamese. The walls and corners were awash in color, from brightly hued banners to vivid murals depicting sacred scenes.</p>

<p>Better yet, in case anyone reads that notebook I’d better obscure those thoughts by using mirror writing like Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know I could do that.</p>

<h2>Bipolar Disorder and Hyper-Religiosity </h2>
<p>Hyper-<a>religiosity</a> during mania is <a>experienced by many individuals with bipolar disorder</a>, and <a>can vary by country</a> with regard to the prevalence of religious vs. secular attitudes.</p>
<a>15%-22% of bipolar individuals with mania experience religious delusions</a>, such as thinking that demons are watching them or that they are Christ reborn. However, short of delusions, hyper-religiosity can be
<a>hard to identify among those actively practicing a faith</a>.

<p>Subsequent research has thrown cold water on such claims, instead supporting the idea that such a complex phenomenon as spirituality involves <a>networks of multiple brain areas responsible for different aspects of spiritual experiences</a>.</p>
<a>memory</a>, and still other parts of the frontal lobe and limbic structures are responsible for rational and emotional aspects of religious beliefs.
<a>cognition</a>, the difference between religion and spirituality when it comes to this type of research, and how religiosity in Parkinson’s Disease patients provides insight into the neurobiological basis of hyper-religiosity during bipolar mania.

<a>bipolar disorder</a>, one of the greatest concerns they have is losing their creative abilities. People with a bipolar condition adapt to mood swings by getting as much accomplished while manic, knowing that a period of
<a>depression</a> may be right around the corner.
<a>manic episodes</a>, an individual can feel tremendous energy and form intense ideas towards extreme
<a>productivity</a>. The prospect of blunting
<a>hypomania</a> that vaulted him to historical immortality.
<a>Psychoanalyst</a> and author Anthony Storr (1997) said of Churchill, “Had he been a stable and equable man, he could never have inspired the nation. In 1940, when all the odds were against Britain, a
<a>leader</a> of sober judgment might well have concluded that we were finished."
<a>fear</a> a loss of their creative juices, but also their entire sense of
<p>Though the prospect of doing away with depression may sound terrific, they will more likely fear becoming zombies in the process. The perceived loss of creativity and sense of identity through mania often keeps people away from bipolar treatment.</p>

<a>confidence</a> builds steadily. But when it comes to success for people with bipolar disorder, the story doesn’t just end with a pat on the back. Interestingly, attaining
<a>medication</a> may be too exciting to maintain. Perhaps the
<a>memory</a> of how good it feels to be creative, productive and high on life, can force a manic response in the brain that can break through barriers imposed by medication and previous cognitive changes brought by therapy.
