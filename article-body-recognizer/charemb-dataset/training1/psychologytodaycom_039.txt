<p>If only nourishment were a simple process: Get hungry, eat, get full, stop eating. In reality, an array of biochemicals sending signals between the brain and the body control both hunger and appetite, and the difference between the two is complex.</p>

<h2> What Creates Appetite? </h2>
<p>It may seem like the stomach is the arbiter of hunger, but the brain is calling the shots. It is important to remember that humans evolved under conditions of food scarcity, and that such scarcity prevailed for most of human history.</p>
<div> <h3> Which factors contribute to appetite? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does sleep influence appetite and weight? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What leads appetite to increase? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a> can lead to different eating patterns including increased appetite.

<div> <h3> Which mental health conditions are linked to appetite loss? </h3> </div>
<p>When people don’t eat due to concerns around weight and <a>body image</a>, it may be due to an <a>eating disorder</a> rather than appetite loss. (For more, see <a>Eating Disorders.</a>)</p>
<p>Appetite loss can also be a side effect of medications for mental health conditions, such as <a>Adderall</a> or Ritalin for ADHD and Prozac for depression.</p>
<div> <h3> Is appetite loss a sign of depression? </h3> </div>
<a>dieting</a>. People who are depressed often lose interest and pleasure in eating, similar to the absence of
<a>motivation</a> overall. Additionally, some believe that the condition may blunt physiological taste sensitivity, another pathway for
<a>appetite loss in depression.</a> (However, the opposite relationship can also occur—significant weight gain can be a symptom of depression.)
<div> <h3> Which physical conditions can result in appetite loss? </h3> </div>
<p>A cold, flu, or stomach bug</p>
<p>• Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Crohn's disease</p>
<p>• <a>Pregnancy</a></p>
<div> <h3> Why do people lose their appetite when they’re sick? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Illnesses can strip people of the desire to eat, because immune cells release proteins called <a>cytokines that suppress appetite</a> and encourage rest. The body can then marshall all of its resources to fight off the infection.</p> </div>

<a>personality disorder</a>. Biological factors probably create vulnerability to the disorder within certain individuals, and experiences such as sleep deprivation can kick off
<a>hypomania</a>, a mania that is mild to moderate and does not normally require hospital care.
<h2> Signs of Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<a>depression</a> can be abrupt, and moods can oscillate rapidly. But while an episode of mania is what distinguishes bipolar disorder from depression, a person may spend far more time in a depressed state than in a manic or
<a>creativity</a>. As a result, a person experiencing it may deny that anything is wrong. There is great variability in manic symptoms, but features may include increased energy, activity, and restlessness; euphoric mood and extreme
<a>optimism</a>; extreme irritability; racing thoughts, unusually fast speech, or thoughts that jump from one idea to another; distractibility and lack of
<a>concentration</a>; decreased need for sleep; an unrealistic belief in one's abilities and ideas; poor judgment; reckless behavior including spending sprees and dangerous driving, or risky and increased
<a>sexual</a> drive; provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior; and

<div> <h3> What age does bipolar disorder tend to develop? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can people recognize bipolar disorder in children and adolescents? </h3> </div>
<a>Children with bipolar disorder</a> undergo extreme changes in mood and behavior, feeling unusually happy and energetic during
<a>manic episodes</a> and becoming very sad and less active during depressive episodes. Manic episodes may involve increased energy, distractibility, grandiosity, and inability to sleep while depressive episodes may involve
<a>self-harm</a> or suicidal thoughts and gestures, which should be taken seriously.
<p>One key factor: bipolar is episodic while other disorders are pervasive. For example, bipolar symptoms come and go in mood swings, while disorders like ADHD tend to be more consistent if left untreated.</p>

<p>People often struggle with unidentified and untreated bipolar disorder for years. In fact, about two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed before bipolar is discovered.</p>

<h2> Causes of Bipolar Disorder </h2>
