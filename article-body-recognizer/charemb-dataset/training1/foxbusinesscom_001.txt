<h1>12 lenders to consider for student loan consolidation</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>If you have multiple student loans and want an easier way to keep track of your payments — or get a better rate — consolidating your student loans may be an option for you. </p></div></div></div>
<p>If you have high-interest student loan debt or are juggling multiple payments, consolidating your student loans into just one loan (ideally with a better interest rate) may seem pretty appealing. </p>
<a><u>refinance</u> </a>to consolidate federal student loans into private ones, you’ll lose valuable federal protections.
<p>Multiple consolidation options are available. Which is right for you can depend on many factors, including whether your debt is federal student loans, private student loans, or a combination of both. </p>
<p>Let’s look at how to consolidate student loans, what the pros and cons are, and alternative repayment options you may want to consider. </p>
<h2>What is student loan consolidation?</h2>
<a><u>lower your monthly payment </u></a>if you consolidate into a loan with a longer repayment term. Or, it could reduce your total interest costs if you consolidate into a loan with a lower interest rate and/or shorter repayment term.
<p>You can consolidate loans in two ways:</p>
<h2>Consolidating federal student loans</h2>
<li>Simplify loan repayment with a single loan and one monthly bill and replace variable rates with a fixed rate</li>
<li>Lower monthly payments by extending repayment period</li>
<li>Can gain access to additional income-driven repayment plan options and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</li>
<li>Can pay more in interest if you increase your repayment period</li>
<li>Outstanding interest from original loans becomes a part of your principal balance</li>
<li>May lose credit for payments made toward income-driven repayment plan forgiveness or PSLF on existing loans</li>
<p>Who it might be good for: Borrowers with multiple federal student loans who want to simplify their monthly payments. </p>
<h2>Refinancing to consolidate private student loans</h2>
<p>You can refinance to consolidate private student loans (or a combination of federal and private loans) through a private lender.</p>
<u>refinance your private student loans</u>
<li>If you have good credit you may be able to get a lower interest rate and <a><u>save money</u></a></li>
<li>May be able to choose a repayment period that works better for you</li>
<li>Parents who helped their children pay for school by taking out loans on their behalf can transfer the debt to their child (with permission from both parties)</li>
<ul><li>No guarantees you'll get better terms than you currently have</li><li>Applying with a cosigner is difficult</li><li>Lose access to federal loan forgiveness programs, income-driven repayment plans, and deferment and forbearance options</li></ul>
<p>Who it might be good for: Borrowers with private student loans who can get a better interest rate by consolidating. </p>
<p>You can <a><u>compare student loan rates</u></a> on Credible to see if refinancing might be right for you.</p>

<h2>What are the requirements for consolidating student loan debt?</h2>
<p>To <a><u>consolidate federal student loans</u></a>, you must meet certain requirements.</p>
<li>Only certain federal loans are eligible. While most federal loans are eligible for consolidation, there are exceptions.</li>
<li>Grace period or active repayment status is key. Any loans must be in repayment or in the grace period to be eligible for consolidation.</li>
<p>To consolidate private student loans, you’ll generally have to meet the new lender’s qualifications, which can include:</p>
<li>Credit score — Having a poor credit score can limit your consolidation options and lead to less desirable terms and interest rates.</li>
<li>Income — Being able to demonstrate a steady and solid income can help assure a lender that you’ll repay your new loan.</li>
<li>Payment history — Having a history of making on-time payments not only boosts your credit score but affects your consolidation options.</li>
<li>Cosigner — Applying for student loan consolidation with a cosigner may help you gain access to consolidation if your credit score is on the lower side.</li>
<h2>What are the pros and cons of student loan consolidation?</h2>
<p>There are both advantages and disadvantages to consolidating federal and private student loans that you should consider:</p>
<ul><li>Can access more favorable repayment terms</li><li>If you get a lower interest rate, you can save money</li><li>Paying one monthly loan payment can feel more manageable than paying multiple loans</li></ul>
<li>Consolidating federal loans into a private loan causes you to lose access to federal protections and repayment programs</li>
<li>There’s no guarantee you’ll get a more advantageous interest rate or repayment term</li>
<li>Extending your repayment period when consolidating can lead to spending more in interest over the years</li>
<p>If you want to <a><u>consolidate your student loan debt</u></a>, use Credible to compare rates and shop around.</p>
<h2>When not to consolidate your student loans</h2>
<p>Consolidating student loans can come with some major benefits, but even so, consolidating may not always be the right fit for you. You may want to reconsider consolidating your student loans if any of the following applies:</p>
<li>You have federal loans but don’t qualify for a federal consolidation loan and will lose benefits and protections by consolidating into a private loan.</li>
<li>Consolidating or refinancing to consolidate will give you a higher interest rate than you currently have.</li>
<li><a><u>Consolidating or refinancing</u> </a>will lead to you having a significantly longer term that will make your loan more expensive in the long run.</li>
<li>Making your new loan payments will be a struggle and your current loan is a better fit financially. </li>
<h2>Alternative ways to manage student loan monthly payments</h2>
<p>If you decide that consolidating your student loans isn’t right you, you may want to pursue an alternative way to manage your student loan debt. </p>
<li>Deferment or forbearance — These options can help you suspend student loan payments (if you’re eligible), although interest will still accrue during this time period.</li>
<li>Income-driven repayment plan — An income-driven repayment plan takes your income and family size into account when determining how much you should pay each month. </li>
<li>Loan forgiveness and cancellation — Student loan forgiveness or cancellation happen when you aren’t required to make loan payments because of your job.</li>

<p>Frequently asked questions about personal loans</p>
<p>Here are some answers to a few commonly asked questions regarding personal loans:</p>
<p>Can you get a personal loan with bad credit?</p>
<p>Yes, there are several lenders that offer $10,000 personal loans to borrowers with bad credit. However, keep in mind that <a>personal loans for bad </a><a>credit </a>typically come with higher interest rates compared to good credit loans.</p>
<p>How fast can you get a personal loan?</p>

<ul><li>Online lenders: Less than five business days</li><li>Banks and credit unions: One to seven business days</li></ul>
<p>Online lenders are usually the quickest option — many offer approval decisions within minutes, which can help speed up the loan funding time. Some online lenders even offer next-day or <a>same-day loans</a> if you’re approved. </p>
<p>What can a personal loan be used for?</p>
<p>You can use a personal loan for almost any personal expense (though some lenders might have some restrictions). For example, you could get a personal loan to cover <a>debt consolidation</a>, medical bills, <a>home improvements</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you might not be able to use a personal loan to pay for business ventures or post-secondary school expenses. Make sure to read the terms first so you know how you can use your loan.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to <a>shop for a personal loan</a>, remember to compare as many lenders as you can to find the right loan for you. Credible makes this easy — you can compare your prequalified rates from multiple lenders in two minutes.</p>

<h1>Why is it important to have good credit?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>A good credit score can make borrowing easier and more affordable. It can also reduce the cost of insurance and make it easier to find an apartment. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>A good credit score is important. Many companies check your credit, from mortgage lenders to <a>insurance companies </a>to landlords. If your score is low, you may not be able to borrow money or live where you'd like. Or you may pay more for loans.</p>
<a>monitor your credit score for free</a> and to
<a>increase it if necessary</a>. Your credit score can
<a>change quickly</a> if you embrace responsible borrowing behavior and
<a>remove inaccurate information</a>. It's worth taking these steps due to the importance of good credit.
<p>It's important to know where your credit score is at in order to know what steps to take to improve it. You can <a>visit Credible to check your credit score for free without negatively impacting it.</a></p>
<p><a>WHAT IS CREDIT MONITORING, AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</a></p>
<p>Why is having a good credit score important?</p>
<p>A good credit score is important for five key reasons</p>
<li>Having good credit gives you a choice of borrowing options</li>
<li>A good credit score makes borrowing cheaper</li>
<li>Landlords check your credit score</li>
<li>Your credit score affects insurance rates</li>
<li>Employers check your credit score</li>
<p>What is a good credit score?</p>
<p>There are actually different types of credit scores, but FICO scores are the most common score used by many lenders. FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores representing better credit and lower scores showing bad credit.</p>
<p>A score of 300 to 579 would be considered very poor; while scores between 580 and 669 are fair. Good scores are between 670 and 739, while very good scores range from 740 to 799. Finally, scores above 800 are classified as excellent credit.</p>
<p>You can <a>visit Credible to check your credit score for free</a> to see if you have bad credit, excellent credit or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Is it important to watch my credit score consistently?</p>
<p>Keeping tabs on your credit is important.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to check your score at least once every few months, if not more often. You can <a>visit Credible to learn more about credit monitoring</a> and find out how best to keep track of changes in your credit history.</p>
<p><a>IS IT WORTH PAYING FOR CREDIT MONITORING?</a></p>
<p>How can I quickly raise my credit score?</p>
<li>Becoming an authorized user: When someone adds you as an authorized user to a credit card with a long, positive payment history, the credit card history shows up on your credit report and improves your own credit record.</li>

<h1>This loan type is popular with homeowners — but it comes with a huge risk</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>A HELOC could be a risky choice for some homeowners. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>You may enjoy the flexibility that a HELOC offers. You would have access to a large sum of cash but only repay what you use, and you don’t pay interest on any money you don’t use.</p>
<p>While a home equity line of credit could potentially be a great emergency fund option, there are some significant risks and downsides you should understand before you make your decision.</p>
<li>It uses your home as collateral: The most significant risk is that a HELOC uses your home as collateral. That means if you fall behind on your payments and you’re unable to catch up, you could lose your house.</li>
<li>The interest rates can change: <a>HELOCs have variable interest rates</a>, which means the interest rate can change when federal interest rates go up. A HELOC will likely have a higher monthly payment than other borrowing options.</li>
<p>Finally, if you’re not responsible, you could spend a lot more money than you planned or than you can afford.</p>
<a>view personal loan options via Credible</a>. With a HELOC, you can use the borrowed money for anything — from home renovations to unexpected medical expenses.
<p><a>HOME EQUITY LOAN VS. HELOC: WHICH IS BETTER?</a></p>
<h2>Here's what you can try instead</h2>
<p>If you’re in a financial pinch, other options may be better for you. You’ll want to consider your current financial situation to determine which of these three alternatives could be best.</p>
<ol><li>Cash-out refinance</li><li>Personal loans</li><li>0% APR credit cards</li></ol>
<a>Use an online marketplace like Credible to view refinance rates</a> and get cash out to pay off high-interest debt.
<p><a>HOW DOES A CASH-OUT REFINANCE AFFECT TAXES?</a></p>
<p>If you need money quickly, a personal loan might be a better option than a HELOC or cash-out-refinance since lenders can approve funds within a few days.</p>
<p>Since you won’t have any form of collateral for a personal loan, your interest rates are likely to be a bit higher. Make sure to <a>visit Credible to find the best loan rates</a>.</p>

<h1>4 ways to get lower mortgage refinance rates</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>The best rates are reserved for the least risky borrowers. Here’s how to make sure you fall into that category. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Mortgage rates have dropped to <a>record-breaking lows</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic, creating a massive opportunity for existing homeowners — especially ones who are struggling financially.</p>
<p>Are you considering saving money by refinancing your mortgage loan? Start by exploring your refinance options with a tool like Credible. You can <a>compare rates and lenders with one click</a>.</p>
<p>Follow the below tips to ensure you get the best mortgage and refinance rates possible.</p>
<p>Not everyone will qualify for the market’s lower rates, so you may need to put in some work to ensure you get the best deal. Here are four ways you can increase your chances of getting a bargain-basement rate (and <a>save the most cash</a>):</p>
<ol><li>Compare rates, closing costs and terms of several mortgage lenders</li><li>Pay down your debts</li><li>Improve your credit score</li><li>Lower your DTI</li></ol>
<h3>1. Compare rates, closing costs and terms of several mortgage lenders</h3>
<p>Rates, terms, and fees vary widely from one mortgage lender to the next, so comparing several options is critical. In fact, according to Freddie Mac, getting at least five quotes can save you a whopping $5,000 in the long run.</p>
<a>using a rate-shopping tool like Credible can streamline this process and compare rates and multiple offers</a> at once. It's 100% free — and doesn't impact your credit score, so you can determine if it's time to refinance with ease.

<p><a>HOW TO PAY OFF DEBT FAST</a></p>
<h3>3. Improve your credit score</h3>
<p>The best mortgage loan rates are reserved for those with the best credit scores — think 760 and above. If saving money is your goal, you're going to want to make sure you fit the criteria.</p>
<p>If you're confident in your credit score, then <a>plug in some of your information into Credible's free online tool</a> to find out what kind of mortgage and refinance rates you qualify for.</p>
<p>If your credit score is on the cusp, consider taking the time to <a>boost it</a> before applying for your refinance. Follow these tips to raise your credit score and meet your financial goals:</p>
<ul><li>Pay off some debts</li><li>Report any errors on your credit report</li><li>Ask for a credit line increase (but don’t use it)</li><li>Settle any overdue accounts</li></ul>
<p>Be sure not to take out any new debts, either. This will only hurt your score — and your chances at a low mortgage refinance rate.</p>
<p><a>WHAT CREDIT SCORE DO YOU NEED TO BUY A HOUSE?</a></p>
<p>Your <a>debt-to-income ratio</a> — or how much of your monthly take-home pay your debts account for — plays a big role in your mortgage offers. It determines what loan products you’re eligible for, as well as what rates you get.</p>
<p>If you’re a homeowner, <a>compare mortgage and refinance rates with Credible</a> to see if you can save, but don’t forget about closing costs, which could neutralize any savings you gain from a lower monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p><a>MORTGAGE REFINANCES ARE BOOMING — HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW</a></p>
<h2>What are today’s mortgage rates?</h2>
<p><a>Today’s mortgage rates</a> are at historic lows, hovering under 3% since at least July. As of mid-October, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan is just 2.625%, according to Freddie Mac.</p>

<h1>Refinance for debt consolidation: pros, cons, and what to know</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, refinancing for debt consolidation can make it easier to tackle your debt. But there are also risks involved.</p></div></div></div>
<p>In almost any comparison, a mortgage APR is lower than a credit card APR. When mortgage rates are low, you may think it’s a no-brainer to use your home’s equity to pay off credit card debt that has a double-digit APR. </p>
<p>But proceed with caution. Refinancing for debt consolidation comes with significant risks, as well as benefits. Let’s examine what it looks like to refinance for debt consolidation.</p>
<h2>Refinancing for debt consolidation: How it works</h2>
<p><a>Refinancing for debt consolidation</a> works just like any other refinance. You’ll have to apply, qualify, go through the closing process, and pay closing costs. </p>
<p>You should shop around when refinancing a mortgage to make sure you get the <a><u>best rates</u></a> and terms possible. If you’ve improved your credit since you took out your first home loan, you may qualify for more favorable terms.</p>
<p>You can <a><u>compare cash-out refinance offers</u> </a>from multiple lenders when you use Credible.</p>
<h2>Is a cash-out refinance for debt consolidation a good idea?</h2>
<p>Whether or not a cash-out refinance for debt consolidation is a good idea depends on your unique financial situation. Consider these factors when deciding:</p>
<a><u>make sure you can afford your new mortgage payments</u></a>. Ideally, even if your new monthly mortgage payment is higher than your original payment, your total debt payments will drop, leaving you more funds available to put toward your mortgage.
<li>Your ability to qualify for a better interest rate and terms — If you can’t qualify for a lower interest rate, you may end up paying pricey closing costs with little or no real financial benefit. </li>
<li>How long it will take to realize savings — You should also consider how long you’ll have to pay on the loan until your savings cover the closing costs you paid. </li>
<h2>Pros and cons of a debt consolidation mortgage</h2>
<p>Like every financial decision, tapping your home equity to pay off high-interest debt has <a><u>advantages and disadvantages</u></a>. Before refinancing to consolidate debt, here are some things you’ll want to consider:</p>
<h3>Pros of refinancing for debt consolidation</h3>
<a><u>APR</u></a>), you’ll save money by paying off your loan faster and making fewer interest payments.
<h3>Cons of refinancing for debt consolidation</h3>
<li>You’ll pay closing costs and other expenses. When you refinance, you need to fund lawyer fees, appraisal costs, and closing expenses. </li>
<li>Your income must be stable. Because your home is on the line, you won’t want to refinance for debt consolidation unless you’re confident you can afford it. If your income is unstable in any way, you may want to reconsider refinancing. </li>
<li>You need to stay put for awhile. Refinancing won’t save you as much money if you plan to move in the near future. You have to live in your home long enough to balance out paying the closing costs. </li>
<h2>How debt consolidation can affect your credit score</h2>
<p>Debt consolidation’s affect on your credit score depends on a variety of factors. </p>
<li>Credit inquiries — When you apply for credit, the lender will perform a hard inquiry, which generally knocks a few points off your credit score. But this impact will lessen fairly quickly.</li>
<li>Average age of accounts — When you open up a new credit account, the average age of your credit accounts drops. The older your credit accounts are, the more your credit score will benefit. </li>
<u>consolidate credit card debt</u>
<p>You can <a><u>compare mortgage refinance rates</u></a> and prequalify without affecting your credit when you use Credible.</p>
<h2>5 alternatives to refinancing for debt consolidation</h2>
<p>If you decide that refinancing for debt consolidation isn’t the right fit for you, you do have other options to help <a><u>get your debt under contro</u>l</a>. </p>
<h3>Consolidate with a personal loan</h3>
<h3>0% APR balance transfer credit card</h3>
<h3>Retirement account loan</h3>
<p>You may be able to borrow money from your 401(k) — without having to worry about a credit check. The interest rate is generally pretty low on retirement account loans, and your payments will be deducted from your paychecks. </p>
<a><u>approved credit counseling agencies</u> </a>to vet any credit counselor you’re thinking of working with.
<p>When you’re ready to refinance your mortgage, Credible makes it easy to compare rates and <a><u>prequalify for a mortgage refinance</u></a> in just minutes.</p>

<h1>Calculate your debt-to-income ratio and find out where you stand</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>Understanding your debt-to-income ratio is key to improving your credit. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>The <a>debt-to-income</a> ratio is defined by what portion of a person’s monthly <a>income</a> is devoted to payments for debt such as <a>credit cards</a> or student loans.</p>
<p>“It is used as an indicator of indebtedness and how tight your budget might possibly be,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, a New York-based financial data provider.</p>
<p>A debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is calculated by taking a person’s monthly <a>debt payments</a> and dividing the total by the monthly income.</p>
<p><a>CREDIT CARD VS. PERSONAL LOAN: WHICH ONE IS A BETTER OPTION?</a></p>
<a>mortgage</a>, said Bruce McClary, spokesperson for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization.
<p>Figures in the 25 percent and 40 percent range are generally considered good while anything above 43 percent can cause issues when applying for certain types of mortgage loans, he said.</p>
<p>Here are some ways for consumers to lower their ratio if it's too high:</p>
<p><a>HOW STUDENT LOANS CAN AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE</a></p>
<li>Work out a plan to quickly pay down your debt. The best way is to focus on the high-interest debt that is costing the most to carry, McClary said. Make extra payments if you can or pay more than the minimum payment.</li>
<a>budget</a> that allows for sufficient saving and financial wiggle room.”
<li>Refinance into lower interest rates that will reduce your monthly payments. </li>
<li>Avoid taking on more debt, such as making large purchases.</li>
<li>Check your debt-to-income ratio on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Lower your discretionary spending such as driving on toll roads, eating out, streaming services or entertainment such as concert tickets.</li>
<li>Use your <a>tax refund</a> to pay down your debt and avoid spending it on a vacation or buying something you may not need.</li>

<h1>Are my mortgage closing costs tax-deductible?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>Mortgage closing costs can be expensive, but these five in particular could be tax-deductible.</p></div></div></div>
<p>As a firsttime homebuyer, you may be surprised by how expensive real estate can be. In addition to purchasing a house itself, homeowners have to plan to pay closing costs, which usually cost between 3% and 6% of the total loan amount.</p>
<p><a>WHAT IS A GOOD INTEREST RATE ON A HOME MORTGAGE?</a></p>
<p>When it comes to mortgage write-offs, homeowners can take advantage of tax deductions on their property taxes and mortgage interest. However, you may be surprised to learn how many of your closing costs fall under this umbrella.</p>
<p>5 mortgage closing costs that are tax-deductible</p>
<p>Let’s look at five mortgage closing costs that are tax-deductible for home buyers. And if you’re looking to explore your mortgage options, be sure to <a>visit Credible </a>to compare loan rates and mortgage lenders.</p>
<p>1. Loan origination fee and mortgage points</p>
<p>Mortgage points are any fees and charges you paid to purchase the home. Points can include things like origination charges, discount points, and maximum loan charges. </p>
<p><a>The IRS considers mortgage points</a> to be prepaid interest, and they may be tax-deductible if you itemize your deductions. However, mortgage points must meet the following requirements to be tax-deductible:</p>
<li>You used the mortgage points for your primary place of residence</li>
<li>Paying mortgage points is an established business practice in the area you bought the home</li>
<li>The points fall within the normal range for that area</li>
<li>The total amount of points paid is listed on your settlement statement</li>
<p>To learn more about your options for mortgage loans, be sure to visit <a>Credible to compare lenders and mortgage rates</a>.</p>
<p><a>WHAT ARE MORTGAGE POINTS – AND HOW DO THEY WORK?</a></p>
<p>Sometimes a portion of your <a>mortgage interest </a>is paid during the closing, and these costs would be tax-deductible. You can continue to deduct your mortgage interest payments every year as long as you own that home. </p>
<a>IRS does put limits</a> on how much you can deduct in property taxes per year. Married couples can deduct up to $10,000 per year in property taxes or $5,000 if you’re married and filing separately.
<p>If you purchased a home and either forgo paying a down payment or paid less than 20%, most lenders will require that you take out private mortgage insurance (PMI). On average, PMI costs between 0.5% and 1.5% of the total loan amount. </p>
<p>Whether or not PMI is tax-deductible really depends on the current tax year. For 2020, PMI is considered tax-deductible. But Congress routinely changes this, so it’s unclear whether PMI will be tax-deductible in 2021.</p>
<p><a>WHAT IS PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</a></p>
<p>You can use this <a>mortgage calculator </a>to determine your rates and fees and how much you can expect to pay on your monthly payments.</p>
<p>5. Distressed property expenses</p>
<p>And finally, if you recently bought a distressed property, some of your expenses for maintaining or improving the property may be tax-deductible. For instance, if you had to pay for any back taxes or repairs, these items may be tax-deductible. </p>

<h1>You can refinance your home with no closing costs — but there's a major downside</h1>
<p>Mortgage refinancing is a common option if you’re looking to <a>lower your monthly payment</a> or save money on interest. However, there is also a sum of upfront expenses you’ll have to cover first in the form of new closing costs.</p>
<p>Some mortgage lenders offer what’s called a no closing cost mortgage. If you’re thinking "what’s the catch?" along with whether this would be a wise option for you, here’s what you need to know about no closing cost refinance options.</p>
<h2>What is a no-closing cost refinance?</h2>
<p>Before you decide to refinance your mortgage, make sure you do your research. <a>Credible can take you step-by-step through the refinancing process</a> to ensure you find the best deals available for your personal finance.</p>
<p><a>WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE WHILE RATES ARE LOW</a></p>
<h2>Major drawback of no-closing cost refinance</h2>
<p>Aside from potentially higher monthly payments, the major drawback is you probably won’t get the best loan terms even if your credit score is great. You could get stuck with a higher interest rate and you will have a higher principal loan balance.</p>
<h3>There are also some costs and fees</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how this might add up with a no closing cost mortgage. If you refinance your home with a principal of $225,000 and closing costs are $7,000, this amount would just get added to your loan for a new principal total of $232,000.</p>
<a>Using Credible’s Mortgage Repayment calculator</a>, you can see by refinancing a $225,000 mortgage to a 15-year term with a 3.5% interest rate, you’d pay $64,527 in interest. You can also
<a>use Credible's free online marketplace to compare rates and lenders</a> instantly.
<p>Let’s say you go with a no closing cost refinance where your lender will:</p>
<ul><li>Add the $7,000 closing cost total to your principal loan balance</li><li>Increase your interest rate to 4.5%</li></ul>
<p>This could leave you paying $87,461 in interest over the 15-year term instead. <a>Visit Credible to get prequalified rates</a> without impacting your credit score.</p>
<p><a>WHO'S EXEMPT FROM THE NEW MORTGAGE REFINANCE FEE?</a></p>
<h2>Is a no closing cost mortgage refinance right for you?</h2>
<p>The key benefit is you won’t have to pay closing costs on your new mortgage loan upfront. While you will still pay extra costs down the line, you don’t have to worry about gathering the liquid funds to do so in order to secure your refinance.</p>
<a>Crunch the numbers using Credible's free online tools</a>.
<p><a>REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE BEFORE RECORD LOW RATES DISAPPEAR</a></p>
<h2>Other mortgage refinance options</h2>
<p>If you’re leaning away from a no closing cost mortgage refinance, here are some other options.</p>
<a>type of mortgage</a> but are looking to refinance to a conventional mortgage? Doing so is easy if you have good credit, equity in your home and can cover closing costs. Refinancing from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage can also save you a ton of money.
<li>FHA Streamline: An FHA streamline refinance requires less paperwork (often no new appraisal on the home is needed) so you’ll save money on closing costs and can obtain a new home loan with a lower interest rate quickly. </li>
