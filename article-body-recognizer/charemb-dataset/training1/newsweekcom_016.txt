<p>Books authored by the 47-year-old suspect in the Denver and Lakewood shootings—which contain racist rants and a mass shooting sequence similar to Monday's attacks—are still available for purchase on <a>Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Sanction, written by Lyndon James McLeod under the pen name Roman McClay, is a science fiction trilogy that is available in paperback and Kindle formats.</p>
<p>The books, which were published between 2018 and 2020, have remained on the e-commerce giant's website two days after their author killed five people and was subsequently shot dead by a police officer.</p>
<p>According to its <a>Amazon</a> listing, the first book, Sanction I, ranked number 16 in Genetic Engineering Science Fiction and number 50 in Dystopian Fiction.</p>
<p>Newsweek examined passages of the books, which feature a man named Lyndon as a protagonist. In Sanction II, published in 2019, the character commits a mass shooting, which McLeod described vividly and with morbid enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Lyndon then shoots and kills a woman and two dogs in the home portion of the building, before heading to the tattoo studio, where he kills a pair of tattoo artists, two seated clients, and an additional man.</p>
<p>This sequence closely resembles certain events in Monday's shooting spree.</p>
<p>At least four people were shot in two Colorado tattoo shops that afternoon. The first was in Denver, where the suspect killed two women and injured one man.</p>
<p>In nearby Lakewood, the shooter killed 38-year-old tattoo artist Danny Scofield at Lucky 13 Tattoo Parlor.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Amazon for comment.</p>
<p>That character also mentions the prospect of a "race war," which he said will occur so long as white men are prevented from "defending their women; their own honor."</p>
<p>Yet in the first few passages of Sanction III, McLeod had a character ponder about "the things women won't admit about rape, that it slakes, that it enthralls, that—if done by a certain type of man—they don't hate it at all."</p>
<p>While McLeod's works have since garnered negative reviews spurred by the shooting, both good and bad reviews on Sanction I posted prior to the tragedy lifted the veil on concerning content espoused in the book.</p>
<p>"I don't strongly identify with democrats or republicans on a lot of things and I enjoy a strong critique of both," read a negative review written in January 2020. "But this book is packed full of rants on diversity, women, and globalization."</p>
<p>"SANCTION is an epic, visceral journey into the dark heart of every man broken by society; chewed up and spit out," wrote another satisfied reviewer.</p>
<p>One Amazon user gave more details about the first book's premise in a February 2020 review, revealing McLeod's portrayal of himself as a homicidal anti-hero.</p>
<p>"An epic story about the human condition. It's about artificial intelligence. It's about the emasculation of the alpha male," another wrote that same month. "A war is coming and pain demands a response. Viva la Roman McClay."</p>
<p>The book's first words—"Pain demands a response"—capture McLeod's belief in "male honor violence," i.e. violent retribution towards those who have shown perceived disrespect.</p>
<p>The shooting suspect's extremist ideologies, such as glorifying violence, misogyny and firearms, has been apparent from his <a>Twitter</a> account, which made use of his pen name.</p>
<p>Authorities believe all but one of the victims targeted by McLeod were "known to him," either personally or professionally.</p>
