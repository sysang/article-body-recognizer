<p>By far the biggest attraction in Pelican Town is its prosperous farming industry. You can find all the tools, seeds and machinery needed to fulfill your agrarian adventures. Pierre’s General Store is a good first stop to stock up on items.</p>
<p>Although Pelican Town is generally a quiet destination, you should plan your trip around its famous festivals, such as winter’s Festival of Ice, or the grand, beachside feast known as Luau in the summer.</p>
<h2>For shopping and food lovers</h2>
<h4>Tokyo from ‘Persona 5’</h4>
<p>Immerse yourself in Japanese culture as you drink in the sights and sounds of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Check out the local youths that frequent the arcade in Akihabara. You can even try your hand at the crane game to grab a little something to bring back home.</p>
<p>For food, you should visit the beef bowl shop, as well as the ramen shop in Ogikubo. You can spend your evenings bar hopping through Shinjuku, where you may cross paths with a reporter who frequents the bar Crossroads.</p>
<p>If you want to kick back and savor a drink or two, pop into the jazz club. And here’s another hot tip: On nights when the resident singer performs, the club offers a two-for-one drink special.</p>
<h4>Toussaint from ‘The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’</h4>
<p>One word of caution for any adventure seekers: Steer clear of the Tesham Mutna Ruins, once used by ancient vampires to farm humans like cattle for their blood. Rumor has it one vampire still resides there, trapped by their bloodlust.</p>
<h4>Greece from ‘Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’</h4>
<p>Be mindful when you’re gawking at your surroundings — pickpockets abound! And you’d do well to stay away from shady characters sporting cowls; you never know what they have up their sleeve.</p>
<p>Hunting is also a popular activity, particularly searching for predators like bears and boars. If you’re feeling particularly daring, try tracking down some two-legged game by targeting those marked by a bounty.</p>

<div>August 7, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDT</div>
<div><div><p>It might be 2021, but the Virginia GOP hopes it’ll begin to feel more like 2009.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That was the last year Virginia Republicans won statewide, as Robert F. McDonnell took the Executive Mansion in an 18-point landslide.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>— crucial to a statewide win —
<b> </b>backed McDonnell that year. But in the dozen
<b> </b>years since, Northern Virginia has become much bigger and bluer, posing a daunting challenge to any Republican running statewide.
<div><div><p>“I do think Northern Virginia is a steeper climb now than it was for me,” McDonnell said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even that<b> </b>could be a challenge after a dozen years of demographic shifts favoring Democrats, compounded by four years of intense opposition among suburban moderates to President Donald<b> </b>Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However it’s defined, Northern Virginia has been leaning ever more left — and the population is<b> </b>growing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A gradual change</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>In Virginia governor’s race, a raging debate about education takes center stage</p></div>
<div><p>Since statewide margins were in line with the nation’s before 2016, this fall’s governor’s race could reveal whether Virginia has undergone a lasting political realignment or merely experienced an anti-Trump spasm.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I often describe Virginia as a purple state with a bluish hue,” Skelley said. “This will be an interesting test of just how purple it is.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Northern Virginia was still swing territory in McDonnell’s day. The region handed Barack Obama 60 percent of its vote in the<b> </b>2008 presidential election, then turned around the next year to give McDonnell 52 percent.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Greater sway over the state</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>Immigrants, like other minority groups, have traditionally favored Democrats, although Trump made inroads with them in 2020.
<div><div><p>Republicans missed a chance to cultivate those groups while<b> </b>they were newcomers to the exurbs during the late 1990s, said Mark J. Rozell, dean of George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Back then, the conventional thinking was that the GOP would dominate those areas while the inner suburban communities would continue to trend blue.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Regardless of outcome, Virginia lieutenant governor’s race will make history</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Some of the changes, people didn’t realize were happening and they happened so quickly,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The percentage of<b> </b>people with at least a bachelor’s degree<b> </b>— another group that favors Democrats —<b> </b>steadily climbed in the region to 57 percent during that decade.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hamilton Lombard, a demographer with the Weldon Cooper Center, said the Democratic Party’s gains in the region mirror what has happened in suburban areas across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Making up the difference</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia, meet Glenn Youngkin — the Republican nominee for governor who both parties are racing to define</p></div>
<div><p>Messaging will be key as Youngkin tries to make gains in Northern Virginia, according to several Republican strategists who have urged him to focus on “kitchen-table issues” such as jobs, public safety and education.</p></div>
<p>“Northern Virginia has certainly become more heavily Democratic in recent years, but there remains a sizable number of persuadable voters in the middle who are consistently up for grabs,” said Cox, McDonnell’s campaign manager.</p>
<div><p>Is Virginia an economic success or ‘in the ditch?’ Depends on which candidate you ask.</p></div>
<p>It didn’t hurt that McDonnell had roots in three critical suburban voting regions: He grew up in Fairfax County; raised his family in Virginia Beach; and then moved them, as attorney general, to the Richmond suburb of Henrico County.</p>
<div><div><p>“Ambiguity may be his best friend,” said David I. Ramadan, a former Republican state delegate from Loudoun now teaching at George Mason’s Schar School of Policy and Government.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Video shows Glenn Youngkin saying he can’t fully discuss abortion or risk losing independent Virginia voters</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>He said he would have to avoid<b> </b>discussing his opposition to abortion in the general election, explaining that the issue “won’t win my independent votes that I have to get.”</p></div></div>

<p>The Supreme Court on Dec. 1 will consider the most serious challenge in decades to its 1973 decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that there is a constitutional right to abortion, and a 1992 reaffirmation of the right in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i>.</p>
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was properly decided, but past court rulings, public appearances and other public comments give insight into their thinking on abortion and court precedents.
<p>[What abortion laws would look like if Roe v. Wade were overturned]</p>Jump to:
<div>John G. Roberts Jr.Clarence ThomasStephen G. BreyerSamuel A. Alito Jr.Sonia SotomayorElena KaganNeil M. GorsuchBrett M. KavanaughAmy Coney Barrett</div>
<h3>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.</h3>
<b>At his confirmation hearing in 2005, Roberts declined all attempts to have him weigh in on the merits of </b>
<b> and the court’s abortion precedents</b>, like all other nominees have done. He also said he was acting as a lawyer representing a client when he wrote in a legal brief filed by the George W. Bush administration that
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> had “no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution.”
<b>In past cases he has sided with decisions that would restrict abortions. </b>In 2007, he was in the majority as the court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003,
<b> </b>although he assigned the majority opinion to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. In 2016, he was on the losing side when the court ruled that a Texas law that imposed restrictions on abortion clinics and doctors was unconstitutional.
<h3>Justice Clarence Thomas</h3>
<h4><span>Has written that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided and should be overturned</span></h4>
<b>In his fall 1991 confirmation hearings, Thomas was vague on the subject of abortion.</b> He testified that he could not remember “personally engaging” in discussions of
<i>Roe</i> during law school and that he had no “personal opinion” about
<p><b>But his views on the matter became clear shortly after taking the bench. </b>In 1992, he joined three other members of the court in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i> to say that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided.</p>
<p><b>After Casey, he began to write more strongly in his own voice </b>in multiple dissenting opinions, including last year in <i>June Medical Services v. Russo</i>:</p>
<h3>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</h3>
<h4>Consistent abortion rights supporter</h4>
<p>The 83-year-old justice has been a steady supporter of abortion rights, while acknowledging the “virtually irreconcilable” points of view on the issue.</p>
<p><b>In 2000, Breyer voted to strike down a Nebraska restriction, writing the majority opinion in </b><i><b>Stenberg v. Carhart. </b></i>He acknowledged the divide on the issue:</p>
<h3>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.</h3>
<h4>Previous support for restrictions</h4>
<p>The George W. Bush nominee has never voted to strike down a restriction on abortion during his time on the court. But he has not yet been called upon to <a>decide whether <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> should be overturned</a>.</p>
<b>As a federal appeals court judge, he voted to uphold the Pennsylvania abortion restrictions that were the focus of the Supreme Court’s </b>
<i><b>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</b></i>, including a requirement of spousal notification before obtaining an abortion.
<b>The Supreme Court disagreed on the spousal notification requirement in </b>
<b>, although it upheld the other restrictions that Alito voted to approve.</b> The court also used the case to uphold the basic premise of
<i>Roe: </i>that the constitutional right to abortion means states may not impose an undue burden on that right pre-viability.
<h3>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</h3>
<h4>Reliable vote for abortion rights</h4>
<p>Sotomayor was a longtime district and appellate judge but was never called upon to act in an abortion rights case. When President Barack Obama nominated her in 2009, some liberals were concerned about her lack of record on the issue.</p>
<p>But she has been a reliable vote for abortion rights in her tenure, and with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court’s most outspoken advocate.</p>
<p><b>Sotomayor objected to the court’s 2021 decision to reimpose restrictions on obtaining medication abortions, </b>channeling the late Justice Ginsburg:</p>
<p><b>Like the other liberal justices, she would have stopped Texas S.B. 8 from being implemented</b>, and was sharply critical of her colleagues who voted the other way:</p>
<h4>Previous support for abortion rights</h4>
<p><b>Kagan has not written any of the court’s major decisions on abortion</b>. But she filed a dissent when her colleagues allowed Texas S.B. 8 to go into effect:</p>
<h3>Justice Neil M. Gorsuch</h3>
<h4>Few rulings on abortion</h4>
<p><b>He was also in the five-justice majority that allowed Texas S.B. 8 to go into effect</b>.</p>
<h3>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh</h3>
<h4>Conservative but incremental</h4>
<i>Roe</i>, and Kavanaugh’s name was added to the president’s shortlist after his writing on abortion while a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. But Kavanaugh has sometimes proposed compromises that others have rejected.
<p><b>On the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh voted to uphold a restrictive Louisiana law, but again proposed a compromise. </b>He said more fact-finding was necessary to determine how the restrictions affected the doctors who perform the procedure.</p>
<b>He has taken a more incremental stance on the issue than some of the court’s other conservatives. </b>Despite joining five other justices in allowing Texas S.B. 8 to go into effect, it is unclear whether he would be willing to overturn
<h3>Justice Amy Coney Barrett</h3>
<h4>Conservative but sometimes reluctant to overturn precedents</h4>
<p>Despite Barrett’s antiabortion views and deep faith, she has indicated that she would separate her personal views from her duty to respect the court’s precedents.</p>
<b>She has previously opposed abortion and criticized the </b>
<b> decision. </b>As a Notre Dame law professor in 2006, Barrett and her husband signed a letter to “oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death.”
<p><b>In 2016 at a university appearance, she said </b><i><b>Roe v. Wade</b></i><b> would likely stay in place</b> when answering a question about how the Supreme Court’s legal theory might change with additional conservative justices:</p>
<p><b>But in her first term on the court, she seemed more comfortable with moving the law incrementally</b>, and did not vote to overturn some precedents that her conservative colleagues proposed.</p>

<header><div><div><div><a>Europe</a></div></div><h1>Unraveling the mystery of Europe’s uneven covid surges </h1></div></header>
<div><div><div><div>By <div>Youjin Shin and </div><div><a>Adam Taylor</a></div></div></div></div><div>March 16, 2021</div></div>
<div><div><div> Europe </div></div></div>
<p>But the wave broke unevenly, smashing, pulling back and surging again into different countries at different times, in a confounding sequence experts are still scrambling to untangle.</p>
<p>More than a year into the pandemic, as some countries struggle yet again with surging cases, it still often seems there is little rhyme or reason to which countries get hit hardest, and when.</p>
<a>say “farewell”</a> to the virus.
<p>Months later, case numbers spiked. In the space of a few weeks in fall, the Czech Republic went from being one of the least affected countries in Europe to the most.</p>
<p>“I think what we’re looking at is something that is highly multidimensional,” said Maarten van Smeden, a medical statistician at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. “</p>
<b> </b>such as shutdowns and border closures play a role in determining the spread. In some places, vaccines have begun to have an impact. In parts of Europe and elsewhere, variants are driving new surges.
<p>But these factors tell only part of the story.</p>
<p>After the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, it didn’t take long for the virus to reach Europe.</p>
<p>On Jan. 31, 2020, two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive. A cluster of cases were detected in Lombardy and Veneto on Feb. 21. The first death was recorded the next day. By March, Italy had imposed Europe’s first lockdown.</p>
<p>The initial seeding of the virus in Europe may have been stochastic, said Francois Balloux, director of the University College London’s Genetics Institute, which means the first cases dotted the continent at random.</p>
<p>“If you have thousands of introductions at the same time, the risk is that none of them go extinct and you get overwhelmed,” he said.</p>
<p>Last spring, the virus was surging across much of Western Europe. With hospitals overwhelmed, deaths spiked. By May, Belgium had the highest mortality rate in the world among confirmed cases, at 16.4 percent.</p>
<p>But the country may not have been as much of an outlier as it appeared.</p>
<p>Belgium took pains to record all covid-19 deaths, while other countries had less exact accounts, and across Europe differences in testing availability led to disparities in the accuracy of case counts. “</p>
<p>“Everybody records things at least a little bit differently. And this was particularly bad in the first wave,” said Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.</p>
<p>“This is the ugly summary of dirty data,” Van Smeden said, “and a virus that is not very easily modeled.”</p>
<h4>The deferred first wave</h4>
<p>While the virus wrought havoc across Western Europe in the spring, some countries saw only limited outbreaks.</p>
<a>“fragile intermediate success,”</a> and some restrictions were lifted.
<p>For Van Smeden in the neighboring Netherlands, the difference appeared stark. “If you’d have asked me at the start of the pandemic, I’d have said the Germans are just much better” in their response, he said.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t so simple. Sweden, which took a <a>controversial</a>, relaxed view of restrictions, also had avoided much of the initial worst effects of the wave. But after summer, both countries saw cases climb.</p>
<p>[<a>Some countries that avoided initial coronavirus surge see first spike in cases</a>]</p>
<p>Prague residents declared an end to the crisis in July. The Czech Republic, a country of 10 million, has recorded just 12,000 infections.</p>
<p>But within a few months, cases soared. By mid-October, the country reported 492 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days, according to a <a>Washington Post analysis</a>, suggesting one of the fastest-escalating outbreaks in the world.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic wasn’t unique: In Europe, a noticeable geographic split between east and west had begun to emerge.</p>
<p>[<a>Biden’s promise of widespread vaccinations by summer prompts frustration in slower-moving Europe</a>]</p>
<p>Often, the waves that hit countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland that avoided an initial surge were even deadlier for the lack of even a low percentage of immunity in the population, according to some experts.</p>
<p>Cases are surging again in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland that missed last spring’s wave, but also in Italy.</p>
<a>Economist Intelligence Unit indicate that most</a> of Europe is expected to reach widespread vaccination coverage before the end of the year. But the virus may still continue to spread, and could thrive in poorer parts of the world for years.
<p>In the future, however, the waves may be smaller — what Balloux dubs “wavelets.” Exactly how and where these will hit is hard to say, he adds, but “we’ve been through the worst now in most places.”</p>

<div>The first year of the pandemic knocked 54 million women around the world out of work, widening the gender gap in employment. It could take years for that gap to narrow again.</div>
<div>Of the women who lost jobs in 2020, almost 90 percent exited the labor force completely, compared with around 70 percent of men.</div>
<div><p>Labor participation among men and women has always been unequal. Data from 55 countries shows a lower percentage of women employed than men.</p></div>
<div><p>The pandemic made things worse. In several countries for which data is available, women’s labor participation rates fell dramatically.</p></div>
<div><p>Some countries were more affected than others. Eight countries had a more than 6 percentage-point drop in the rate of women’s labor force participation compared with the same period in 2019.</p></div>
<div><p>Even in countries where the impact on women was less severe, pandemic lockdowns caused millions of women to lose their jobs. But in those countries, recovery has generally been easier.</p></div>
<p>Not only did women suffer a disproportionate share of job losses but research suggests that their hours of unpaid labor increased as they undertook more than their share of child care, home schooling and elder care.</p>
<h3>In Peru, ‘the informal economy is what people fall into’</h3>
<p>Lima, the capital, has been hit hard. The number of women in the workforce initially fell by 55 percent in the city and had not returned to pre-pandemic rates by March of this year, according to the Peruvian census agency.</p>
<p>Since that initial drop, some women in Peru have been able to regain their footing in the job market, but experts believe this is because women moved from the formal to the informal workforce, where jobs are not regulated or protected by the state.</p>
<p>“The informal economy is what people fall into,” said Carmen Roca, Lima coordinator for Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing, a research and policy network.</p>
<p><i>Claudia Huapaya, 46, spent the pandemic in Lima with her husband and two of her children, ages 18 and 15. Her older daughter, 26, and her 5-year-old grandson live across town.</i></p>
<p>My husband is a driver, a taxi driver, of his own vehicle, and overnight, he couldn’t go out.</p>
<p>My mother had covid. I had to look out for her, because I am the oldest daughter, and to pay her costs.</p>
<p>My father was also sick, and as result, with my father’s sickness, my husband also fell ill with covid. We also had to have him treated privately because here, if you go to the state, you die.</p>
<p>I started to sell off what I had in the shop, and we were able to live off that. And like that, five, six, seven months, eight months went by, and the business was finished.</p>
<p>Our savings for the house, what we paid, the down payment, is gone. We lost everything.</p>
<p>In October, I handed over our apartment to someone else who could pay and we had to leave and look for a rental, somewhere to live.</p>
<p>We both started going out, with great care, with a kid staying at home, to be able to pay the monthly rent. Searching and searching, I found an ad for someone who was looking for home help.</p>
<p>The woman had a family, with an elderly person who was in a care home, and the woman had a house that was half-built, empty.</p>
<p>This is the capacity that many women here have: to find a way to earn a living, however we can. You do whatever you have to. You don’t say, “No, I don’t know how, I can’t.”</p>
<p>I sometimes think, “What if I had studied?” Because I think that people who studied, and who use it to work for the state, or to work in a company, are better off than a person who didn’t study, who works informally, independently.</p>
<p>If I were a lawyer, a teacher, perhaps I would be working and having a slightly higher income. Perhaps I would have social security, health insurance, perhaps benefits? I don’t know.</p>
<p>My son is in ninth grade, but he just goes to school by telephone. His phone is not great. The state doesn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>My second daughter, I can’t give her anything right now. I feel like a failure — a failure is what I feel for not being able to give her the support and the help that she wants.</p>
<p>I had my business. It was my pride and joy. I have photos of my store. I started with four boxes of beer, three boxes of sodas. I started with five packets of cookies. And I was able. I could. I managed it. I had it in my hand.</p>
<h3>Thailand’s tourism collapse hit women harder</h3>
<p><i>Pimonrat Sriprapat, 40, spent years on the road as a tour guide based outside Bangkok. When the borders shut, her job vanished.</i></p>
<p><mark>B</mark>efore covid-19, I was working on a one-month trip to Indochina. The tourists at the time were mostly Americans, Canadians and English.</p>
<p>CEO is “chief experience officer” — the ones giving tourists experiences wherever we take them.</p>
<p>We started hearing that China had closed its borders and forbidden its people from leaving. Wuhan was in lockdown. I started to think, “Oh, damn, this isn’t normal.”</p>
<p>The last day that I worked was March 22nd [of 2020]. The next day, Thailand announced a border shutdown.</p>
<p>The very first thought was, “Well, it won’t be long.” I believe that a lot of people thought the same way — that it wouldn’t be long, and it would end. The issue is, it didn’t end.</p>
<p>They announced a lockdown.</p>
<p>I came back and was staying home full time. I was taking care of my mother. Well, let’s say, we take turns taking care of each other.</p>
<p>By the third week, I started to stress out: Why couldn’t I go anywhere? Why can’t I work?</p>
<p>When everything was closed and we couldn’t travel anywhere in the world, the company sent us emails to terminate the contracts of those in the full-time CEO position and to change us to freelance.</p>
<p>My income from the company was zero because the agreement in the contract states that they will pay based on the trips that I am assigned.</p>
<p>I still have my savings that I can use. That might last me until the end of this year.</p>
<p>For household expenses, I have to rely on my mom.</p>
<p>In February, things looked better.</p>
<p>I was contacted about multiple jobs to help with operations, program writing and work on tours. I had discussions with companies that operate tours in Thailand.</p>
<p>Now, news about the number of the cases, or various clusters, in Bangkok and outside Bangkok makes me realize that this time, the third wave, won’t end easily.</p>
<p>In my previous plan, I planned my life that I would settle down and that I should start a business, so that I could live my life and earn money.</p>
<p>If I invest and the business isn’t successful, it would be like I burned my money. I have to stop and think: “Should I do this or not?”</p>
<p>I have to find a career as my second or third job, or it can become a main job for me in the future.</p>
<p>If I have one career and something like covid-19 happens, I will be drifting, a capsized boat.</p>
<h3>French social spending may help preserve women’s gains</h3>
<p>Some European countries have begun to rebound. In the fourth quarter of 2020, employment rates for women ages 20 to 64 in France and much of the European Union returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Eurostat.</p>
<p>As countries begin to mull recovery programs, Europe offers some lessons, said Martina Bisello, a research manager at the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.</p>
<p>But gender-specific social spending is needed to ensure that recent gains are not lost, she said. “To make sure we are moving in the right direction, the gender element has to be part of the plan.”</p>
<p><i>Andrea Watkins, 50, was in Paris with her two daughters, 12 and 20, as the city struggled through multiple lockdowns.</i></p>
<p><mark>I</mark> think at the beginning, we thought, “Okay, by tomorrow we’ll be fine. Everybody’s going back to their lives and it is going to be okay.” But not at all, not at all.</p>
<p>I was working for a company that develops software to manage data on ICUs and was the office manager for France. I used to work in a very nice place here in Paris.</p>
<p>The youngest, she didn’t have school. In March, they stopped, and she studied at home.</p>
<p>On school days, they had classes the whole day and I was not able to work some days.</p>
<p>The second [lockdown] was the most difficult for me because it was unexpected, and I knew I was losing the job.</p>
<p>It was in January when I finally finished everything with the company, and I went to what they call the unemployment agency.</p>
<p>It’s going to be difficult for everybody. But for a woman, a 50-year-old woman, it is going to be quite difficult.</p>
<p>I received an email from the unemployment agency: a program from the city of Paris to introduce women to technology and jobs.</p>
<p>It’s very sweet because, my first day of classes, my oldest daughter brought a cake for me and some flowers.</p>
<p>When I used to walk during the winter, I used to arrive at the Sacré-Coeur and cry for a few minutes. Now I have a purpose. I have a project.</p>
<p>I just finished classes last Friday. I will continue to educate myself and take some new classes so that I can specialize myself. I know what I would like to learn, so I think it’s a good start for me.</p>
<p>I am very happy with what I’m doing — for now. I don’t know what will happen in six months.</p>

<p>“One, two, three, pull!” the demonstrators shouted.</p>
<p>With one quick tug, a 14-foot-tall Carrara marble statue of Christopher Columbus fell, shattering into pieces. The crowd of more than a hundred, gathered in Baltimore’s Little Italy neighborhood, erupted in celebration.</p>
<p>As the sun was setting on the anniversary of the nation’s independence from the British Empire, the statue of a man whose legacy is a reminder of colonialism fell to the bottom of the city’s Inner Harbor.</p>
<p>Earlier that morning, as the sun was rising, Francine Nido in Waterbury, Conn., was awoken by a phone call. “They killed your man,” the voice on the other end said.</p>
<p>Quickly, she made her way to city hall. She was shocked to see the 12-foot granite statue of Columbus vandalized, something she felt was an insult to her Italian heritage.</p>
<p>Nearly a month and a half after the murder of George Floyd, the dismantling of the statues<b> </b>in Baltimore and Waterbury came amid a broader reckoning over whose legacy is commemorated, and why.</p>
<h2>Columbus as a shifting symbol</h2>
<p>Although he never set foot in the continental United States, Columbus is the third most memorialized person in the country, behind<b> </b>Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, according to an audit from Monument Lab.</p>
<p>“He was the good guy of the history of colonialism,” Paul said of Bancroft’s portrayal. “There were other bad guys, but he was always kind of redeemed.”</p>
<b> </b>the late 19th century as more than 18 million immigrants came from southern and eastern Europe — nearly
<p>[The first Columbus Day was born of violence — and political calculation]</p>
<b> </b>“His bravery and his spirit of adventure and also his strong faith in God,” she said.
<b> </b>“That’s what we’re proud of.”

<p>Later, the statues were moved to Smithsonian’s storage facility, where they remain. Columbus, however, is still on display in the Capitol, including on the East Portico doors.</p>
<p>Calls to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day first appeared in a public forum in 1977 at a United Nations-sponsored conference. Since 1990, at least 13 states and more than 100 localities have adopted the new holiday.</p>

<p>Munro, who founded the Massachusetts Statewide Indigenous Peoples Day campaign, says a large part of her work is educational. Much of the resistance she sees is rooted in misinformation and the dehumanization of Native Americans.</p>
<p>“The days that you celebrate as holidays have meaning and they send a message,” she added, “and the message that you send is important.”</p>
<p>“There was really no way to make sense of this myth anymore,” she said. “It was more of a sense that we also need to tell the story of Native Americans and we need to see the bigger picture.”</p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter movement, Munro said, generated awareness around symbols of white supremacy and led to more support for Indigenous issues from those outside the community.</p>
<p>“These statues traumatize citizens whose ancestors were enslaved in some form or another,” Spencer Compton, a White protester who captured video of the moment when the Columbus monument in Baltimore fell last year, told The Post.</p>

<p>But reminders of the man still linger in the city. Two Columbus monuments remain standing, and the Columbus Center for Marine Biology is just across the channel from the now-vacant pedestal.</p>

<p>The two statues in Waterbury and Baltimore were erected the same year and toppled on the same day. Together, they highlight the messy process of confronting the nation’s history.</p>

<header><div><h1>How abortion laws in the U.S. compare with those in other countries</h1><h2>Chief Justice Roberts said Mississippi’s 15 week abortion ban was 'the standard’ around the world. The reality is more complicated.</h2></div></header>

<p>“They also don’t have the same types of barriers that we have here,” Center for Reproductive Rights Litigation Director Julie Rikelman said to Roberts. There is only one abortion clinic in Mississippi.</p>
<p>[What abortion laws would look like if Roe v. Wade was overturned]</p>
<p>In the last three decades, countries around the world including Mexico, Argentina, New Zealand, Thailand and Ireland have made it easier to legally get an abortion.</p>
<p>A Washington Post analysis looked at how the United States overall, as well as the abortion laws in Texas and Mississippi, compare with other parts of the world.</p>
<h3>Understanding legality versus access</h3>
<p>Legality is one thing. Access on the ground can look very different. Antiabortion groups echo Roberts, saying U.S. laws are too liberal when compared with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“I think very few Americans realize just how radical and out-of-step America’s abortion laws are in comparison to the rest of the world,” said Angelina Nguyen, an associate scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute.</p>
<h3>Expanding abortion rights worldwide</h3>
<p>Still overall, when it comes to the legality of abortion, countries around the globe that have changed their legislation on this issue have largely pushed to increase access in the last three decades.</p>
<h3>A regional anomaly in abortion laws</h3>
<p>In addition to recent legal changes in Mexico and Argentina, Colombia’s constitutional court is expected to soon rule on whether abortion should be decriminalized. Ecuador decriminalized it in cases of rape in April.</p>
<p>[What to know about the Texas abortion law]</p>
<b> </b>have some of the highest contraception prevalence rates in the world, according to the latest statistics from the World Bank.
<p>The Texas law also incentivizes the public to report and sue those who are breaking it, with the possibility of a $10,000 reward, raising the stakes for medical providers and abortion rights advocates.</p>
<p>Zamora said she suspected that if abortions become more available in Mexico, she could see a lot of people going there from Texas for care. But she noted that many of the people she helps are undocumented.</p>
<p>“They can’t go into Mexico because they won’t be able to come back.”</p>

<b>The latest: </b>On Dec. 1, the Supreme Court heard arguments in
<i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Center</i>, a case from Mississippi that legal observers say could weaken or overturn the legal right to an abortion established by
