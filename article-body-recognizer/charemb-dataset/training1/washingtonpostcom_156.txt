<div><div><p>Instead, the network that prizes itself on covering breaking news is months late to a story sitting right in its own office.</p></div></div>
<a>reported in May</a> that Chris Cuomo had participating in strategy sessions with the governor’s team,
<a>CNN issued a statement</a> conceding that “it was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor’s staff, which Chris acknowledges.”
<i>not</i>, however,commonplace for a journalist who’s running a political consulting operation for his brother to seek info on a competitor’s publication timeline. (Farrow declined to comment on the record.)
<a>a close colleague</a> of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker. Any mid-level producer who did a comparable amount of line-crossing would have met the full wrath of the CNN News Standards and Practices Policy Guide.

<div><div><p>That “further evaluation” leaves open the possibility that Chris Cuomo could return to the network’s airwaves. Perhaps his best argument would be this: <i>My efforts weren’t effective</i>.</p></div></div>
<a>reported</a> in May that Chris Cuomo had participated in strategy sessions with top aides to Andrew Cuomo, and the
<a>official report of the attorney general in August confirmed that role</a>.
<a>who’d claimed that the governor had touched her inappropriately at a wedding</a>. In at least a couple of instances, he acted on requests from Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s top aide.
<div><div><p>“I can’t remember the substance,” said Azzopardi, in reference to Cuomo’s thoughts on one accuser.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Political consultant Lis Smith had a similar recollection: “As to specific things that he said in the conversations, I can’t remember.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his own testimony, Chris Cuomo spoke to his own impact on the proceedings:</p></div></div>
<div>You know, I mean, I didn’t even cover the mayoral race recently. </div>
<div>So it shouldn’t be surprising that I didn’t have a heavy hand in a lot of these things, because I didn’t.</div>
<p>Surely Chris Cuomo influenced his brother in their one-on-one conversations, though the CNN anchor wouldn’t be <a>facing professional consequences if he’d limited himself to serving as a “sounding board” for the governor</a>.</p>

<div><p>Erik Wemple: Never count out Fox News</p></div>

<a>released</a> another statement: “We are evaluating the letter from the committee. We remain very concerned about the constitutional implications especially as it relates to the First Amendment. We will respond as appropriate.”)

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Erik Wemple</div></div>Media critic </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 3:14 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>said Grisham</a>. “And I think there were things that I was able to kind of help put together like a puzzle.”
<div><p>“I have great faith in this committee. It’s given me hope for 2022, as we reflect on, you know, today, which was a terrible day for democracy and just for our country,” she told Berman and co-host Brianna Keilar.</p></div>
<div><p>Erik Wemple: Sean Hannity’s bottomless corruption</p></div>
<div><div><p>As Grisham recounts in her book, she was an early Trumpite, having joined the campaign as a press aide. After Trump’s inauguration, she bounced back and forth between press operations for the president and the first lady.</p></div></div>
<a>Politico has reported</a> that two others are former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.
<a>“Anonymous” op-ed in the New York Times about thwarting Trump’s excesses</a> and look how that worked out; and Scaramucci, because of his 10 days at the White House —
<div><div><p>Just think of what they can accomplish together.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Such are the professional consequences of having chosen to work with such a man. “I’m still not looking for redemption,” said Grisham on Thursday, sounding wise. “I’m actually just looking forward.”</p></div>

<a>a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll</a>. Almost 3 in 10 Americans say Biden’s election was not legitimate. Among people who voted for Donald Trump in 2020, 69 percent say Biden was not legitimately elected, according to the poll.

<a> turned into a fortress</a>. An eight-foot-high black metal fence topped with razor wire surrounded the U.S. Capitol for months. There were concrete barriers, security checkpoints and armed National Guard members.

<div><div><p>Former vice president Richard B. Cheney visited the House floor on Thursday and patiently waited to greet more than a dozen members waiting to shake his hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were all Democrats.</p></div></div>
<p>Cheney and his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) are among the few Republicans who have joined Democrats in condemning last year’s attack on the Capitol as an assault on democracy and blaming former president Donald Trump for that deadly day.</p>
<div><div><p>They were the only two Republicans on the House floor Thursday for an event to mark the anniversary of the attack, but they were hardly alone.</p></div></div>
<p>One by one, Democrats put aside their fierce and lasting policy divides with the Cheneys to thank them for condemning the attack and Trump’s continued effort to undermine the 2020 presidential election results with his false claims of fraud.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was great coming back. I think Liz is doing a hell of a job, and I’m here to support her,” Cheney told reporters upon leaving the House floor.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked to reflect on Republican leaders’ decision not to show up on Thursday to mark the anniversary of the attack, Cheney said he could no longer recognize the party he helped lead as House minority whip and then vice president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Cheney has moderated their positions on any number of conservative issues they have held over the years, but their determination to take on Trump and call out fellow Republicans is more than enough for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Liz Cheney was in the chamber during the insurrection and became one of the only House Republicans to pointedly blame Trump for instigating the most violent attack on the Capitol since British forces set it on fire in 1814.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Republicans oust Cheney for calling out Trump’s false election claims, minimize Jan. 6 attack on Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p>When her father left office in 2009, it was hard to imagine what would cause him to be rejected by Republicans and embraced by Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During his time as vice president, his relationship with Democrats was marked by bitter disagreements, particularly over the Iraq War, that often went beyond policy disagreements and into questions of character and patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi and Cheney had an acrimonious relationship of their own.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney said in 2007 that if Pelosi was successful at preventing a U.S. troop increase in Iraq it would “validate the al-Qaeda strategy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi demanded an apology, saying Cheney had questioned her patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He declined and said he didn’t question her patriotism, just her judgment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s what I believe,” she told CNN. “I think he’s proud of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, those old tensions were put aside as they focused on their shared feelings about Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) also applauded Cheney for his daughter’s courage during a lengthier conversation in which both men were overheard talking about other news of day such as testing frequently for the coronavirus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Back in 2004, at a time when Sen. Patrick J. Leahy and other Democrats accused Cheney’s old company, Halliburton, of profiting off the Iraq War, the Vermont Democrat approached the vice president on the Senate floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hey Dick,” Leahy recalled saying in an interview Thursday, “why don’t you talk to the Democratic side?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney wasn’t amused.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“F--- yourself,” he told Leahy before complaining about the Democrat’s recent comments about him.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Cheney dismisses critic with obscenity</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But like for many Democrats, Cheney’s public support for his daughter’s outspoken anti-Trump vows has softened Leahy’s feelings toward the elder Cheney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that the younger Cheney’s actions remind him of the stories he heard when he first arrived in Washington in 1975.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They thought it was a thing they had to do,” said Leahy, who watched Liz Cheney’s media appearances Thursday morning. “And that’s what I was thinking of, more than anything else.”</p></div></div>

<p>Instead of an attempt to overturn the election by radicalized Donald Trump supporters, it was a choreographed attack staged by antifa provocateurs. Rather than an armed insurrection, it was a good-natured protest spoiled by a few troublemakers.</p>
<div><div><p>And instead of a deadly event that put the lives of hundreds of lawmakers, police officers and others at risk, the riot was no big deal at all.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Johnson defended his approach to the riot, saying he viewed his role as raising questions for the various investigations to answer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not afraid of information,” he said. “Some people seem to be afraid of the truth. I’m not. I’m just trying to get the whole truth.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Soldiers on the streets, helicopters in the air and tension all around reminded her of Sept. 11, 2001, too. But something was different. Twenty years ago, the country had come together, she said. Now it was coming apart.</p></div></div>

<div><p>What hasn’t disappeared for residents and workers in the Capitol Hill neighborhood are the memories of that dark day when democracy felt in the balance. As the anniversary of the attack approaches, the fallout continues to be felt.</p></div>
<p>Businesses were forced to shutter. Streets were closed. Neighborhood parks where dogs once ran and children played were instead patrolled by troops carrying high-powered weapons. Overnight the friendly neighborhood became a menacing occupation zone.</p>
<div><div><p>A year later there is still fear, disbelief and anger at what the rioters wrought.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Business plummeted after the insurrection as armed National Guard troops stood sentry and large military trucks were a constant presence near the storefront Nguyen has occupied for 19 years.</p></div></div>
<div><p>His clients have included senators and representatives from both parties, and many of their staff members as well. On Jan. 6, Nguyen, who moved to the United States from Vietnam in 1984, couldn’t believe what was taking place.</p></div>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. It should never have happened,” he said. “It made me feel like I was in Ukraine or Syria, not the United States. If they can attack the government openly, they can attack anybody.”</p>
<b>,</b> frustration and anger about those who attacked the Capitol
<b> </b>were common themes. There is a feeling that many of those who took part in the insurrection have escaped justice.
<div><div><p>The fear and panic the rioters created inside the Capitol was also felt by residents who lived nearby. As the mob dispersed that evening, many who had participated in it filtered through the neighborhood, shouting and cheering.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It wasn’t until late afternoon that she started to hear helicopters and sirens and turned on CNN, where she watched live as the mob continued to surge through the Capitol in a violent effort to overturn the election.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>If newcomers to the Hill were unnerved, so too were residents who have lived here all their lives.</p></div></div>
<p>“It was surreal for me that this was happening in real time in my backyard,” she said. “And I had to cancel the appointments because I could not pay attention, which is an uncomfortable feeling when you do the work I do.”</p>
<div><div><p>“Seeing that fencing was depressing and disturbing and I stopped going that way for weeks and months,” Sangster said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They at least need to do community service and pay back for all the damage they did,” she said. “It’s not right for the taxpayers to have to pay for that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Part of the problem, Rakowski said as he stood outside Eastern Market on a recent rainy morning, is the disconnect people from outside of Washington have toward Congress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With time, some of the anger and fear engendered by Jan. 6 has subsided. And in its place is a sentiment shared by many residents: that the tragedy brought the neighborhood closer together.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think the biggest ramification that I see, and maybe I’m being overly positive, is that a lot of people really started cherishing being neighbors,” Carey said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Capitol Police see sharp increase in threats to Congress, departure of dozens of officers</h1></div>
<h2>Chief Thomas Manger seeks to rebuild force, add resources after after Jan. 6 breakdowns</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tom Jackman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>Ex-Montgomery, Fairfax chief J. Thomas Manger named new Capitol Police chief</p></div>
<div><p>Gus Papathanasiou, the head of the Fraternal Order of Police’s Capitol Police Labor Committee, agreed that “morale isn’t any better now than before January 6th,” because of forced overtime and restricted leave.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Papathanasiou also criticized Manger for not firing Yogananda Pittman, the assistant chief for protective and intelligence operations since October 2019.</p></div></div>
<p>Manger defended keeping Pittman on board. He noted that his predecessor, Steven Sund, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, the director of intelligence and a number of assistant and deputy chiefs all resigned in the wake of the Capitol riot.</p>
<b> </b>large incidents. He said the biggest failures on Jan. 6 were in intelligence, operational planning, the training and equipping of the civil disturbance unit, and the coordination with outside agencies, whether local police or the National Guard.
<div><div><p>He said he had hired nine new intelligence analysts and provided them with better training than previous Capitol intelligence analysts, and a new director of intelligence is to be named soon.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Capitol Police had intelligence indicating an armed invasion weeks before Jan. 6 riot, Senate probe finds</p></div>
<div><div><p>Keeping the rank and file informed helps spread information effectively, Manger said. After the attack, officers were provided department cellphones, which they did not previously have.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They get intelligence bulletins every single day,” Manger said. “In fact, they complain sometimes that now they’re getting too much information.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Papathanasiou said the phones were a sign of progress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manger has<b> </b>tried to maintain staffing by offering officers a $3,000 bonus if they sign an agreement that they will stay for at least another year.</p></div></div>
