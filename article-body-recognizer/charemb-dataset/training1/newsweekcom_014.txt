<div> U.S. Ayahuasca <a>Drug Enforcement Administration</a> <a>IRS</a></div>
<p>The IRS has defended its decision to deny tax-exempt status to an Iowa church that uses the hallucinogenic drug ayahuasca in its services and ceremonies.</p>
<p>The Iowaska Church of Healing applied for tax-exempt status with the IRS in January 2019. The church was formed in September 2018, according to state records, and listed the home of one of its co-founders, Admir Dado Kantarevic, as its address.</p>
<p>The church, which had as many as 20 members at one time, holds a "Sacrament of Ayahuasca." Its members use the hallucinogenic for spiritual, physical and emotional healing as well as to develop a psychic and spiritual connection to the divine.</p>
<p>Numerous other Native American cultures have used ayahuasca for similar purposes. But even though Kantarevic said that he never conducted any such ceremonies at his home or elsewhere in the state, the substance remains illegal in the United States.</p>
<p>Ayahuasca, also known as dimethyltryptamine or DMT, is a Schedule I drug, meaning that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers it as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.</p>
<p>In February 2019, the church sought a religious exemption from the DEA, but the DEA provided "no substantive response" to the request, the Dispatch reported.</p>
<p>The church eventually sued the IRS in October, seeking a judicial review of the tax agency's decision. This week, the IRS issued a court filing in the case standing by its final decision.</p>
<p>The church said the IRS' denial violated a unanimously decided 2006 <a>Supreme Court</a> decision allowing members of a New Mexico church to use ayahuasca as a way of expressing religious freedom.</p>
<p>In that case, the church sued the DEA, claiming that the DEA's confiscation of a Brazilian ayahuasca shipment address to the church violated the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).</p>
<p>RFRA says the government can't substantially burden a person's exercise of religion without provably furthering a compelling government interest in the least restrictive way possible.</p>
<p>In the 2006 case, the Supreme Court said that the DEA failed to prove that the hallucinogenic would harm the church's members or lead to the substance being abused in a non-religious way.</p>
<p>The ruling compared ayahuasca to peyote, a hallucinogenic that also contains mescaline, a substance criminalized by the DEA. The U.S. has allowed Native American tribes to legally use the substance for decades in their religious rituals.</p>
<p>The court review of the church's case remains ongoing.</p>

<div> News Capitol Riots <a>January 6</a> <a>Washington D.C.</a></div>
<p>A judge on Friday sentenced Capitol rioter Robert Palmer to 63 months in federal prison for assaulting police with a fire extinguisher and a wooden plank during the Capitol attack on January 6.</p>
<p>U.S. DistrictJudge Tanya Chutkan issued the sentence after Palmer pleaded guilty to charges of the assault, Zoe Tillman, a Buzzfeed News reporter, tweeted. This is the longest sentence issued in connected with the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>"Show your children that while we make mistakes and we can do bad things, it does not make us irredeemable people. Good luck to you sir," Chutkan said.</p>
<p>Fifty-four-year-old Palmer, who is from Largo City, Florida, pleaded guilty in October to assaulting law enforcement during the Capitol breach.</p>
<p>"He threw a wooden plank at U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officers protecting the lower west terrace entrance," an October statement by the <a>Department of Justice</a> read.</p>
<p>During the court session on Friday, Chutkan spoke about the way law enforcement helped protect individuals and the Capitol that day and that they didn't deserve Palmer's actions against them.</p>
<p>"Despite being outnumbered that day, law enforcement officers labored valiantly and tirelessly," Chutkan said, according to Tillman. "They were the patriots that day, Mr. Palmer."</p>
<p>"The men and women who kept democracy functioning that day and saved lives, they deserve the thanks of this nation," Chutkan added. "They didn't deserve to have fire extinguishers thrown at them."</p>
<p>On Friday in court, Palmer expressed his regret about participating in the riot on January 6 and said that he was "really, really ashamed of what I did," according to Huffpost.</p>
<p>He added that when he was detained he had watched a video clip of himself that showed him attacking police officers. He told the judge that he "was horrified" by the video, according to the news outlet.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Justice Department recommended that Palmer receive a 63-month-sentence in jail for his actions, according to WTSP.</p>
<p>Palmer's attorney, Bjorn Brunvand, said that his client believed that he was acting in the best interest of the country at the time.</p>
<p>Newsweek contacted Palmer's attorney for comments.</p>
<p>Update 12/17/2021 3:37 PM ET: This story has been undated to include more background information on the case.</p>
<p>Mary Trump, the niece of former President Donald Trump, said on Sunday that her uncle will exert every possible effort to remain GOP leader and possibly regain the presidency.</p>
<a>MSNBC</a> host Alex Witt asked for her thoughts about her uncle's remarks during a "History Tour" stop with former
<a>Fox News</a> host Bill O'Reilly in Houston on Saturday. Trump repeated his claim that he recommended sending 10,000 troops to the Capitol to protect lawmakers on January 6.
<a>said at the time</a> that he "spoke separately with the Vice President [Mike Pence] and with Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, Senator Schumer and Representative Hoyer about the situation at the U.S. Capitol." He didn't mention working with Trump.
<p>Trump, a psychologist, continued her assessment of her uncle as she commented on his Saturday remarks that there was "love in that crowd" at the Stop the Steal rally before the Capitol riot.</p>
<a>told MSNBC </a>that small crowds at the tour stops indicate that the former president has become "increasingly irrelevant." Saturday's
<a>event in Houston</a> saw many empty seats, despite thousands of people attending. There was also
<a>a low turnout in Florida</a>.
<p>"We saw what a miserable failure his rally was with Bill O'Reilly because people had to pay to go and obviously that's not something a lot of people were willing to do," she said.</p>
<p>Newsweek contacted Trump's office for comments.</p>

<h4>In this daily series, Newsweek explores the steps that led to the January 6 Capitol Riot.</h4>
<p>On Saturday, December 19, President Donald Trump conveyed his first public notice of a "big protest in DC" to be held on January 6, the day <a>Congress</a> was to convene in a Joint Session to certify the electoral vote.</p>
<p>"Be there," he tweeted, "will be wild!"</p>
<p>"The calvary [sic] is coming, Mr. President!" <a>tweeted</a> Kylie Jane Kremer in response, one of the leaders of the "Women for America First" coalition.</p>
<p>"The President is calling on us to come back to Washington on January 6th for a big protest—'Be there, will be wild'," the official poster announced.</p>
<p>Trump retweeted Kremer's post, saying: "A great honor!"</p>
<p>"Thank you for the RT [retweet] @realDonaldTrump," Kremer answered. "We hope you come out and join us!!"</p>
<p>Kremer and the president got thousands of retweets and comments, most supportive, with declarations from individuals near and far, that they were coming. But there were also a fair share of mocking responses, a battle of the memes.</p>
<p>She said that January 6 would "be one of the greatest experiences [and] the duty of all able Patriots." But not for the faint at heart. "Violence can and will break out." Kelly O'Brien was later arrested for her role on January 6.</p>

<p>Gina Bisignano tweeted "I'll be there" in response to Donald Trump's call. Bisignano was later arrested for his role on January 6.</p>
<p>Kenneth Reda posted: "We have got to get to DC on January 6th it is IMPERATIVE every single person that VOTED for Trump has to flood DC ..." Reda was later arrested for his role on January 6.</p>
