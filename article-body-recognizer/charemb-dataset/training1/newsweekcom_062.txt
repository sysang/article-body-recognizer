<p>It was first to hit the grim milestone by a relatively wide margin. Among fellow large states, Texas stands at over 4.4 million cases, Florida surpassed 3.9 million over the weekend and New York has just over 3.2 million cases.</p>
<p>The state's death toll sits at just over 75,500, according to the California Public Health Department website.</p>
<p>Cases and hospitalizations are rising in the state, although not as rapidly as in some other other states and nationwide.</p>
<a>summer peak</a> of nearly 9,000 caused by the Delta variant and about the same peak reached in July 2020. It's around one-fifth of the peak of over 22,000 the state was facing in January, just before vaccines were widely available.
<p>The first COVID case was reported Jan. 25, 2020, and 292 days later, the state reached 1 million cases. Forty-four days afterward, 2 million was reached.</p>
<p>The state has fared far better than many other states dealing with a coronavirus surge, with areas in the Midwest and Northeast seeing the biggest jump in cases and hospitalizations amid frigid temperatures that have kept people indoors.</p>
<p>The timeline of COVID-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travelers from China, where the outbreak began.</p>
<p>The Feb. 6, 2020, death of a San Jose woman was the first known coronavirus fatality in the U.S. That same month, California recorded the first U.S. case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.</p>
<p>On March 19, 2020, Governor <a>Gavin Newsom</a> issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many of the newly reported cases were attributed to the Omicron variant. Much about Omicron remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>One in every 50 Manhattan residents tested positive for coronavirus in the past week as the Omicron variant causes a massive surge in cases in New York City.</p>
<p>According to transmission data released by the city's health department, the borough reported nearly 2,012 new cases for every 100,000 people—about 2 percent of the total population.</p>
<p>The city's Chelsea-Clinton neighborhoods reported the highest number of new cases per capita at 2,600 new cases for every 100,000 people, according to the city's data.</p>
<p>New York's other boroughs also reported notably high numbers of cases. Per 100,000 people, Staten Island reported 1,902 cases, Brooklyn reported about 1,741 cases, the Bronx reported about 1,685 cases and Queens reported about 1,547 cases.</p>
<p>The citywide average was 1,742 cases were per 100,000 people, according to the health department.</p>
<p>Cases in New York—an epicenter of the virus during the first months of the pandemic—began rising earlier in December, prompting officials in the state and city to take quick action to try to limit the spread of cases.</p>
<p>Governor Kathy Hochul issued an indoor mask mandate across the state out of Omicron concerns. The mandate went into effect December 13 and will last until at least January 15.</p>
<p>"We're entering a time of uncertainty and we could either plateau here or our cases could get out of control," she said during a December 10 press conference.</p>
<p>Hochul announced December 6 that <a>elective surgeries in the state would be temporarily halted</a> as the state dealt with the surge in cases.</p>
<a>shutter due to outbreaks among their casts</a>. The city also
<a>scaled down their New Year's Eve celebration</a> due to the high number of cases.
<p>The city is also experiencing a nursing shortage as <a>many test positive for the virus</a>.</p>
<a>Bill de Blasio</a> announced Tuesday that the state will send 2 million at-home testing kits to schools that can be sent home to students if a classmate tests positive. The city will also increase the number of random tests at each school.
<p>A New Jersey company that purports to offer "natural solutions" to medical issues has been ordered to stop selling a fake "nano silver" treatment for COVID-19 by a federal court.</p>
<p>While silver does have antimicrobial properties and can destroy bacteria and viruses on surfaces outside of the body, silver substances have not been FDA-approved to cure or treat any systemic diseases and can be toxic when taken internally.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to announce that we have now entered into a consent decree resolving that dispute, without any admission of wrong-doing," Laibow, the Natural Solution Foundation's medical director, said in a statement posted online.</p>
<p>"In consequence of that consent decree, we may modify some of our procedures and activities, but the Foundation will continue to operate under the protection of the First Amendment," added Laibow.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency will send strike teams to Pennsylvania as hospitals face an overwhelming number of patients from the latest COVID surge, Governor Tom Wolf's office said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Any federal assistance will help relieve some pressure on the health system so there is capacity to treat people who need hospital care," Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director Randy Padfield said in the statement.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, Pennsylvania hospitals had 4,648 admitted patients with COVID, around 120 more than during the previous week, PennLive.com reported.</p>
<p>The state's daily average number of COVID cases was 9,979 from December 20 to December 26, according to a press release from the state Department of Health.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Friot in Oklahoma ruled Tuesday against the lawsuit from Governor Kevin Stitt and others filed earlier this month in objection to the COVID vaccine mandate for National Guard troops in the state.</p>
<p>Stitt, Attorney General John O'Connor and 16 National Guard members in the state requested a preliminary injunction halting the order, which Friot denied, saying their claims were not sufficient to stop the mandate.</p>
<p>When the lawsuit was filed, Stitt released a statement saying Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stepped beyond his constitutional authority by enacting the mandate for the National Guard.</p>
<p>Austin decided that those who do not get a vaccine would not be allowed to participate in federally funded drills and other training required to keep their status as a member of the National Guard.</p>
<p>He said the COVID vaccines, like many others the military already requires, are the key to making sure the U.S. has a healthy force of troops that are ready to defend the country.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Oklahoma National Guard declined to comment while litigation is pending.</p>
<p>The White House and health officials have credited coronavirus vaccine mandates with driving up vaccination rates and curbing deaths from COVD-19.</p>
<p>Prior to filing a lawsuit, Stitt asked Austin to suspend the mandate for the Oklahoma National Guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for declining the vaccine.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials have repeatedly said Austin has the authority to set medical readiness requirements, including vaccines, for the entire military including the Guard.</p>

<p>An unvaccinated woman died with COVID-19 shortly after Christmas, only two months following the birth of her first child.</p>
<p>Natalie Forshaw from Burnage, a suburb of the city of Manchester in northwest England, passed away on December 26 at the age of 30, the Manchester Evening News (MEN) reported.</p>
<p>Forshaw tested positive for the disease while pregnant with her son Caleb, who was delivered via an emergency cesarean section on November 3. She had decided not to get vaccinated because she was pregnant, MEN reported.</p>
<p>But the new mother was forced to remain in hospital as her condition worsened. She eventually ended in the ICU at Manchester Royal Infirmary but doctors were not able to save her.</p>
<p>The woman's mother, Bernie Wilton, told MEN that Forshaw had been at home when she first began feeling sick.</p>
<p>"Because she was pregnant we took her to see a doctor and her oxygen levels were very very low. She was getting bad pains in her chest," Wilton said.</p>
<p>"She went to hospital and the baby was delivered but Natalie was transferred to intensive care. She was not able to see Caleb for a week."</p>
<p>Soon after the baby was delivered, doctors placed Forshaw in a drug-induced coma as part of her treatment. Then in mid-November, medical staff spotted a blood clot inside her heart.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the blood clot broke up and moved her lungs, leaving her in critical condition. In early December, doctors told the family there was nothing more they could do for Forshaw.</p>
<p>Despite showing some signs of improvement, on December 20, the 30-year-old's heart failed and she died less than a week later.</p>
<p>"I am going to miss your daft ways...the fact that you text me 8,400,000 times a day even if it was just to say love you mammy. We had the most amazing bond not only mother and daughter but very best of friends...</p>
<p>"But you left us a very special piece of you my gawgus grandson Caleb and I swear with the help of everyone who knew you we will make sure he knows every detail of your life and I will never ever let him forget you.</p>
<p>"I know you will be watching us to make sure we do it right anyway and I know you will let me know some way if we are not...you fought so hard my baby girl...you rest now baby girl I know you will light up the sky...my life will never be the same."</p>
<a>pregnant women</a> and those who have recently had a baby are more likely to get
<a>severely ill</a> with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people—although the overall risk is still low.
<p>This is because pregnancy causes changes in the body that can reduce an individual's ability to fight off a respiratory infection.</p>
<p>The CDC says vaccination can protect you from severe COVID-19 illness and is recommended for all people aged 12 years and older, including "people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future."</p>
<p>The currently available evidence indicates that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of <a>vaccination during pregnancy</a>, according to the CDC.</p>

<p>An unvaccinated priest who came to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic was some kind of hoax or setup has been admitted to an ICU with the disease.</p>
<p>Juan Manuel Fernández Iglesias, 52, is a parish priest from Galicia—an autonomous region in the northwest of Spain—who covers the municipalities of Cerdedo-Cotobade, Ponte Caldelas and A Lama, local media outlet La Voz de Galicia reported.</p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, Iglesias, who is also a professor of religion at a school in A Lama, strictly adhered to coronavirus restrictions, according to parishioners.</p>
<p>During this period, the priest was careful not to allow people to congregate too closely in his churches, and ensured that a safe distance was maintained between worshippers.</p>
<a>concerns regarding</a> other issues related to the pandemic, such as the rollout of mass vaccinations, La Voz de Galicia reported. In the end, the priest decided not to get vaccinated.
<p>Recently, the priest caught the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus, which causes <a>COVID-19</a>, and his condition worsened to the point where he was admitted to a local hospital and transferred to the ICU, where he remains.</p>
<p>Around 80 percent of the Spanish population have been fully vaccinated against the disease.</p>

<p>A Dutch economist who was a prominent skeptic of the COVID-19 vaccines and an anti-lockdown campaigner has died at the age of 53 after contracting the disease.</p>
<p>Robin Fransman, a political economist, passed away due to the consequences of infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, on December 28 at a hospital in Amsterdam, Dutch daily newspaper Het Parool reported.</p>
<p>On December 3, Fransman announced on his Twitter page that he had tested positive for the disease.</p>
<p>"Corona positive. It's about time too," he tweeted.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old was admitted to the hospital soon after and eventually succumbed to the disease after his condition worsened.</p>
<p>Fransman was unvaccinated and had been highly critical of the <a>COVID-19 vaccines</a> on social media, often downplaying their effectiveness.</p>
<p>The economist had also criticized the concept of long COVID, opposed lockdown measures, while also arguing that coronavirus restrictions caused more damage to society than they prevented.</p>
<p>Fransman also worked as a lobbyist in the financial sector, and was one of the co-founders of an organization called Herstel-NL.</p>
<p>In a later interview with Dutch daily AD, Fransman said lockdowns and strict measures could help some in society but not others.</p>
<p>"The lives of the vulnerable are important, but also the lives of the less vulnerable. It's really not our intention to just throw open every door. We need to find a better balance," he said.</p>
<p>Fransman said in a tweet on November 28 that it was okay for vulnerable people to get vaccinated in his view, but he had vowed not to get the shot himself.</p>
<p>In November, a prominent Austrian <a>anti-vaccination</a> advocate who said he had attempted to treat his COVID-19 infection with a substance found in some bleach products died after suffering complications from the disease.</p>
<div> News Coronavirus <a>Kansas</a> <a>Police officer</a></div>
<p>A Kansas police officer died from COVID-19 complications on December 28, 2021, as high case numbers prompted officials in the Douglas County—the 5th most populated county in the state—to mull imposing a local mask mandate.</p>
<p>"Brian was an exemplary employee, but more so than that, a wonderful person to be around," said North Newton City Administrator Kyle Fiedler. "Serving the community was immensely important to Brian, and our community will miss him greatly."</p>
<p>The delta variant has spread across the state, and 25 cases of the omicron variant have been reported in 10 of the state's 105 counties.</p>
<p>The elected Douglas County Commission would decide whether to impose the mandate. Partridge said the earliest that health officials would present a recommendation would be January 12.</p>
<p>The county kept a requirement that children ages 2 through 11 wear masks in public spaces in place until December 22.</p>
<p>State health department data shows that Kansas has averaged 1,685 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases, 43 new hospitalizations and 10 additional deaths a day this month, through Monday. The state reported 6,964 total deaths as of Monday.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<div> U.S. Coronavirus <a>Germany</a></div>
<p>Germany's COVID-19 infection rate is likely two to three times higher than current data indicates, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Official data released by Germany on Wednesday reported 40,043 new cases over the past 24 hours and an infection rate of 205.5 new infections per 100,000 people during the past seven days.</p>
<p>Germany's Robert Koch Institute confirmed the nation's first Omicron death last week, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>At the same time, neighboring France is reporting record numbers fueled by the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>He said he's sure that there will be "solid and sufficient" data on infections by the time Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Germany's 16 state governors confer on the way forward in the pandemic on January 7.</p>

<p>Ohio currently has the highest rate of hospitalizations per-capita in the United States, Robert Wylie, chief medical operations officer at the Cleveland Clinic, said at the press conference.</p>
<p>DeWine announced an order for 1,250 additional National Guard troops in the state to assist hospitals, <a>adding to the 1,000 members</a> called earlier this month distributed to assist short-staffed hospitals across the state.</p>
<p>In response, the Ohio Hospital Association and the Ohio Children's Hospital Association asked school officials statewide to consider mandatory mask wearing as cases continue to spike.</p>
<p>"Please help us by requiring students to wear masks when they return to school," the groups said. But at least one major district—Cleveland city schools—announced it was returning to remote learning for a week starting Monday.</p>
<p>"If you're vaccinated, the chances of you ending up in the hospital are pretty darn slim," the governor said.</p>
<p>Even as the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations spike, facilities are struggling with staffing levels. The Cleveland Clinic had more than 2,700 staff members out with the coronavirus on Wednesday, also a pandemic record, Wylie said.</p>
<p>But dealing with underreported case numbers is not as important as people having the ability to be tested quickly, DeWine said.</p>
