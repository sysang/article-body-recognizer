<h1> 4 Mantras to Getting Started in 2022 </h1>
<h2> How we can overcome procrastination to lead more fulfilling lives. </h2>
<li>Studies have shown that around 20 percent of people in the United States are chronic procrastinators.</li>
<li>Treating underlying mental health issues such as ADHD, depression, and anxiety can help reduce procrastination, among other benefits.</li>
<li>It's possible to improve one's own tendency to procrastinate by reframing beliefs such as needing to have more energy first.</li>
<p>“I just can’t get myself to do it!”</p>
<p>Sound familiar? This is a problem I hear time and time again from my therapy clients who desperately want to do something or know they should, but just... can't... do.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Will Hwang/author</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Studies have shown that around 20 percent of people in the United States are chronic procrastinators—they habitually delay, postpone, and put off doing things in a way that they need or want to do.<sup>1</sup></p>
<a>ADHD</a> for instance: It has been shown that people with higher levels of ADHD symptoms have more difficulties with
<a>procrastination</a> than people with lower levels of ADHD symptoms.
<sup>2</sup> This may be due to unique challenges individuals with ADHD face related to
<a>motivation</a>, reward, and self-
<a>management</a> (managing one's emotions, organizing thoughts, and conceptualizing time around tasks), often mediated by dysfunction in how
<a>dopamine</a> is working in the brain.
<a>depression</a> and anxiety. Rumination, or the act of repetitively thinking negative thoughts, seems to play a primary role in leading depressed and
<a>anxious</a> people to procrastinate more.
<p>Here are some common reasons people give for procrastinating:</p>
<li>I don’t know why I can't get started. I just can't. </li>
<li>It’s too overwhelming.</li>
<li>I don’t have the energy. </li>
<li>I keep getting distracted.</li>
<li>I don’t know what I should do.</li>
<li>I’m afraid if I try that I will fail. </li>
<li>I only have X amount of time so I can’t really start this now. </li>
<p>Here are four mantras to help you overcome these unhelpful beliefs:</p>
<h3>1. Success breeds success.</h3>
<h3>2. Having no limits is limiting. </h3>
<p>In his book, The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz describes the tendency to believe the more choices, the better, but in reality, how an excessive amount of options can result in indecision, inaction, and an inability to choose at all.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Consumers who had six jams to choose from as opposed to 24 jams were 10 times more likely to follow through with actually buying a jam. It appeared that having too many options ended up dissuading individuals from picking anything at all.</p>
<h3>3. Act the way you want to feel.</h3>
<p>We often get too fixated on the belief that we need to feel better one way or another before we can do something. In reality, we usually end up feeling better after we take action.</p>
<a>hormonal</a> changes but also improves the body's ability to create and use energy supplies in the long term.
<p>Identify how you would like to feel and then create a plan to engage in the activities that would likely bring forth these feelings. </p>
<h3>4. Now is a good time. </h3>
<p>At the same time, it can cause regret to consider exactly how much time has passed since the start of the pandemic. Let us not avoid this feeling of loss, but instead, allow this feeling to serve as a reminder that time is not limitless.</p>
<a>rationalization</a> that we will do it, whatever it is, later, tomorrow, next week, or next year.
<p>When would be a good time to start? The answer just might be...now.</p>

<h1> Is ADHD Genetically Influenced? Yes! </h1>
<h2> Genetics influencing ADHD as "neuroscience fiction"? Seriously? </h2>
<a> <div>This post is in response to <article> Is ADHD Genetic? By Marilyn Wedge Ph.D. </article> </div> </a>
<p>I wanted to just let this one go and take a deep breath, but this post by Dr. Wedge, which will undoubtedly be read by a large number of people, is just so factually inaccurate and misleading that I can’t in good faith ignore it.</p>
<a>identical twins</a> (who share all of their DNA) than between fraternal twins (who share—on average—half their genes). And remember, these are twins living in the same household with the same parents and with much of the same environment.
<a>genetics</a> and to write a post against that position is the classic straw-man argument.

<p>There are legitimate debates about ADHD that are and should be discussed. The public, however, deserves much better than this. </p>

<h2> What is the best treatment for ADHD? </h2>
<a>behavioral and social challenges</a> (such as difficulties making friends, managing time, and poor self-esteem).
<p>The most commonly used ADHD medications are stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall. Non-stimulants like Strattera or certain classes of antidepressants can be used for those who don’t respond to stimulants or cannot tolerate them.</p>
<div> <h3> What stimulants are used to treat ADHD? </h3> </div>
<p>The main stimulant medications used to treat ADHD fall into two broad categories: methylphenidates and amphetamines.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate: Ritalin, Concerta, Daytrana, Focalin, Quillichew, Quillivant, Metadate</p>
<p>Amphetamine: Adderall, Dyanavel, Vyvanse, Dexedrine</p>
<div> <h3> Are stimulant medications dangerous? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Will stimulant medications stunt my child’s growth? </h3> </div>
<a>study published in 2017</a>, for instance, found that extended use of stimulants to treat ADHD was associated with reduced height in adulthood. Other research, however—such as a
<div> <h3> What non-stimulants are used to treat ADHD? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Three non-stimulant medications</a>—Strattera (atomoxetine), Intuniv (guanfacine), and Kapvay (clonidine)—are FDA-approved to treat ADHD. Wellbutrin (bupropion) and other antidepressants are often used off-label to treat ADHD.</p>
<div> <h3> Do non-stimulant medications work as well as stimulants? </h3> </div>
<a>The only way to know if a medication will work for you (or not) is to try it</a>; many with ADHD report trying multiple stimulants and/or non-stimulants before finding a medication that effectively manages their symptoms.
