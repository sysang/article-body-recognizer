<h1>Fed faces fresh pressure to raise interest rates as inflation hits 30-year high</h1>
<h2>Fed may not be able to 'stay on sidelines much longer' with inflation surging</h2>
<div><div><h2><a>The Federal Reserve says inflation is ‘not transitory’ is a ‘farce’: Economist</a></h2> <p>Johnson Smick International chairman and CEO David Smick provides insight into whether inflation is transitory.</p></div></div>
<p>"It is hard to see how the Fed will be able to stay on the sidelines much longer," said Matthew Sherwood, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. </p>
<a>531,000 jobs</a> – the U.S. central bank may have no choice but to raise interest rates as soon as next summer.
<p><a><u>FED TO TAPER BOND PURCHASES BY $15B A MONTH AS IT EXITS PANDEMIC-ERA POLICY</u></a></p>
<p>Traders are now pricing in at least two rate hikes in 2022, and about a 46% chance of a third increase, according to the CME’s FedWatch <a>tool</a>. </p>
<p>"Is this sufficient to force the Fed's hand?" Shah asked. "This long, long transitory period has to heap pressure on the Fed – and yet it is doubtful they will act before late-2022."</p>
<p>What the Fed did not address, however, is whether persistently high inflation has them reconsidering rock-bottom interest rates.</p>
<p>When it comes to raising interest rates in order to tamp down inflation, however, central bank officials are wary of retracting economic support too soon and derailing the U.S. recovery from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, he signed an executive order directing the federal government to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. He also rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, and attempted to pause oil and gas leases but was blocked by a federal judge.</p>
<p>Amid economic uncertainty, Biden tapped the U.S.'s strategic oil reserves in November. During that month, his administration also opened more than 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.</p>

<a>Amazon</a> founder Jeff Bezos issued a statement late Saturday about Friday night's
<a>warehouse tragedy</a> in Illinois, hours after he was blasted on social media for seeming quiet on the topic amid the latest flight of his Blue Origin spacecraft.
<p>"All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through the crisis. We extend our fullest gratitude to all the incredible first responders who have worked so tirelessly at the site."</p>
<p>At least six people were killed in an Amazon warehouse collapse after a tornado ripped through Edwardsville, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Fire Chief James Whiteford confirmed Saturday.</p>

<p>Dozens of others have been killed in a series of severe storms that struck five states, including Arkansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri. </p>
<p>But Bezos failed to mention his lost employees when he took to social media to applaud the successful landing of another of his space tourist missions. </p>
<p>While most of the commentors on his social media platform praised the mission, some pointed to Bezos’ carelessness.</p>
<p>"You should worry about the tornado situation more," one woman commented. </p>
<p>Another person asked, "Will any of your Amazon workers take flight?"</p>

<p>Others took to Twitter to voice their frustrations.</p>
<p>"Really struggling with my rage since Jeff Bezos blasted his major carbon polluting rocket this morning after Amazon workers died in a rare December tornado last night," one commenter said.</p>
<p>Search and rescue officials are still at the scene of the collapsed building trying to account for those who have not been recovered.</p>
<p>At least 30 people have been pulled from the building after it collapsed at roughly 8:30 p.m. Friday night.</p>
<p>Hours prior to Bezos' personal statement, an Amazon spokesperson addressed the Illinois tragedy in remarks to Fox News.</p>
<p>"We’re deeply saddened by the news that members of our Amazon family passed away as a result of the storm in Edwardsville, IL," the Amazon spokesperson said.</p>

<h1>The pet food shortage is real, and owners are scrambling. ‘It’s been a waking nightmare’</h1>
<h2>Food shortage had led some owners to feed their pets whatever they are eating at the moment</h2>
<p>After an online order didn’t show on time, Phyllis Pometta stopped at five different <a>stores</a> before she hit pay dirt. There it was on the shelf: beef stew-flavored dog food.</p>
<p>Ms. Pometta scooped up about four cans, which weren’t her preferred brand. She was desperate, with supplies of the food she usually bought for her dog nowhere to be found online or in stores.</p>
<p>Karmaa Pomeranian rescue, wasn’t as desperate. She sniffed the food and rejected it.</p>

<p>"It’s hard enough feeding [five] people," Ms. Pometta said, referring to her family. "I don’t want to be making dog food."</p>
<p>While shoppers scour stores and online vendors for videogame consoles and bicycles, pet owners like Ms. Pometta are questing after puréed fish and properly sized kibble, as supply-chain problems disrupt pet-food supplies.</p>
<a>Covid-19</a> pandemic, and pet owners are buying bigger volumes of food. Pet-food sales at supermarkets grew 6.9% over the past 52 weeks ended Nov. 27, compared with 2.3% for food overall, according to firm NielsenIQ.

<p>Serafin Burciaja said he has hit multiple Walmarts in his neighborhood in Chandler, Ariz., to look for small-bite dog food for his Manchester terrier, who is older and can’t chew big chunks.</p>
<p>"You want to feed them like family," Mr. Burciaja said. "It puts me in a bad place at times, just having the thought that it could run out at any time for quite some time."</p>
<p>In Lacey, Wash., Lynda Ryba drove an hour in November to buy about 80 cans of roasted chicken and rice for her cats at PetSmart—about a six-week supply.</p>
<p>"It’s nerve-racking, especially if we are getting down to the last cans," Ms. Ryba said. She said she now stockpiles cans of the Hill’s cat food whenever possible.</p>
<u>J.M. Smucker</u> Co. notified retailers in November that it would limit shipments of some pet-food products through January 2023, citing transportation challenges with the supply of wet food—which typically uses imported ingredients.
<div> <div><p>The crunch is putting some pet owners in a bind—particularly those whose pets require prescribed food or have dietary restrictions.</p></div></div>

<p>Still, it has been two months since Ms. Barnoschi has found Spinoza’s preferred variety. Spinoza—named after a graduate course on the philosopher—settles for poultry and beef-flavored food, but doesn’t purr or lick up morsels after meals.</p>
<p>"He looks at me with these sad eyes that are like, ‘Why won’t you give me the flavor I like?’ " she said.</p>
<p>"It’s breaking the bank to do it the Amazon way, but they are my babies," Ms. Crisp said.</p>

<p>The cats, who typically run around the house and meow in excitement near meal time, took just a few bites, he said. They looked at the food, sniffed it then wandered away before returning to reluctantly finish their bowls.</p>
<p>"Some of the cats have lost a pound or two just because they haven’t been getting consistent food," Mr. Whitten said. "It’s been a waking nightmare."</p>
<p>In Dallas, Valese Jones cooked beef and white rice for her 4-year-old Maltese-miniature pinscher mix when she couldn’t find dog food at the end of October. Cookie scrutinized the food, took a bite and walked away.</p>
<p>Ms. Jones, a public-relations manager, tried cooking chicken and salmon with rice instead. In the end, she said, "sometimes she just ate whatever I ate."</p>
<h1>CNN's John Harwood defends Biden after claim there is 'no federal solution' to solve COVID</h1>
<p>CNN’s John Harwood repeatedly defended <a>President Biden</a> after the latter came under scrutiny for recent <a>COVID-19</a> policies.</p>

<p>"Look, there is no federal solution. This gets solved on the state level," Biden said.</p>
<p>One example came from Harwood during Tuesday’s "New Day" the morning after Biden’s comments went viral.</p>
<p>CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona began by criticizing Biden’s response to the omicron variant and how his comments appear to be shifting blame.</p>
<p>"And this could really cost them politically," Zanona said. "At the end of the day, voters are going to be voting on whether or not they feel like the country has returned to normal. And it just does not feel that way right now."</p>

<p>Harwood quickly argued back that he only believed the comment to be a "throwaway line" and insisted that Biden was not shifting his responsibility onto the states.</p>

<p>Regarding the backlash against Biden, Harwood claimed that "more has been made of that, of that, little sort of polite beginning of the conversation than is warranted."</p>
<p>Co-host John Avlon replied "Fair point."</p>
