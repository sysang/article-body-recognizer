<div> <h3> How do Ritalin and Adderall treat ADHD? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> How does coffee affect the brain? </h3> </div>

<a>In the brain, caffeine</a> mimics the neurotransmitter adenosine, which accumulates to promote sleep and suppress arousal. Caffeine binds to those receptors, called A1 receptors, which blocks adenosine and prevents people from feeling tired.

<a>A new meta-analysis</a> blends the results of 28 studies that all took measures to mitigate this problem. Based on data from more than 600,000 participants, all told, psychologists

<a>Richard Haier</a>, professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine. “And yet there’s no doubt in my mind there will be a lot of misunderstanding about it.”
<li>Cognitive tests were taken before participants differed in their degree of education (e.g., before some dropped out of high school) and again afterward, sometimes decades later.</li>
<li>A policy change, such as an increase in the mandatory education level, resulted in some students staying in school for longer.</li>
<li>Students who made an age cutoff to begin schooling were compared with students who had not.</li>
<p>There is also the open question of how much a gain of one or a few IQ points—modest, given that an average IQ score is 100—matters for real-world outcomes.</p>
<a>has articulated</a>, is that if a whole year’s worth of studying raises IQ by just a couple of points, shorter-term cognitive training programs—the effectiveness of which has been
<a>disputed</a>—are unlikely to have much practical impact.

<h2> The Roots of Emotional Intelligence </h2>
<div> <h3> How self-aware is an emotionally intelligent person? </h3> </div>
<a>name an emotion</a> helps manage that emotion. Because of this, the emotionally intelligent have high
<a>self-confidence</a> and are realistic about themselves.
<div> <h3> Do the emotionally intelligent have a better handle on self-regulation? </h3> </div>
<a>emotion regulation</a>, or the ability to reduce how intense an emotion feels. Taking
<a>anxiety</a> down a notch is called down-regulation. The emotionally intelligent are able to shift gears and lighten mood, both internally and externally.
<div> <h3> Are the emotionally intelligent tuned into the emotions of others? </h3> </div>
<a>emotional signals</a> both from within oneself and from one's social environment could make one a better friend, parent,
<a>leader</a>, or romantic partner. Being in tune with others is less work for others.
<div> <h3> Are the emotionally intelligent more empathic? </h3> </div>
<a>empathic</a> are generally supportive of the people in their lives, and they easily modulate their emotions to match the mood of another person as well.
<div> <h3> Is emotional intelligence a valid construct? </h3> </div>
