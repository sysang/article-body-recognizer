<div><h1>For the first time in over 30 years, the EPA adds to its list of hazardous air pollutants</h1></div>
<h2>The move will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to curb the use of 1-bromopropane, a powerful dry-cleaning solvent linked to cancer</h2>

<div><div><p>It took over three decades, but the federal government finally expanded its list of chemicals too dangerous for Americans to breathe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By one.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that it took so long to add a single compound to a list Congress established in 1990 underscores the bureaucratic inertia that impedes any effort to protect Americans from harmful chemicals that businesses use every year.</p></div>
<p>“Putting it on the list was supposed to be easy,” said Adam M. Finkel, who used to direct the health standards programs at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and warned of the dangers of 1-bromopropane 20 years ago.</p>
<div><div><p>“I hate the term no-brainer, but this is a no-brainer,” he added. “It’s a toxic air pollutant, so it belongs on the list of toxic air pollutants.”</p></div></div>

<a>mercury</a> and lead — if it is “reasonably” anticipated to harm humans or the environment.
<div><div><p>The agency was supposed to make a decision within 18 months. But the delays spanned three presidencies.</p></div></div>
<p>Earthjustice senior attorney Tosh Sagar, whose group sued the EPA over the chemical, said its regulators “have trouble consistently following the law that Congress laid out in terms of protecting people” no matter who is president.</p>
<p>Obama administration officials didn’t draft a proposal approving the request until his last month in office, in 2017. The Trump administration <a>granted</a> the petition in 2020 but indefinitely delayed adding it to the hazardous list.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s taken them this long to act,” said Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Executive Director Faye Graul, whose members manufacture alternative chemicals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main lobbying arm in Washington, said they remain leery because the EPA has not yet said how it will curb the pollutant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The EPA is planning to propose a “regulatory infrastructure” for adding the chemical to the hazardous pollutant list this year, EPA spokesman Nick Conger said. It aims to finalize that rule by early 2023, he added.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Claire Parker</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In France, advertisements urging people to buy the latest Peugeots or Renaults will soon come with a caveat urging viewers or listeners to walk or bike instead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under a new regulation slated to take effect in March, French automakers will be required to include messages on car advertisements that encourage viewers to seek more environmentally friendly travel alternatives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The requirement is to apply to ads distributed on radio, television, in theaters, on the Internet and on big screens as well as to print ads. If advertisers fail to include the message, they can be fined up to about $56,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similar measures are already in place in France for food advertisements, which instruct French consumers to cut back on junk food and eat more fruits and vegetables.</p></div></div>
<a>French newspaper Le Monde reported</a>. Ads for the highest-polluting vehicles will be banned beginning in 2028.
<div><div><p>Transportation-related emissions <a>make up a quarter</a> of the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the European Environment Agency.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carmakers aired mixed reactions in French media to the upcoming advertising requirements. Volkswagen <a>told French media</a> it would follow the regulations, as did Hyundai’s French division.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am taking note, we will adapt,” Lionel French Keogh, chief executive of Hyundai in France, told Agence France-Presse. “Zero-emission transportation is the future.”</p></div></div>
<p>But he complained that the measure “stigmatized the automobile” and was “a bit counterproductive” since it does not distinguish between types of cars, even as the government tries to incentivize the use of electric vehicles.</p>
<div><div><p>Major automakers Renault and Stellantis, which sells the Peugeot brand, and U.S. carmaker Ford, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The typical residential customer would save $4.37 a month on electric bills, or $52.44 per year, if Virginia pulled out, Youngkin’s transition office said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia becomes the first Southern state with a goal of carbon-free energy</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a speech to the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce, Youngkin said he will take the state out of the RGGI, as the regional initiative is known.</p></div></div>
<p>Del. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), who is slated to become House speaker when Republicans take back control of the chamber in January, cheered the news, saying RGGI’s impact on climate change has been “negligible at best.”</p>
<div><div><p>Some RGGI supporters said they were disappointed and questioned Youngkin’s authority to single-handedly pull the state out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can assure you there’s a lot of lawyers ... that are busy going to the books right now,” said Sen. Lynwood W. Lewis Jr. (D-Accomack), who sponsored the legislation in the Senate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lewis said Virginia raised $227 million early this year in its first auction of carbon credits — money earmarked for flood preparedness across the state and energy-efficiency programs for low-income ratepayers.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The pick drew immediate blowback from environmentalists and elected Democrats from Richmond to Washington, who warned that Wheeler might not survive confirmation in the state Senate, which remains under narrow Democratic control.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I know he’s new to Virginia government and all but @GlennYoungkin does understand cabinet secretaries require General Assembly approval --- right?” state Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) tweeted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) called Wheeler “an anti-environment ideologue.” Sierra Club Virginia decried the move as “one of the most dangerous appointments in our state’s history.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“He is highly qualified and very competent,” said Stuart, who is considered one of the most pro-environment Republicans in the state Senate.</p></div></div>
<p>But Democrats, who greeted most of Youngkin’s prior appointments with shrugs, cranked out public statements — including those from outgoing state House speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (Fairfax) and U.S. Rep. A. Donald McEachin (Va.).</p>

<div><h1>More than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021</h1></div>
<h2>As climate-fueled extreme weather intensified last year, more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. The impacts of fires and severe storms also spread.</h2>

<a>wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes</a> in the suburbs of Denver. In between,
<b> </b>Americans suffered blistering heat waves, merciless droughts and monstrous hurricanes. People collapsed in farm fields and drowned in basement apartments; entire communities were obliterated by surging seas and encroaching flames.
<a>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, even before officials calculate the final toll of wildfires, drought and heat waves in the West.
<p>While the Federal Emergency Management Agency identified fewer climate-related disasters in individual counties last year, it declared eight of these emergencies statewide — the most since 1998 — encompassing 135 million people overall.</p>
<div><div><p>There is little doubt that the future will be worse. <a>Steadily rising temperatures</a> heighten the risk of wildfires, turbocharge rain storms, exacerbate flooding and intensify drought.</p></div></div>
<a>surged to near-record highs last year</a>. The Build Back Better bill, which contains the
<a> biggest clean energy investment in U.S. history</a>, stalled in Congress. The United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, produced pledges that put
<a>global average temperatures on track</a> to rise about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a degree of warming that would transform once unthinkable disasters into near-annual occurrences.
<p>2022 begins with two crucial questions still unanswered: Will the United States invest in ways to make extreme weather less destructive? And will the country lead the world in curbing warming before it becomes impossible for humanity to adapt?</p>
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>These questions loom over Louisville, Colo., Mayor Ashley Stolzmann, who lost much of her town to wildfire on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I lay awake the first night, not able to sleep from the fire, when I was evacuated from my house,” she said, “the first thing I thought of is: I need everyone to reduce their carbon emissions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado residents still reeling from mass shooting now contend with Marshall Fire disaster</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To lose whole neighborhoods is just so very sad and devastating and unexpected,” Stolzmann said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fires like that are not supposed to happen in densely populated suburbs. They’re not supposed to ignite in December, long after the first snows of the winter have usually fallen.</p></div></div>
<a>lasts more than a month longer</a> than it did four decades ago.
<div><p>“More people are living in more flammable landscapes,” said Chelsea Nagy, a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Earth Lab. “More people are going to be interfacing with disaster.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Post’s analysis of federal data shows that about 15 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced a declared fire disaster this year, a number that has been steadily increasing since 2018.</p></div></div>
