<p>A man who stabbed his girlfriend's dog with scissors has been banned from owning animals for 10 years.</p>
<p>Declan Milne, 22, from Edinburgh in Scotland, pleaded guilty to inflicting 14 stab wounds with a pair of nail scissors on the dog called Max—a 4-year-old black Labrador.</p>
<p>Following an investigation by the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Milne was charged for causing Max unnecessary suffering, according to a statement from the animal welfare charity.</p>
<p>In addition to the 10-year ban on owning animals, a judge sentenced Milne to a four-month restriction of liberty order—which requires him to remain at home from 7:30 p.m. to 7 a.m.—and also ordered him to complete 200 hours of community service.</p>
<p>Milne was brought to justice after the vet who treated Max's injuries became concerned that they were not accidental. The vet contacted the SPCA's animal helpline and an inspector, Fiona Thorburn, was assigned to the case.</p>
<p>Max belongs to the parent's of Milne's girlfriend. The family had left the dog with Milne and their daughter while they enjoyed a weekend away.</p>
<p>But at one point during the weekend, the girlfriend found the dog cowering in fear with feces all over the floor and on his tail.</p>
<p>She soon realized that Max was bleeding from several wounds spread out across his body. Milne's girlfriend also noticed that her nail scissors were missing and questioned her boyfriend about it, who said he knew nothing about the dog's wounds.</p>
<p>But when Milne presented the nail scissors to her, there was black hair on them. Investigators subsequently took the scissors away for forensic analysis and found dog blood and DNA on them.</p>
<p>After Milne's girlfriend discovered Max with the fresh injuries, she immediately phoned her family who returned home from their weekend away.</p>
<p>Thorburn said the dog sustained puncture wounds to his head, cheek, thighs and muzzle. According to the vet who <a>treated the dog</a>, the injuries were caused by stabbing deliberately with a sharp object.</p>
<p>"We are glad that Milne pled guilty and admitted to this appalling crime," the inspector said.</p>

<p>Some people infected with the Omicron variant have already had COVID twice before, new data shows.</p>
<p>In addition, the report highlighted 290 cases where people caught Omicron just 60 to 89 days after previously being infected with COVID a first time.</p>
<p>"This suggests relatively low remaining levels of immunity from prior infection," it added.</p>
<p>In August, the CDC highlighted a report from Kentucky that suggested unvaccinated people were more likely to get reinfected with COVID than the vaccinated.</p>
<p>"These findings suggest that among persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, full vaccination provides additional protection against reinfection," the report stated.</p>
<p>However, the study was carried out at a time before the Omicron variant had been found and may not be relevant to Omicron. Data has suggested that Omicron is more able to resist vaccines than the Delta variant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Omicron variant has <a>now been detected in every U.S. state </a>with more people expected to get infected in gatherings ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>Thousands of people in the country are reported to have been affected by travel disruption this week with <a>airlines canceling dozens of flights</a> due to the recent spike in Omicron cases.</p>
<p>In a statement reported by <a>various news outlets</a>, a United spokesperson said the variant had had a "direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation."</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Extreme Eruption Spotted From Earth's Nearest Feeding Supermassive Black Hole</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 12/24/21 at 7:39 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>The black hole at the heart of this galaxy, one of the largest and brightest objects in the night sky when viewed in radio waves, has a mass 55 million times that of the sun and is greedily consuming gas and matter that surrounds it.</p>
<p>The image produced by the team shows massive lobes of plasma stretching far beyond the limits of the galaxy. These are created as the black hole ejects material at near light speed.</p>
<p>This causes these "radio bubbles"—visible in the radio wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum—to grow over hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Benjamin McKinley, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), said that these emissions could stretch over one million light-years into space.</p>
<h2>Handling "Extreme" Radio Jets</h2>
<p>McKinley and the team conducted their observations with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope located in Western Australia. They combined these radio images with observations made in both optical and X-ray wavelengths.</p>
<p>Astrophysicist Massimo Gaspari, from Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics, said that the findings arrived at by the team conform to a model in physics known as Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA).</p>
<p>Gaspari also points out this study is one of the first to probe the multiphase CCA 'weather' over the full range of scales in such detail.</p>
<p>McKinely concluded: "In this research we've been able to combine the radio observations with optical and x-ray data, to help us better understand the physics of these supermassive black holes.</p>
<p>"We can learn a lot from Centaurus A in particular, just because it is so close and we can see it in such detail."</p>

<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>5 Unexplained Mysteries of the Universe</h1><div> By Ed Browne <time>On 12/25/21 at 6:00 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Some questions about the universe can quickly stray away from physics and into the realms of philosophy. What was before the Big Bang? Why is there something and not nothing?</p>
<p>Happily some of the biggest unanswered questions in physics can be quite neatly tied up as phenomena not explained by the Standard Model of Particle Physics.</p>
<p>In essence, the Standard Model is the current best theory to explain the most basic building blocks of the universe. It explains that all matter is made up of tiny particles called quarks and leptons and how other particles carry force.</p>
<p>But the Standard Model does not explain everything. It does not explain gravity, nor the phenomena of dark matter or dark energy.</p>
<p>Below are some of the most outstanding and still unsolved mysteries of the universe that the Standard Model has not explained.</p>
<h2>Where Is All the Antimatter?</h2>
<p>At the start of the known universe there was the Big Bang, an event around 13.8 billion years ago from which all known matter is thought to have sprung.</p>
<p>Scientists think that the Big Bang should have produced an equal amount of matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>An antimatter particle has the same mass as its normal matter counterpart, except its electric charge and some other qualities are opposite. They're produced as a pair, and if they collide, they turn into pure energy and are annihilated.</p>
<p>In the 90s, physicists thought that the universe would do either of two things over time: One, it would eventually collapse due to having so much stuff in it; Two, it would keep expanding but its density would cause it to slow down over time.</p>
<p>This is why they were puzzled when observations of distant supernovae showed that not only was the universe still expanding, it was accelerating.</p>
<p>The cause of this acceleration is still unknown. "Dark energy" is really just a placeholder name for whatever the cause is.</p>
<p>Scientists once tried to calculate that dark energy was caused by particles popping in and out of existence, but they came up with a number so big it had 120 zeros and, as <a>NASA</a> states: "It's hard to get an answer that bad."</p>
<p>Then there is dark energy's twin, <a>dark matter</a>. Dark matter is needed to explain why stars orbit their galaxies faster than they should, and why light is bent by the gravity of invisible objects.</p>
<p>The prevailing theory is that dark matter is made up of some hypothetical exotic particles.</p>
<p>Scientists think that together, dark energy and dark matter make up about 95 percent of the known universe. Just 5 percent is everything that we can directly observe.</p>
<h2>What Is the Mass of a Neutrino?</h2>
<p>Only a couple of decades ago, scientists thought that neutrinos—tiny particles that are everywhere <a>but also extremely hard to detect</a> as they barely interact with anything—had no mass.</p>
<p>Then, scientists in Germany established that there was an upper limit to how much mass a neutrino could have—just over one electronvolt, which is around 500,000 times less than an electron.</p>
<p>"We know that they have mass, since we've been able to measure neutrino flavor-changing behavior, which is determined by the difference in the neutrino masses, but we don't know the absolute scale of those masses."</p>
<p>Everything in the universe with mass has gravity—a force that attracts other things with mass towards it. The Standard Model does not explain what gravity is, nor does Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>
<a>BBC</a>'s Science Focus magazine.
<p>Scientists have wondered if it's possible to develop a quantum theory of gravity that would bring it together with the other forces, but so far this has not been possible.</p>
<p>One theory is that gravity may be delivered in chunks by a tiny particle called a graviton. But these have never been observed.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories have been around for decades, some of which have tended to stick around (and develop) more than others.</p>
<p>In recent years, particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic, new ones have surfaced, too.</p>
<p>Below, Newsweek has compiled a list of new conspiracy theories that have all since been debunked.</p>
<h2>Do Vaccines Make You Magnetic?</h2>
<p>A conspiracy theory that has spread since the start of the pandemic is that a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines causes people's bodies to become magnetized.</p>
<p>This misinformation was spread in part by social media videos in which people who said they were vaccinated stuck metallic objects like coins and fridge magnets to their arms, claiming the vaccine had caused this effect.</p>
<p>One version of the theory claims that magnetism was added to the vaccines in order to make its ingredients move around the body.</p>
<p>This conspiracy theory was widely debunked, not least because the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain metals or any ingredients that would produce a magnetic field, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states.</p>
<p>"What's interesting to me is I haven't seen anybody put a compass on their arm because a compass under a magnetic field gets disrupted," he added.</p>
<p>Another COVID-related conspiracy theory. The essence of the theory is that 5G mobile phone signals sent by new 5G towers are the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The theory states that the towers can cause COVID-19 by suppressing the immune system or somehow propagating SARS-CoV-2 via radio waves.</p>
<p>As fact-checking charity Full Fact has reported, neither claims are backed up by evidence and, in any case, the coronavirus pandemic is affecting countries that do not even have 5G infrastructure.</p>
<a>BBC</a> in April last year that the theory is "complete rubbish," adding that people's immune systems can be dipped by all sorts of things including being tired or not having a good diet.
<p>In addition, 5G radio waves sit on the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum, and are less powerful than light or the sun's rays. They are not strong enough to damage cells.</p>
<h2>Do Wind Farms Cause Cancer?</h2>
<a>Donald Trump</a>. Speaking at a Republican fundraising event in 2019, Trump told attendees: "If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer."
<p>The American Cancer Society told The New York Times in 2019 that it was "unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer."</p>
<h2>Was the Pentagon Developing a COVID-sensing Microchip?</h2>
<p>Earlier this year claims were made that the U.S. Department of Defense was making a COVID-sensing chip that could be injected into the body, invoking fears of an Orwellian nightmare.</p>
<a>CBS</a> in an interview that he had been told to "take pandemics off the table" and discussed research projects like a sensor that uses a light signal to indicate illness.
<p><a>Hepburn told Newsweek</a> that his interview had caused confusion and there was "no microchip, no electronics, none of that stuff," and that the technology would not be able to tell people if they had COVID-19 anyway.</p>
<h2>Did Humans Once Live on Mars and Destroy It?</h2>
<p>This theory was put forward via a TikTok video that gained many hundreds of thousands of views and likes.</p>
<p>In essence, the theory states that Mars is red because of the dust from nuclear blasts and that there is evidence that there had once been flowing water on the planet that humans had drained.</p>
<a>As Newsweek previously reported</a>, the theory does not hold up in part due to the timescales involved. The fossils of early humans in Africa come from between 6 million and 2 million years ago, according to the
<a>Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</a>, but Mars' watery past was billions of years ago.
<p>In addition, Mars is red because the surface is covered in iron oxide—also known as rust—and not nuclear dust.</p>
<p>Newsweek cited a report from the journal Nature in 2004 that suggested the reason for Mars' rustiness is that temperatures were not hot enough to melt iron oxide and allow it to sink to the planet's core, unlike on Earth.</p>
<p>"I do not know of any other explanation for Mars' rustiness," said John Murray, a planetary scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes in the U.K., at the time.</p>

<a>MDMA</a> are being assessed in clinical trials and showing promise for the treatment of a host of mental health problems, ranging from depression to PTSD.
<p>Last month, mental health care company Compass Pathways announced the results of a Phase IIb study—the largest psilocybin therapy trial ever conducted—that found the drug appears to be effective as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>Five years earlier in 2016, researchers at Imperial College London completed a small study that was the first trial to assess psilocybin as a treatment for this condition.</p>
<a>psilocybin</a> as a "breakthrough therapy"—an action intended to expedite the development and review of drugs designed to treat serious or life-threatening conditions—and much of the subsequent research on this issue.
<p>Among the participants in the 2016 study, published in <a>The Lancet Psychiatry</a>, was Kirk Rutter.</p>
<p>Five years later, Rutter, now 51, spoke to Newsweek about his experiences of the trial and its impact on his mental health. The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<h3>How was your mental health in 2016?</h3>
<p>So, I had a telephone screening with Imperial. They checked my notes to make sure I had had treatment and accepted me into the trial based on the screening. That was where the journey started.</p>
<h3>Had you tried psychedelics before?</h3>
<p>I was new to psilocybin and had never tried psychedelics before.</p>
<h3>What was your view of psychedelic substances at the time?</h3>
<h3>How many times did you receive the psilocybin during the trial?</h3>
<p>Twice. There was a 10 milligram session, which was fairly psychedelic, and then there was a 25 milligram session, which was the more potent dose.</p>
<p>I just think, generally, I started taking care of things I needed to. I still have the grief—not as bad as I did, it's still there—but I'm not feeling it all the time. So for me, it was really beneficial. It was overall a positive experience.</p>
<h3>So would you say you experienced lasting changes from those two doses?</h3>
<p>Yes, very much so. You have these insights and awareness of stuff. I think psychedelics are the difference between knowing something and then really absorbing it and feeling it.</p>
<h3>What's your view on growing interest in psychedelic therapy?</h3>
<p>I think it should be available. The efficacy of it looks good. It's been used for thousands of years. It's a very humane intervention.</p>

<div> Tech Science Tiktok <a>Science</a> <a>Earth</a></div>
<p>A video showing the satisfying way crystals can be pulled out of the ground has gone viral online, capturing the wholesome reaction to the find.</p>
<p>On December 8, TikTok user and self-proclaimed treasure hunter @pioneerpauly posted a clip of his friend and fellow crystal hunter Bryan Major, also known as @thecrystalcollector.</p>
<p>Filmed at Avant Mining in Blue Springs, Arkansas, the group managed to find and pull a pair of large quartz from clay. For many viewers, the satisfying process has shown them for the first time how crystals can be mined.</p>
<p>"Pulling out a pair of crystals out of the clay! Unearthing pretty things for the first time is a neat feeling," he captioned the video. The video has gained over 20 million views and 3.7 million likes at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Major begins by slowly pulling at the crystal lodged in the clay. "It's moving," someone can be heard saying off camera.</p>
<p>"This is larger than I thought, look at this," he said, as the "huge" crystal began to budge from the clay. The reveal of the quartz in its full length was met with "ooh" sounds from off-camera voices—something praised by viewers of the video.</p>
<p>"That's why he is the crystal collector," joked one person in the video, as the crystal was fully pulled from the clay. In a subsequent clip, a second almost-identical crystal was similarly pulled out too.</p>
<p>"It's even more satisfying to pull one out yourself," wrote @pioneerpauly, in response to the many comments explaining just how satisfying the clip was.</p>
<p>With so many viewers, many have rushed to express envy at the find. "It hurts to see other people living your dream," commented one user.</p>
<p>"I love the mutual excitement," added another.</p>
<p>"Where do I get a job like this?" asked one TikTok viewer.</p>
<p>By day, @pioneerpauly works as an actor, but in his spare time he hunts for gold and other treasures, including crystals, and shares it all online.</p>
<p>"Most of the time I enjoy gold prospecting but will do just about anything if it means getting outside," he said on his YouTube channel, which boasts over 200,000 subscribers. His TikTok account has over 300,000.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2021, a crystal called moldavite, believed by some to turn your life upside down, became a popular talking point on the app.</p>
<p>With over 493 million views on the hashtag, users recounted stories of breakups, losing friends, traumatic events, and even deaths after purchasing a moldavite crystal.</p>

<p>The Instagram Top 9 app creates a collage of your best posts from the last twelve months and then allows you to share this on your feed.</p>
<a>the newly debuted Playback feature,</a> but this will only let you create a video montage based on archived stories.
<a>Instagram Top 9</a> or the similar
<a>Best Nine</a> website. To reiterate, these are third-party applications, but they are entirely safe to use and
<a> have been around for many years now</a>.
<p>The following guide will explain precisely how to use the Instagram Top 9 feature and find your best performing posts of the year.</p>
<h2>How Does Instagram Top 9 Work?</h2>
<p>Instagram Top 9 takes your best posts of the year (the metric for this being how much engagement they have got from other users) and consolidates them into one photo that you can easily share on your social media feeds.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the cyber security implications of this, rest assured that it is safe, <a>but you can find more information about this in the blog post here.</a></p>
<h2>How To Get Your Instagram Top 9 in 2021</h2>
<a>In previous years</a> you were able to get your Instagram Top 9 by just heading to the relevant website, but if you try to do that now download it will just direct you to install a separate app onto your phone (using the corresponding
<a>Apple</a> or Android storefronts).
<p>Once the feature is ready (around New Year's Eve) all you will need to do is open the app, type in your Instagram handle, and then provide your email address.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the developers of the Top 9 app to ask when the 2021 feature will be ready. At the time of publishing, there has been no response.</p>
