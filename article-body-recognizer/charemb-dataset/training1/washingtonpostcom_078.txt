<div><div><p>In 1999, 279 people were sentenced to death in the United States, and 98 prisoners were executed. That year saw the most executions since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Things have changed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia abolishes the death penalty, becoming the first Southern state to ban its use</p></div>

<div><p><span>Daughter of slain sheriff’s deputy asks Va. governor to stop execution of her father’s killer</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>“We are seeing more and more family members saying that,” Dunham said, “and more and more prosecutors listening.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since 1976, 55 percent of those executed have been White, 34 percent Black and 8.4 percent Hispanic, while 75 percent of the victims have been White, compared with 16 percent who were Black and 7 percent who were Hispanic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dunham revealed another finding by the center: About half of the people on death row in the United States were sent there by about 1.2 percent of the counties in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other big jurisdictions have declared that they will no longer seek capital punishment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That tells us these are clear outliers,” Dunham said. “It also tells us how much these outliers distort the system.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In South Carolina, prosecutors twice tried to schedule executions without first obtaining the execution drugs, and prosecutors in Arizona tried to speed up the appeals process to execute prisoners before the drugs expired.</p></div></div>

<h2>Chief Thomas Manger seeks to rebuild force, add resources after after Jan. 6 breakdowns</h2>

<div><p>Ex-Montgomery, Fairfax chief J. Thomas Manger named new Capitol Police chief</p></div>
<div><p>Gus Papathanasiou, the head of the Fraternal Order of Police’s Capitol Police Labor Committee, agreed that “morale isn’t any better now than before January 6th,” because of forced overtime and restricted leave.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Papathanasiou also criticized Manger for not firing Yogananda Pittman, the assistant chief for protective and intelligence operations since October 2019.</p></div></div>
<p>Manger defended keeping Pittman on board. He noted that his predecessor, Steven Sund, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, the director of intelligence and a number of assistant and deputy chiefs all resigned in the wake of the Capitol riot.</p>
<b> </b>large incidents. He said the biggest failures on Jan. 6 were in intelligence, operational planning, the training and equipping of the civil disturbance unit, and the coordination with outside agencies, whether local police or the National Guard.
<div><div><p>He said he had hired nine new intelligence analysts and provided them with better training than previous Capitol intelligence analysts, and a new director of intelligence is to be named soon.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Capitol Police had intelligence indicating an armed invasion weeks before Jan. 6 riot, Senate probe finds</p></div>
<div><div><p>Keeping the rank and file informed helps spread information effectively, Manger said. After the attack, officers were provided department cellphones, which they did not previously have.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They get intelligence bulletins every single day,” Manger said. “In fact, they complain sometimes that now they’re getting too much information.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Papathanasiou said the phones were a sign of progress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manger has<b> </b>tried to maintain staffing by offering officers a $3,000 bonus if they sign an agreement that they will stay for at least another year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think around 90 percent or more of our officers signed the agreement,” the chief said. “So we’re going to have a lot less people leave this next year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officers who were with the department on Jan. 6 also got a $2,000 “hazard pay” bonus, Manger said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. Capitol Police inspector general says only a small number of recommendations after Jan. 6 attack have been adopted</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manger disputed a claim by the Capitol Police inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, that only 30 of 104 recommendations made by Bolton after the attack had been implemented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have addressed or are in the process of addressing over 90 of them,” Manger said, “and the inspector general has acknowledged that to me” with many classified as “resolved but open.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police said Wednesday he wants to hire 840 new officers to his force over the next three years to handle recent losses and future attrition and to increase the department’s capabilities.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Looking back on the events of Jan. 6, perhaps we should focus more on the false prophets who inspired the violence of that day than the rioters we still highlight on video loops.</p></div></div>
<a>the FBI is purging patriots from society</a> and that the “deep state” staged the Jan. 6 riot as a “false flag” to strip citizens of their constitutional rights.
<a>verbal assaults</a> targeting military heroes,
<a>the slandering of the U.S. intelligence community</a> and
<a>the nation’s democratic voting system</a> that would make Vladimir Putin blush with pride. These are the kind of anti-American screeds that fueled the Capitol riot, and they have been preached with increasing intensity since that tragic day.
<a>the greatest wealth redistribution in world history</a>, at the expense of the middle class.

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>
