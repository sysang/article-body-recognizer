<p>Local officials have also <a>faced punishment</a> over the outbreak and domestic flights scheduled to depart the city on Friday were cancelled.</p>
<p>Xi'An ChenXi Aviation Technology, a supplier of aviation technology to the Chinese military, said late on Friday it had temporarily suspended production due to the outbreak, which it expects to hurt its 2021 operating income.</p>
<p>Western Securities said on Friday its Xi'an-based branches have stopped offering face-to-face services to clients.</p>
<p>An oncology hospital said on Saturday its outpatient department and emergency room had stopped receiving patients due to COVID-19, after several other hospitals made similar moves.</p>
<p>China's nationwide figures confirmed 87 local symptomatic cases for Dec 24, up from 55 a day earlier. There were also 53 confirmed cases among international travellers on Dec 24.</p>

<p>BEIJING: China reported its highest daily rise in local COVID-19 cases in 21 months as infections more than doubled in the <a>northwestern city of Xi'an</a>, China's latest COVID-19 hot spot.</p>
<p>The city of 13 million, which entered its <a>fourth day of lockdown</a>, detected 155 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, up from 75 a day earlier, official data showed on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>That drove the national daily count to 158, the highest since China managed to contain a nationwide outbreak in early 2020.</p>
<p>Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported for the Dec 9 to Dec 25 period, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak, in line with Beijing's policy that any flare-up should be contained as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The city managed to quickly detect those cases through three rounds of mass testing, He Wenquan, a Xian official, told a press conference on Sunday, adding that high case numbers could persist into the next couple of days.</p>
<p>"In order to quickly screen out the infected groups of people, after an analysis by experts, we will step up control measures in key areas, especially places with greater risk level," said He.</p>
<p>The local government also announced that it would launch a city-wide disinfection campaign from 6pm local time, urging residents to shut the windows and bring clothes or other items inside from their balconies.</p>
<p>Restrictions on movement have also been tightened.</p>
<p>Each household can only send one member out to buy basic necessities once every three days - down from two days under previous rules.</p>
<p>All businesses except supermarkets, convenience stores and medical facilities have been ordered to close and residents may not leave town without approval from employers or local authorities.</p>
<p>The city has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant, although Chinese authorities have reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China.</p>
<p>Including imported cases, mainland China confirmed 206 new cases on Dec 25, up from 140 a day earlier.</p>
<p>No new deaths were reported, leaving the cumulative death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 101,077 confirmed cases as of Dec 25.</p>

<p>JOHOR BAHRU: A married couple in Johor who recently returned from performing the Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia have tested positive for the <a>Omicron COVID-19 variant</a>, said the state government on Sunday (Dec 26). </p>
<p>The pair had left Malaysia for Saudi Arabia on Dec 4 and returned on Dec 16 via Kuala Lumpur International Airport, said Johor Health and Environment Committee chairman R Vidyananthan.</p>
<p>"They did their arrival (polymerase chain reaction) test at the arrival hall and their result on Dec 18 showed that they had tested positive for COVID-19," said Mr Vidyanathan. </p>
<p>"The couple’s PCR results were also sent to the Institute of Medical Research where a genome sequencing process confirmed that it was the Omicron variant."</p>
<p>He added that the couple were presently isolating at home. Their close contacts have also been identified and instructed to isolate at home and monitor their health. </p>
<p>In his statement, Mr Vidyanathan also reminded Johor residents who are returning from overseas travel to adhere to the quarantine health protocols that have been set. </p>
<p>"Please remain in your respective rooms and do not meet with any housemates or other individuals," he said. </p>
<p>"Failure to do so could lead to the spread of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant, among our family and community."</p>
<p>Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin on Saturday said that Malaysia had reported 49 new Omicron COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>He added that 30 out of the 49 cases were from those who were returning from Saudi Arabia after performing Umrah. </p>
<p>Mr Khairy also confirmed that Malaysia has reported a total of 62 COVID-19 Omicron cases, with 61 imported infections and one case suspected to be a local transmission. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Hong Kong retailers forge new path without mainland Chinese tourists </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: Three years of democracy protests followed by a pandemic have devastated Hong Kong retailers who had grown used to relying on cash from mainland Chinese tourists.</p>
<p>In a city that once boasted some of the world's highest retail rents, the market has cratered.</p>
<p>But a border town has seized the chance to evolve its local economy.</p>
<p>Sheung Shui is the first town from the main overland border crossing and once thrived as a place where tax-free goods could be snapped up for resale back in mainland China - a process known as parallel trading.</p>
<p>"People's impression of Sheung Shui is of parallel traders and mainland China," said Eugene Chan, 22, who has lived in the neighbourhood since childhood.</p>
<p>Chan recalled pavements swamped by people filling their luggage with cosmetics, baby formula or household supplies to meet huge demand across the border.</p>
<p>But all that vanished in the wake of huge democracy rallies followed by pandemic-related border closures.</p>
<p>In January 2019, just before the protests began, arrivals from the mainland reached a record high of 5.5 million, a remarkable figure given Hong Kong's population is 7.5 million.</p>
<p>Two years later that figure fell below 3,000.</p>
<p>"That's a huge loss of demand," Simon Smith, senior director of research and consultancy at Savills, told AFP.</p>
<p>"That wave of mainland spending, particularly focused on luxury, watches, jewellery, designer goods, it really propelled rents to world-beating levels."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's popular shopping districts previously boasted "golden streets" where store rents were more expensive than those in New York City's Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Now, Smith said, shop rents in prime locations have undergone a "substantial correction" and regressed to 2003 levels, down more than 75 per cent from peak levels in 2013.</p>
<p>Analysts have noted a rebalancing to more local consumption, with some prime location stores in shopping areas taken over by more budget-friendly businesses.</p>
<p>Similar rent falls have been documented in Causeway Bay, another once eye-wateringly expensive shopping district.</p>
<p>In Sheung Shui, entrepreneurs like Dream Law have seized the opportunity to start businesses that cater more to locals - in his case a grocery store.</p>
<p>"During the boom of (mainland tourists), 80 to 90 per cent of businesses in the Sheung Shui market area catered to parallel traders," Law told AFP.</p>
<p>The inflated rents meant that community businesses - such as hardware stores, bookstores and cinemas - were priced out, he said.</p>
<p>"It felt like this community did not belong to us, and it had been that way for years."</p>
<p>The economic situation in border towns like Sheung Shui boiled over into protests starting from 2012 and was a major contributing factor to growing China-Hong Kong tensions over the past decade.</p>
<p>When the pandemic struck, Law saw a silver lining in the rock-bottom rents and started BeWater Mart, which focuses on "Made in Hong Kong" goods.</p>
<p>His store, along with a cafe and a pottery studio nearby, represent a wave of nascent businesses trying to respond to local demand.</p>
<p>"I hope Sheung Shui people can come back here to live and spend," Law said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, which has followed China's lead in adopting a strict zero-Covid policy, is now in negotiations to resume normal travel with the mainland in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>Polls showed that many Hong Kongers are eager to cross the border for business, tourism and family reunions.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's proposal of a daily quota, which is reported to be around 1,000, will not have a "significant impact" in boosting tourist spending back to pre-pandemic levels, Savills' Smith said.</p>
<p>On the eve of a border reopening, it remains unclear whether Hong Kong's retail economy will return to its mainland-dependent model or chart a fresh path forward.</p>
<p>Sheung Shui resident Chan said the border closure was just a "pause" and she was worried about parallel traders returning.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, she would focus on enjoying the present.</p>
<p>"I finally had one of my friends say they wanted to come visit Sheung Shui to try out a restaurant (...) it's a happy change," Chan said.</p>
<p>"The atmosphere is not as stifling or hectic, and instead it feels like a small community. I think everyone is breathing easier."</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s COVID-19 mobile application on Sunday (Dec 26) introduced a new feature that enables close contact tracing via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>“If you are confirmed positive, you can send the interaction data to the Ministry of Health for contact tracking process to be made. All interaction data is anonymised," he added.</p>

<p>PATNA, India: A factory boiler exploded in eastern India on Sunday (Dec 26), killing at least six workers and injuring six others, police said.</p>
<p>Rescuers were looking for any workers who may be trapped in the rubble of the factory that produced food snacks in an industrial area 95km north of Patna, the Bihar state capital.</p>
<p>The cause of the blast in Muzaffarpur was being investigated, said police officer Ram Naresh Paswan. He said the death toll was likely to rise as four of the injured were critical.</p>
<p>Panic gripped the area as the powerful explosion shook and damaged homes and factories in the Bela industrial area, media reports said.</p>
<p>Poor safety standards are a frequent cause of fires and explosions in India.</p>
<p>Last year, a major fire and a powerful blast rocked a warehouse storing chemicals, killing 12 people near Ahmedabad in western Gujarat state.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese dominated possession at Singapore's National Stadium but could not break down the resolute defence of the Thais, who have conceded only one goal in six matches on their run to the final.</p>
<p>The War Elephants will attempt to win the ASEAN football title for an unprecedented sixth time when they <a>face Indonesia in the final</a>.</p>
<p>Both legs will take place in Singapore with the first leg on Wednesday and the return game on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Vietnam coach Park Hang-seo made five changes to his line-up from the first leg and his team exerted much of the pressure as they sought to turn around the two-goal deficit.</p>
<p>But the Thai defence allowed few clear-cut chances despite suffering a blow in the 31st minute when goalkeeper Chatchai Bootprom had to be replaced after he was injured in a clash with Nguyen Tien Linh.</p>
<p>Siwarak Tedsungnoen came off the bench and made a good save shortly afterwards to keep out Nguyen Quang Hai's free-kick.</p>
<p>As the first half came to a close, Ho Tan Tai headed a corner narrowly wide and Quang Hai fired wastefully high over the crossbar as Vietnam turned up the pressure.</p>
<p>At the other end, goalkeeper Tran Nguyen Manh was called into action just before half-time as he made a fine save to deny Theerathon Bunmathan.</p>
<p>The Thais continued to frustrate their opponents after the interval with Vietnam's best efforts falling to Quang Hai, who sent a 49th minute free-kick narrowly wide before forcing Siwarak into a diving stop nine minutes later.</p>
<p>The replacement keeper also snuffed out efforts by Phan Van Duc and Nguyen Hoang Duc as the Thais gradually took the sting out of their opponents to seal their passage to the final.</p>

<h1> Commentary: India's year of beauty and a few beasts </h1>
<div> <p>From UN seats and economic rebounds to a Miss Universe win and several Olympic medals, it’s been quite a year for the country, says writer Aarti Betigeri.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aarti Betigeri </a> </div> </div>
<p>India also had an eleventh-hour soft power win in, of all things, the global beauty pageant Miss Universe, with India’s Harnaaz Sandhu winning the crown.</p>
<p>Normally, I would be mildly scornful, but this year it feels churlish to mock the joy that Indians are expressing over the victory, given the year they’ve had.</p>
<p>Sure, the contest is retrograde, but if it brings a measure of happiness to the masses, then it is worth every bikini-clad step.</p>
<p>The wins came a few years after the Indian economy deregulated in 1991, and triggered widespread jubilation as they were considered the ultimate symbol of India finally finding its place on the global stage.</p>
<p>This year’s winner is the first Indian Miss Universe since 2000 – coincidentally, the year she was born.</p>
<p>But in a sign of the times, news outlets are not breathlessly reporting her measurements, but rather that she is a passionate menstruation rights advocate and that her winning dress was by a trans designer. </p>
<p>India’s other major global achievement this year was at the Tokyo Olympics, taking out a record haul – seven medals, including one gold.</p>
<p>While paltry by international standards – particularly considering India’s population of 1.3 billion – it was the country’s best Olympic haul in more than four decades.</p>
<p>It is not a glory that the Indian government can rightfully claim, however, after it cut already meagre sports funding by eight per cent in the January budget (although it did have a special Olympic fund to help athletes).</p>
<p>India’s economy also looks hopeful, moving beyond the pandemic. It continues to rebound, with growth of 8.4 per cent in the September quarter, albeit lower than expected.</p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank has expectations of 9.7 per cent for 2021–22. However, the International Monetary Fund notes that the pandemic will likely result in more poverty and inequality, and recovery will not be even.</p>
<p>The healthy growth figures mask the wider reality.</p>
<p>Inflation is expected to rise and an estimated 10 million Indians in the formal workforce, and most likely vastly higher numbers in the informal sector, have lost their jobs, with many millions pushed below the poverty line.</p>
<p>India has been hit hard by the pandemic, and the after-effects will be felt for a long time, perhaps even generations.</p>
<p>But a sliver of silver lining is vaccination rates, with around three-quarters of the population having received at least one dose, and more than 1.2 billion doses administered overall.</p>
<p>It is no mean feat even for a country where the vaccine is manufactured in high volumes. </p>
<p>One of the less publicised, but still important, developments of the year was the move towards enacting a data protection bill, similar in scope to Europe’s General Data Protection Ruling (GDPR).</p>
<p>India is the second largest internet market in the world, only behind China, with nearly 800 million users, and there have been attempts to create privacy laws for a decade. The bill is currently before Parliament.</p>
<p>Something unusual also occurred in contemporary India this year: A successful protest.</p>
<p>This was a victory for thousands of protesting farmers who had camped out in Delhi for a year.</p>
<p>Politically, however, it appears that the screws are tightening.</p>
<p>The national government took steps throughout the year that all lead in one direction: An administration intent on consolidating its power, removing avenues for dissent, and clamping down on ideological issues such as inter-religious marriage.</p>
<p>India also refused to accede to the desires of rich nations at the COP26 climate conference, ending the two week meeting by insisting on softer language around coal, making it clear that developing countries have different needs and values.</p>
<p>Geopolitically, India continued to stare down China in the Himalayas, while strengthening its regional relationships, something that Australia benefited from.</p>
<p>The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) between India, Australia, Japan and the United States, is going from strength to strength, with its first in-person Leaders’ Summit in Washington, DC, in September.</p>
<p>Australia was also invited to take part in the Malabar maritime exercises in August, another sign of the deepening level of cooperation and trust.</p>
<p>But never one to pledge its troth, India joined hands with France in the wake of the AUKUS trilateral strategic defence announcement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. It never hurts to have numerous suitors.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2022, expect to see more of India on the global stage, whether it be at the UN Security Council or deploying its navy in the South China Sea – or calling for world peace from the beauty pageant pulpit.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> China talks up 'green' Olympics but prepares to fight smog </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>ZHANGJIAKOU, China : China is using the Winter Olympic Games to drive its efforts to improve the environment, but smog-prone capital Beijing is still preparing for the worst as the opening ceremony looms. </p>
<p>Beijing has improved its air quality since China won its bid to host the Games, but the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has said winter smog risks remained "severe". </p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Liu Youbin told reporters on Thursday that contingency plans were in place. </p>
<p>"When the time comes, Beijing and Hebei will be guided to adopt reasonable environmental protection measures in accordance with the law," he said. </p>
<p>Rumours that polluting heavy industries in the area would be shuttered from Jan. 1 were "not true", however, he said. </p>
<p>Since then, China has planted thousands of hectares of trees in Beijing and surrounding Hebei province, built sprawling wind and solar farms, and relocated hundreds of enterprises. </p>
<p>In Zhangjiakou city, 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Beijing and host to skiing and snowboarding events, 26-year-old amateur skier Deng Zhongping said he has already felt the difference. </p>
<p>"When I came to Beijing a few years back I would suffer with rhinitis because of pollution, but the air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei has improved a lot," he said. </p>
<p>"I think the air quality at Zhangjiakou ski resort is even better than some foreign ski resorts." </p>
<p>In 2016, average concentrations of PM2.5 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region stood at 71 micrograms per cubic metre and soared to more than 500 micrograms over winter. That compares to an average 40 micrograms from January to September this year. </p>
<p>The reading in Beijing was 33 micrograms in the first three quarters, meeting China's 35-microgram standard, although exceeding the recommended World Health Organization level of 5 micrograms and likely to rise much higher over winter. </p>
<p>"China will win many medals at the Winter Olympics, but the smog ... could plunge the Games into difficulties," the Washington-based International Fund for China's Environment said earlier this year.</p>
<p>Preparations have included a tree-planting programme that increased forest coverage in Zhangjiakou to 70per cent-80per cent, up from 56per cent previously. </p>
<p>China has also said it would make the Games "carbon neutral" for the first time. Environmental group Greenpeace, though, said without more data it would be hard to evaluate whether the goal was actually met. </p>
<p>Water scarcity is another concern, especially when it comes to creating artificial snow and ice. </p>
<p>"We are all self-sufficient and ecologically circular," said Wang Jingxian, a member of the 2022 Games planning committee. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Debt-crippled Evergrande vows 'full steam ahead' to deliver homes </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: Embattled Chinese firm Evergrande will deliver almost four times the number of housing units to buyers in December than in the previous three months, its chairman said, as the real estate behemoth grapples with massive debts.</p>
<p>Evergrande - drowning in US$300 billion in liabilities - has struggled to repay bondholders and investors after becoming ensnared in Beijing's deleveraging crackdown on the bloated property sector.</p>
<p>But the group - which officially defaulted on a major bond payment this month - has insisted it will be able to complete tens of thousands of units and pay off some debts.</p>
<p>"There are only five days left this month, we must charge full steam ahead to guarantee the delivery of 39,000 units this month."</p>
<p>The new homes are across 115 developments, he said.</p>
<p>"Absolutely nobody at Evergrande is allowed to 'lie flat'," Hui added, referring to an internet slang term for "slacking off" popular among young people.</p>
<p>In recent months, the company has repeatedly said it will finish its unfinished projects and deliver them to buyers in a desperate bid to salvage its debts, despite having missed a payment of more than US$1.2 billion earlier this month.</p>
<p>Earlier struggles to pay suppliers and contractors due to the debt crisis led to sustained protests from homebuyers and investors at the group's Shenzhen headquarters in September.</p>
<p>Since then, the bloated firm has tried to sell off its assets and shave down its stakes in other firms, with Hui paying off some of the debts using his own considerable personal wealth.</p>
<p>The provincial government of Guangdong - where the firm is headquartered - is currently overseeing Evergrande's debt restructuring process, but Beijing has yet to roll back any of the restrictions that prompted the housing crunch.</p>
<p>Having already blamed the firm's woes on "poor management and blind expansion", China's central bank vowed on Saturday to protect the rights of homebuyers and promote the healthy development of the real estate market.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Lakeisha Leo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Travellers who have received their Thailand Pass QR Code will be permitted to enter the country under the existing conditions of the scheme that they have registered for. </p>
<p>However, they will have to undergo two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said on Tuesday (Dec 21). </p>
<p>The second test will take place at a government-designated facility at no additional cost. </p>
<p>Those who have registered for the Thailand Pass, but have yet to receive their QR code, must wait for their pass to be considered or approved. </p>
<p>"Once approved, they can enter Thailand under the scheme they have registered," said the authority. </p>
<p>Thailand Pass is <a>a web-based system</a> for citizens and foreign travellers to declare their travel and health information in order to enter the country. </p>
<p>The announcement comes after Thai authorities on Tuesday said they would reinstate the country's mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for foreign visitors and scrap a quarantine waiver. </p>
<p>New applicants will also not be able to register to enter Thailand under the Test and Go scheme or Sandbox programme.</p>
<p>Travellers are then free to go anywhere in Thailand upon receiving a negative result, according to guidelines by the tourism authority. </p>
<p>From Dec 24, Travellers arriving in Thailand under the Test and Go scheme are required to take two PCR tests - one on arrival and the other on Day 6 or Day 7 of their stay, said the Singapore office of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. </p>
<p>"No quarantine is required for the second PCR test on Day 6 or Day 7 (taking arrival day as day 1)," it said.</p>
<p>After the second test, travellers are free to move around in Thailand while waiting for their test results. They will be informed of their test results through the <a>Mor Chana app</a> - Thailand's contact tracing app. </p>
<p>"If positive, the traveller would need to report to a local hospital (government or private) immediately." </p>
<p>The decision on Tuesday to halt Thailand's Test and Go waiver means visitors will have to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine, which ranges between seven to 10 days.</p>
<p>Thailand's sandbox programme, which requires visitors to remain in a specific location but allows them free movement outside of their accommodation, will also be suspended in all places <a>with the exception of Phuket</a>.</p>
<p>"Thailand Pass will only accept new applicants seeking to enter Thailand under Alternative Quarantine or Phuket Sandbox only," said the ministry. </p>
<h2>NEW APPLICATIONS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE</h2>
<p>Thailand's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration had ordered the temporary suspension on Tuesday, citing the rising number of Omicron variant cases in the country.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Thai government spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said about 200,000 visitors who had previously registered for the <a>quarantine waiver</a> and sandbox programme will still be eligible. </p>
<p>"This is not to shut off tourists but to temporarily suspend arrivals," he said, adding that the decision will be reviewed on Jan 4.</p>
<p>Responding to CNA's queries, the Royal Thai Embassy in Singapore said the new measures will be "officially announced in the Royal Gazette soon". </p>
<p>Singapore had launched its <a>vaccinated travel lane for Thailand</a> on Dec 14, allowing fully vaccinated passengers on designated flights from Thailand to enter Singapore without having to serve quarantine.</p>

<p>NEW YORK: New York's famous New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square will be drastically scaled back due to the pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday (Dec 24), as the Omicron variant fuels a "staggering" surge in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Typically some 58,000 New Yorkers gather to watch a giant ball drop marking the arrival of a new year, but next week the capacity will be reduced to 15,000, with each attendee required to wear a mask and prove they have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The additional safety measures "will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year," said de Blasio.</p>
<p>Times Square was<a> largely empty on New Year's Eve</a> last year, with only essential workers and invited guests able to watch the ball drop from socially distanced areas.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China punishes dozens of Xi'an officials as city grapples with COVID-19 lockdown </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: Dozens of officials have been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi'an, China's disciplinary body said on Friday (Dec 24) - the latest state reprimands under Beijing's strict zero-COVID-19 approach.</p>
<p>China, where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February in the capital Beijing.</p>
<p>The world's most populous nation has reduced cases to a minimum thanks to a zero-COVID-19 strategy of tight border restrictions, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns.</p>
<p>But cases have been bubbling up in recent weeks - with Xi'an, home to the world-famous Terracotta Warriors, telling <a>all 13 million residents to stay home</a> from Thursday, shuttering businesses and launching several rounds of mass testing.</p>
<p>The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Friday that 26 Communist Party officials had been punished for "insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak".</p>
<p>Xi'an reported another 49 cases on Friday, bringing the total outbreak to more than 250 in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Chinese officials who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded.</p>
<p>The statement said inspections had revealed there had been a lax approach to testing and an uncoordinated response that hindered contact tracing in Xi'an.</p>
<p>Authorities would clamp down on "bureaucratic issues in disease control work such as shirking responsibility, not taking action, passing the buck and dealing with things in a negative way", a party discipline official said.</p>
<p>A party secretary in Inner Mongolia was sacked after his area was hit by a cluster of cases in October, while the head of Zhengzhou city's health commission was sacked in August after cases this summer.</p>
<p>Cases from Xi'an have so far spread to five other cities including Beijing, according to state media - fuelling fears about how quickly the virus can spread geographically across the vast country.</p>
<p>Under lockdown rules, since Thursday all households in Xi'an have only been permitted to send one member outside every two days to purchase necessities.</p>
<p>Residents who want to leave the city must first apply for approval, while major venues including the museum housing the Terracotta Army - the mausoleum of China's first emperor - have been shut until further notice.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China expects COVID-19 cases due to Winter Olympics arrivals, flags Omicron risk </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Officials also sought to alleviate concerns about healthcare for participants prompted by COVID-19 as well as an accident last month in a luge training session at the Beijing venue during which a Polish slider suffered a severe leg injury.</p>
<p>The fast spread of Omicron in North America led the National Hockey League to announce on Wednesday that its <a>players will not participate in Beijing</a>, depriving the Games of the star power of the sport's biggest names.</p>
<p>Officials gave a detailed breakdown of medical personnel and facilities available to handle COVID-19 cases, sports injuries and general medical care and expressed confidence the Games can proceed despite the highly infectious Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe these COVID prevention measures can reduce the risk of infection spreading, and can ensure the health of the athletes and other games personnel," said Huang Chun, another official with the organising committee.</p>
<p>Besides designating 18 hospitals for Olympics personnel, Beijing is building two clinics of at least 1,500 sq m each which will be open 24 hours and staffed by English-trained doctors, officials said.</p>
<p>Noting criticism that emergency help had been slow, Han said that was because of an international standard whereby the athlete's team doctor must make an assessment first before first-aid personnel can provide assistance.</p>
<p>The competition venues in Beijing will have 74 ambulances and 1,140 on-site medical personnel, including an orthopaedic specialist at every site and equipment for CT dental scans at ice hockey venues.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysia pauses transition to COVID-19 endemic phase over new Omicron variant </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's efforts to transition to an endemic phase will be put on pause as the government looks to find out more about the <a>new COVID-19 Omicron variant</a>. </p>
<p>Senior Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein on Tuesday (Nov 30) said the government was aware that the variant has not only spread in South Africa, but also to several other countries including Italy, Australia, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“Although we have not heard of any cases in our country to date, precautionary actions will continue to be implemented," he said at a press conference after a meeting of ministers handling the country's pandemic response.</p>
<p>Malaysia's government had previously set seven criteria that needed to be achieved before the health ministry could declare the country as entering the endemic phase of living with the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The criteria included the number of beds being utilised in hospitals, intensive care units and COVID-19 low-risk quarantine and treatment centres; testing capacity at laboratories and the rate of positive cases.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin said the health ministry was also seeking more information on the incubation period, symptoms and infectiousness of the Omicron variant, and would make an announcement on the matter soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the government would impose stricter border controls on countries where the new variant was prevalent, he said. </p>
<p>Commenting on South African President <a>Cyril Ramaphosa</a>'s call for the lifting of travel restrictions on the country, Hishammuddin said the decision was based on security risks and advice from the health ministry. </p>
<p>"We do not want to jeopardise what we have been doing for one and a half years with irresponsible actions," he said.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa on Monday urged countries around the world to immediately lift the travel ban to the country, which he described as being "unjustified and unfair". </p>
<p>Also addressing the risk of reopening the Malaysia-Singapore border via the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) following the spread of the new variant, Hishammuddin said it was being monitored.</p>
<p>“The Quartet meeting took note of the discussions between the two Prime Ministers (Malaysia and Singapore) on the potential of having more destinations (with the VTL implemented), such as Singapore to Penang, Langkawi, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu.</p>
<p>"I have asked all parties to continue to think and discuss, but we will not make a decision until we know the real effects and impact of this new variant," he said.</p>

<p>The panel decision sets the stage for shipments of 200,000 doses across the country from this weekend, based on preparations announced earlier by Kishida.</p>
<p>US regulators on Thursday <a>authorised the Merck pill</a> for certain high-risk adult patients.</p>
<p>Merck is known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Countries rushed to buy Merck's molnupiravir after very promising initial results, but subsequent company data in late November indicated the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought. France cancelled its order on Wednesday.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why China will uphold its zero-COVID policy for a long time to come </h1>
<div> <p>Omicron may have created an initial feeling of vindication. There are also important political milestones in the next six months, says Hong Kong Baptist University’s Yew Wei Lit.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Yew Wei Lit </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Amid the worldwide panic over the spread of Omicron, China is feeling vindicated for sticking to its zero-COVID-19 strategy. All it needs to do at the moment is stay the course.</p>
<p>With expanding vaccination coverage and loosening social and travel restrictions, the world had thought that it was on track for a post-pandemic recovery. But the recent Omicron variant outbreak shows we are far from being out of the woods.</p>
<p>Omicron, designated a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization, has now circulated globally since it was first discovered in South Africa, appearing to be more contagious than previous variants of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In response to the many unknowns of Omicron, most countries have slammed their borders shut for specific southern African nations, while a few others, such as Israel and Japan, opted to completely ban foreign arrivals. </p>
<h2>CHINA IS FEELING VINDICATED</h2>
<p>Indeed, Chinese media has seized the latest development to justify the country's zero-tolerance policy, claiming that the nation is an “impregnable fortress” against the virus </p>
<p>To be sure, China was not the only country that pursued this zero-COVID policy. </p>
<p>Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, were once determined to stamp out the existence of the virus within their communities. </p>
<p>Yet, they all fell like dominoes, as they abandoned this strategy in favour of “living with the virus” as recent as two months ago. With masks, vaccines and safe-distancing, caseloads could be bearable for hospitals.</p>
<h2>WHY CHINA IS HOLDING ONTO A ZERO-COVID STRATEGY</h2>
<p>As the rest of the world normalises co-existing with the virus, why does China remain so steadfast in its commitment towards zero-COVID?</p>
<p>A key reason is China’s enormous population size. To Chinese policymakers, the zero-COVID strategy is - and has been - effective in buying precious time for rolling out vaccinations to all of its citizens. </p>
<p>To put this in context, China’s national drive to vaccinate its population of 1.4 billion people is roughly equivalent to vaccinating the combined populations of Europe and North and South Americas. </p>
<p>Moreover, China has set for itself ambitious targets: 80 per cent vaccination rate by the end of this year (it has exceeded the target by reaching 82.5 per cent), and eventual full vaccination to establish herd immunity to the virus. </p>
<p>More time is also needed for China to manufacture homegrown mRNA vaccines as potential booster shots, since current Chinese vaccines have shown lower efficacy than mRNA jabs.</p>
<p>More recently, China’s top respiratory disease expert, Dr Zhong Nanshan, who is also a key shaper of China’s early COVID-19 strategy, suggested that the virus’s fatality rate must reach the levels of influenza before normalcy is restored.</p>
<p>In other words, a shift in China’s COVID-19 policy remains a distant prospect. </p>
<p>Crucially as well, the quality and capacity of healthcare services across China is highly uneven. The virus could easily overwhelm medical providers in underfunded localities and the countryside.</p>
<p>Beyond these practical reasons, China’s current approach is also borne out of their experience in dealing with the virus’ ground zero. </p>
<p>By all measures, the costly strategy was effective, as it brought infection cases to zero in Wuhan by April 2020. The Wuhan model would then become the China model.</p>
<p>Under a toxic combination of Western xenophobia and geopolitical tensions, China was then unfairly blamed for “causing” the global spread of the coronavirus. </p>
<p>From developing its own vaccine and rejecting the entry of foreign vaccines, to distributing homegrown vaccines to poorer countries as part of its vaccine diplomacy, China is eager to chart its own way in dealing with the pandemic. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Dr Zhong hit on the mark when he pointed out that how long the zero-COVID policy would last “depends on the virus-control situation worldwide” in November. But this also speaks to the potential unsustainability of China’s approach.</p>
<h2>WHY A ZERO-COVID STRATEGY IS CHINA’S REALITY FOR A WHILE MORE</h2>
<p>Large parts of the world have already been treating COVID-19 as endemic, in part because many scientists believe that the virus may keep mutating, with new strains popping up from time to time. </p>
<p>Even then, the current Delta variant outbreak that has enveloped at least 21 Chinese provinces, with the largest Delta outbreak ever just last month, is a case in point. Two Omicron cases have since been found in China too this past week.</p>
<p>As long as the virus remains unchecked in certain parts of the world, there will be new dangerous variants that could extend the clock of China’s zero-COVID policy. </p>
<p>President Xi Jinping seems to have recognised this threat when he pledged to deliver 600 million vaccine doses to Africa last month.</p>
<p>Yet, China’s zero-COVID strategy will likely be retained for most of next year. After all, important stages are being built for victorious proclamations by China early next year. </p>
<p>And while there has been an obvious post-pandemic economic slowdown, China’s large domestic market and technological self-sufficiency have so far staved off pressures to reopen its borders.</p>
<p>And if experiences from other parts of the world haven’t made it clear enough, pandemic policies are as much a political decision as a scientific response. </p>
<p>Unless there is large-scale public disgruntlement, Beijing will likely not reverse their stance anytime soon. So far, there is little to lose and so much to gain politically for China’s persistence in a zero-COVID strategy. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Hong Kong mandates COVID-19 tracing app for most adults in bars, restaurants </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: The Hong Kong government made its check-in app mandatory for most adults in bars and restaurants on Thursday (Dec 9), the latest expansion of coronavirus tracing tech at a time of heightened privacy concerns in the city.</p>
<p>The international finance hub has kept infections at bay thanks to mostly closed borders, some of the world's strictest quarantine rules and ongoing social distancing rules.</p>
<p>No local infections have been recorded in months, but the city is further ramping up virus measures, aligning with China's zero-COVID-19 strategy as it <a>seeks quarantine-free travel with the mainland</a>.</p>
<p>From Thursday, all adults under 65 must use the city government's COVID-19 app, scanning QR codes to log their presence at 18 types of premises - including eateries, cinemas, gyms and karaoke venues.</p>
<p>The logs can be used to trace infections if there is an outbreak.</p>
<p>Children and the elderly were exempted at the last minute after a public backlash against the proposal to make the app mandatory for all.</p>
<p>The Leave Home Safe app has been in use since November 2020, but until Thursday, it was not mandatory and people could still fill out paper slips when entering venues.</p>
<p>Chum Tak-shing, a local district councillor in Sham Shui Po, said many older residents who are not exempted in his working-class district do not own, and cannot afford, a phone to run the app.</p>
<p>"(They) are now having to spend nearly HK$1,000 (US$128) on a smartphone and a new SIM card they don't necessarily need," he told AFP.</p>
<p>Coronavirus contact tracing has got caught up in Hong Kong's febrile politics as China cracks down on dissent in the city.</p>
<p>Despite assurances about data security from the authorities, concerns have swirled about how information collected by the app will be stored - and how it may be used.</p>
<p>User information on Hong Kong's check-in app is currently linked to phone numbers, not names.</p>
<p>Mainland China, however, uses a tracing app that is linked to people's identities.</p>
<p>Last week, Hong Kong announced anyone wishing to travel to the mainland would need to download a version of that app.</p>
<p>Some restaurants and venues within Hong Kong's "yellow economy" - businesses that supported the city's now dismantled democracy movement - have often refused to use Leave Home Safe as a form of protest.</p>
<p>A number of them are considering going takeout-only to avoid using the app.</p>
<p>Oscar You, co-founder of local online delivery platform Lingduck, told AFP that queries from eateries looking to sign on to his service had risen 30 to 40 per cent ahead of the app mandate roll-out on Thursday.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> China urges real estate project acquisitions to aid struggling developers </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) recently issued a notice to financial institutions, urging them to strengthen financial support for such acquisitions, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Over the past months, Chinese regulators have marginally eased funding curbs on the real estate sector, to prevent debt risks spreading from struggling developers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Property Holdings.</p>
<p>Regulators are urging Chinese banks to actively provide lending to fund acquisitions of projects owned by cash-strapped developers, and avoid cutting, or withdrawing, loans to these companies, China Securities Journal reported.</p>
<p>But only the acquisition of real estate projects, rather than acquiring stakes in the struggling developers, would be encouraged, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, developers without financial problems are also being encouraged to issue bonds to fund such acquisitions, and PBOC is urging financial institutions to invest in such debt instruments, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Developers including China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings plan to issue debt instruments via the interbank market in the near term to fund mergers and acquisitions, local media has reported.</p>
