<div><div><p>The birthrate in America fell 4 percent last year, marking the biggest annual decrease in decades — suggesting the coronavirus pandemic has taken the country’s already existing downward trend into overdrive.</p></div></div>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<div><p>2020 Census shows U.S. population grew at slowest pace since the 1930s</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a shock but not a change in direction,” Cohen said, noting a continuous decline in birthrates since 2007.</p></div></div>
<div><p>White House closes in on ‘families plan’ spending proposal centered on child care, pre-K, paid leave</p></div>
<div><div><p>For some, the pandemic brought long-cherished plans to a crashing halt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hannah Crabtree and her fiance, Joshua Abramsohn, were in the middle of in vitro fertilization — an already emotionally and physically draining process — when the pandemic hit.</p></div></div>
<p>Crabtree, 30, of Falls Church, Va., had just finished a procedure to have her eggs retrieved when their fertility clinic shut down. By summer, the offices were open again and Crabtree was ready to move forward — but Abramsohn was not.</p>
<div><div><p>So when the couple got vaccinated in January, they scheduled an embryo transfer. The pandemic had cost them precious time, but at least everything was back on track.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two months ago, that first transfer ended in a miscarriage, devastating them both.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She is grateful she is still relatively young, she said. She and Abramsohn still have hope.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But any declines caused by the coronavirus pandemic are negligible compared with the overall direction of the country’s fertility rate, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let’s say covid reduces births by a few hundred thousand,” Levine said. “In a country of 330 million, that just is not that big of a deal if it’s just a one-shot thing.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fact that the United States now has around 700,000 fewer births annually than it did in 2007 is much more significant, Levine said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last year’s downturn was most significant among teenagers, continuing a long decline in birthrates for that group, and women between 35 and 44, an age group in which births had been increasing since 2007.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Older women would be a prime target because having a second or third child would be harder in last year’s environment,” Levine said.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>The U.S. birthrate is falling. Here’s how other countries have tried to persuade people to have more children.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>It remains to be seen what long-term effects the pandemic may have.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before the pandemic, Niki Akhaveissy, a 27-year-old lawyer in Dallas, had planned to have her first child by the time she turned 30, assuming she would find a partner by then.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So two months ago, Akhaveissy got an intrauterine device, or IUD, inserted to prevent pregnancy, she said. Now, the only thing she is certain of is that she does not plan to have a child anytime soon.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“At this point, I don’t even know if I want to have my first child by 35,” Akhaveissy said. “The more I think about it, it’s just not financially feasible for me to have a child at all right now.”</p></div>

<section> <div> <div> <div> <div><a>National</a></div> <div> <div> <h1>Pope Francis tells couples not to substitute dogs and cats for children</h1> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <div> By Josephine Mckenna | Religion News Service </div> </div> </div> </div> June 2, 2014 </div>
<p>VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday (June 2) warned married couples against substituting cats and dogs for children — a move that he said leads to the “bitterness of loneliness” in old age.</p>
<p>The pope made his comments as he celebrated daily Mass with 15 married couples in the chapel at the Santa Marta residence where he lives inside the Vatican.</p>
<p>He reminded the couples, whose marriages ranged from 25 to 60 years, of the need for faithfulness, perseverance and fertility in maintaining a Christian marriage.</p>
<p>But he went a step further and strongly criticized those couples who choose not to have children, saying they had been influenced by a culture of “well-being” that says life is better without kids.</p>
<p> “You can go explore the world, go on holiday, you can have a villa in the countryside, you can be carefree,” the pope said.</p>
<p> “It might be better — more comfortable — to have a dog, two cats, and the love goes to the two cats and the dog. Is this true or not? Have you seen it?</p>
<p> “Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness.”</p>
<p>The 77-year-old pontiff made his comments after recent figures confirmed a drop in birth rates in the U.S., Italy and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Last year, Time magazine provoked a national debate with a controversial issue entitled “The Childfree Life,” which also showed a dramatic fall in the U.S. birth rate and the role of personal choice.</p>
<p> “Married life must be persevering, because otherwise love cannot go forward. Perseverance in love, in good times and in difficult times, when there are problems: problems with the children, economic problems,” the pope said.</p>

<div><div><p>The official word from Beijing is that China’s population is still growing — if barely.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to the census, China’s population reached 1.41 billion in 2020, up from 1.40 billion in 2019. Average annual population growth over the past decade was 0.53 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The population growth rate will continue to slow down in the future,” said Ning Jizhe, a commissioner of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, at a news conference in Beijing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>China needs a baby boom to avert a demographic crisis. Small steps won’t be enough.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ning declined to forecast when China’s population will peak but said the overall figure will remain above 1.4 billion for a while into the future.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chinese economists have warned of a potential demographic crisis if not enough children are born in coming years — leading to societal strains as fewer young people work to support a larger aging population.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked about the delay at the news conference, the statistics bureau’s chief methodologist, Zeng Yuping, said officials decided to push back the release to add more details into the report, given the public interest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s why it took longer to prepare the data,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The numbers hinted at challenges ahead for China. Ning said there were only 12 million births in 2020, down from 18 million and 17 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Compared with 2010, the number of working-age people age 16 to 59 decreased by 40 million. The census put the average age of the Chinese population at 38.8, higher than the United States’ 38.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The last time China’s population recorded a decline was in the 1950s, after Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” campaign for farmers to switch to steelmaking resulted in a deadly famine.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Beijing has taken further steps to promote births. China’s National Health Commission announced in February a pilot program to lift birth restrictions in the northeast rust belt provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the state-run Global Times this week that there is no doubt that China will fully lift birth restrictions in the near future to counter the declining birthrate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>China is still the world’s most populous country, but with India narrowing the gap. The United Nations estimated India’s population in 2019 at 1.37 billion.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“What I am proposing is a whole new era for New York,” said Hochul in the annual State of the State speech, delivered to a largely empty chamber due to the ongoing pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hochul said the time of unproductive rivalries between the governor and other elected officials in New York was over. “We’ll fight like hell — not for turf, not for credit, but for New Yorkers,” she said.</p></div>
<div><p>Hochul, 63, is the first woman to serve as governor of New York. For years, she stood in the shadow of former governor Andrew M. Cuomo, one of New York’s <a>most dominant</a> — <a>and domineering</a> — politicians.</p></div>
<a>a state investigation found that he had sexually harassed 11 women</a> and taken steps to retaliate against an accuser. This week, the Albany County district attorney
<a>declined to prosecute a charge of forcible touching against Cuomo.</a>

<div><p>Lawmakers say Hochul has already initiated a dramatic change in tone and conduct in a state where Cuomo’s decade in office was marked by a climate of intimidation, something that coexisted with significant policy achievements.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It was always personal” under Cuomo, Biaggi said, “whereas this is very professional.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesman, declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While Hochul served as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor for six years, their relationship was chilly. “It is no secret that the governor and I are not close,” she said <a>in a television interview last year</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cuomo reportedly tried to remove Hochul from their joint ticket in 2014 and 2018. More recently, <a>he had sought a post for her in the Biden administration</a> to choose a new running mate ahead of a planned fourth term.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Even Hochul’s choice of venue for the speech was a break with her predecessor. Cuomo had shifted the annual event out of the legislative chamber and into a cavernous convention center in Albany.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hochul has worked to “dissolve the combative relationship” between the governor and legislators that was a feature of Cuomo’s tenure, Nnaemeka said. But “what’s the road map, what’s the vision?”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Bragg, the city’s first Black district attorney, said these changes will not only make people safer but also “free up prosecutorial resources to focus on violent crime,” according to the memo.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside a district attorney's campaign to reform the Austin, Texas police department</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Data, and my personal experiences, show that reserving incarceration for matters involving significant harm will make us safer,” he wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts like Southerland anticipated the policies will likely prompt some resistance from police and the public at a time when the city has seen a rise in crime.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Garland vows to prosecute Jan. 6 riot criminals 'at all levels,' whether at the Capitol or not</p></div>
<div><div><p>While Bragg has discretionary authority to implement the new policies, he said he looked forward to holding “discussions” and working with the union and other parties in the following weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We urge judges to not stand in the way of these long overdue and necessary reforms,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added his assistant district attorneys would seek no more than a maximum of 20 years in prison for most crimes, except for extraordinary circumstances, and would never ask for a life sentence without parole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, Bragg instructed prosecutors to consider the impacts of incarceration on public safety, communities and the financial costs, as well as the “racially disparate use of incarceration.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ghislaine Maxwell lawyers say they will seek new trial after jurors claim history of sexual abuse</p></div>
<a>Twitter</a> that the new guidelines will allow prosecutors to focus on “real robberies, not a harmless person who walked into a store to steal underwear with a hand in his pocket.”
<div><p>According to the <a>Gothamist,</a> New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer who has vowed to crack down on crime, praised Bragg’s “vision” Tuesday, but stopped short of further commenting on the new policies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I have not looked over and analyzed exactly what he’s calling for,” he said when asked about the changes at a news conference Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>

<div><span><div><span><div>By Maura Ewing</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Marisa Iati</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Timothy Bella</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>María Luisa Paúl</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><div><p>“Please keep all of these folks, and especially these children, in our prayers,” Mayor Jim Kenney (D) said at an emotional news conference. “Losing so many kids is devastating.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The siblings each had multiple children, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, but it remains unclear whether all of them were home at the time or how many of them may have died.
<div><div><p>“Everybody is still in shock,” Purifoy said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Firefighters said they arrived at the three-story, 2,300-square-foot rowhouse, operated by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, in the 800 block of North 23rd Street about 6:40 a.m. and saw flames shooting up from the second floor.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a news release Wednesday night that revised the number of dead, the city said firefighters removed “one child from the building, but the child did not survive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witnesses told local media that they were awakened by screams coming from the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Loved ones, many warmed by blankets, formed a prayer circle nearby. Vanessa Price, 46, said she was a cousin of a family that lived in the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s our brothers, sisters, daughters,” she said of the fire victims. “We just got to keep them in prayer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Price said it was particularly sad that so many were children. “They didn’t get a chance to experience life,” she said. “It’s a loss people don’t want to wake up to.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alice Wright, 80, said she cried in her home before walking three blocks to the scene of the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just wanted to see what I could do,” said Wright, a lifelong Philadelphian. “Provide clothes — something.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Red Cross said it is providing emergency assistance for a family of five people displaced by the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The blaze was brought under control about 50 minutes after the firefighters arrived, officials said. Officials had not determined the fire’s origin or how smoke detectors failed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The home had a number of working smoke detectors, powered by lithium batteries meant to last 10 years, at its last inspection, Murphy said, but several were not operating at the time of the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was unclear what started the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A Philadelphia museum kept the bones of a Black child killed in a police bombing. Decades later, it’s apologizing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This unimaginable loss of life has shaken all of us at PHA. It is too early for us to say more,” Jeremiah said. “Our primary goal right now is to support our residents in any way we can.”</p></div></div>
<a>Philadelphia Inquirer</a> and
<a>CNN </a>that the building has had no violations.
<div><div><p>The house is yards from an elementary and middle school and the Eastern State Penitentiary, a former prison, in a neighborhood that is home to several of the city’s museums.</p></div></div>
<a>the 1985 MOVE bombing</a> — which started a fire that killed 11 — and
<a>an inferno in 1850 that killed 44</a> in the Old City neighborhood.
<div><p>The child injured in the blaze was taken to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, while an adult was transported to Temple University Hospital. Hospital officials declined to describe their conditions as of Wednesday afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Everybody in this neighborhood gets along,” he said, standing by his porch with a cigar in hand. “It’s a good place to raise kids.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an anomaly to have so many people die,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The shock of the fire reverberated throughout the city.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This punched you in the gut,” Philadelphia City Council President Darrell Clarke told reporters, visibly shaken. “It’s just so tragic. I don’t know what to say.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neighbors said the shrieks woke them up early Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s something you can’t reverse time on,” he said. “It’s shocking to see something like this happen so close to home — and to know that these are faces I’ve seen for years.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>On Dec. 30, a tipster called local authorities to report a significant number of items dumped near an intersection in Luther, Okla., police said.</p></div></div>
<p>Inside one of the garbage bags, investigators found an envelope with a name and an address that eventually led them to an even larger discovery inside a home in Luther, Sheriff Tommie Johnson III said during a Wednesday <a>news conference</a>.</p>
<div><div><p>“Everywhere we looked there were packages,” Tye said.</p></div></div>
<a>announced</a> it had arrested and charged three people in connection with the “massive Amazon theft ring” that left thousands of customers without packages they were supposed to receive by Christmas.
<p>Those charged include Cesar Yasnier Cerqueira Rojas, a third-party driver for Amazon; 37-year-old Dinneris Matos Delgado, the owner of the truck allegedly used in the scheme; and 38-year-old Maikel Perez Laurencio, also a third-party driver.</p>
<p>The three face<b> </b>15 felony counts of possession of stolen property and embezzlement. Matos<b> </b>was also charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance after authorities found meth in her personal belongings, police said.</p>
<div><div><p>Cerqueira, Matos and Perez could not immediately be reached by The Post early Thursday. It is unclear whether they have lawyers.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>At the news conference, police also said they had been informed of a possible<b> </b>third dump site in the Luther area.</p></div></div>
<p>“There are probably going to be some more packages that will be recovered as well,” Tye said. He said the third dump site is probably connected to the first two, along with the Amazon packages found inside the Luther residence.</p>
<div><div><p>Tye said Amazon is now in possession of all packages recovered at the Luther residence so the company<b> </b>can redeliver them.</p></div></div>

<p><b/>Attorneys for the former longtime paramour of<b> </b>disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein are preparing<b/> to seek a new trial on the grounds that Maxwell’s first was fundamentally unfair. A judge will consider the issue later this month.</p>
<div><div><p>Defense lawyers made the request Wednesday, based on news articles that quoted one juror saying he used his past to convince others on the jury to believe Maxwell’s accusers, despite some gaps and inconsistencies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Photos included with some of the articles indicate the juror is a 35-year-old executive assistant in the finance sector who was referred to as Juror No. 50 during anonymous voir dire proceedings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maxwell, 60, was found guilty on Dec. 29, after four women testified that she groomed and recruited them as teenagers to give sexualized massages to Epstein, and in some cases groped them herself.</p></div></div>

<p>In 2015, a federal appeals court in New York granted a new trial to a former Deutsche Bank broker in what was considered the biggest tax-fraud case in history on the grounds that a juror in the case lied about substantial matters in her background.</p>
<a>told Reuters that he didn’t recall </a>being asked about sexual abuse history and that he breezed through the questionnaire.

<b> </b>He was asked about his social media habits, replying that he had deleted his accounts “because I just got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them.”
<b> </b>he appeared to announce his participation on the jury in an Instagram post, calling it “an incredible, surreal experience and an honor to serve our country!” He also
<b/> posted a selfie taken in front of the federal courthouse in early November in which he is playfully sticking out his tongue.
<div><p>How some states are trying to address racial disparities in juries</p></div>
<div><div><p>Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison based on her conviction. Her trial spanned four weeks and featured nearly 30 witnesses, including the four accusers, unfolding in pandemic conditions with the omicron variant bearing down.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It would be both expensive and complicated to launch<b/> a new trial, and some legal observers said Thursday that they were skeptical that Nathan would order a redo.<b/></p></div></div>
<b> </b>is rare for a judge to overturn a conviction after making careful rulings and decisions to ensure a fair trial. Judges tend to be wary of wading too much into the jury process, which is secret and generally protected.
<div><div><p>Outside of egregious examples, “there’s a certain acceptance that jurors bring personal experience into deliberations,” DuCharme said.</p></div></div>
