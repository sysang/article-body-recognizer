<p>Q: Do you enjoy the penalty kill?</p>
<p>Q: What are you most proud of that has enabled you to get where you’re at?</p>
<p>Q: What is the biggest obstacle you’ve had to overcome?</p>
<p>Q: Describe your on-ice mentality.</p>
<p>A: I would say hard to play against, someone that’s gonna always be there for teammates, and try to be a team player.</p>
<p>Q: If you could pick the brain of any player in NHL history, who would it be?</p>
<p>Q: If you could have a breakaway on any goalie in NHL history?</p>
<p>A: Dominik Hasek. Just loved his style. I just loved a goalie that just battled like he did.</p>
<p>Q: Where were you during the Boston Marathon tragedy?</p>
<p>Q: Why is that charity a cause for you?</p>
<p>Q: Describe winning the 2015 NCAA championship.</p>
<p>Q: What is your best single hockey moment?</p>
<p>Q: Who were your favorite members of the Red Sox growing up?</p>
<p>A: Dustin Pedroia; Jonathan Papelbon; David Ortiz obviously; Manny Ramirez.</p>
<p>Q: How often did you go to Fenway?</p>
<p>A: I went a lot, actually. My family owns a bar right outside of Fenway, they actually just sold it right before COVID hit, so they kind of hit the lottery there. It was called The Baseball Tavern, so all my cousins and stuff would work there.</p>
<p>Q: Who were your favorite Celtics growing up?</p>
<p>A: Paul Pierce. Ray Allen was awesome, but definitely Paul Pierce, me and my brother had Paul Pierce jerseys.</p>
<p>A: Sergei Samsonov, Joe Thornton. When they won the Cup in 2011, I was a big fan of the Merlot line — it was Daniel Paille, Shawn Thornton and Greg Campbell — so it was kind of like what my role is on New York a little bit.</p>
<p>Q: Who was your boyhood idol?</p>
<p>A: I would probably just say my dad. Someone I always looked up to. He was my coach in minor hockey and all the way up.</p>
<p>Q: How about hockey-wise?</p>
<p>A: Joe Thornton. I was always a big fan of his when he was on the Bruins, someone that I like kind of tried to model my game after. I’m not similar in any which way, but someone when I was younger I thought I could be.</p>
<p>A: Tom Brady, Tiger Woods, Larry Bird.</p>
<p>Q: How did you feel about Brady leaving the Patriots and winning the Super Bowl last year for the Buccaneers?</p>
<p>A: Obviously I was really disappointed when he left, just like any other Pats fan, but I was obviously still a fan of his. Once the Pats weren’t in it, I was rooting for Tampa and once again this year I’m rooting for Tampa now.</p>
<p>A: “Shawshank Redemption.”</p>
<p>Q: Favorite singer/entertainer?</p>
<p>Q: Describe Rangers fans.</p>
<p>Q: What’s it like being a New York Ranger?</p>
<p>A: It’s special, it’s something I definitely don’t take lightly. I remember when I was signing here how proud I would be to be able to put that Original Six sweater on for the first time.</p>
<p>Q: Is this team a legitimate Stanley Cup contender?</p>
<a>we have a really good team dynamic</a> that you don’t really see much in pro hockey. It’s a little bit more business-oriented ’cause it is a business, but this team seems special with the group we have.
<p>Q: Does it remind you of your Providence College national championship team?</p>

<h1> Hoax Grace Kelly mansion in NYC sells for $25M</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 4:10pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 5:15pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A palatial NYC home got a little boost from a princess to help it sell.</p>
<p>A Manhattan mansion where Grace Kelly allegedly once resided — despite no supporting evidence of her ever living there — has finally sold for $25 million, The Real Deal first reported.</p>
<p>However, the building’s celebrity pedigree is a long-running scam dating back to 2013, The Post reported last year. </p>
<p>When reached by The Post, Millian said he was repeating the Kelly story based on what he’d been told by the owner and late real estate manager Paul Ender, who was deep in debt and then seeking $48 million for the deteriorating townhouse.</p>
<p>Since buying the enormous property — the result of two twin 1889 apartment buildings being combined into one in 1947 — Ender treated it like a piggybank, and its mortgage stood at $15.25 million at the end of 2016, public records show.</p>
<p>Other A-listers falsely rumored to have had a history with the address include Harry Belafonte, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and George Soros.</p>
<h1> Despite work-from-home worries, Manhattan office real estate is doing just fine</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 9:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 9:25pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>But does it portend a dystopian future of deserted office towers, attended by a collapse of the tax base largely dependent on the economic clout of those towers?</p>
<p>Nope — despite panic over a report showing companies are pitching more jobs than ever to the work-from-home crowd.</p>
<p>“It’s only going to get worse,” warned Partnership for New York City CEO Kathryn Wylde about findings by research firm Emsi Burning Glass. It’s “a big cultural shift, and I don’t see it reversing.”</p>
<p>The Post exclusively reported the scary survey Monday. It showed that of major companies’ December job postings, work-from-home positions jumped to 10.6% of all openings, or 25,800 of a total 243,000.</p>
<p>That’s a near-quadrupling of early 2020’s 4% remote-job offerings.</p>
<p>But as Charlie Chan was prone to say, “Contradiction, please.” The countervailing view shrugs off some companies’ repeated postponements of return-to-office dates.</p>
<a>major firms continue to renew huge leases</a> — such as law firm Fried Frank at One New York Plaza downtown and Madison Square Garden Entertainment at 2 Penn Plaza in Midtown. Both re-signed for more than 400,000 square feet each.
<a>pharmaceutical-software developer Schrödinger at 1540 Broadway</a> and spirits-maker Suntory at 11 Madison Ave.
<a>inked for a quarter-million square feet at Five Times Square</a>. That triples its New York space. Wait — isn’t Roku the kind of company, with its young and tech-savvy workforce, you’d expect to send everyone home?
<p>Some of the new leases were signed at rents above $100 per square foot, the longtime benchmark for the classiest tenants in the fanciest buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, overall Manhattan office leasing jumped by a robust 8.3% in the fourth quarter, undeterred by Omicron. There’s still plenty of space available, and rents are lower overall — but that hardly amounts to a sinking ship.</p>
<p>More large deals might be announced soon, possibly including for IBM and investment firm Franklin Templeton at One Madison Ave.</p>
<p>Sure, Manhattan buildings’ total value is down — how could it not be in today’s climate? — but no owners have yet been observed jumping off their roofs.</p>
<a>how effectively Mayor Eric Adams can tame crime and homelessness</a>, especially in the subways and at Penn Station. An unexpected new viral strain on the heels of receding Omicron could further delay back-to-office plans.
<p>But assuming no further catastrophes, the city and Manhattan especially will recapture their allure to the best and brightest careerists — and the skyline won’t go dark any time soon.</p>

<h1> Historic Wonder Bread factory in Hoboken turns into luxury building</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:26pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:26pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>People are leaving the Big Apple to live in a former Wonder Bread factory.</p>
<p>Located in Hoboken, the historical factory sits directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan, and has been been transformed into a luxury residential building.</p>
<p>Known as Wonder Lofts, a nod to the famous bread brand, it prides itself on the expansive, “suburban-sized” layouts within its 83 condos — 60% of which reportedly sold within a few months of its opening.</p>
<p>Floor plans of the newly built residential units range from 1,200 to 2,700 square feet of living space. Prospective buyers have the option of a two bedroom unit that sells for $1.25 million, and up to five bedrooms at a cost of around $2.4 million.</p>
<p>“It was very important to the civic leaders in Hoboken and the neighbors in the community that the Wonder Bread building be preserved, which we agreed with,” Fourniadis said.</p>
<p>The building’s original brick detail, archways, high ceilings, large windows, an 80-foot-tall chimney stack from its factory days is now the focal point of a passively landscaped common courtyard.</p>
<p>Features of each residence include large window facades, smart home entry systems, designer kitchens and baths, walk-in closets, and room for abundant storage.</p>
<p>New Yorkers increasingly want the perks of comfortable suburban living, with the excitement and modern conveniences of life in the city, according to Fourniadis. </p>

<p>The COVID-19 curse has struck Marea, the celebrated, Michelin-starred restaurant on Central Park South.</p>
<p>But a source told The Post that “more than 20 were infected both in the kitchen and front of the house.”</p>
<p>Marea appears to be the first major Big Apple eatery to close temporarily over a COVID outbreak.</p>
<p>Lee said, “Our rule has been for everyone to be double vaccinated even before it became the actual requirement.”</p>
<p>She said managers called everyone who made a reservation during the three-day shutdown — presumably a lot of calls for a place with 160 indoor seats that serves both lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>Marea draws a cavalcade of celebrity diners including Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Beyonce and Jay-Z, “Real Housewife” Terisa Giudice and art gallerist/producer Edward Tyler Nahem.</p>

<h1> Andrew Cuomo resigns as governor of New York</h1>
<div> August 10, 2021 12:14pm <div> Updated <div> December 30, 2021 7:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Cuomo’s resignation marks an ignominious end to the Democrat’s three-term run as governor, the same number of terms to which his late father — Gov. Mario Cuomo, whom the younger Cuomo idolized — was elected. </p>
<p>By resigning before his term ends, Andrew Cuomo will not match the three full terms as governor that the family patriarch served. </p>
<p>“Wasting energy on distractions is the last thing [the] state government should be doing.”</p>
<p>The impeachment fight, he said, would “consume government.”</p>
<p>“It will cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” he went on. “It will brutalize people.”</p>
<p>“This situation, by its current trajectory, will generate months of political and legal controversy. That is what we’re going to have. That is how the political wind is blowing.”</p>
<p>Cuomo went 11 minutes into the speech before making the stunning announcement, which made him the third New York governor in a row to be forced out of office amid scandal after David Paterson and Eliot Spitzer.</p>
<p>In the speech, he once again sought to cast allegations of sexual harassment and groping as politically motivated — an argument that has not recently helped the scandal-scarred governor’s political standing. </p>
<p>Though he said he took “full responsibility” for his actions, Cuomo claimed “generational differences” of which he was previously unaware led him not to realize that his actions are not kosher in the 21st Century. </p>
<p>“In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said. “But I didn’t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn.” </p>
<p> “There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn’t fully appreciate,” he added. “And I should have – no excuses.”</p>
<p>Cuomo’s resignation will be effective in 14 days, the governor said. </p>
<p>Now, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who served as a member of Congress from 2011 to 2013, will assume the role of governor, becoming the first woman to lead the Empire State.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hochul commended Cuomo’s opting to leave office.</p>
<p>“I agree with Governor Cuomo’s decision to step down. It is the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers,” said Hochul, 62.</p>
<p>“As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor.”</p>
<p>Cuomo arrived in Manhattan from Albany by helicopter before taking a motorcade to his Midtown offices on Third Avenue, near Grand Central.</p>
<p>Photos showed him accompanied by his daughter, Michaela, and top staffers, including his longtime right hand, Melissa DeRosa, who recently announced her own resignation.</p>
<p>Attorney General Letitia James, whose office’s report delivered a death blow to the governor’s attempt to keep his job, said the resignation ended a “sad chapter” for the Empire State.</p>
<p>“Today closes a sad chapter for all of New York, but it’s an important step towards justice,” James said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The ascension of our Lieutenant Governor, Kathy Hochul, will help New York enter a new day,” she added.</p>
<p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie called Cuomo leaving office “the right decision.” </p>
<p>“This has been a tragic chapter in our state’s history. Governor Cuomo’s resignation is the right decision,” he said in a statement. “The brave women who stepped forward were heard.”</p>
<a>Mayor Bill de Blasio</a>, state 
<a>Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins </a>(D-Yonkers),
<a> Heastie</a> (D-Bronx), and 
<a>Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams</a>.
<p>Governors of neighboring states <a>followed suit</a>.</p>
<p>Even President Joe Biden <a>said</a>, “I think he should resign” in the wake of the attorney general’s probe.</p>
<p>Initially, Cuomo promised to fight, releasing a bizarre, pre-recorded video that included a montage of the governor kissing and touching people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his attorneys took to attacking the credibility of several women who accused him and attempted to undercut the report by arguing it was process driven the credibility of James’ investigation.</p>
<a>jumped ship</a> following the release of James’ probe, as did 
<a>Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs</a>, formerly a close ally, leaving Cuomo with few backers. By the day after James’ office’s findings were released, a 
<a>majority </a>of state Assembly members favored impeachment.
<a>survey showing</a> that 70 percent of voters believed the governor should resign, and 63 percent were in favor of state lawmakers impeaching him.
<p>The meltdown continued late Sunday when DeRosa, second-most powerful person in state government, <a>stepped aside</a>.</p>
<a>Brittany Commisso</a> — previously identified in James’ report as “Executive Assistant #1” — 
<a>revealed her identity</a> and 
<a>spoke on national TV about her creepy encounters</a> with the 63-year-old governor.
<p>Beyond his career, Cuomo now faces potential legal repercussions for his behavior.</p>
<p>Commisso, 32, charges the governor groped her on two occasions — allegations that <a>mean Cuomo could face</a> “a couple” of misdemeanor charges as a result of a criminal complaint <a>she filed</a> in Albany.</p>
<a>Prosecutors</a> in at least five New York state counties — including Nassau County, Manhattan, and Westchester County as well as 
<a>Albany</a> — have 
<a>launched separate</a> criminal probes following the report’s substantiations of forcible touching of multiple women. 
<a>spending time fighting for political survival</a> — including by orchestrating a failed deal to agree not to seek a fourth term in exchange for lawmakers dropping their impeachment process — 
<a>New York state’s bureaucracy came</a> “to a grinding halt,” lawmakers and sources told The Post.
<p>The sexual misconduct was just one of the scandals confronting the 63-year-old governor as he announced he would step down.</p>
<p>But it was the attorney general’s report into Cuomo’s harassment and office that landed first — and proved to be a knock-out punch.</p>
<p>“This investigation has revealed conduct that corrodes the very fabric and character of our state government, and shines light on injustice that can be present at the highest levels of government.”</p>
<p>In a previous statement, Cuomo called that woman’s account “gut-wrenching,” but denied inappropriate physical contact with her or anyone else — a denial he has repeated frequently since the scandal erupted.</p>
<p>The floodgates opened in late February when Lindsey Boylan, 36, penned a Medium article accusing Cuomo of kissing her on the lips without warning and suggesting that they pass a flight by playing strip poker.</p>
<p>Less than a week later, Charlotte Bennett, 25, told the New York Times that Cuomo asked probing questions about her sex life that left her convinced he “wanted to sleep with” her.</p>
<p>Those allegations spurred bipartisan outrage and resulted in James’ office launching an independent investigation — despite the administration’s efforts to control the probe.</p>
<p>And as James investigated, women kept coming forward.</p>
<p>On March 1, Anna Ruch, 33, alleged that Cuomo grabbed her and kissed her cheek as she tried to pull away at a 2019 wedding — the first time they met.</p>
<p>And on March 6, another two former staffers went public.</p>
<p>Ana Liss, 35, told the Wall Street Journal that Cuomo once kissed her hand, asked if she had a boyfriend and made other remarks that left her feeling like “just a skirt.”</p>
<a>grabbed her</a> in a “very long, too long, too tight, too intimate” embrace inside a dimly lit hotel room in Los Angeles.
<a>offered a conditional apology</a> “if [his accusers] were offended,” while denying allegations that he touched anyone inappropriately.
<p>At the time, he vowed he would not resign.</p>
<p>James’ report affirmed the accounts offered by those women — and uncovered another victim, a state trooper assigned to the unit tasked with protecting Cuomo.</p>
<p>The trooper, who has not been publicly named, told investigators that Cuomo had her transferred to the Protective Services Unit following a chance meeting at the RFK Bridge in 2017, despite her not meeting the qualifications for the unit.</p>
<p>The sexual harassment scandal exploded as Cuomo was already under fire his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Though Cuomo quietly shelved the policy in May 2020, he never fully admitted to its potentially fatal implications, as the death toll among nursing home residents rocketed into the thousands.</p>
<p>Two separate analyses revealed that the state directive to admit COVID-19-positive patients was responsible for more deaths in the facilities.</p>
<p>A report by The Empire Center — using data obtained by The Post — put the number of additional nursing home deaths potentially <a>caused by the policy at about 1,000</a>.</p>
<p>It revealed that the policy had a greater effect upstate because of how prevalent the virus was in the five boroughs and suburban communities.</p>
<p>Under scrutiny, the Cuomo administration refused for months to fully account for deaths linked to nursing homes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>They would only reveal the number of people who actually died in the facilities, not the number of residents taken to hospitals with the virus where they perished.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker only released the full figures after a report by James in January estimated that the state’s tally was undercounting nursing home linked deaths by as much as 50 percent.</p>
<a>refused to release requested documents</a> because it feared a summertime federal probe from the Trump administration.
<p>Trump’s Justice Department did launch a civil rights probe into the management of publicly-owned facilities run by the state — a small percentage of all nursing homes overall — that was later closed by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>However, DeRosa’s admission caught the attention of federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who subsequently opened their own probe into the matter, which is still ongoing.</p>
<p>As Cuomo sought to contain the mushrooming scandals, the tactics that he’d used to squash other political problems before came under scrutiny — particularly complaints of bullying and berating from lawmakers and reporters.</p>
<p>Cuomo — who served as state attorney general after he was secretary of housing and urban development under President Bill Clinton — has disputed Kim’s characterization of the call, insisting he never threatened him.</p>
<p>Along with the rampant sexual harassment documented by the attorney general’s probe and nursing home controversy, Cuomo faced an inquiry into the $5.1 million book deal he inked for his pandemic memoir.</p>
<p>The book became a best-seller in 2020, after Cuomo’s daily televised pandemic briefings made him a pandemic-era hero for many worried liberals.</p>
<p>But sales of the book dropped when he became embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, and the publisher of the memoir stopped promoting it.</p>

<h1> NY state cap blocks Queens charter school for struggling kids</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> April 18, 2021 6:43pm <div> Updated <div> April 19, 2021 12:01am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A proposed Queens charter school aimed at struggling high school students can’t open — because the state Legislature won’t raise the charter school cap on expansion.</p>
<p>The Urban Dove Team Charter School III was planned to open in western Queens, in the district of powerful Senate Deputy Majority Leader Mike Gianaris.</p>
<p>But the school hasn’t been able to go ahead as New York has hit the cap for more charter schools, and lawmakers rejected pleas for an expansion as part of the recent state budget.</p>
<p>Urban Dove CEO Jain Nanda said the charter school would serve a pressing need — there are only five other second-chance transfer schools in all of Queens, and none in District 30, where the alternative school would be located.</p>
<p>“There’s a huge need and now we can’t fulfill that need,” Nanda said.</p>
<p>“This is an example of politics at its worst, It’s a shame,” Nanda said.</p>
<p>Urban Dove operates two other successful transfer charter schools in the south Bronx and Brooklyn, taking in students who are failing, behind in credits and over age and in danger of dropping out.</p>
<p>All students are required to participate as a group on sports teams and health and fitness programs. Boys and girls are put in separate classes to prevent distractions.</p>
<p>Urban Dove also has a longer school day, from 8:15 a.m. to 4:30.</p>
<p>The planned Queens school would enroll 300 students and class sizes would be as low as five students to one teacher, to help students get back on the academic track toward graduation, according to officials. </p>
<p>One Urban Dove graduate, Kendell Herinn, 22, told The Post that the second-chance charter school saved his life.</p>
<p>“I had gotten left back in ninth grade. I had less than 10 credits,” said Herrin, who is now an assistant coach at Urban Dove in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He said he was lost in high school and transferred to Urban Dove and graduated in 2016.</p>
<p>“It was a very family-oriented space. They treated me like I was family. If I didn’t go to Urban Dove I would have dropped out,” Herrin said.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of staff members who kept on top of me to do my work,” Herrin said.</p>
<p>Herrin urged state lawmakers to increase the cap so Urban Dove can help teens in Queens. </p>
<p>“I’m disappointed with the legislature. The cap is stopping more more kids from getting a better education,” he said.</p>
<p>“You can’t stop greatness.”</p>
<p>The overall graduation rate for all Urban Dove students is 57 percent over five years, significantly higher than students with the same profiles in other high schools, according to Nanda. </p>
<p>The graduation rate for 15-year-old students with less than 11 credits who transfer to Urban Dove is 71 percent, compared to 32 percent for “peer” student in the same category at other high schools, Nanda said.</p>
<p>Ironically, in a Jan. 2, 2019 letter to the state DOE, Gianaris raved about the proposed school and mission, and said he would welcome it in his district.</p>
<p>“Urban Dove’s commitment to serving the students in need fills a gaping hole in the education system in New York City,” Gianaris wrote.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with Urban Dove to help students reach their full potential and I applaud its determination to improve education in Queens.</p>
<p>Gianaris — the no. 2 leader in the Senate — declined to comment on whether he would push to raise the charter school cap in the Big Apple before the legislature adjourns for the summer.</p>
<p>Democrats who control both the Senate and Assembly refused to amend the law to lift the cap to allow charter school expansion as part of the state budget.</p>
<p>But state Sen. Leroy Comie, another Queens Democrat, wants the charter school cap issue revisited.</p>
<p>Comrie told The Post on Sunday he was “frustrated” that any talk of increasing charter schools was shut down by the leadership of the Democratic-run Senate and Assembly.</p>
<p>“I’m frusrated by it. We have to put everything in education on the table,” Comrie said.</p>
<p>He said parent and student “choice” should be part of the discussions, including charter schools.</p>
<p>“I think we should work something out,” Comrie said.</p>
<p>The charter school cap is set at 460 statewide, with 290 set aside for New York City, which has already hit that limit.</p>
<p>There are 92 unused charters left for the rest of the state but they can’t be used in the Big Apple — where the demand is — without a change in state law.</p>
<p>Other proposed charter schools that received preliminary approval — including one sponsored by the Harlem-based anti-child poverty group the Mission Society — are also left in the lurch by the cap. </p>

<h1> Anthony Greco, son of late 9/11 first responder, now part of father’s beloved Rangers</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 11:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 12:22am </div> </div> </div>
<p>His mom watched the game with his aunt from her home in Massapequa Park on Long Island. </p>
<p>His dad, everybody says, no doubt watched from above. </p>
<p>Paul Greco, a FDNY firefighter of more than 20 years, died in May 2020 after a battle with several illnesses resulting from breathing toxic air at Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was 54. </p>
<p>To watch her son fulfill his childhood dream after enduring such hardship, Mary Jane was overwhelmed. But she never expected to feel her late husband’s presence as much as she did. </p>
<p>After the first 20 minutes of the Rangers’ eventual shutout win over the Sharks, Greco had logged exactly 3:43 of ice time. There were 343 firefighters killed at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. </p>
<p>“We know he was watching,” Mary Jane told The Post in a phone interview on Friday. “Along with a lot of other guys up there cheering for him.” </p>
<p>Last week, Greco was recalled from AHL Hartford to join the Rangers’ taxi squad. He then was promoted to the active roster two days later amid more positive tests, but was scratched in the Rangers’ loss at the Kings on Monday. </p>
<p>Greco, who became the first Queens native to ever play for the Rangers, signed in New York after he had bounced around the AHL within the Panthers, Lightning and Sharks organizations.</p>
<p>It was poetic for Greco to earn his next NHL opportunity with the Rangers, the team he used to watch with his dad growing up. </p>
<p>“That’s all he wore was Rangers jerseys, when he was little and he first started skating,” Mary Jane recalled. “He absolutely did [inherit the fandom]. There was not a choice in the matter.” </p>
<p>Paul was still working as a firefighter in New York, but that didn’t stop him from being there for both of his families. </p>
<p>But he’ll always have Jan. 13, 2022, the night he got to play for the Rangers in front of thousands — and one very special man a little higher up. </p>
<p>“Some of my favorite memories are going to game with him growing up,” Greco said on the MSG broadcast. “It’s a tough situation, but I’m sure he’s happy and watching.” </p>
<h1> Camille Kostek dances through Buccaneers’ blowout win against Eagles</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 11:04am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 12:01pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Camille Kostek had plenty of reasons to dance on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The “Wipeout” star hit Raymond James Stadium over the weekend in Tampa, where she watched the Buccaneers — including longtime boyfriend Rob Gronkowski — dominate the Eagles, 31-15, in the wild-card round of the NFC playoffs.</p>
<p>“I live for the electric environment in Raymond James on Sunday’s,” Kostek captioned an Instagram video of herself dancing from inside a suite, adding her signature hashtag, “Never not dancing.”</p>
<a>who banked $1 million in incentives</a> during last weekend’s regular-season finale against the Panthers, scored a touchdown
<a>in Sunday’s win against the Eagles</a>. The tight end’s pal, quarterback Tom Brady, threw for 271 yards with two touchdowns and zero interceptions.
<p>The Buccaneers will either host the Rams or the Cardinals next Sunday, pending the winner of Monday’s wild-card game between the NFC West rivals. </p>
<p>Kostek, meanwhile, made it clear Sunday that she likes what she sees from the Buccaneers.</p>
<p>“Keep it going Tampa Bay!!!!” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model wrote <a>in a separate Instagram post</a>.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers are chasing back-to-back Super Bowl titles after defeating the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV last year. Kostek recently <a>told The Post</a> that she’s predicting a return trip to the championship game for Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>“It’s already in my mind that I see the Bucs playing in that new Los Angeles stadium,” she said. “In my mind, I already see the Bucs there.”</p>
<p>With potentially two more games to go, Kostek’s vision may soon become a reality.</p>
