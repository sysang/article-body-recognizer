<p>So why do we tend to think that men's <a>low sexual desire</a> is non-existent? And why do we avoid talking about it?</p>
<p>But let’s put those stereotypes and our conventional wisdom aside and look at what the research can really tell us about men’s low sexual desire.</p>
<p>How Many Men Experience Low Sexual Desire?</p>
<sup>3 </sup>For example, when asked whether they had experienced a "distressing loss of sexual desire" over the last 12 months, 8 percent of Norwegian men aged 22 to 67 indicated that they did "all the time," "nearly all the time," or "quite often."

<sup>8 </sup>And there are those who suggest that men’s low sexual desire is actually a mask for some other experiences, such as an attempt to conceal atypical arousal patterns, compulsive
<a>pornography</a>, repressed issues regarding one's
<a>sexual orientation</a>, or a history of sexual

<div> <div> <h1>Love and Sex</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the keys to great sex? </h3> </div>
<a>the keys to a great sex life</a> are being able to stay in the moment,
<a>communicate with each other honestly</a> about their sexual wants—and have empathy for their partner’s, be vulnerable, and remain open to trying new things together.
<div> <h3> Are we having enough sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does having more sex make couples happier? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How important is what couples do after sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is it more important for a man or a woman to feel sexually satisfied? </h3> </div>
<a>the woman’s satisfaction is more predictive</a> of overall relationship satisfaction for both partners than the man’s—and
<a>a decline in a woman's sexual desire</a> is more predictive of relationship troubles than a decline in a man's.
<div> <h3> Can great sex survive marriage? </h3> </div>
<a>even as sexual satisfaction begins to decline</a> in many relationships, overall satisfaction remains high. But when partners’ levels of desire start to diverge widely, it’s crucial that the concern be addressed.
<div> <h3> How can couples rediscover their passion? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is love? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does love require passion? </h3> </div>
<a>a decrease in passion</a> is less of a problem than a couple’s belief that once it decreases it can’t be restored; partners who understand that it waxes and wanes are more likely to rekindle it, and stay together.
<div> <h3> Do men or women usually say “I love you” first? </h3> </div>
<a>say those three words first</a>, and more likely to report having felt love first in a relationship.
<div> <h3> How can partners negotiate “unconventional” sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Should I tell my partner about my sexual fantasies? </h3> </div>
<a>couples that acted on a fantasy</a> reported that it went well (with the exception of threesomes).
<div> <h3> Is sexting good for a relationship? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is BDSM good or bad for a long-term relationship? </h3> </div>
<h2> Facing Sexual Challenges </h2>
<div> <h3> What can you do when a partner becomes sexually coercive? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual coercion</a> and unwanted intimacy—even if it’s not physically aggressive—is a serious concern that partners should address before it becomes normalized, and seek to reestablish healthy boundaries and ground rules.
<div> <h3> How do women with high sex drives manage relationships? </h3> </div>
<a>Women with high sex drives</a> may find increased satisfaction through greater mental presence during sex and more open communication with their partners about their desires and fantasies.
<div> <h3> What can I do if a partner doesn’t meet my sexual needs? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can couples stay together even if they stop having sex? </h3> </div>
