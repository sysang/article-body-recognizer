<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Lena H. Sun</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 4:35 p.m. EST</div></div>
<b> </b>to reassess its guidance about what people should do to avoid spreading the virus to others, and to safely return to school and work to keep society functioning.
<div><div><h3><div>What did the CDC recommend?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>well-fitting masks for an additional five days.
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What does it mean to go into isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How long should someone with a coronavirus infection stay isolated?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months and should not delay the end of isolation. People still need to wear a well-fitting mask around others at home and in public for five days after ending isolation.
<div><div><h3><div>Why did the guidance change from 10 days to five days?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>they experience their first symptoms and declining within several days. Some reports suggest omicron has a shorter incubation period — that is, the time between someone becoming infected and showing
<b> </b>symptoms — than previous variants.
<div><div><h3><div>Why isn’t the CDC requiring a test to end isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Asked at a briefing why the CDC updated its guidance on Jan. 4 to say that people with access to rapid tests could use them before coming out of isolation, Walensky said the agency was simply responding to questions from the general public.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What has been the reaction to the guidance?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In particular, the group strongly endorsed requiring a negative test before someone who has previously tested positive can end isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortly after the guidance was posted online, Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said he agreed with it, except that he would recommend that people get a negative test before ending isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are the isolation recommendations the same for those who are unvaccinated, vaccinated and boosted?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most transmission occurs early in the infection, in the one to two days before onset of symptoms and within the first days afterward. That is true of people regardless of their vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Does this guidance apply to K-12 school settings?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What if you have symptoms of covid-19 but can’t find a test?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>covid-19 symptoms</a> such as a fever of 100.4 F or greater, cough or shortness of breath,
<b> </b>you might have the illness and should isolate immediately. Even if you do not know if you had
<div><div><h3><div>When should you quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<a> symptoms</a>, isolate for at least five days from the date your symptoms began.
<div><div><h3><div>When can you end your quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What if someone can’t get a test five days after the last close contact?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can leave home after day five if you had no covid-19 symptoms during those five days.<b> </b>Wear a well-fitting mask for 10 days after the date of that contact when around others, both at home and in public.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Who does not need to quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<li>People 18 or older who have received all recommended vaccine doses, including boosters and additional primary shots for some immunocompromised people.</li>
<li>Children 5 to 17 who have completed the primary series of coronavirus vaccines.</li>
<li>Someone who had confirmed covid-19 within the last 90 days.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are the recommendations for quarantine different for those who are vaccinated and those who are boosted?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>close contact</a> with someone who is infected.

<div><p>A year out from the attempted insurrection of the Capitol, we consider the state of American democracy — what’s changed, what hasn’t changed and what will never be the same. </p></div>

<p>One year ago today, rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, set on overturning the results of the 2020 election. Since then, the basic facts of the insurrection have been in contention and democracy itself has remained under siege. </p>
<p>On today’s episode of Post Reports, politics reporters Dan Balz, Roz Helderman and Amy Gardner join guest host Cleve Wootson to discuss how the spirit of the insurrection has seeped into America’s bloodstream.</p>

<div><p>Overall, the survey offers a set of harsh judgments about the president’s performance and the state of the economy.<b> </b>Together, they send a stark warning to Democrats about their prospects in the 2022 midterm contests.</p></div>
<b> </b>70 percent rate the economy negatively, including 38 percent who say it is in “poor” condition. About half

<a>accused or convicted</a> of domestic violence.
<div><div><p>In sentencing a man accused of illegally demonstrating in the building, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell last month suggested all participants should face more serious charges.</p></div></div>
<p>“Once we found out Pence turned on us … the crowd went crazy,” an Alabama landscaper said two days after the riot, in a YouTube video cited in <a>government filings</a>. “I mean, it became a mob. We crossed the gate.”</p>
<div><div><p>Brian Levin, who runs the Center for the Study of Hate Extremism at California State University, said that in the right circumstances, even those with weak attachment to extremist views can turn violent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Responsibility gets diffused across the group, and you have the immediate lure of peer validation, plus a cloak of anonymity,” he said. “It’s almost like a sport.”</p></div></div>
<a>rioting that had often erupted<b> </b>around soccer games</a> by identifying and removing key instigators.
<div><div><p>“It’s hard when the person who was inciting it happens to be the sitting president of the United States,” she noted. “Makes it a bit difficult for the police to extricate him.”</p></div></div>
<p>Sibick had never been to a Trump rally before Jan. 6, according to his defense attorney Stephen Brennwald, who said at a recent hearing that “there is nothing in his life before this that would indicate a propensity for violence.”</p>
<div><div><p>“He’s just not that person," Brennwald added.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>by other members of the mob, Sibick reached in and stripped him of his badge and radio,
<b> </b>according to body-camera footage submitted in court.
<div><div><p>“Just got tear-gassed, but we’re good, baby, we’re good! We’re pushing forward now!” Sibick shouted hoarsely in an Instagram post found by law enforcement.</p></div></div>

<b> </b>told FBI agents he found the former president
<div><div><p>“Civil war is coming,” he wrote in December. “This time the conservatives will stand their ground and the radicals will die.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He later said he only decided to attend Trump’s rally that morning. He had never been to a protest before.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I wasn’t with anyone; I didn’t have any battle gear,” Reeder said in an interview with FBI agents. “The only thing in my backpack was two protein bars.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>according to court filings.
<div><div><p>“This is not me,” he told the agents, “and yet here we are.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>in early October. He said his brother wasn’t one of the “wack jobs.” The family was “appalled by his participation,” his brother said, but a harsh punishment would also be “appalling.”
<div><div><p>The judge, calling his account “disingenuous” and “prevaricating,” sentenced Reeder to three months in jail.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reeder was not simply swept along by events, the judge said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“It’s rewriting history and the facts to say you didn’t know what was going on. … I’ve had too many people say that to me.”
<b> </b>they are being punished for their political beliefs. Pence
<a>said recently</a> that the media’s reporting on the mob that chanted calls for his death is a tool to “demean” Trump supporters.
<div><div><p>For his part, Trump has <a>continued</a> to falsely claim the election was stolen and he was merely exercising his right to say so on Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>guilty to parading in the Capitol. “And unfortunately, those same things that I assume motivated you to do what you did are still being said.”
<div><div><p>Thomas Vinson, an Air Force veteran, told Walton that he and his wife had “no intention” of joining a mob on Jan. 6 and would do nothing like it again; previous Trump protests they attended were peaceful.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I took an oath and I know I violated that oath,” Vinson said. “Joe Biden is our president, he was sworn in; that’s all I can say about it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Through attorneys, defendants have <a>blamed Trump</a> and his rhetoric for inspiring their behavior. But others continue to see their fate through a partisan lens.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Former model Nathan DeGrave,<b> </b>who is accused of fighting police to get inside the Senate chamber, said through an attorney in March that he was “mortified and remorseful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>(In a brief interview from jail, DeGrave said there was “culpability on both sides.”)</p></div></div>
<a>hundreds</a> were not. Most federal defendants
<b> </b>generally are detained; only about 13 percent of the Jan. 6 defendants are.
<a>handwritten letter from jail</a>, he told the judge the events of Jan. 6 were “a disgrace to our nation.”
<div><div><p>The blame, he said, lay “ultimately” with the president he once followed to the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The word “never” was underlined twice.</p></div></div>

<b> </b>the spotlight of a United Nations climate summit to show their resolve to act with urgency.
<div><div><p>President Biden told delegates in Glasgow, Scotland, that cutting methane is essential to keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As major U.N. climate talks open, pleas for action to back up big promises</p></div>
<div><div><p>Still, living up to promises on both deforestation and methane will take serious work, and key details about how many countries plan to follow their rhetoric with action remain uncertain.</p></div></div>
<a>New York Declaration on Forests</a>, which called for halving the rate of deforestation by 2020 and halting it by 2030. Instead, deforestation remains rampant. A satellite-based survey by Global Forest Watch found that, in 2020, the
<a>world lost nearly 100,00 square miles of tree cover</a> — an area about the size of Colorado.
<a>reported that levels</a> of methane showed a “significant jump” in 2020, marking “the largest annual increase recorded since systematic measurements began in 1983.”
<div><p>Voices from around the world on what’s at stake at COP26</p></div>
<div><div><p>That makes Tuesday’s push in Glasgow significant.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the pact include Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Iraq, Vietnam and Canada. But critical methane-emitting nations such as China and Russia have yet to sign on.
<div><div><p>Hamburg said reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions represent the “two big levers” to slowing climate change, “and we need to push down on both of them, which we have not historically done.”</p></div></div>
<p>Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter in England, said that although the methane pledge is a great step, a continued focus on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide remains the only way to combat long-term warming.</p>
<div><div><p>“We shouldn’t use one for an excuse of not doing the other,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The world needs to cut its emissions seven times as fast to hit climate goals, U.N. report finds</p></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier Tuesday, a litany of nations also signed on to a renewed effort to cease deforestation around the planet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the agreement unprecedented, adding, “We will have a chance to end humanity’s long history as nature’s conqueror, and instead become its custodian.”</p></div></div>
<a>about 23 percent</a> of total emissions stemming from agriculture, forestry and other land uses.
<div><div><p>“As consumers, we’ll all be able to enjoy guilt-free chocolate,” Johnson said. “I mean, I suppose that’s carbon-guilt-free, not calorie-guilt-free chocolate.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The collective pledge to safeguard the world’s forests generated hope among activists, but also a measure of skepticism.</p></div></div>
<a> Billion Tree Tsunami” reforestation </a>campaign. In Costa Rica, the government has been paying farmers to protect forests near their farms. The project was among the
<a>five inaugural winners of Prince William’s Earthshot prize</a>, which highlights creative climate solutions and comes with a prize of 1 million pounds.
<div><div><p>The deforestation and methane agreements were part of a day in Glasgow marked by a flurry of promises from government and the private sector, some lacking specifics on how they will be executed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“By showing up, we’ve had a profound impact on the way I think the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As Biden and other heads of state begin to depart Scotland, the difficult job of hammering out a global road map is only beginning.</p></div></div>
<p>Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he feels confident progress is happening, but that hard work lies ahead. “We must take care to guard against false hope. We have still a very long way to go,” the British prime minister said.</p>

<div><div><p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer requested emergency authorization Tuesday for Paxlovid, a five-day antiviral pill regimen the company found to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Biden administration is expected to announce this week that it is purchasing 10 million doses of the Pfizer antiviral pill in a bid to add another tool in their pandemic response as the country heads into colder months.</p></div></div>
<p>Here’s what to know</p>
<li>The FDA is expected to grant a request from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech — perhaps as soon as this week — to authorize boosters for their vaccine for everyone 18 and older.</li>
<li>A growing number of governors from both political parties are circumventing federal guidance to offer boosters to anyone over 18 in hopes of staving off a spike in cases over the holidays.</li>
<li>While southern states have emerged from a late summer and early autumn delta variant-fueled surge, the Mountain West and upper Midwest are now seeing a dramatic uptick in cases.</li>
<li>Crowds will return to Times Square to ring in 2022, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced Tuesday, with proof of vaccination required for entry.</li>
<li>At least 50 percent of people who survive covid-19 experience health issues for six months or more after their recovery, according to new research.</li>

<div><div><p>“The significance of every choice and every action is just exponential now, and that makes decisions harder than they were before,” Jahnke says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, she says, the question becomes, “What can I do to diffuse that anticipatory regret? And one of the things I can do is to try to share every possible way in which I may be silently carrying SARS-CoV-2.”</p></div></div>
