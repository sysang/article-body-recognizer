<div> Newsgeek James Bond <a>Video games</a></div>
<p>Having starred in 29 titles, James Bond is more prolific in the gaming realm than he is in the movies.</p>
<p>As is the case with 007's film credits, some of these outings have been extremely good while others...not so much.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the <a>long-delayed release of No Time To Die</a>, we have prepared this guide breaking down which classic Bond games are essential for fans and which ones will leave you saying "never again".</p>
<h2>The Worst- '007 Legends'</h2>
<a>IGN</a>, The Quantum of Solace tie-in was a middling Call of Duty imitator, while Blood Stone was desperately trying to emulate the success of other cover-based shooters like Gears of War.
<p>Of this pitiful bunch, 007 Legends is undoubtedly the worst. The game has a truly bizarre premise that sees Craig's Bond recalling his previous adventures during the moment in which he falls off the train at the beginning of Skyfall.</p>
<h2>Worst - 'Live and Let Die: The Computer Game'</h2>
<p>According to <a>Watch Mojo</a>, the most glaring issue is the ear-piercing sound design, as low-res music, cacophonous explosions and the incessant noise of a speedboat revving its engine will all combine to give you a throbbing headache.</p>
<h2>Worst – 'James Bond Jr.'</h2>
<p>While it is hard to track down many reviews of James Bond Jr. (as it has been mostly forgotten) a writer for SNES hub was so critical <a>that they awarded the game a 1 star rating</a>.</p>
<h2>Worst – 'Tomorrow Never Dies'</h2>
<h2>Best – 'The World Is Not Enough'</h2>
<p>It does not do anything especially revolutionary, but it nails the fundamentals and that was more than you could reasonably expect at the time. The visuals were strong, the gunplay felt precise, and you got to experiment with a lot of fun gadgets.</p>
<a>debate whether it holds up better than </a>
<a>GoldenEye</a> - thanks to its various technical improvements and the refined graphics – but that seems like a bit of a stretch. If nothing else, it has definitely not had the same level of cultural impact as Rare's trailblazer.
<h2>Best – 'James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire'</h2>
<a>the original Dead Space</a>, Agent Under Fire is a
<a>highlight from the 007 catalog</a>. Its story was devised completely from the ground up but felt worthy of a summer blockbuster and the environments were authentically Bond, recalling the classic production design of Ken Adam.
<a>fully-fledged immerse sim like Dishonored</a> or Deus Ex, but this did give you an incentive to replay missions and try them out again in different ways.
<p>Of course, Agent Under Fire is most fondly remembered for its exceptional driving sequences which, to this day, remain the best car chases you will find in any Bond game.</p>
<h2>Best- 'James Bond 007: Nightfire'</h2>
<p>Nightfire takes the solid foundations of Agent Under Fire and builds upon them to tremendous effect.</p>
<a>fans agree </a>that it has got everything you could possibly want from a Bond adventure.
<h2>Best – 'James Bond 007: Everything Or Nothing'</h2>
<p>Where most of the decent 007 games are first-person shooters, Everything Or Nothing is played from a third-person perspective and (unlike Tomorrow Never Dies) it works really well.</p>
<a> with a positive Metacritic score of 84.</a>
<h2>The Best – 'GoldenEye 007'</h2>
<a>best-selling release on the Nintendo 64 console to not feature Mario</a> and it often places in countdowns of the greatest video games of all-time.
<p>From a technical standpoint, it also pushed the boundaries of what the N64 was capable of, thanks to its astonishingly detailed environments, long draw distances, and expressive animations.</p>
<header><div> <a>Gaming</a></div><h1>12 Video Games That Were Banned in America</h1><div> By Harrison Abbott <time>On 8/7/21 at 10:00 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>Video games are very rarely banned in the United States of America, especially when compared to other countries around the globe.</p>
<p>Here are 12 games that were effectively banned in the United States. Please note, topics like sexual violence, child pornography, mass shootings and discrimination will all be discussed.</p>
<h2>'Custer's Revenge' Banned in Oklahoma</h2>
<p>Custer's Revenge is arguably the most famous example of a banned video game in America, even though it was only declared illegal in one state.</p>
<h2>'The Guy Game' Constitutes Child Pornography</h2>
<p>Released in 2004, The Guy Game was aimed squarely at the frat house crowd, with an emphasis on female nudity and party culture.</p>
<p>This offending footage meant that The Guy Game constituted child pornography in certain territories, including the U.S. where it is now prohibited from ever being sold.</p>
<h2>'Too Human' Violated Copyright Law</h2>
<p>Indeed, federal authorities can be quite lenient when it comes to allowing depictions of grisly violence and explicit sexual imagery in games (as you will see later on), but one thing they will not tolerate is copyright infringement.</p>
<h2>'X-Men: Destiny's' Code Was Destroyed</h2>
<p>X-Men: Destiny is another unlikely candidate for a ban, as it too was an unfortunate casualty of Epic's legal action against Silicon Knights.</p>
<a>see page 41 of the court case document</a>), and this applied to the otherwise innocuous superhero title, X-Men: Destiny.
<p>Ironically, Too Human (which instigated this whole saga) was made readily available in 2019, when Xbox added it to their backwards compatibility library for free.</p>
<h2>'Thrill Kill' Was Slapped With 'Adults Only' Rating for BDSM Content</h2>
<p>Thrill Kill was technically never issued a hard ban, but that is only because the publisher decided to cancel it first.</p>
<h2>'Hatred' Was Removed From Steam</h2>
<p>If we skip ahead to 2015, we find yet another game that was given the soft ban of an AO rating, only this time the studio decided to plough ahead with its launch regardless.</p>
<p>Of course, the game's release was also impeded by the fact that it received an AO certificate from the ESRB, preventing it from being sold at mainstream retailers and from being livestreamed on Twitch.</p>
<p>It was even briefly delisted on Steam, at which point gamers could not get it anywhere in the country. It has since returned to the digital storefront and has even had a few post-launch updates.</p>
<h2>'RapeLay' Simulated Sexual Assault</h2>
<p>A Japanese import, RapeLay has been banned in countries like Argentina, Indonesia, and New Zealand. In it, players control a sexual predator tasked with stalking, groping, and raping multiple women.</p>
<a>CNN</a>. According to early coverage, one especially abhorrent scene had the player forcibly impregnate a woman and then urge her to get an abortion.
<a>Microsoft</a>, Sony and even the infamously lax Valve refused to carry it on their respective platforms. Meanwhile, one is not allowed to stream it on Twitch and it is impossible to find a physical copy of it anywhere in the U.S.
<p>That being said, in the era of digital distribution, an AO rating is not the commercial death sentence it once was and the U.S. government never officially stepped in to ban RapeLay.</p>
<h2>'Devotion' Was Pulled From Steam Globally</h2>
<p>Unlike most of the other entries on this list, Devotion was never placed under the scrutiny of the U.S. government or hit with an "Adults Only" rating from the ESRB.</p>
<a>Xi Jinping</a> to Winnie the Pooh. There were also a few more jokes at Xi's expense scattered throughout the virtual environment and players began to discover these over time.
<p>The image of Winnie the Pooh has been enough to get <a>certain films banned in China</a> before, so it is hardly surprising that the Easter egg resulted in Devotion being pulled from the country's Steam page.</p>
<a> own distribution platform</a>. This makes Devotion one of the few examples of a game that managed to recover from a ban, although it is still outlawed in China.
<h2>Valve Refuses to Distribute 'Super Seducer 3'</h2>
<p>Released in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Richard La Ruina's Super Seducer was always going to cause a bit of a stir.</p>
<p>While it has been rejected by PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo and Steam, an "uncensored" version of Super Seducer 3 is now hosted on a few niche websites around the internet.</p>
<h2>"Kill the F****t" Was Never Released </h2>
<p>Kill the F****t (title censored) was not a major AAA release and was instead the product of a small independent studio that actively encouraged people to send "threats and hate mail."</p>
<h2>'Active Shooter' Was Canceled Worldwide</h2>
<p>Billed as an authentic "simulation" of school massacres, Active Shooter <a>sparked outrage from the parents of children who had been killed in real-life tragedies</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, Active Shooter has never been available to purchase in the U.S.</p>
<h2>'Paranautical Activity' Was Banned Over Death Threats</h2>
<p>Paranautical Activity was temporarily banned in the U.S after its creator sent death threats to Valve's president Gabe Newell.</p>
<p>To find out more about media that has been outlawed domestically, read Newsweek's list of <a>20 movies that were banned in the United States</a>.</p>
<header><div> <a>Newsgeek</a></div><h1>The Best (And Worst) 'Spider-Man' Video Games of All-Time</h1><div> By Harrison Abbott <time>On 12/15/21 at 3:38 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>If great power comes burdened with great responsibility, then great licences like Star Wars or Marvel Comics seem to come burdened with mixed results. At least, that appears to be the case when they're being adapted into video games.</p>
<p>Of all the Marvel properties, Spider-Man has undoubtedly fared best, with at least 3 or 4 excellent titles to his name. Yet, even then, there are inevitably some turkeys that let the side down.</p>
<p>To help you separate the truly amazing entries from those that will have you leave you crying "Spider-Man no more," Newsweek has put together this definitive list.</p>
<p>While you are here, you might want to check out our similar retrospective on the back catalogue of 007, <a>with our list of the best and worst James Bond games</a>.</p>
<h2>The Worst - 'Spider-Man: The Video Game' (1991)</h2>
<p>In the early '90s, side-scrolling beat 'em ups like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Streets of Rage were guzzling quarters by the bucketload across the nation.</p>
<h2>Worst - 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' (2014)</h2>
<p>Upon release, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was lambasted for its gruelling loading times, simplistic combat, dated visuals and an unwieldy camera that felt like more of an adversary than any of the supervillain bosses.</p>
<p>When even the web-swinging isn't enjoyable in a Spider-Man game, then you know you're in deep trouble.</p>
<h2>Worst - 'Spider-Man 2' PC Version (2004)</h2>
<p>Spider-Man 2 originates from that era where licenced tie-ins shipped in multiple versions for multiple systems, many of which were developed on separate engines and by entirely different teams.</p>
<p>Such was the case with the Spider-Man 2, which was an acclaimed open-world blockbuster on consoles, yet that hype must have seen completely unwarranted if you were unlucky enough to try it on PSP or <a>Microsoft</a> Windows.</p>
<p>In short, the PC version of Spider-Man 2 is the perfect representation of that "we have pizza at home" meme. On a surface level it's kind of the thing that you want, but it's really not the same.</p>
<h2>Worst - 'Spider-Man: Edge of Time' (2011)</h2>
<p>A lacklustre follow-up to the infinitely superior Shatter Dimensions (more on that one later), Spider-Man: Edge of Time bafflingly strips out content from its predecessor and doesn't even replace the missing elements with anything new.</p>
<p>You'd think that a sequel would want to expand upon the premise of its forbear by increasing the number of superheroes you control. Yet this is quite literally half the game that Shattered Dimensions was.</p>
<p>The word "banality" should never be appropriate for describing a Spiderverse game, yet it unfortunately fits like a glove in this instance.</p>
<h2>Best - 'Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions' (2010)</h2>
<p>A year before Edge of Time came along and delivered an underwhelming Spiderverse game, Shattered Dimensions absolutely nailed the concept.</p>
<p>Like the A.V. Club articulated in their B+ review of the game: "[It's] filled with countless remember-when moments—as in 'Remember when you outran that wave of sand?"</p>
<h2>Best - 'Ultimate Spider-Man' (2005)</h2>
<p>Fondly remembered as "the one that lets you play as Venom," Ultimate Spider-Man was a fairly typical example of the open-world superhero offerings that came out in the early noughties.</p>
<p>To reiterate the most salient point though, you were able to control Venom and got to embark on a feeding frenzy around Manhattan.</p>
<h2>Best - 'Spider-Man' (2000)</h2>
<p>Often referred to as the first good Spider-Man game, Neversoft's stab at the franchise is still enjoyable to this day, even if some of the technical aspects feel a tad archaic.</p>
<h2>Best – 'Spider-Man: Miles Morales' (2020)</h2>
<p>We already have a detailed review explaining why <a>Spider-Man: Miles Morales is so incredible</a> but, to summarize, it's one of the top exclusives that you can get for the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The next-gen graphics are second-to-none (especially when you activate ray-tracing), the protagonist switch is refreshing, the gameplay is supremely addictive, and it makes terrific use of its festive New York setting.</p>
<h2>Best- 'Spider-Man 2' Console Version (2004)</h2>
<p>Although the PC port was an unmitigated train wreck, the console version of Spider-Man 2 is frequently hailed as being one of the greatest movie tie-ins ever made.</p>
<p>It hasn't aged quite as gracefully as you might hope—on account of its dated mission design and tedious side-objectives—but it still set the benchmark for comic book adaptions and the level of quality towards which they should aspire.</p>
<p>It's a ridiculed cliché of games journalism to say that a superhero title makes you feel like its protagonist, but there's no getting around it here. That's the defining attribute of Spider-Man 2 and the reason why it's so beloved.</p>
<p>Putting on the Spidey costume never felt quite this magical again. That was until our next entry came along.</p>
<h2>The Best - 'Marvel's Spider-Man' (2018)</h2>
<p>Aside from the colorful costume and fantastic powers, the core appeal of Spider-Man is that he's an unwavering trier.</p>
<p>Stan Lee often spoke about how Peter Parker was meant to be a character with relatable, soap opera problems and that's something that Insomniac's Spider-Man adaptation truly understands. Probably better than any of the movies.</p>

<p>Details are thin on the ground in relation to this panel, but according to EA's website it will "highlight an extremely cool new addition to an extremely popular and long-running EA Sports franchise".</p>
<h3>Thursday, July 22, 1 p.m. ET – EA Play Live</h3>
<h2>How to Watch EA Play Live</h2>
<p>Like this year's E3 conference, every EA Play broadcast will be aired virtually.</p>
