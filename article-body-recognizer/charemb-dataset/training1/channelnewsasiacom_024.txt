<p>Rajah admitted that the investigations into JI were “not easy”, noting that its members operated in high secrecy and were deeply indoctrinated.</p>
<p>Jameel revealed that the JI members never used their real names, and never travelled directly to a meeting point to ensure they were not being followed. They used different codes for locations and dates when contacting each other using pagers.</p>
<p>As for their camaraderie, Rajah said some members pledged loyalty to spiritual leaders, were sometimes related by blood, and had trained and operated in conflict zones overseas.</p>
<p>“These actually bonded them together as a group, and they had a certain exclusivist mindset that they were the chosen one, they were here for a mission of jihad,” Rajah added.</p>
<p>“It was really a challenge. We had to really win their hearts and minds before they would start talking to us.”</p>
<h2>ROAD TO REHABILITATION</h2>
<p>These volunteers provide religious, psychological and social rehabilitation, including financial and social support, and extend the help to family members to correct any radical ideology they might have been exposed to.</p>
<p>When the former JI member Adam was first arrested, he expected to be tortured and brainwashed. He says he felt grateful when officers did none of this.</p>
<p>“They also tried to rationalise with me, to show me that what I did was wrong,” he said. “So when we did not succeed in our attempts to do all those things, what I felt was we were not (fighting) a lost cause. We were fighting a wrong cause.”</p>
<p>During his detention from 2002 to 2010, Adam spoke with religious teachers from the RRG and asked where he went wrong. He read a translation of the Quran and discovered that many of the things he did were not in line with the religion.</p>
<p>“The religious teachers play an important role also, by streamlining me back to the correct Islam,” he added.</p>
<p>“This is actually a very painful time for me. Because I’ve lost a lot of years during my time in JI and detention. I’ve missed a lot of time with my family, my children. Now, I’m trying to make up for it.”</p>
<p>While Adam said it took him a “few months of reflection” to change his perspective, other detainees were tougher to crack.</p>
<p>One former JI member who was detained for 10 years held on to the belief that he was wrongfully detained and victimised for most of his detention, which in turn affected his rehabilitation.</p>
<p>ISD case officers and rehabilitation partners continued to reach out to him. Eventually, his attitude changed around the sixth year of his detention, and he started showing progress in his rehabilitation, ISD said.</p>
<p>Of the 56 Singapore JI members who were detained since 2002, four remain in detention, while another six are currently on ROs. The remaining 46 had their ROs lapsed.</p>
<p>The majority of them have reintegrated well into society, and continue to maintain a close rapport with ISD case officers and rehabilitation stakeholders, ISD said.</p>
<p>However, the four JI members who remain in detention are still deeply entrenched in their radical beliefs and are assessed to pose an imminent security threat, ISD added.</p>
<p>One of them is openly hostile to ISD officers and rehabilitation partners, and regularly threatens to harm ISD officers and the Government.</p>
<p>He also said that he would destroy Singapore, and that the country would burn in hellfire because of its secular society.</p>
<p>Another member still believes in the concept of armed jihad. He expressed admiration for suicide bombers and said he would not hesitate to engage in suicide attacks if called on by the JI leaders to do so.</p>
<p>“ISD will continue to explore ways to reach out to them and encourage them to participate in rehabilitation,” it said.</p>
<p>While JI’s Singapore branch has been disrupted, the group remains quietly active in Indonesia, where it continues to conduct outreach and recruitment activities, ISD continued.</p>
<p>“At this juncture, there is no indication that Indonesian JI members are rekindling operational ties with former Singapore JI members or that they have been recruiting Singaporeans,” ISD said.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Assoc Prof Ramakrishna called the terrorist threat a “constantly moving target”, with social media exposing younger and relatively impressionable Singaporeans to extremist ideologies such as that of the far right.</p>
<p>This is of “significant concern” in Singapore, Assoc Prof Ramakrishna said, especially as ISIS – and its use of online propaganda – has emerged as the primary regional threat.</p>
<p>In particular, ISIS’ use of social media and sophisticated methods of presenting itself has been a “game changer”, Rajah said, while the Taliban’s rise in Afghanistan could provide sanctuaries and training grounds for terrorists.</p>
<p>“Regional terrorist groups have networks with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and they will – and probably already have – develop their skillsets,” he added.</p>
<p>“That will continue to pose a danger not just to the regional countries but also to Singapore.”</p>
<p>*Names have been changed to protect their identity.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART) kits for self-testing will be dispensed in pharmacies to the public from Wednesday (Jun 16), the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Jun 10. </p>
<p>ARTs detect the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of infected individuals and usually work best in the early stages of infection. </p>
<h3><a>READ: COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits for self-testing to be 'sold by pharmacists' to the public from Jun 16: MOH</a></h3>
<p>According to the Health Ministry, these tests produce results in less than 20 minutes. </p>
<p>If you’re planning to pick some up when they go on sale, here’s what you need to know about these self-test kits. </p>
<p>A: The kits will be available at selected Unity, Watsons and Guardian outlets islandwide. </p>
<p>From Jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Jun 10. </p>
<p>“We will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively," he added. </p>
<p>The test kits will be dispensed by the pharmacist in-store, which means customers have to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them. They can be bought without a doctor’s prescription, said HSA in an update on Jun 10. </p>
<p>According to Quantum Technologies Global, the distributor of the QuickVue tests, training will be provided to pharmacists on how to teach customers on the correct usage of the tests.</p>
<p>All 79 Guardian stores with an in-store pharmacy will carry the COVID-19 ART kits including the Guardian store at the Giant outlet in Suntec City, said a Dairy Farm Group spokesperson in response to CNA's queries. </p>
<p>Customers can visit Guardian’s website to use the "Pharmacy" filter to locate these stores.</p>
<p>The Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-test and the QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test will be available at Guardian outlets, the spokesperson added. </p>
<p>39 Unity pharmacies will offer the test kits from Jun 16, said a FairPrice spokesperson in response to CNA's queries. </p>
<p>These stores were “specially selected” as they have in-store pharmacists who are “professionally trained” to assess whether customers are suitable to use the ART kits and provide information on how to use them, said the spokesperson. </p>
<p>The Abbot Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test kits will be available at all Watsons pharmacy stores in the first phase of the test kit roll out, said a spokesperson for the company. </p>
<p>The self-test kits will be gradually expanded to more Watsons stores and Watsons Online in the second phase, the spokesperson said in response to CNA queries. </p>
<p>Consumers will be able to locate Watsons pharmacy stores using the store finder option on the company’s website or via the store locator on the Watsons SG mobile app. </p>
<p>Q: How much will the test kits cost and how many can I buy? </p>
<p>Sales will initially be limited to 10 ART kits per person to ensure that there are "adequate supplies for all”, said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Jun 10. </p>
<p>But as more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will "eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased", he said.</p>
<p>According to Watsons, the pharmacy will be keeping with MOH’s recommended guidelines for the selling price of the kits. This ranges from S$10 to S$13 per test kit depending on the size of the pack purchased, said the spokesperson. </p>
<p>The FairPrice spokesperson said that details on the type of kits and pricing are still being finalised, and more information will be available soon. </p>
<p>Dairy Farm's spokesperson also said the company will adhere to MOH's pricing guidelines.</p>
<p>CNA has contacted the ministry for more information about the price of the self-test kits.</p>
<p>From Jun 16, Quantum Technologies Global will have about 500,000 tests available, and more kits will be flown in from the United States in the coming weeks, said a company spokesperson in response to CNA queries.</p>
<p>Abbott is “well-positioned” to fulfill the demand for COVID-19 tests, said Abbott’s APAC divisional vice-president for rapid diagnostics Sanjeev Johar. </p>
<p>“We expect to make millions of Panbio Antigen Rapid Tests available for Singapore over the coming months, as needed,” he added. </p>
<p>Q: How do these test kits work? What should I look out for? </p>
<p>Those using the self-test kits should collect their nasal sample using the swabs provided in the kits, said HSA in the press release on Jun 10. </p>
<p>They should then prepare their nasal sample with the buffer and tube provided. Once the sample is ready, users should use it with the test device and read the results, said HSA. </p>
<p>While performing the test, users should follow the instructions in the instruction leaflets to get valid results, the authorities said. </p>
<p>The instructions for all four self-test kits may differ slightly. For example, the QuickVue test uses a test strip dipped in the buffer solution, while the one manufactured by Abbott involves dripping the buffer solution on a rapid test device. </p>
<p>"For children younger than 14 years, an adult caretaker should help collect the nasal samples and conduct the test procedures," said Abbott.</p>
<p>Q: Are these test kits effective and accurate? What should I do if I test positive? </p>
<p>In general, ARTs can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent, said HSA.</p>
<p>Sensitivity refers to the test’s ability to correctly detect COVID-19 in individuals with the , while specificity refers to the test’s ability to correctly identify individuals without COVID-19. </p>
<p>ARTs have lower sensitivity than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which means such tests have a "higher chance of false negative results", said HSA in the press release. </p>
<p>Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged users to follow the instructions on how to use the test kits strictly and “to the letter”.</p>
<p>A properly done test will “carry a similar sensitivity” to a PCR test, especially if it’s repeated every three to five days, he added. </p>
<p>“A negative test doesn’t mean you don’t have it but you’re less likely to have COVID-19,” said Dr Leong. </p>
<p>Q: What should I do if I see a positive result?</p>
<p>People who have a positive result on these self-test kits should "immediately approach" a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a confirmatory PCR test, said MOH. </p>
<p>After that, they must self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result, MOH added.</p>
<p>Those who test negative on their self-test ART kit should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, said the Health Ministry. </p>
<p>“Individuals who have ARI symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit.” </p>

<h1> Commentary: How Omicron is messing up immunity from vaccination and prior infection </h1>
<div> <p>Just because you have been vaccinated or infected with COVID-19 before does not guarantee immunity, say UK professors. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Mick Bailey </a> <a> Nicholas John Timpson </a> </div> </div>
<p>BRISTOL, England: With the highly mutated Omicron variant spreading rapidly, people want to know if immunity from vaccination or a prior infection will be enough to protect them against getting infected or developing severe disease.</p>
<p>If prior immunity does provide sufficient protection, then precautionary measures to slow Omicron’s spread, together with vaccinating and boosting people, should prevent intolerable strain on healthcare systems.</p>
<p>But if not, then increased social restrictions are inevitable as the variant spreads around the world and potentially replaces delta, which is currently the dominant variant.</p>
<p>Early studies – all of which are still preprints, so yet to be formally reviewed by other scientists – suggest that Omicron is handled less well by existing immunity.</p>
<p>But research also suggests that giving a third booster vaccine dose may provide protection. So, the bad news isn’t as bad as it could be, but the good news also needs to be treated with caution. </p>
<h2>OMICRON CAN ESCAPE NEUTRALISING ANTIBODIES</h2>
<p>Inevitably, early reports have focused on the most quickly accessible data, which is the amount of antibodies people have in their blood that are capable of neutralising the new variant.</p>
<p>Overall, the data consistently suggest that Omicron can escape these neutralising antibodies to some extent: The reduction in neutralisation in double-vaccinated people is somewhere between 10- to 20-fold to 40-fold compared to delta.</p>
<p>That said, in people who had received two vaccinations and had also been infected, the level of neutralisation of Omicron was higher.</p>
<p>But lower levels of neutralising antibodies doesn’t necessarily mean people are completely exposed.</p>
<p>Past studies have also found that many people with low levels of antibodies do still appear to be sufficiently protected, particularly against severe disease, even with the newer variants like delta. We may find that the same applies with Omicron.</p>
<p>This is most likely because neutralising antibodies that attack and nullify the virus are just part of the immune response.</p>
<p>There are also binding antibodies, which attach to the virus or to infected cells to flag them to other immune cells for destruction, and T-cells and memory B-cells, which can attack the virus directly and produce more antibodies to fight it.</p>
<p>Even in the initial absence of antibodies that can neutralise the virus, these mechanisms may also provide a level of protection against infection or symptomatic disease.</p>
<p>This may still be sufficient to reduce the likelihood of Omicron causing severe disease and limit its impact on health systems.</p>
<h2>BUT BOOSTERS CAN NEUTRALISE OMICRON</h2>
<p>One of these (a press release from Pfizer) suggests that a booster can provide quite a marked increase in neutralisation of Omicron, although this only included a summary of the results and not the full dataset.</p>
<p>A closer examination of what data is available in these studies reveals that reduced neutralisation of omicron can be extremely variable (which is why it would be helpful to see Pfizer’s results in full).</p>
<p>While some vaccinated or previously infected people are good at neutralising Omicron, some have almost no neutralising antibodies, even after a booster dose.</p>
<p>So are these people still likely to be protected against infection or severe disease? It’s hard to say. We don’t know the extent to which the immune system’s other mechanisms can provide protection.</p>
<p>However, we do know these other immune mechanisms target different parts of the coronavirus to neutralising antibodies.</p>
<p>And while the part of the virus that neutralising antibodies target – the spike protein – is heavily mutated in Omicron, the bits these other mechanisms focus on aren’t so badly affected.</p>
<h2>OPTIMISM RATHER THAN CONFIDENCE</h2>
<p>Overall, then, what we know so far is that vaccination or prior infection should provide some protection against Omicron, and that for most people protection should be increased by a booster vaccine dose.</p>
<p>But the crucial message from these early studies is that we still need a lot more information to assess the national and global impact of the rapid spread of this new variant.</p>
<p>We need more and larger studies on neutralising antibodies after different combinations of vaccines and previous infections.</p>
<p>We also need studies of the ability of other protective mechanisms (T-cells, binding antibodies) to control infections and disease caused by Omicron. And we need to know how much these mechanisms are also boosted by a third vaccine dose.</p>
<p>And above all, we need large, real-time studies of levels of infection and disease attributable to Omicron to allow rapid, rational public health decisions to be made.</p>
<p>Research groups around the world are addressing all these areas and, in the near future, we can expect their reports to make the situation clearer.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Parents believing conspiracy theories threaten COVID-19 vaccination drive for kids </h1>
<div> <p>With the young taking up an increasingly large proportion of COVID-19 cases, British experts say vaccine misinformation is preventing parents from keeping their kids safe.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Darel Cookson </a> , <a> Daniel Jolley </a> , <a> Rachel Povey </a> <a> Robert Dempsey </a> </div> </div>
<p>NOTTINGHAM, England: Older people may be more vulnerable to COVID-19, but in the UK it’s the young who are now driving the pandemic.</p>
<p>Last month, school-age children in Britain were 15 times more likely than people over 80 to have the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Leaving young people unvaccinated partly explains why cases have been so high in this group. This is why many countries are now offering COVID-19 jabs to children.</p>
<p>In the UK, all 12 to 15-year-olds are being offered a first vaccine dose. Some countries – such as the US and Israel – are offering COVID-19 vaccines to children aged five and over.</p>
<p>Of course, with younger children, it’s their parents that decide whether they get the jab – and vaccine hesitancy can be a problem. In a recent US poll, three in 10 parents said they would definitely not vaccinate their child against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Concerns about side-effects or the perceived lower risk of COVID-19 to kids may explain this. However, anti-vaccine conspiracy theories may also be playing a role.</p>
<p>We know that anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs can be a barrier to vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>A 2014 study showed that British parents exposed to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, when asked to imagine that they had a fictional eight-month-old, were less likely to get that child vaccinated.</p>
<p>Also, a more recent study across 24 countries demonstrated that anti-vaccine attitudes were highest among those who were also high in conspiratorial thinking.</p>
<p>Once COVID-19 vaccines started being developed, it didn’t take long for specific conspiracy theories about them to appear – for instance that they contain microchips or make people infertile.</p>
<p>Research has shown that believing in such theories is associated with reduced intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>It’s therefore highly plausible that believing in COVID-19 conspiracies could prevent parents from wanting to vaccinate their children against the coronavirus.</p>
<h2>CORRECTING CONSPIRACIES</h2>
<p>Past research has shown that people are influenced by the perceived beliefs and behaviours of other people – what are known as “social norms”.</p>
<p>But these perceptions are often inaccurate, which can lead to people shaping their behaviour to fit a misperceived norm.</p>
<p>However, we didn’t know whether this was true specifically when it came to conspiracy theories. So as a first step, we explored whether there’s a link between perceived social norms and conspiracy beliefs among British parents.</p>
<p>Our finding backed up earlier research. Parents in the UK overestimated how much other British parents endorsed anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>And, as before, the more people believed that others believed these conspiracy theories, the more strongly they tended to believe themselves.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we then attempted to lower parents’ belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories by correcting their overestimation of what other parents think.</p>
<p>We did this using the Social Norms Approach, a simple technique that works by correcting misperceptions – for example, by giving people feedback on how they misjudged the actual beliefs and behaviours of others.</p>
<p>The aim of this is to recalibrate people’s perceptions, and so change their behaviour so that it aligns with what others actually think and do.</p>
<p>We tested this approach on a sample of British parents of young children. Parents first completed measures of their personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and their intentions to vaccinate a fictional child.</p>
<p>Next, they estimated to what extent “other UK parents” endorsed the same conspiracy theories and what their intentions to vaccinate would be.</p>
<p>Parents were then allocated to either receive feedback on their beliefs, which would correct any misperceptions of other parents’ conspiracy beliefs, or no feedback.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, participants were again asked about their anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and intentions.</p>
<p>We found that correcting misconceptions reduced parents’ beliefs in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>It also increased perceptions that other parents would vaccinate their children, which as a knock-on effect increased parents’ own intentions to have a child vaccinated.</p>
<h2>A SIMPLE STEP TO IMPROVE UPTAKE</h2>
<p>When talking with people who might be persuaded by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, a practical step could be to highlight that conspiracy beliefs are not as commonplace as people might think.</p>
<p>Showing that it’s far more usual to vaccinate rather than not vaccinate could also be persuasive.</p>

<h1> Commentary: The US is not responsible for China’s rise </h1>
<div> <p>The Middle Kingdom's reemergence as a world power is an inevitability, not an American blunder, argues the Financial Times' Janan Ganesh.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Janan Ganesh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Nations too have losses to process. Whether or not China ever surpasses it, the US has been bereaved of its 1990s unipolarity. It copes with the trauma by dwelling on what could have been done about it.</p>
<p>The West might have postponed its arrival at the top table, at some cost. Preventing it outright was never in its power.</p>
<h2>NO LUNCH INVITATION NEEDED</h2>
<p>Consider its two implications. First, the WTO, in 2001, could have plausibly blackballed a fifth of humanity that had just undergone a generation of market-friendly reforms.</p>
<p>Second, doing so would have somehow only stymied China, and not the West, even though American and other companies gorged on low-wage labour there ever after.</p>
<p>If this were just academically wrong, it need not detain us. But there are political consequences to this fantasy. One theme that Donald Trump rode to the White House was that US elites were derelict and even complicit in China’s rise.</p>
<p>Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama are still held to have sold out industrial America (but not credited for the cheap consumer goods that flowed into many of the same households from a trading China).</p>
<p>The premise that a mighty China is some kind of aberration, and not just a regression to the historic mean, props up a lot of US populism.</p>
<p>Progressives have their own version of this solipsism. A vicious civil war in the Arabian Peninsula? Blame Western arms sales. Poverty in Africa? The Washington Consensus. Meltdown in Afghanistan? How dared we abandon it.</p>
<p>It is a stab at global consciousness that could not be any more parochial. It is a pretence of humility that is actually the most fantastical claim of omnipotence.</p>
<h2>GUILT AND MARGINALISATION</h2>
<p>The West is forever confronting a harsh “truth” (how guilty we are) in order to duck a harsher one (how marginal we are).</p>
<p>The trouble with this surface toughness is that it suggests China doesn’t have enough going for it to prosper under its own steam.</p>
<p>If so, why the hawkishness? Why the eternal vigilance and military largesse? China cannot be an awesome century-long rival and an unwitting creation of soft-headed free-trade liberals all at once.</p>
<p>The truth is that no one takes China more seriously than those who recognise that it is too vast and ambitious to have been contained for long, with or without WTO membership. The real hawks are the fatalists.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Preparing your child for the COVID-19 vaccine jab isn't easy. Here's how to do it </h1>
<div> <p>Most children are fearful of needles. But for some children, this fear is more serious and can be defined as a needle phobia, says a child therapist.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Judi Parson </a> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: Your child’s experience of needles in their early years may impact how they feel about and react to subsequent vaccinations. </p>
<p>So it’s important to reduce the chance of a negative experience.</p>
<p>But what can parents do to help prepare their child for the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine or other injections?</p>
<p>Most children are fearful of needles. But for some children, this fear is more serious and can be defined as a needle phobia.</p>
<p>In severe cases, the level of anxiety caused by just the sight of a needle may result in feelings of dizziness, nausea, increased sweatiness, loss of consciousness, and fainting.</p>
<p>Almost one in five children (19 per cent) aged four to six have a needle phobia, and this decreases to one in nine (11 per cent) by age 10 to 11. Among adults, about 3.5 to 10 per cent have a needle phobia.</p>
<p>Working as a nurse, I still remember Emma, a five-year old girl, who was petrified of needles. I recall her little face, the anger and fear, the tears and screams just at the sight of a needle.</p>
<p>Her increasing fear was due to previous blood tests, injections, and other medical procedures. And it didn’t get any easier until she got some professional play therapy help.</p>
<h2>REDUCING THE CHANCE OF A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>When booking vaccination appointments, consider asking the nurse to set aside extra time to prepare.</p>
<p>When children come for a vaccination, most nurses anticipate the child may be concerned and nervous, or very frightened of an injection.</p>
<p>Nurses may help by asking the child to tense and relax their muscles to prevent fainting. They may suggest taking a deep breath, holding it and breathing out slowly. They may also ask the child to wiggle their toes to provide some distraction.</p>
<p>Parents are the best advocates for their child and know how to support them during their immunisations.</p>
<h2>HOW CAN YOU PREPARE YOUR CHILD?</h2>
<p>The first step is to consider when to give your child information about the vaccine. For children under five years, a shorter time frame works better; for example, the same day.</p>
<p>For children five to six years, you might tell them up a day or two before; and for those seven years, up to a week before.</p>
<p>But if your child has a needle phobia, they may need significant help in a safe environment to play out their thoughts and feelings, and learn some stress management strategies.</p>
<h2>GETTING HELP FROM THERAPISTS</h2>
<p>This often starts with toy medical equipment and moves towards more authentic medical equipment.</p>
<p>The therapist provides information to the child by showing them how things work. The child may then develop mastery by injecting their doll or teddy, while the therapist provides cues for coping strategies and resiliency.</p>
<p>Some children need one or two sessions, but those with a needle phobia may require up to ten sessions or more.</p>
<p>Therapists can also teach parents skills to support their child during a needle or other medical procedure.</p>
<h2>USING PLAY THERAPY TECHNIQUES AT HOME</h2>
<p>Introduce some pretend medical equipment toys to your child’s playtime and notice if they’re curious or avoid them.</p>
<h4> <div>Why is there a niggling fear among some parents in deciding whether to get the COVID-19 vaccination? CNA's Heart of the Matter dives into the issues with a parent, a paediatrician and an epidemologist:</div> </h4>
<h2>WHAT TOOLS DO PLAY THERAPISTS USE?</h2>
<p>For Emma, after developing a therapeutic play relationship, I introduced and practised the Magic Glove Technique.</p>
<p>For children with good imaginations, they can learn to relax and pretend they have a magic invisible glove that makes their arm – and themselves – feel calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>For other children, I have used Buzzy, a mechanical vibrating device that looks like a bee, developed by American physician and pain researcher Amy Baxter. It has a cold pack and the vibration inhibits the sensation of pain.</p>
<p>If your child has a negative experience during their vaccination, and you’d like to access professional help, ask your GP for suggestions of local play therapists or child life therapists or child psychologists in your area.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How US-China decoupling became a self-fulfilling prophecy </h1>
<div> <p>Ever since the words "decouple from China" were uttered, the US and China have been engaged in a tariff war, sanctions and even a diplomatic boycott now at the Winter Olympics - actions few desire, says Chinese economist Yu Yongding.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Yu Yongding </a> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: In 2018, Steve Bannon, then-US President Donald Trump's chief strategist, argued that the United States needed to "decouple" from China.</p>
<p>Some decoupling is undeniably underway. In recent years, the two countries have been locked in a tariff war.</p>
<p>This trend extends beyond trade and technology. For example, the number of Chinese students enrolled in American universities has plummeted.</p>
<p>And the US has announced plans for a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, prompting condemnation from China.</p>
<p>Yet it is unlikely that either China or the US is as keen to decouple as these developments may suggest.</p>
<p>China has adopted a passive approach, reacting to US actions, while taking care not to initiate any fights. And while Americans broadly support a tough line on China, far fewer support cutting economic ties.</p>
<p>This may partly explain why even Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence, in 2019, answered with a "resounding no" when asked if the administration wanted to decouple from China.</p>
<p>More recently, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai argued that, far from decoupling - which "isn't a realistic outcome" - the US is pursuing "recoupling"; US officials are merely pinpointing their goals in this process.</p>
<h2>DESPITE DECOUPLING, BUSINESS IS BOOMING</h2>
<p>Whatever those goals turn out to be, some recoupling is already happening. As the US-China Business Council reports, after the two countries signed the Phase One trade agreement in 2020, both sides halted tariff escalations. </p>
<p>Furthermore, China instituted a "robust system of tariff exclusions," with the US also instituting some exclusions.</p>
<p>China has also been maintaining - or even deepening - its ties with the rest of the global economy.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2020, China's inbound FDI grew by more than 10 per cent, to US$212 billion, putting its share of global FDI at an all-time high of one-quarter, almost twice its share in 2019.</p>
<p>China is also pursuing complementary domestic reforms, aimed, for example, at achieving competitive neutrality. And it is using market mechanisms (such as exchange-rate flexibility) to balance its trade account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, China is working to strengthen its adherence to international rules and norms, such as intellectual-property protections - a key concern of foreign companies operating in China.</p>
<h2>CHINA’S 'STEADY EFFORTS' TO PURSUE TRADE</h2>
<p>As the US-China Business Council notes, China has made "steady efforts" to improve protection and enforcement of IP rights, and its IP laws and regulations "increasingly reflect international standards."</p>
<p>But, contrary to what some Western observers believe, China has been pursuing its own form of decoupling for more than a decade, since it launched a campaign to develop more advanced technologies at home.</p>
<p>This might not be exactly what the US envisioned when it supported China's accession to the WTO 20 years ago. But, in its own way, China is fulfilling the promise of that step, and it will most likely continue to do so, as long as the US lets it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Rudd's warning should not be taken lightly. If we keep talking about decoupling, we may well get it. That is an outcome we would all live to regret.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Vast majority of American workers like their jobs – even as a record number quit them </h1>
<div> <p>The narrative of the Great Resignation is that workers hate their jobs and are desperate to quit. The data tells a somewhat different story, says a Canadian sociology professor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Scott Schieman </a> </div> </div>
<p>TORONTO: A record share of American workers are <a>quitting their jobs</a>, thanks in part to a strong economy and a labour shortage.</p>
<p>Does that mean Americans are unhappy with where they work?</p>
<p>The answer would seem to be yes, according to many economists and other observers. That’s the narrative driving the Great Resignation, in which workers are simply fed up with their current jobs and demanding something better.</p>
<p>Survey data I’ve been collecting during the pandemic, along with social survey results from previous years, however, suggests this is far from the whole story.</p>
<p>Rather than being motivated simply by dissatisfaction, it appears many of them are simply taking advantage of a strong economy to look around, while for others, the pandemic has prompted them to consider their options.</p>
<p>The General Social Survey, a reputable national survey of American adults, has been asking workers questions about how they feel about the quality of their working life since 2002.</p>
<p>There are actually three key types of questions it asks that help us get at this idea: The level of dissatisfaction with current work, turnover intention and confidence in finding a new job.</p>
<p>Let’s start with dissatisfaction. The question is: “On the whole, how satisfied are you with the work you do – would you say you are very satisfied, moderately satisfied, a little dissatisfied or very dissatisfied?”</p>
<p>In 2002, about 12 per cent of respondents said they were very dissatisfied or a little dissatisfied with their work, a figure that barely changed in subsequent surveys through 2018.</p>
<p>In 2021, a tad over 16 per cent said they weren’t satisfied – an increase, but not a big one. And on the flip side, a little over 83 per cent said they were moderately or very satisfied.</p>
<p>This means that by and large the vast majority of Americans – at least according to this survey – express moderate to high satisfaction with their work.</p>
<p>My interpretation of a “very likely” response to this question is that it signals an immediate interest in leaving their present job. In 2002, about 19 per cent said they were very likely to try to find a new job soon. </p>
<p>Over the years, the share who said this rose and fell a little, but has remained very consistent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the survey hasn’t posed the question since 2018, so I partnered with polling company Angus Reid Global to conduct two large national surveys of American workers in November 2020 and November 2021.</p>
<p>One of the questions I asked was the one on turnover intentions, though I extended the period of time in which they expected to look for a new job to two years.</p>
<p>As you might expect given the rising quit rate, the share saying they were very likely to hunt for a new position jumped. It rose to 26 per cent in 2020 and to 29 per cent in November 2021.</p>
<p>While it’s likely that my number is a bit elevated just because of the extended time horizon – two years instead of one – the increase is consistent with the Great Resignation narrative that workers are keen to find a better workplace.</p>
<p>But these two figures – job satisfaction and turnover – reveal an interesting paradox: A greater share of people say they are contemplating quitting than express dissatisfaction with their current job.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities for why a worker might be happy with their job, yet eyeing a move to another company. Perhaps they’re seeking more status or reconsidering their career, or maybe they’re worried about possible layoffs.</p>
<h2>CONFIDENCE IN THE JOB SEARCH</h2>
<p>An additional theme in the Great Resignation narrative is that workers feel more confident about finding alternative job prospects – and that’s one reason they have been quitting in droves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the General Social Survey asks that very question: “How easy would it be for you to find a job with another employer with approximately the same income and fringe benefits as you now have – not at all easy, somewhat easy or very easy?”</p>
<p>Two years before the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2018, about a quarter of respondents said finding another job would be very easy. I asked the same question in my 2021 survey and found that number had actually decreased to around 22 per cent.</p>
<p>This means that worker confidence or optimism about finding a palatable alternative job has not climbed all that much, making it less likely to be a factor in driving the current wave of resignations.</p>
<h4> <div>Listen to HR experts explain what’s behind worker unhappiness despite greater attention on workplace well-being and what managers should do on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<p>While the data doesn’t show that Americans overwhelmingly love their jobs or anything like that, they do suggest most people like them enough to hold on to them.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the end of the story. The data does show important differences depending on the type of job we’re talking about.</p>
<p>For example, workers in the service sector were more dissatisfied with their jobs and much more likely to express an intent to quit than the average respondent.</p>
<p>But all in all, the survey data doesn’t support the common narrative that it’s a “take this job and shove it” economy, in which increasingly unhappy workers are finally sticking it to their managers.</p>
<p>Rather, when you dig down into the data, something different appears: A slice of workers are always considering leaving their jobs – and as the labour market looks brighter, the pent-up impulse to quit kicks in.</p>
<p>But the shift in worker sentiment – or at least the way it has been portrayed – seems exaggerated.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Our festive shopping will cost us far more than our holiday bills </h1>
<div> <p>Our shopping habits are anything but environmentally friendly, and unless sustainable shopping is achieved, the consequences of our Christmas shopping will take a hefty toll on the environment, says a Canadian academic.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jennifer Ellen Good </a> </div> </div>
<p>ST CATHERINES, Canada: As extreme weather events in Canada and around the world are linked to human-made climate change, there is one story that continues to be left out: The connection between climate change and the products we purchase.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that across a product’s life cycle — from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal — the total embedded carbon emissions are 6.3 times the product’s weight.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it is the product’s supply chain, or what we do not see related to making and distributing products, that is especially carbon intensive.</p>
<p>In the context of human history, the changes to our relationship with the material world have happened in the blink of an eye. Our ancestors lived in direct connection with the land that physically and spiritually sustained them.</p>
<p>Only in very recent human history have so many of us lived our lives at such a great distance from that which sustains us. Today, unchecked consumerism is helping drive a changing climate that is very much affecting all people.</p>
<h2>STORIES TO BUY MORE STUFF</h2>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution introduced mass production, companies have devoted tremendous quantities of time and money to educating people about the value of the ever-increasing quantities of stuff for sale.</p>
<p>They have told us what to covet, what our stuff says about who we are or our status in the world and why we need to buy even more.</p>
<p>As marketing consultant Victor Lebow wrote in the Journal of Retailing in 1955, “We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing pace.”</p>
<p>Appeals to consume more stuff — clothes, electronics, appliances, toys, cars and so on — used to be found only in advertisements. In the 1990s, the average American was targeted by 3,000 advertising messages a day.</p>
<h2>IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
<p>In the past few decades, those in more materially affluent parts of the world have enthusiastically added more stuff to their lives and discarded hastily.</p>
<p>For example, in the US, the average person’s consumption of stuff has doubled in the past 50 years and, in 2019, North Americans disposed of almost 21 kilograms of electronic waste per person.</p>
<p>The consequences of our rabid consumption are borne out in the planet’s ecosystems. Consumption in “developed” countries has led to massive-scale logging of the Earth’s forests, leaving just three per cent of the world’s ecosystems intact.</p>
<p>The widespread production, use and disposal of plastics has deposited about eight million tonnes of plastic waste into the world’s oceans each year.</p>
<p>These outcomes have historically been experienced as “tragedies of the commons.”</p>
<p>It begins with the collection of “resources” — minerals, metals, oil, water and wood — and follows with their assembly into products, their distribution, use and often quick disposal.</p>
<p>Each step in a product’s life cycle has environmental consequences and a carbon footprint.</p>
<p>For example, trees are the Earth’s carbon storehouse but the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that 10 million hectares of forests are lost each year.</p>
<p>Furniture and furnishings in municipal waste (mostly wood products) amounted to almost nine million tonnes in 2018, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, nearly five times more than what was landfilled in 1960.</p>
<p>Yet, old-growth forests continue to be cut down and consumers don’t know which forest products contain 100-year-old trees.</p>
<p>While producing or buying differently may decrease our carbon footprint, ultimately, the planet’s wealthiest will need to produce and consume less.</p>
<h2>LARGE AND SMALL SCALE CHANGE NEEDED</h2>
<p>Making an effort to buy less during the holidays could have a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>Americans, for example, produce 25 per cent more waste between US Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, discarding half of their yearly paper waste — holiday wrapping and decorations — totalling about eight billion tonnes.</p>
<p>Likewise, Canadians will send more than 2.6 billion cards and wrap gifts using 540,000 tonnes of wrapping paper over the holidays. For every kilogram of paper, 3.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide are produced.</p>
<p>Indeed, a big part of coming to terms with consumption and climate change involves acknowledging the inordinate consumption and climate impact of the wealthy.</p>
<p>UNEP points out that the planet’s richest 10 per cent contribute almost 50 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the planet’s poorest 50 per cent contribute only 12 per cent of global emissions.</p>
<p>We must challenge stories that encourage fast and “cheap” consumption and demand the telling of — and share — stories that accurately link our copious consumption to the devastating effects of climate change.</p>
<p>We must elect leaders who will do the hard work of transitioning away from an endless growth economy based on the excessive consumption of monetarily cheap but planet-expensive products.</p>
<p>We must demand vital product information such as life cycle carbon footprints. And we must all commit to resisting the constant appeals to consume fast and cheap, by giving less stuff, more slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<h1> Commentary: ‘Sorry, I don’t understand that’ – the trouble with chatbots and how to use them better </h1>
<div> <p>Chatbots can be a source of headache for many internet users, as technical difficulties come along with asking a pre-written computer programme for help using human language, say technology experts.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lena Waizenegger </a> <a> Angsana Techatassanasoontorn </a> </div> </div>
<p>Interactions with chatbots have become increasingly common in our daily lives. But when asking for information or trying to solve a problem, we’re often annoyed when the chatbot either can’t understand or misinterprets our inquiry.</p>
<p>Even worse is when it advises us to contact the call centre or visit a web page, which defeats the purpose of using chatbots in the first place.</p>
<p>Second, many chatbots are rule-based and have a narrow knowledge base, which means grammatical and syntactical errors can throw them off and complex questions often can’t be answered, disappointing customers.</p>
<p>Although it’s easy to blame the chatbot for a miserable experience, we need to realise that, just as it takes two hands to clap, it takes both chatbot and customer to create a satisfactory interaction.</p>
<p>While previous studies have focused mainly on the chatbot, including why companies implement them and the design cues that characterise them, there hasn’t been much consideration of the customer’s role in these interactions.</p>
<p>In our latest research, we put the spotlight on how customers deal with chatbots and suggest ways to improve the experience.</p>
<p>We find that to create constructive, meaningful engagement with a chatbot, the actions and reactions of the customer and a willingness to make it work are as important as the chatbot’s own functionality.</p>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING CHATBOTS</h2>
<p>We identified six distinct types of human-chatbot interactions: Socialising, collaborating, challenging, accommodating, committing, and redirecting.</p>
<p>These vary depending on who is driving the conversation (the chatbot or the customer), how “real” they perceive each other to be, their social cues, and the customer’s effort.</p>
<p>In the case of socialising, the chatbot tries to entertain the customer – for example, by telling jokes or trying to cheer them up if they detect a bad mood.</p>
<p>Collaborating interactions are those conversations where both the chatbot and the customer work together on the customer’s needs, such as booking a flight or understanding the root cause of a problem and identifying solutions.</p>
<p>Both socialising and collaborating interactions involve smooth exchanges between the chatbot and customer and mostly lead to positive outcomes.</p>
<h2>GETTING QUESTIONS RIGHT</h2>
<p>Accommodating interactions are ones where the customer is in the driver’s seat, helping the chatbot understand their needs by changing the way they phrase the question or statement, repeating their request or clarifying their intent.</p>
<p>On the flip side, a committing interaction sees the chatbot more engaged than the customer, trying to provide an answer to a question or solving a customer’s problem.</p>
<p>In those cases, chatbots often ask follow-up questions and provide additional information that might be relevant.</p>
<p>These two types of interactions, however, often leave customers without the required information.</p>
<p>In some cases, people see the novelty of chatbots as an open invitation to challenge them and see when it breaks.</p>
<p>This type of interaction usually leads nowhere, since most chatbots aren’t trained for off-topic questions such as “do you want to marry me?” or “what is the meaning of life?”.</p>
<p>Lastly, when redirecting a customer, chatbots act more like a navigator, pointing to alternative information sources such as the company’s website, and don’t directly respond to inquiries.</p>
<p>These interactions are very short and may not be an ideal outcome for the customer.</p>
<p>Based on our research, we provide three tips for your next encounter with a chatbot:</p>
<p>1. Remember that a chatbot is not human and many chatbots can’t understand nuanced natural language, so try not to use complex sentences or provide too much information at once</p>
<p>2. Don’t give up too quickly – if the chatbot doesn’t understand your question or request the first time, try to use keywords, menu buttons (if available) or short sentences</p>
<p>3. Give it a second chance – chatbots acquires new “skills” over time, so it might now be able to solve a problem or answer a question it couldn’t two months ago.</p>
<p>The introduction of chatbots has redefined the way customers, employees and technology interact, and we encourage organisations to take a holistic view of their customer service systems when redesigning them.</p>
<p>Careful consideration should be given to the changing role of customer service employees who need to work with chatbots. Additionally, we recommend organisations:</p>
<p>1. Reimagine a customer service team – involve people in the redesign of customer service delivery through a mix of chatbots and actual employees</p>
<p>2. Treat chatbots like a new (digital) employee – spend time and effort extending their skills</p>
<p>3. Find the sweet spot for escalating an enquiry to a contact centre employee – some chatbots refer people too early (causing congestion), while others offer the option frustratingly late. Experiment to find the right timing</p>
<p>4. Monitor the chat interactions – learn how and what questions customers ask and extend your chatbot’s knowledge base accordingly.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Is it unprofessional when your child interrupts your office Zoom meeting? </h1>
<div> <p>In a completely upside-down work world, the lines have blurred between work and home. Should we get annoyed when one part of life seeps into another? Cherie Tseng takes a side.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cherie Tseng </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: For all the advances that have been made over the last two years of people finding a better balance with work and family, there remains one small but not insignificant micro-aggression that comes up every now and then.</p>
<p>Like many working adults today, I share my workspace with the rest of my family. My husband, who has also been working from home since the circuit breaker in April 2020, sits a stone’s throw away from me. </p>
<p>My three children each have their own desks and we are all cluttered in the same room, our books and files stacked in the same shelves. </p>
<p>It sounds strange but I take many of my calls in my walk-in wardrobe. In fact, during a podcast recording with CNA, the neighbour began fumigating and that wardrobe was my refuge. We all do what we must.</p>
<h2>KIDS APPEARING DURING OFFICE ZOOM MEETINGS</h2>
<p>When these instances come up, I am thankful my fellow meeting attendees have been understanding, even senior business counterparts. </p>
<p>Until it dawned on me I had to find a more sustainable and reasonable way forward given my new reality that work was at and from home.</p>
<h2>PARENTING WHILE WORKING FROM HOME</h2>
<p>In a recent survey, People Magazine said kids come stumbling into digital boardrooms, client calls and other work calls as many as five times a day. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the survey shows parents can be equally disruptive when their children are learning online. But that’s what families living and working together looks like.</p>
<p>Recently, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Arden showed world leaders are not above such mundane parenting interruptions. During a Facebook Live COVID-19 update, her three- year-old daughter, Neve, enters the room looking for mum. </p>
<p>Arden doesn’t shoo her away but tries to get her to go back and after what seems a failed attempt, simply stops the meeting and tells everyone the simplest truth: She may be the PM but she needs to be a mum too. </p>
<h2>SHOULD WE FEEL GUILTY?</h2>
<p>Is it unprofessional for children to be in a work setting? Can’t parents separate the two? After all, you don’t expect your client or boss to show up for a meeting wearing pyjamas.</p>
<p>Another camp – and not just parents - embraces this intermingling of work and life. </p>
<p>The article continues, “Work-life balance has always been flawed—balance is subjective and not always achievable—but flexibility, empathy, and grace in the workplace are values we should have already been upholding.”</p>
<p>Professor Catherine Lumby writing in The Guardian concurs. Children interrupting Zoom meetings might be the reboot corporate culture needed.</p>
<p>Family, in that pre-pandemic work world, existed in curated photos on our desks, cute artwork on our walls, little anecdotes we shared over lunch or company events. </p>
<p>This doesn’t mean parents get to throw all good sense out their Zoom windows. No pyjamas, no breakfast during a pitch, no screaming child while your CEO is talking. </p>
<p>Beyond that, it is time to accept what this true blurring of lines really means – you can’t ignore a child who needs attention or an elderly parent who needs care. There is no real damage in stepping out of frame for a bit. </p>
<p>As lines are well and truly blurred, it has become unrealistic to expect colleagues and counterparts to not have some parts of their family life seep into a work environment because now and for the foreseeable future, work happens at home. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Should women trying to get pregnant be given leave? </h1>
<div> <p>Birth rates are dropping at an alarming rate, and reproduction leave may the answer to it, say University of Sydney experts.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Marian Baird </a> , <a> Elizabeth Hill </a> <a> Sydney Colussi </a> </div> </div>
<p>SYDNEY: Balancing the competing demands of work and care, or “production” and “reproduction”, is traditionally a burden carried by women.</p>
<p>But beyond the personal cost, there is an impact on the economy, workplaces and gender equality.</p>
<p>In Australia, this is reflected by declining fertility rates and the withdrawal of women from the labour market in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Future fertility rates are predicted to drop to a record low of around 1.6 babies per woman, one of the lowest rates on record. This is below “replacement level”, putting additional pressure on an already strained workforce.</p>
<p>After decades of growth, women’s participation in employment is also falling, likely driven by the ongoing strain of lockdowns and a recalibration of work and care responsibilities .</p>
<p>These trends paint a grim picture of the state of production and reproduction in Australia. But we can make policy changes to better help young people navigate work and care. One of these is reproductive leave.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS REPRODUCTIVE LEAVE?</h2>
<p>In Australia, as well as countries such as the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand, “reproductive leave” has emerged as an innovative response to the tensions between work and human reproduction.</p>
<p>These policies aim to assist workers in balancing their paid work obligations with their reproductive needs, sexual health and overall well-being.</p>
<p>These policies may offer support to workers who are trying to start a family, or to anyone who is managing some of the complex needs of the human body, which requires different levels of attention and maintenance over the life course.</p>
<p>For example, there is evidence Australian women struggle to balance the demands of IVF treatment with paid work obligations. There is also data to suggest painful periods may contribute to absenteeism.</p>
<h2>UNIONS, PRIVATE COMPANIES LEAD THE WAY</h2>
<p>We are starting to see a wide range of workplace policies in this area.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Health and Community Services Union in Victoria began a push for reproductive health and well-being leave as part of their enterprise bargaining process.</p>
<p>This claim includes paid leave and flexible working arrangements for menstruation, menopause, miscarriage and stillbirth, fertility treatments, vasectomies, hysterectomies and gender affirmation therapies (negotiations are ongoing).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ethical superannuation company Future Super announced paid leave for menstruation and menopause, as did the Australian-owned period underwear brand Modibodi.</p>
<p>Global music streaming platform Spotify also made headlines recently for its generous “family formation” benefits that provide employees with a lifetime allowance for IVF treatments, donor services and fertility assessments.</p>
<h2>PART OF A GLOBAL MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>But there is a renewed energy surrounding reproductive leave, demonstrating an increasing acceptance of the complex entanglement of work and personal life.</p>
<p>There is a drive to bring the body into the modern workplace and to pay attention to biological and social reproduction as a means of assisting in economic production.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, we will not have a future generation of workers and taxpayers if we fail to accommodate the reproductive needs and activities of today’s workers and taxpayers.</p>
<p>These policies are also part of a global movement to normalise and accommodate the body at all stages of life and for all people across the sex and gender spectrums, including cisgender, transgender, gender diverse and non-binary people.</p>
<h2>SOME PEOPLE HAVE OBJECTIONS</h2>
<p>But how well accepted will these policies be?</p>
<p>Acknowledging the potential drawbacks of reproductive leave must be part of the policy conversation. These policies must be approached cautiously and designed in a way that minimises the risk of gender stereotyping.</p>
<h2>THE FUTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE LEAVE IN AUSTRALIA</h2>
<p>Despite significant developments within trade unions and private companies, there are limited provisions for reproductive leave in national legislation. For many workers their only option is to claim personal leave: That is, “sick” leave.</p>
<p>Recent announcements by the federal and NSW governments that parents who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth are now eligible for paid bereavement leave is a start – but they need to go further.</p>
<p>For example, we could explore a “model clause” for reproductive leave in modern awards or a legislative amendment to the National Employment Standards to include a gender-inclusive reproductive leave provision.</p>
<p>This provision would conceivably provide days of unpaid or paid job protected leave, in a similar manner to the origins of parental leave and more recently domestic and family violence leave.</p>
<p>We must take the opportunity of COVID-19 to reconfigure our gender contract. It is clear that without policies that enable people to work, care and reproduce, Australia will be a poorer and smaller nation.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Holidays can be stressful during these pandemic times </h1>
<div> <p>The festive season is a period of anxiety for many, according to Irish psychologists and they offer techniques to cope.</p> </div>

<p>DUBLIN, Ireland: We often think of Christmas as a time of joy and happiness. But for some people, this time of year is more stressful than getting caught speeding or jaywalking.</p>
<p>Christmas has even been linked to an increased risk of heart attack possibly due to the yearly pressure and emotional distress.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people find Christmas to be stressful – including pressure to find the perfect gift to give someone, pressure to have the perfect family gathering, and financial worries.</p>
<p>The pandemic has only worsened the negative effect of the holidays on mental health.</p>
<p>But there are a few things people can do to help them deal with the stress of the holiday season.</p>
<p>Many people beat themselves up if their Christmas isn’t perfect – especially parents. It’s important to try not to fall into this “perfectionism trap” where you’re motivated by fear of failure.</p>
<p>Not only can it lead to feelings of distress and lower life satisfaction for parents, it might also lead some to avoid their favourite parts of the holidays due to fear of getting things wrong.</p>
<p>But avoiding things or worrying about perfection may mean we miss out on some of the positive things that happen at this time of year.</p>
<p>Having an imperfect Christmas may even be beneficial to you. By embracing the possibility of things going wrong, we can actually learn to be flexible and better deal with failure or challenges the next time we face them.</p>
<p>Since we can’t avoid Christmas, trying to change how we think about it might help us cope with the stress.</p>
<p>There are three simple steps you can follow to do this. The first step is acknowledging that Christmas is indeed stressful, and that you may be feeling stressed about it.</p>
<p>Finally, look at your typical response to stress and ask if it’s getting in the way of what’s important to you.</p>
<p>For example, you might be stressed because you want everything to be perfect for your children on Christmas day – but that stress may mean you end up shouting at them.</p>
<p>While following these steps won’t actually reduce the amount of stress you’ll experience, it will change how you see the impact of the stress on you.</p>
<p>You can even repackage how you see the holidays by simply changing how you talk about them.</p>
<p>For example, try saying “Christmas isn’t stressful, it’s exciting!” or “I’m excited and I’m really worked up about Christmas because I love my family and I am so looking forward to making the experience wonderful for them!”</p>
<p>This may help you feel more excited and less stressed about the holidays – and may help you cope better when you do face stress.</p>
<h2>PRACTICE SELF-COMPASSION</h2>
<p>Even if you do find yourself becoming stressed by the holidays, having self-compassion may help you feel less distressed in the moment. It may even improve wellbeing and reduce the negative impact of stress.</p>
<p>Self-compassion involves taking kind action towards yourself during moments of stress.</p>
<p>For example, meditation – specifically a type known as loving kindness meditation – may help improve self-compassion, and help us feel happier and more connected with others.</p>
<p>To practice this type of meditation, set aside around 10 minutes each day, especially in the lead-up to Christmas. Start by sitting somewhere comfortable and closing your eyes.</p>
<p>Then, imagine a person close to you who loves you, and redirect the feelings of love back to them. Then, follow the same process by thinking of other people in your life you know and care for, such as friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>The idea with this type of meditation is that it will reduce feelings of stress by taking attention away from yourself and your stress, and redirecting it towards others you love.</p>
<p>If meditation isn’t for you, getting out of the house and into nature can help reduce stress and improve your mood. Reducing the amount of time you spend on your phone may also help you feel less stressed and happier.</p>
<p>While the pandemic may make you feel even more stressed about Christmas, it’s important to remember the reasons why we’re celebrating.</p>
<p>This may help you feel less stressed about getting things right, and enjoy whatever time you can spend with family and friends.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Omicron wrecked holiday plans but benefits of long overseas vacations are overstated </h1>
<div> <p>Vacations are wonderful but a few days off can be just as useful as a week, says the Financial Times' Pilita Clark.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pilita Clark </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, or up a ski slope, or off to any other holiday spot this December, <a>along comes Omicron</a>.</p>
<p>Before news of the coronavirus variant emerged, I had been practising my year-end ritual of checking to see where I might be able to get to for a vacation.</p>
<p>Excitingly, it had looked as if it was finally safe to book a trip to see family in Australia without having to spend most of the holiday in quarantine. Even the cost of a flight had fallen from the stratospheric to the merely staggering.</p>
<p>“Wow,” I reported to my other half after a prolonged session of travel site scouring one night. “You can get from London to Sydney and back for less than £2,000.”</p>
<h2>OPTIMISM TURNED INTO LIMBO</h2>
<p>Five months ago, fares were being advertised for up to 10 times that price, one way.</p>
<p>Buoyed by similarly cheering travel news, many of my friends were also making getaway plans. Some were desperate to see far-flung relatives. Others just wanted to escape a grey London winter.</p>
<p>All this might still happen. Or <a>it might not.</a></p>
<p>At the time of typing, the world is still in Omicron limbo, waiting for scientists to say if the variant is likely to cast us back to the remorseless uncertainty of 2020, or not.</p>
<p>Either way, the idea of a holiday has become <a>vastly more complicated</a>. The good news is, this is not as disastrous as it might seem.</p>
<h2>DON’T NEED A LONG HOLIDAY TO ENJOY A BREAK</h2>
<p>There is no getting around the fact that vacations can make us feel more satisfied, happy and energetic, especially while we are having them.</p>
<p>But you do not need to go on a long holiday, or a foreign one, to enjoy the boost of a break.</p>
<p>The effect of a short vacation is just as strong as that of a longer one, some studies have shown, and getting away for less than five days is still a powerful way to improve health and happiness. Also, you do not need to go far.</p>
<p>“And vacations by car or rail are no less enjoyable than vacations by air.” </p>
<h2>THE JOY OF PLANNING A HOLIDAY</h2>
<p>It is also calming to consider the reasons we enjoy holidays so much.</p>
<p>Oddly, a lot of the joy comes before we even pack a toothbrush.</p>
<p>The pleasure of anticipating a break is significant and studies suggest it starts weeks or even months before a holiday begins.</p>
<p>One theory says this happens because our hunter-gatherer past has left us with an innate desire to roam that is still partly satisfied by the prospect of a week in Tenerife.</p>
<p>This idea could also explain why the post-break euphoria fades so fast, since we have had our fill of wandering and don’t have another break to look forward to.</p>
<p>Mitas puts it slightly differently. We are “soft and slow creatures”, he says, and hard-wired to survive by outsmarting our environment.</p>
<p>That means we suck our surroundings for information, like vacuum cleaners. The impulse that makes us constantly check our phones for new messages is linked to the pleasure we get from travelling somewhere new and different.</p>
<p>In other words, one reason we like holidays is because we are programmed to enjoy novelty.</p>
<h2>ACCEPT CANCELLING TRIPS IF NEEDED</h2>
<p>So what is Mitas’s advice for those whose overseas holiday plans have been disrupted by Omicron?</p>
<p>First, accept the blow of missing out on the sense of pre-trip anticipation.</p>
<p>But second, if circumstances still allow, do not give up entirely. “Please go on vacation!” he says. Get out of the house. Do something different, even if just for a few days.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth remembering that, as wonderful as holidays are, we have a tendency to exaggerate their brilliance.</p>
<p>Once back in harness at work, the post-break afterglow fades faster than we think. It has generally vanished within a week and lasts at most for two weeks, even after a very relaxing holiday, say researchers.</p>
<p>So if Omicron ends up completely wrecking your holiday plans, there is still the — admittedly small — consolation that the vacation was never going to leave you feeling better for quite as long as you thought.</p>
