<div><h1>A primer on how the IRS gift-tax law pertains to parents and their children</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ilyce Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>November 22, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>We have heard from a number of readers regarding the mention of elder abuse in a recent column, and one reader suggested reporting the abuser to the IRS.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That sibling would have to claim that amount and pay taxes on the difference, correct? At least it could stop the bleeding by that amount — maybe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’d also like to take the time to answer another question regarding an older homeowner.</p></div></div>
<b>A:</b> We’re not sure what your questions are. Your dad is in good health and doesn’t want to sell the properties. We don’t know how he uses these properties, where he lives full- or part-time or whether he needs cash to live on.
<div><p>More Matters: IRS likely to frown on homeowner’s scheme to get tax benefit by selling property to himself</p></div>
<div><div><p>So, if you rent all of these homes and your dad is getting good income from the rentals, where will your father call home?</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Matters: Crunching the numbers to determine whether a senior should buy or rent a home</p></div>
<div><div><p>If you can’t rent the D.C. property without causing an issue with the reverse mortgage, investigate selling the property, paying off the reverse mortgage and investing the net proceeds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Again, the right answer starts with a deep conversation with your dad about what he needs in the way of cash and help as he enters his 90s. We hope he stays healthy for a long time to come.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>No, the housing market isn’t in a bubble. But there still are many things to worry about in 2022. </h1></div>
<h2>A panoply of factors are in play that could prompt a rosy picture — or a dire forecast</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Mark Zandi</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>House prices are sizzling. Not just in swanky neighborhoods in the nation’s big cities or in resort towns. Not just in the suburbs or exurbs. Not just in inner cities or in rural areas. Just about everywhere.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, are we in another housing bubble?</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: The conundrum affordable housing poses for the nation</p></div>
<div><div><p>No. Not yet. But I say this with less confidence than I did a year ago, and if current trends continue for another year, I won’t be saying it at all.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: What actions can policymakers take to avert the brewing national housing crisis?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Based on these tried-and-true measures of house-price valuation, homes nationwide appear overvalued by as much as 15 percent, and in much of the South and West they are overvalued by more than 20 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: Housing market could shift under new tax law</p></div>
<div><div><p>Having said this, competition is heating up in the mortgage market, which in times past has driven lenders to ease their lending standards.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The script on house prices is still being written. The most graceful scenario is for prices to cool off, go more-or-less sideways, and allow incomes, rents and construction costs to catch up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the price declines won’t be broad-based. The stronger job market will forestall foreclosures and distressed sales, and the housing shortage will put a proverbial floor under prices in many communities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We should know soon which scenario will unfold.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I’m a blue-collar working theater actor and this is a big, buzzy Hollywood production,” Faist says. “And blue-collar theater actors don’t really get those chances.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘In the Heights’ is an award-winning hit. Its predecessor, ‘West Side Story,’ shocked audiences.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Thomas Floyd</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In D.C. Dream Day, we ask our favorite people in the area to tell us how they would spend a perfect day in the District.</p></div></div>
<p><i>As someone who lives with multiple sclerosis, </i> <i> <b>Shantel Smith</b> </i> <i> understood she was in for a uniquely rigorous “Survivor” experience when she signed up to compete on Season 41 of the CBS reality competition.</i></p>
<i>A D.C. resident until recently, Smith now resides in Frederick ahead of a move back to her hometown of Toronto. On her perfect day in the District, she stretches her legs, samples vegan cuisine, connects with old friends and makes some new ones. </i>
<a><b>Rock Creek Park</b></a>. I’m so Zen — I do a lot of meditating, a lot of praying — and it’s just one of the best places to start your day. And everyone you bump into is super friendly.
<a><b>Fare Well</b></a>. They have the best blueberry pancakes and the best French toast, and they also have an awesome take on vegan mac. After breakfast, I’d say goodbye to my friends and do yoga at
<b> <a>Hot Yoga Capitol Hill</a></b>
<a>,</a> which is this great place right next door.
<b>National Museum of African American History and Culture</b>
<a><b>Shouk</b></a>, which does modern Israeli food and is my favorite place to get
<a><b>Salt Sundry</b></a>, which has rings and wall art and pencil cases and table clothes and runners. If it’s my perfect day, I’ve rented a minivan and I’m filling it with tons of stuff from Salt Sundry.
<a><b>Georgetown Cupcake</b></a>.
<a><b>Howard University</b></a> — I like to just walk [around] and soak up the history. I’d also stop by
<a><b>Busboys and Poets</b></a>, which is a dope place to eat and read and grab a coffee, with the best vegan slice of chocolate cake that you will find in the city. After that, I would go to the
<b>H Street Corridor</b>, which has seen a lot of gentrification, but a lot of old D.C. culture is still there. And I’d go to my favorite bookstore,
<a><b>Politics and Prose</b></a>, to just unwind.

<div><div><p>For the past year, President Biden has tried to be his old, bipartisan, “we can all get along” self.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>He desperately wanted the country and Washington to return to being what they were when he was first elected to the Senate in 1972.
<div><div><p>On Thursday, Biden finally said: Enough.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You cannot love your country only when you win,” Biden declared. “You can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient. You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.”</p></div></div>

<p>It was an inflection point for Biden’s presidency as well. He acknowledged as clearly as he ever has that the Republican Party is no longer the constructive force in our politics that he often worked with as a senator and vice president.</p>
<div><div><p>“Too many others are transforming that party into something else,” he said. “They seem no longer to want to be the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And he did not hold back in describing what Trump has been doing:</p></div></div>
