<div><div><p>The messaging app Telegram, especially popular in former Soviet republics, was blocked along with Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others on Wednesday over a new law demanding local storage of data.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Their fight with Big Tech comes as Central Asian governments increasingly balk at Western influence and instead take their cues from powers such as China, which is investing heavily in the region.
<div><p>Key takeaway from the Facebook Papers</p></div>
<div><div><p><b/><b/>Central Asia is also following the playbook of traditional ally Russia on Internet controls.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How the founder of the Telegram messaging app stood up to the Kremlin — and won</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The rules of the game are largely set by Moscow,” said Arkady Dubnov, a political analyst and expert on Central Asia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In September, Apple and Google removed an opposition voting app from their online store<b/><b/>s in Russia, just as balloting began in the parliamentary election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Russian authorities were able to pressure the companies by threatening to prosecute their local employees.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Human rights advocates decry Apple, Google decision to pull Navalny app as Russia voting begins</p></div>
<div><div><p>Though the bill was framed as a child-protection measure and a way to curb cyberbullying, activists depict it as an effort to limit free speech and silence criticism of the government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Unfortunately, we are between two Big Brothers,” said Ruslan Dairbekov, director of the Digital Rights Center in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More than 10,000 people have signed a petition that said Kazakhstan’s law “would damage Kazakhstan’s international reputation and undermine the country’s sociopolitical development.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dairbekov said the public’s negative reaction to the bill as well as the government hailing its deal with Facebook — confusion notwithstanding — could doom the draft law.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Kremlin is notorious for global meddling online. But controlling cyberspace at home has been trickier.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Uzbekistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in January approved legislation that mandated tech companies store Uzbek users’ personal data in the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That prompted the country’s Internet regulator to block Telegram last week. The law was a copycat from Russia, which first used it as a basis for fining Google more than $40,000 in July.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mirziyoyev’s press secretary said in a statement on Telegram that the head of Uzbekistan’s Internet regulator was fired for “erroneous and uncoordinated actions.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“These actions by the authorities have raised doubts about the truthfulness of the government and presidential statements that the Internet and social networks will not be blocked,” she added.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Israel rolls out Pfizer covid pill, using digital health records to identify those most at risk</h1></div>
<h2>The country is among the first to put the new coronavirus treatment into use</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steve Hendrix</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:58 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a very promising drug,” said Ian Miskin, an infectious-disease specialist who oversees the Paxlovid program at Clalit. “This gives us something to turn to when everything else has failed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first shipment of a reported 20,000 courses of Paxlovid arrived at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport last week, making the country one of the first to obtain a supply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pfizer would not comment on the specifics of its agreements with Israel. A spokesperson said Israel received Paxlovid early because the country was one of the first to give it regulatory clearance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some governments are easing rules for isolation, citing dangers of economic and health-care strains from omicron spread</p></div>
<div><div><p>To flatten the curve, physicians are targeting patients who have tested positive and have underlying risk factors but are not yet seriously sick. There’s a window of a few days to find and treat those who fit the bill.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before these conversations even occur, computers cross-tabulate reports of positive coronavirus tests with existing medical files, then flag those individuals who might be most at risk and most likely to benefit from the drug.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And so, he recalled, the sore throat and fever he developed last week were scary. The positive coronavirus result that arrived by text message late Friday was terrifying. He feared he might end up on a ventilator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They said I was a perfect case but that it was totally up to me,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>His temperature had climbed, and his throat was burning by the next day when his wife ran out to meet a taxi on the street. She came back with a 30-pill course of medication, six a day for five days. He took the first three immediately.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Within 17 hours, his symptoms were almost gone, he said. “Now I’m just tired,” he said. “It’s like I went from covid to mononucleosis.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fast rollout of the drug has once again made Israel a test case, a role the country has played several times during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<a>world watched closely when Israel began administering the first shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</a> on a national scale in late 2020 and again when it launched booster shots in 2021 and
<a>a second round of boosters </a>for some this week. Pfizer,
<a>under an agreement with the government</a>, has collected anonymous data on vaccine performance from the electronic health records of almost all of Israel’s 9 million residents.

<div><span><div>Tyler Pager</div></span></div>
<div><div><p>President Biden announced last week that rapid coronavirus tests were a pillar of his plan to fight the new and <a>potentially more transmissible<b> </b>omicron variant</a>, now confirmed in at least 21 states.</p></div></div>
<a>the situation in countries such as Britain and Singapore, </a>where the government purchased the kits last spring and distributed millions of them free or at low cost.
<a>traveling</a> or gathering indoors with family members and friends — to avoid spreading the virus unintentionally, as many health experts now advise.
<a>including investing billions of dollars</a> to buy the tests directly from manufacturers. Public health experts welcome those initiatives but say more needs to be done.
<div><p>How scary is omicron? Scientists are racing to find answers.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There needs to be a revamped regulatory approach to get more and better tests out at scale, immediately, and free distribution to all Americans,” Topol said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A White House official also noted that over-the-counter tests are just one part of the nation’s testing infrastructure, saying the number of PCR tests, typically performed in a health-care setting, has increased.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zients said the administration would continue its efforts to make the tests more affordable and available.</p></div></div>

<a>race to get more information on the transmissibility of omicron</a> and its
<a>ability to evade vaccines.</a> Regulators say they’re confident that most of the rapid tests authorized in the United States will detect omicron infections because they do not rely on the spike protein,
<a>where many of its mutations</a> have been identified.
<a>undergo regular testing</a> if they are not vaccinated, as well as to “test to stay” school policies that enable children potentially exposed to infections to remain in class if they test negative.
<div><p>“We all need multiple self-test kits weekly that are free, to entice everyone to test,” she said. “Often, at $23 for two tests, many families don’t have the extra cash to pay for the tests in advance.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some state officials agree more needs to be done, citing their own difficulty obtaining tests that are supposed to go to the most vulnerable Americans.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Another White House official said the board deferred to the HHS because Congress appropriated testing money to that agency, but that the board helps coordinate testing efforts planned across the government.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>As the delta variant stampeded through the South over the summer, causing a growing number of breakthrough infections, the CDC would change that guidance. By that point, however, valuable time had been lost.</p></div></div>
<p>Faced with a huge falloff in sales just before the delta variant took hold, meanwhile, test manufacturer Abbott laid off thousands of workers and told employees to destroy excess test cards in June and July, the New York Times first reported.</p>
<div><div><p>“We rehired workers, reassembled manufacturing lines and critical machinery, and asked our suppliers to work with us again to beat back delta and prepare for the winter months,” Koval wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It would have been good if when we saw a drop in demand this summer, there had been a more aggressive plan to shore up the supply side to make sure we were prepared if the surge came back,” one of the officials said.</p></div>

<a>William Lloyd Garrison</a> and a young Frederick Douglass regarded the U.S. Constitution as a pro-slavery document. The Constitution, “dripping as it is with human blood,” Garrison
<a>proclaimed</a>, was the most “heaven-daring arrangement ever made by men for the continuance and protection of a system of the most atrocious villainy ever exhibited on earth.”
<div><div><p>Uncomfortable conversations about racism are an inbuilt feature of American life. And they have resulted in certain categories of modern thought.</p></div></div>
<a>Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and
<a>Douglass said</a>, “the Constitution is a glorious liberty document.” His fight for an anti-slavery Constitution and his embrace of political abolitionism shaped his century.
<p>Douglass remains the model for dealing with racism — in his righteous anger at systemic corruption in the American experiment, and in his belief in the redeeming power of American ideals and institutions. A sound education will cultivate both.</p>

<div><div><p>“We have the tools and institutions we need to address any concerns,” McConnell said. “The president has every right to look into allegations and request recounts under the law.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, Trump’s rhetoric has inflamed some of his supporters around the country, who have gathered in small “Stop the Steal” protests and declared that they do not have faith in the results.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the Ballot count,” Trump tweeted despite extensive reporting, and some live feeds, showing poll watchers had access. “Unthinkable and illegal in this country.”</p></div>
<p>Since Election Day, the Trump campaign and GOP allies have made claims of election irregularities in six states where Biden holds the lead in the vote count. But they have yet to prove any widespread fraud and have largely suffered defeat in courts.</p>
<div><p>Here are the GOP and Trump campaign’s allegations of election irregularities. So far, none has been proved.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But further complicating their effort: David Bossie, tapped to lead the campaign’s legal effort, tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a person familiar with the situation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gloria said he was confident in the election results. “We’ve had answers for every allegation that has been brought forward,” he said. “All we want to do is count votes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The office of Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford, meanwhile, said no formal complaints had been filed to his office as of Monday evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Georgia, a new level of intraparty hostility burst into view between Republicans who have questioned the election’s integrity and those who have publicly defended it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later in the day, Georgia’s two Republican senators, both headed to runoff elections Jan. 5, demanded that Raffensperger resign.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a fiery response, Raffensperger said he would not step down and defended the election process as orderly and transparent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden’s 11,595-vote lead in Georgia means the race is eligible for a recount, but Raffensperger emphasized it was unlikely to change the outcome of the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just as more Republicans came forward to back Trump’s legal push, others came forward to urge the country to move on.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>That means the GOP’s commitment to pay Trump’s personal legal expenses could be more than 10 times higher than previously known.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump’s longtime accountant testifies to N.Y. grand jury in criminal probe</p></div>
<div><div><p>The payments are expected to continue over the coming months, and the executive committee could approve amounts beyond $1.6 million if it chooses, the people familiar with the decision said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>James and Vance have said their probes are not politically motivated. James has promised in the past to use her perch to investigate Trump and his company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Campaign finance experts said there appeared to be nothing illegal about the payments. The RNC was free to pay for Trump’s legal fees, they said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The decision also shows the party continuing to help the former president ahead of what could be a competitive primary process in 2024, with Trump eyeing another bid.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“To pay the legal fees for someone who isn’t a candidate, and isn’t an employee — I’ve never seen that happen,” said Brett Kappel, a campaign lawyer at the firm Harmon, Curran, Spielberg Eisenberg.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In its first payments, in October, the RNC paid Ronald Fischetti, who has acted as Trump’s personal lawyer in the investigations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And while some members have called for the party to be more independent from Trump, a large majority of the party’s 168-member committee continues to support him, according to members and party officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We could have used that money in New Jersey,” he said, of paying Trump’s legal bills.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An RNC official said the party spent more in the state in the final days of the race but did not alert Palatucci personally, although it did inform the state party. </p></div></div>
<a> have interviewed Trump’s longtime banker and accountant</a>, and James has demanded a deposition from Trump in a separate civil case. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
<div><div><p>Since Trump won the 2016 presidential election, the RNC has spent more than $2.6 million at Trump’s hotels and clubs, according to campaign-finance data.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p> Trump has more than $100 million in his PAC and could pay his own bills, should he choose to do so. Trump has attacked James repeatedly, saying her investigation is a political “witch hunt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Ryan said no such ban applies to political parties.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So the RNC can pay Trump’s legal bills, even for an investigation unconnected to his time as president.</p></div></div>

<a>said</a> last month: “Looking at the policy on Iran in the last decade, the main mistake was the withdrawal of the U.S. administration from the agreement.” Former Mossad director Tamir Pardo
<a>described</a> the pullout as a “tragedy.” Retired general Isaac Ben Israel, chairman of the Israeli Space Agency,

<a>100,000 missiles</a> and rockets on Israel, enough to overwhelm its missile defenses. (In the
<a>2006 Lebanon war</a>, Hezbollah fired only 4,000 short-range rockets at Israel.) There’s a good reason no Israeli or American leader — not even hawks such as Netanyahu, George W. Bush and Trump — has been willing to bomb Iran. As I

<a>told ABC News</a> that Trump’s failure to call off his mob constituted a “dereliction of duty.” She noted that at any point, Trump could have gone on TV and urged the mob to stop, but didn’t. Cheney
<div><blockquote><div>I think one of the things the committee needs to look at — we’re looking at a legislative purpose — is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.</div></blockquote></div>
<div><p>Now note that Cheney has <a>repeatedly suggested</a> the committee is examining whether Trump, in refusing to talk down the mob, might have done so as part of a deliberate effort to obstruct Congress’ counting of electors.</p></div>
<div><p>The committee is <a>reportedly looking at whether to make</a> that the basis for recommending criminal prosecution. The grounds would be that it violated <a>federal law</a> barring obstruction of an “official proceeding.”</p></div>
<a>saw the violence as instrumentally helpful</a> in subverting the electoral count, and deliberately refrained from calling off the attack to serve that express goal.
<div><p>2 Capitol Police officers: The government we defended last Jan. 6 has a duty to hold all the perpetrators accountable</p></div>
<a>numerous Republicans frantically urged Trump</a> to call off the riot, even as he
<a>enjoyed watching it all unfold</a> on TV. Journalist Jon Karl
<a>reports that Trump</a> didn’t take at least one of their calls.
<div><div><p>The committee wants to determine whether Trump indicated a desire to see the mob continue disrupting the electoral count. We don’t know if it will prove this.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Reform to prevent another Jan. 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>This is an idea worth talking about, and NYU law professor Ryan Goodman says it’s legally doable.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Goodman said the committee could recommend this while avoiding implying that Trump’s conduct did not violate current statute. It could recommend “enhancing the criminal penalties for obstructing the electoral count.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>This would write an explicit protection against obstructing the electoral count into the law, Goodman said, but without undercutting the idea that “obstruction of congressional proceedings is already criminal.”</p></div></div>
<a>reform of the Electoral Count Act</a>.
<div><div><p>In an important sense, we already have our smoking gun. As Cheney <a>told ABC News</a>:</p></div></div>
<div>We have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence.</div>
<div><div><p>How many congressional Republicans would agree with this statement? How is it possible that the answer is: <i>Very few</i>?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We may soon get answers to those questions. And they probably won’t be to our liking.</p></div></div>
