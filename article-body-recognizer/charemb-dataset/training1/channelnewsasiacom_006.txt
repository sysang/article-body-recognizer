<div> <div> <p> <a> Living </a> </p> <h5> Four resolutions for a healthier tech life in 2022 </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> Living </p> <h1> Four resolutions for a healthier tech life in 2022 </h1> <div> <p>Identify what's most important, and re-examine your habits and impulses.</p> </div> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been packed with plenty of nasty tech surprises.</p>
<p>Yet there was a silver lining to all this: Valuable lessons to improve our relationship with tech for years to come, like becoming savvier online shoppers and taking control of our personal data.</p>
<p>Think of it as New Year’s resolutions, but for tech. Here are my top recommendations.</p>
<p>RESOLUTION 1: INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST</p>
<p>When people spend on technology, they generally buy gadgets before all else. Electronics like video streaming sticks were among the top-selling items on Black Friday, according to a research report published last month by Adobe.</p>
<p>RESOLUTION 2: CHECK BEFORE YOU CLICK THE BUY BUTTON</p>
<p>If you tried buying a high-quality face mask online in the pandemic, you probably ran into a fair number of fakes. Counterfeiters have flooded the market with poorly constructed masks, a problem that still persists today.</p>
<p>Be especially careful when buying anything that can affect someone’s health, including vitamins and dog food. When in doubt, buy these goods at a reputable brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<p>RESOLUTION 3: PRACTICE SELF-RELIANCE WITH YOUR DIGITAL DATA</p>
<p>Apple, which has long portrayed itself as a defender of digital privacy, delivered one of the year’s biggest tech surprises.</p>
<p>The episode was a reminder that when we use cloud services, our data is at the whims of a tech company. The lesson? We should consider changing how we manage our data so that we are more independent of the big companies and their cloud services.</p>
<p>RESOLUTION 4: SKIP THE ONLINE SALES EVENTS </p>
<p>Last month, many shoppers who tried snatching up deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday quickly learned there was something amiss.</p>
<p>Waiting until Black Friday to splurge has rarely been wise, but the pandemic-induced scarcity has made this clearer than ever. All year round, deals often emerge that are just as good – and sometimes better – than the promotions on Black Friday.</p>
<p>The tricky part is knowing when the cool stuff is cheaper. There are many ways to scout for discounts, like following sites that alert you to sales. Our sister publication Wirecutter tracks deals on its Twitter account and website, for example.</p>

<h1> Afraid of burning out from work? 10 small changes in your life to avoid that </h1>
<div> <p>Like everyone else, The Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington gets stressed out because of work – here’s what she does to get out of the funk. Hint: It includes “being bored”.</p> </div>
<p>On Apr 6, 2007, I woke up in a pool of my own blood. I was two years into building The Huffington Post.</p>
<p>And so, the morning after we returned home, I woke up burned out and exhausted – and collapsed. The result was a broken cheekbone, several stitches over my eye and the beginning of a long journey.</p>
<p>The answer was no. And the diagnosis I got from all the doctors was that I had a severe case of burnout.</p>
<p>So I got deep into the growing body of science on the connection between well-being and performance, and how we can actually be more productive when we prioritise our well-being and take time to unplug and recharge.</p>
<p>That’s why at Thrive Global, the company I founded to help people improve both their well-being and performance, our behaviour change system is built on the idea of microsteps.</p>
<p>People are tired of being sick and tired. They want to work and live in a way that doesn’t overwhelm them. And making even very small changes in our trajectory can, over time, lead us to a very different destination.</p>
<p>By making our microsteps too small to fail, we can make those first, small changes on which we can begin to build a new and healthier way of living and working. There’s nothing wrong with aiming big – but we can help ourselves by starting small.</p>
<p>Here are 10 of my favorite microsteps in a handful of areas of life. Each can serve as the foundation for continuing to make more changes in your life.</p>
<p>PICK A TIME AT NIGHT WHEN YOU TURN OFF YOUR DEVICES – AND GENTLY ESCORT THEM OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM</p>
<p>SET AN ALARM FOR 30 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR BEDTIME</p>
<p>When you think of sleep as an actual appointment, you’re much more likely to grant it the time it deserves. Setting an alarm reminds you that if you’re going to get to bed on time, you need to start wrapping things up.</p>
<p>SIT DOWN WHEN YOU EAT, EVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES</p>
<p>TURN A SIT-DOWN MEETING INTO A WALKING MEETING</p>
<p>Instead of sitting in a conference room, try walking with a colleague during a meeting. You’ll be less likely to peek at your devices, and the movement can help get the creative, problem-solving juices flowing.</p>
<p>TURN OFF ALL YOUR NOTIFICATIONS, EXCEPT FROM THOSE WHO NEED TO REACH YOU</p>
<p>The more our phone buzzes at us, the more it conditions us to release cortisol, or “the stress hormone.”</p>
<p>DO AN AUDIT OF YOUR PHONE’S HOME SCREEN TO REDUCE TIME-SAPPING DISTRACTIONS</p>
<p>Take just a few minutes to determine which apps you really need to access. Keep only “tools” that add value – not apps designed to consume more of your attention.</p>
<p>BLOCK TIME ON YOUR CALENDAR TO MANAGE YOUR EMAIL</p>
<p>Studies show that it takes an average of 25 minutes to refocus after being interrupted, so setting aside time for email can help you avoid constant inbox distractions.</p>
<p>SET ASIDE A SPECIFIC TIME (EVEN FIVE MINUTES) EACH DAY OR WEEK DEDICATED TO WORRY TIME</p>
<p>Write down or reflect on your worries and concerns. Don’t set any expectations about solving your worries or generating solutions, though you might find that solutions come naturally once you start reflecting.</p>
<p>DECLARE AN END TO THE DAY, EVEN IF YOU HAVEN’T COMPLETED YOUR TO-DO LIST</p>
<p>Effectively prioritising means being comfortable with incompletions. Once you’ve handled the day’s essential priorities, recognise that in any interesting job it’s almost impossible to do all you could have done in any one day.</p>
<p>By taking the time to recharge, you’ll return to work the next day ready to seize opportunities.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Nobel Prize-winning anti-apartheid hero Desmond Tutu dies aged 90 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JOHANNESBURG: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against apartheid who was revered as his nation's conscience by both Black and white, died on Sunday (Dec 26) aged 90.</p>
<p>Ever outspoken, he preached against the tyranny of the white minority.</p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu in a televised address as "one of our nation's finest patriots" adding, "our nation's loss is indeed a global bereavement".</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden said Tutu followed his spiritual calling to create a better, freer, and more equal world. "His legacy transcends borders and will echo throughout the ages."</p>
<p>"Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a mentor, a friend and a moral compass for me and so many others," former President Barack Obama said. "He never lost his impish sense of humour and willingness to find humanity in his adversaries."</p>
<p>Bill Clinton called Tutu's life "a gift".</p>
<h2>TWO NOBELS ON ONE STREET</h2>
<p>Born near Johannesburg, Tutu spent most of his later life in Cape Town and led numerous marches and campaigns to end apartheid from St George's Cathedral's front steps.</p>
<p>Tutu died "peacefully" on Sunday morning in a Cape Town nursing home, a representative of his Archbishop Desmond Tutu IP Trust said. He will lie in state at St George's on Friday before his funeral service there on Saturday, it said.</p>
<p>Looking frail and in a wheelchair, he was last seen in public in October at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town - a one-time safe haven for anti-apartheid activists - for a service marking his 90th birthday.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and was later hospitalised several times to treat infections associated with treatment for it.</p>
<p>Long-time friends, Tutu and Mandela lived for a time on the same street in the South African township of Soweto, making Vilakazi Street the only one in the world to have been home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners.</p>
<p>"His most characteristic quality is his readiness to take unpopular positions without fear," Mandela once said of Tutu. "Such independence of mind is vital to a thriving democracy."</p>
<h2>'A PROPHET AND A PRIEST'</h2>
<p>Having officially retired from public life on his 79th birthday Tutu - who once said of himself: "I wish I could shut up, but I can't, and I won't" - continued to speak out on a range of moral issues.</p>
<p>John Steenhuisen, leader of opposition party The Democratic Alliance, said Tutu's spirit would live on "in our continued effort to build a united, successful, non-racial South Africa for all."</p>
<p>In 2008, Tutu accused the West of complicity in Palestinian suffering by remaining silent.</p>
<p>In 2013, he declared his support for gay rights, saying he would never "worship a God who is homophobic".</p>
<p>Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby on Sunday hailed Tutu as "a prophet and priest" while Pope Francis offered heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones.</p>
<p>In a letter to Tutu's daughter Reverend Mpho Tutu, Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, said the world had "lost a great man, who lived a truly meaningful life".</p>
<p>"We are better because he was here," said Martin Luther King's daughter Bernice.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> 'Back to me in a coffin': Bodies of migrants drowned in English Channel reach Iraq </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SULAIMANIYA, Iraq: At least 16 bodies of Iraqi Kurdish migrants who drowned in November when their dinghy deflated while they tried to cross the English Channel were returned on Sunday (Dec 26) to Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
<p>The Nov 24 disaster, in which 27 migrants died, was the worst on record involving migrants trying to cross the Channel to Britain from France.</p>
<p>The plane carrying the bodies landed on early Sunday in the airport of Erbil, capital of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Ambulances then took the coffins to the home towns of those who died.</p>
<p>"The last time I heard my son's voice was when he got on board the boat. He said: 'Don't worry Mum, I will reach England shortly.' Now he's back to me in a coffin," said Shukriya Bakir, whose son was one of those who drowned.</p>
<p>Iraq is no longer at war since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017. But a lack of opportunities and basic services, as well as a political system most Iraqis say is corrupt and nepotistic, mean many people see little chance of a decent life at home.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Wellness </a> </p> <h5> Taking vitamins on an empty stomach? 8 do's and don'ts of health supplements </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Taking vitamins on an empty stomach? 8 do's and don'ts of health supplements </h1>
<div> <p>It's always best to meet your nutritional needs through your diet. But if you have certain conditions that require something extra, experts explain how to maximise these.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>Remember the health trends of the 90s, when everything you read seemed to advocate fish oil for better heart health, gingko biloba was the talisman for warding off Alzheimer’s disease, and “antioxidants” was the catchphrase du jour?</p>
<p>DON'T COMBINE FISH OIL AND VITAMIN E: FALSE</p>
<p>“There are ongoing studies and some published ones to assess the effects of combining fish oil and vitamin E to relieve menstrual pain and to improve blood sugar levels in patients with coronary artery disease,” he told CNA Lifestyle. </p>
<p>In fact, certain supplements contain a combination of both. But if you are thinking of starting on a regime of fish oil or vitamin E supplements, check with your doctor first – especially if you are on medication or have medical conditions. </p>
<p>DON'T COMBINE CALCIUM AND IRON: TRUE</p>
<p>DON’T TAKE VITAMINS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH: IT DEPENDS</p>
<p>Also, make sure you eat something first before you pop fish oil or iron supplements, especially when they are consumed in higher quantities, she said, as they can upset an empty stomach. </p>
<p>However, water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins B and C, are better absorbed when taken on an empty stomach, Wang clarified. </p>
<p>DON’T MIX ZINC WITH ANTIBIOTICS: TRUE</p>
<p>DO PAIR VITAMIN C WITH IRON: TRUE</p>
<p>This is a combo that works well together, said Wang. “Vitamin C and iron bind together to form a complex which makes it easier for the body to absorb iron.” </p>
<p>Just how much better is the absorption? When iron is consumed with 25mg to 100mg of vitamin C, the body’s absorption of iron increases by four times compared to just taking iron on its own, said Wang.</p>
<p>FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS HAVE MORE STAYING POWER: TRUE</p>
<p>This could be owing to the fact that fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver or fat tissue for later use, explained Carolyn Chan, a senior pharmacist. </p>
<p>“In comparison, water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are absorbed, but the excess is passed out from the body,” she said. </p>
<p>DON’T TAKE SUPPLEMENTS WITH TEA OR COFFEE: TRUE</p>
<p>If you have the habit of chasing down your supplements, especially calcium or iron tablets, with your morning coffee, reconsider. “Tea and coffee contain caffeine which may reduce the absorption of certain minerals,” said pharmacist Lim Cinny. </p>
<p>MISSED A DOSE? JUST TAKE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: TRUE</p>
<p>Yes, you can, advised Chan. But skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. This will prevent you from double dosing, she said.</p>
<p>Chan explained that this is unlike medicines for treating certain conditions, where missing a dose can result in patients experiencing immediate symptoms, such as an increased blood sugar level due to missing a dose of anti-diabetic medication.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why India can't commit to phasing out coal just yet </h1>
<div> <p>India has come under heavy fire from climate activists for refusing to phase out coal in the Glasgow climate conference - and unjustifiably so, according to MP Shashi Tharoor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Shashi Tharoor </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: India has somehow emerged as the villain of last month’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), blamed for resisting cuts to coal consumption even as toxic air envelops its capital, New Delhi.</p>
<p>The country’s supposed crime in Glasgow was to join China in insisting on a last-minute change to the conference’s final declaration, in which countries pledged to “phase down” rather than “phase out” coal.</p>
<p>For that, India, whose per capita carbon-dioxide emissions are a fraction of those of the world’s leading emitters, was widely criticised for obstructing the global fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The irony is that India has done far less to intensify the planet’s greenhouse effect than either China or the developed West. True, the country is a major coal consumer, and derives about 70 per cent of its energy from it.</p>
<p>But, as recently as 2015, at least a quarter of India’s population couldn’t take for granted what almost everyone in the developed world can: To flick a switch on a wall and be bathed with light.</p>
<p>The causes include fine particulate matter particles emitted from coal-fired power plants, fumes from dense traffic, industrial pollution, and the burning of crop stubble by farmers in neighboring states – all combined with winter fog.</p>
<p>But given India’s traditional role as a leading voice of the developing world, it became the face of the last-minute change of language at COP26.</p>
<p>The “phase down” wording regarding coal consumption had already appeared in a US-China bilateral climate agreement signed earlier in the conference. Nevertheless, India became the focus of global opprobrium.</p>
<p>India does not deserve to be the fall guy. For starters, the country has 17 per cent of the world’s population but generates only 7 per cent of global CO2 emissions. </p>
<p>(China, with 18.5 per cent of the world’s people, generates 27 per cent of emissions, and the US, with less than 5 per cent of the world’s population, accounts for 15 per cent.)</p>
<p>Economic development – indispensable to pulling millions of Indians out of poverty – requires energy. Coal may be polluting, but it is not feasible for any developing country to switch rapidly to cleaner alternatives that need scaling up.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite having vast financial resources and access to cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas (which India must import), Western countries have done little to help.</p>
<p>They have failed to keep climate-finance promises to poor countries (notably the $100 billion per year they committed to provide at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009), and refused to transfer advanced green technologies.</p>
<p>And COP26 singled out the coal used by developing countries, not the oil and gas used extensively in the West.</p>
<p>India’s energy requirements are expected to increase faster than those of any other country in the next two decades.</p>
<p>Since COP21 in Paris in 2015, India has announced ambitious plans to scale up its production and use of renewable energy, which currently accounts for only 18 per cent of its electricity generation.</p>
<p>And at COP26, India complemented its explicit commitment to phase down coal with a pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.</p>
<p>Furthermore, India aims to reduce its CO2 emissions by 1 billion tonnes and lower its emissions intensity (which measures emissions per unit of economic growth) by 45 per cent from 2005 levels.</p>
<p>Vast amounts of solar energy cannot be generated overnight, and battery storage remains expensive, while green hydrogen technology and facilities are still unavailable in India.</p>
<p>Wind energy is minuscule, and the country lacks significant oil and gas reserves. Nuclear power accounts for less than 2 per cent of India’s electricity, and nuclear plants constantly face opposition from residents of surrounding areas.</p>
<p>As a result, India’s performance on greenhouse-gas emissions will get worse before it gets better. According to a study by BP, India’s share of global emissions will increase to 14 per cent by 2040.</p>
<p>Coal will by then account for 48 per cent of the country’s primary energy consumption, and renewable energy only 16 per cent.</p>
<p>And because of India’s high dependence on agriculture, which engages nearly two-thirds of its population, and its vast number of cattle, the country did not sign the global deal announced at COP26 to reduce methane emissions.</p>
<p>Of course, reducing emissions is not the only way to combat climate change. India plans to bring one-third of its land area under forest cover, and to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5-3 billion tons of atmospheric CO2.</p>
<p>It has made a start, with forest cover increasing by 5.2 per cent between 2001 and 2019, though progress has been uneven, with the northeast losing forest cover while the south visibly improves.</p>
<p>Still, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that achieving global net-zero emissions by 2050 is the minimum needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>Climate Action Tracker calculates that – based on countries’ current 2030 climate targets – the world is heading for a temperature rise of 2.4 degrees by 2100. Some scientists warn that global warming could eventually exceed 4 degrees.</p>
<p>The country will therefore make a good-faith effort to help avert climate disaster – but only within the limits of what it can feasibly do.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Harnaaz Sandhu of India named 70th Miss Universe </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>EILAT, Israel: Harnaaz Sandhu of India was crowned the 70th Miss Universe on Sunday (Dec 12), topping a field of some 80 contestants in a pageant that was touched by politics and the pandemic.</p>
<p>The pageant included traditional displays of national costumes, evening gowns and swimwear, as well as a series of interview questions to test contestants' public speaking skills.</p>
<p>But it also drew attention in recent weeks for other reasons.</p>
<p>A grassroots Palestinian-led boycott had urged contestants to skip the event to protest Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>In the end, only Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim country with close ties to the Palestinians, did not send a representative, citing the global COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>The South African government, which also strongly supports the Palestinian cause, withdrew support for the country’s representative over her participation.</p>
<p>In an interview last month, Meza urged contestants to leave politics out of the pageant, saying the gathering was meant to bring together women from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>“When you are in there you forget about politics, about your religion,” she told The Associated Press at the time.</p>
<p>Sara Salansky, an official with the Israeli Tourism Ministry, said the country was selected to host the contest earlier this year because of Israel’s successful coronavirus vaccination program.</p>
<p>The contest also suffered a last-minute hiccup with the arrival of the Omicron variant, which forced Israel to close its borders to foreign tourists late last month.</p>
<p>Most of the Miss Universe contestants were already in the country before the new regulations came into effect. But those who came afterward were given special permission to enter, albeit with a mandatory 72 hour quarantine period.</p>
<p>Throughout the run-up to Sunday’s contest, all contestants were tested for the coronavirus every 48 hours and required to obey strict mask requirements.</p>
<p>Amid all the safeguards, France’s contestant, Clemence Botino, tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after arriving in Israel. After 10 days in quarantine, she was declared virus free last week and allowed to rejoin the competition.</p>
<p>Last year’s pageant was delayed due to the pandemic before Meza was crowned in May for her abbreviated tenure.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>Sunday’s contest was hosted by US TV personality Steve Harvey.</p> <p>Organizers said the pageant was expected to reach an estimated 600 million viewers via the FOX network in 172 countries.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <a> Matthew Mohan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: On the pitch at the National Stadium on Saturday (Dec 25), they fought like lions.</p>
<p>Backs against the wall, in the face of several questionable refereeing decisions, Singapore stared into the abyss of a loss.</p>
<p>Yet they battled – clearing shots off the line, defending stoutly, throwing bodies around.</p>
<p>First reduced to 10, then nine and eventually eight.</p>
<p>Then came heartbreak in extra time, courtesy of two Indonesian goals, which meant that Tatsuma Yoshida’s side were eliminated from the AFF Suzuki Cup on Saturday (Dec 25) after a 4-2 loss to Indonesia in the second leg of the semi-final.</p>
<p>Extra-time strikes from Irfan Jaya via a Shawal Anuar touch and Egy Maulana Vikri gave the away side a 5-3 aggregate victory and ensured that the search for the Lions’ first Suzuki Cup title since 2012 would go on.</p>
<p>Showing "Singapore spirit" was how Yoshida described his team's performance after the game.</p>
<p>"They showed the best performance since I came to Singapore ... I feel happy working with my boys and I am proud of all of them," he said.</p>
<p>"I was moved by their fighting spirit, their Singapore spirit and they didn't give up."</p>
<p>The Lions’ first leg match on Wednesday had ended 1-1 as an Ikhsan Fandi equaliser pegged back the Indonesians.</p>
<p>However, with Yoshida making several changes, Ikhsan started the game on the bench, with a different-looking Singapore side for the second leg.</p>
<p>In his place was Geylang International striker Amy Recha, making his first Singapore start. Faris Ramli was also dropped to the bench, with Hafiz Nor starting for the Lions.</p>
<p>It was the Indonesians who took the lead in the 11th minute, as a Hassan Sunny pass was intercepted by Witan. He brushed off two defenders and found Ezra Walian for the opener.</p>
<p>Four minutes later, they almost doubled their lead but Pratama Arhan could only curl his effort over.</p>
<p>Singapore struggled to find their foot in the game, with a series of misplaced passes handing the momentum to the ever-pressing Indonesia team on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>The Lions’ best chance came courtesy of a lung-busting run from Song Ui-young, who found Hafiz Nor, but his shot was parried wide.</p>
<p>Amy Recha then looked to have been brought down in the box when he was about to latch onto the rebound but vehement appeals from Singapore were waved away.</p>
<p>Then came a flashpoint. Defender Safuwan Baharudin, who was shown a soft yellow card earlier by referee Qasim Matar Ali Al Hatmi, was booked again and sent off after a tussle in the box before a corner kick was taken. </p>
<p>But the Lions held their nerve and drew level, with Song firing home in the first half added time to the delight of Singapore fans.</p>
<p>Indonesia piled on the pressure in the second half and had a shot rebound off the bar in the 59th minute.</p>
<p>Yoshida threw caution to the wind with a triple substitution, bringing on Ikhsan, Faris and Shawal Anuar.</p>
<p>And it was Shawal who almost made an instant impact a minute after coming on, but his dipping shot drifted just wide.</p>
<p>Singapore defender Irfan Fandi received his marching orders in the 67th minute, after he hauled down Irfan Jaya as he ran towards goal. The referee deemed him to have denied the forward a clear goalscoring opportunity.</p>
<p>But shortly after, Singapore midfielder Shahdan thought he had turned game winner as he curled a gorgeous free kick past the Indonesian keeper to put nine-man Singapore ahead.</p>
<p>But Indonesia were not done yet, and they grabbed an equaliser with four minutes to spare, courtesy of Pratama.</p>
<p>With the game on the line, Faris had the chance to seal a famous win, but his penalty was pushed away by Indonesian keeper Nadeo Winata.</p>
<p>Then came the clincher for the Indonesians with just a minute played in extra time. As Irfan Jaya tried to force the ball across the line, it inadvertently rebounded off Shawal into goal.</p>
<p>Indonesia almost extended their lead on several occasions, if not for the excellent work of Singapore keeper Hassan Sunny, who was one of the many players who were immense for the Lions.</p>
<p>Substitute Egy then doubled the Indonesians’ lead just before the end of the first half of extra time to seal the victory.</p>
<p>Hassan received his marching orders with time ticking down as the Lions went down to eight men.</p>
<p>Speaking after the match, Yoshida said: "The referee is the referee. (If) they say (it's a) foul, it's a foul. (If) they say (it's a) red card, (it's a) red card.</p>
<p>"We have to accept it, it's football."</p>
<p>And it is Yoshida's hope that the fans will believe in the team, and the players in themselves.</p>
<p>"I always tell the boys, my staff. You must believe (in) yourself. You can do it ... Singapore fans I hope, I want them to support the boys and Singapore football."</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the crowd’s appreciation for the crestfallen team at the full-time whistle said it all.</p>
<p>Singapore may have fallen to a defeat, but on a pulsating Christmas night at the National Stadium, they roared.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Hong Kong’s big dilemma - opening up to China versus resuming more links with rest of the world </h1>
<div> <p>Cancelling exemptions for business executives and more is a cost Hong Kong may be too quick to pay to resume links with China, says CUHK’s Simon Lee.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Simon Lee </a> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: To the chagrin of the business community, the Hong Kong government still maintains strict quarantine measures for most coming into the city.</p>
<p>We have seen some exemptions, like those made for JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and actress Nicole Kidman who was in town to film a series for Amazon. But these are few and are in between.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s stringent travel rules remain the reality. Quarantines for up to three weeks have been slapped on travellers. </p>
<p>Why is a reopening of borders so important to many stakeholders in Hong Kong? Hong Kong has been the world’s freest economy. Economic figures tell a story of how it’s been severely impacted even before the coronavirus hit.</p>
<p>Despite booming economic growth of 5.4 per cent in the third quarter, Hong Kong’s 2021 GDP is expected to land lower than levels seen before the coronavirus and the protests of HK$2.893 trillion (US$361.7 billion) in 2018. </p>
<p>Thankfully, trade in goods has returned to 2018 levels. This is expected as sea and air cargo can still be moved freely in and out of the international logistics centre.</p>
<p>But the closure of borders, particularly with China, has restricted the movement of people and fuelled weak figures in trade in services, which remains far below 2018 levels.</p>
<h2>BREATHING LIFE BACK INTO FINANCIAL SERVICES IS KEY</h2>
<p>There is value in thinking about granting quarantine-free entry to CEOs and leaders of important financial institutions entry into Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Financial services is a crucial sector, generating some of the highest average salaries and contributing about 23.3 per cent of GDP in 2020. Some 7.5 per cent of the workforce work in banking, insurance and other financial services.</p>
<p>Hindrance to the movement of executives would shake Hong Kong’s competitiveness. Mr Dimon himself had told reporters Hong Kong’s COVID-19 rules made it harder to retain talent in the city. </p>
<p>Yet at a time when more Asian cities are reopening and easing travel restrictions that should give Hong Kong pause for concern, the city is pursuing a more specific reopening.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is maintaining a razor-sharp focus on reopening the China-Hong Kong border.</p>
<p>It sees tightening quarantine measures as a necessary step to convince the Chinese government to lower travel restrictions to and from Hong Kong. The only exception is for visitors from China to Hong Kong who don’t require quarantine today.</p>
<p>This is despite such zero-COVID moves being seen as out of step as the majority of countries around the world are attempting to live with COVID-19 and relax restrictions all around, given higher vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Most are taking a wait-and-see approach on Omicron, after travel bans to keep the variant out have come down across the world.</p>
<h2>REOPENING CHINA-HONG KONG LINKS COULD BREATH LIFE BACK INTO TOURISM</h2>
<p>Authorities know little will change if Hong Kong’s international borders remain shut. Retail, accommodation and food services still report the highest unemployment rate in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>They see hitching their sails to China’s, the only growing economy in 2020, as a silver bullet.</p>
<p>For one, the loss of Chinese tourists is estimated to cost the city US$1.28 billion a month. Out of Hong Kong’s record-high 65 million visitors in 2018, 51 million were from China, with 19.9 million staying one night and 31.1 million day-trippers. </p>
<p>Chinese visitors also tend to spend more compared to the average visitor to Hong Kong, with shopping accounting for most expenditures.</p>
<p>Although the tourism sector contributes only 3.6 per cent to Hong Kong’s GDP, a reopening of the border could breathe life back into the hotels and retail sectors. </p>
<p>Almost a quarter of Hong Kong residents lived below the poverty line in 2020 - the highest since record keeping started 12 years ago.</p>
<h2>STRIKING A TOUGH BALANCE</h2>
<p>The reopening of the China-Hong Kong border may be critical to a quarter of a million Hong Kong residents.</p>
<p>But the stringent measures implemented to allow that reopening are severely hampening the movement of top executives in the financial sector, who come from everywhere around the world, and making the city less attractive as a global financial hub. </p>
<p>This trade-off has come into focus, after authorities pledged that most foreign diplomatic personnel and top business executives will no longer receive such special dispensation. Firms might not relocate entire operations but jobs can seep out.</p>
<p>Realising that top priority is some time away and not before Dec 19, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam highlighted - the same day the city holds its Legislative Council elections.</p>
<p>The other thing is opening up to China may not bring a flood of jobs back. Numbers might see a trickle, with daily quotas slowing recovery, with significant improvement requiring time. </p>
<p>Even if 1,000 visitors are allowed each day, the pre-pandemic 80,000 to 100,000 daily visitors from China will likely dwarf changes.</p>
<p>The impact on FB could be huge if Hong Kong authorities do require all to use LeaveHomeSafe to head into a restaurant or mandate vaccination to use such places.</p>
<p>At a time when Omicron is sweeping through the world, picking one valuable country to focus reopening with seems prudent, compared to a wholesale reopening to other countries.</p>
<p>But one thing’s clear: Whichever way Hong Kong swings, that choice will come with a price.</p>

<p>The move will help limit Singapore's exposure to imported Omicron COVID-19 cases, said the ministry.</p>
<p>The freeze does not apply to passengers who already hold a VTL flight or bus ticket and meet all other VTL requirements, meaning they can continue to travel under the quarantine-free travel scheme.</p>
<p>MOH will also temporarily reduce the VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel after Jan 20, 2022. It will continue to monitor developments closely and update this policy as the situation changes.</p>
<p>"We are picking up more Omicron cases because of the rapid spread of the variant across many countries/regions," said MOH.</p>
<p>"With aggressive contact tracing and ringfencing measures, we have, for now, been able to limit onward community transmission. But it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant spreads in our community," it added.</p>
<h2>SINGAPORE-MALAYSIA LAND VTL </h2>
<p>In light of the new measures, no new VTL bus tickets will be sold for travel into Singapore or Malaysia between 11.59pm on Dec 22 and 11.59pm on Jan 20, 2022, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a separate release.</p>
<p>All travellers who already hold a VTL bus ticket can continue to travel under the scheme, and those who are not Singapore Citizens or permanent residents can also continue to apply for their Vaccinated Travel Pass if they have not done so.</p>
