<div><div><p>President Biden plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday afternoon amid tensions surrounding Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine.</p></div></div>
<p>The conversation will mark the second Biden-Putin call in a month. In a Dec. 7 videoconference, Biden warned Putin not to mount a new invasion and laid out the economic and security costs that Russia would face if the Kremlin went down that path.</p>
<div><div><p>The planned call comes during a week when Biden has been away from Washington, splitting his time between Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington, Del., and staying largely out of public view.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I think both leaders believe that there is genuine value in direct leader-to-leader engagement, that we are in a moment of crisis and have been for some weeks now given the Russian buildup,” the official said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden threatens Putin with economic sanctions if he further invades Ukraine</p></div>

<div><div><p>The Biden administration has said that talks must proceed on the basis of reciprocity and that the president plans to bring up concerns that Washington has about Russia’s activities in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since October, Putin has massed tens of thousands of Russian troops, as well as materiel, near the border with Ukraine, and the Biden administration has said the Russian military is making plans for a new invasion.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>THE CAPITOL RIOT</div><div><div>HAND CURATED</div></div></div></div>
<header><div/><div><div><a>Local</a></div></div><div><h1>How Ashli Babbitt went from Capitol rioter to Trump-embraced ‘martyr’</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paul Schwartzman</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div></span></div></span></div><div>July 30, 2021 at 7:25 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><p>Her phone rang on that day in early July, nearly six months after a police officer’s bullet killed her daughter as she and a mob of rioters seeking to overturn the election stormed a barricaded door deep inside the U.S. Capitol.</p></div>
<p>Micki Witthoeft answered the call and listened as former president Donald Trump expressed condolences over Ashli Babbitt’s violent death and acknowledged, she said, that her daughter had died Jan. 6 trying to salvage his lost presidency.</p>
<div><div><p>Witthoeft took the opportunity during the 30-minute call to ask Trump for help getting information about Babbitt’s death and to fight for those still imprisoned because of the riot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After their call, the circumstances of Babbitt’s death — once a focus of right-wing extremists and white supremacists — became a talking point for the nation’s most dominant Republican.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Who shot Ashli Babbitt?” Trump asked over and over in the ensuing days, suggesting that the 35-year-old Air Force veteran was the victim of an overzealous Capitol Police officer whose identity was being covered up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the Capitol siege: How barricaded lawmakers and aides sounded urgent pleas for help as police lost control</p></div>
<div><div><p>Yet, instead of marauders invading the Capitol, Trump and his acolytes describe a largely peaceful crowd of protesters unfairly maligned and persecuted by prosecutors, Democrats and mainstream journalists.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At the center of their revisionism is Babbitt, their martyr, whose fatal attempt to leap through a door that led to the House chamber — captured in graphic detail on video — they describe as a heroic act of patriotism.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Just before she was shot, Babbitt was among a group of rioters bashing in the glass-paneled doors that led to the Speaker’s Lobby, down the hall from the House chamber, where lawmakers were being evacuated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a gun! There’s a gun!” someone shouted when an officer, on the other side of the doors, aimed his weapon in the direction of the mob.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the warning, someone appeared to hoist Babbitt up so she could step through an opening in the door created after its glass panels were shattered. A bullet struck her and she fell back on the floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors determined it was reasonable for the officer to believe he was firing in self-defense or to protect members evacuating the House chamber.</p></div></div>
<a>four police officers </a>catalogued the emotional and physical abuse they suffered defending the Capitol and how betrayed they feel by Republican lawmakers.
<div><p>Trump has complained to aides that his supporters were treated far worse than Black Lives Matter protesters charged last summer, and that the Justice Department and others want to use prosecutions of Jan. 6 crimes to damage him.</p></div>
<p>The former president, according to three advisers, often talks about the “good people” who traveled to Washington that day, and the crowd’s large size, despite encouragement from some confidants to avoid the subject altogether.</p>
<div><div><p>In a statement, Trump confirmed talking to Babbitt’s family and said: “I want to know why is the person who shot Ashli Babbitt getting away with murder?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Vigils, rallies, rap lyrics</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Fox News host Tucker Carlson</a>.
<div><div><p>When Trump invoked Babbitt’s name, right-wing organizers said it became easier to generate public interest for those arrested in the Jan. 6 riot.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It didn’t make me feel more emboldened, but it made other people feel emboldened, which helps me,” said Cara Castronuova of Citizens Against Political Persecution, a New York-based group that has hosted rallies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He gives people a voice,” Castronuova said. “They feel if Trump said it, he’s the leader of the United States, so it’s okay to say it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you believe that,” he said, “you’ll probably respond to a fundraising appeal that comes with it and you’re more likely to show up at a Trump rally. It’s about intensity and money.”</p></div></div>
<p>Stevens, who grew up in Mississippi, compared the Republican campaign to the Lost Cause of the post-Civil War era, in which Southern sympathizers sought to recast defenders of slavery such as Gen. Robert E. Lee as a “benevolent guy.”</p>
<div><p>‘The storm is here’: Ashli Babbitt’s journey from capital ‘guardian’ to invader</p></div>
<p>Until her death, Babbitt had lived the anonymous life of an ordinary American, serving in the military for 14 years. Her tenure included a stint protecting the Washington region with an Air National Guard unit known as the Capital Guardians.</p>
<div><div><p>In recent weeks, Witthoeft said she noticed Babbitt’s name mentioned more frequently on Fox News, Newsmax and OAN, an uptick she attributes to Trump and House Republicans such as Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think everyone should know her name,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Protecting America’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Say her name!” a speaker shouted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Ashli Babbitt! Ashli Babbitt!” the crowd chanted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“American hero!” a woman yelled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She was protecting America from the enemies of the people,” Anglin wrote. “There was absolutely no reason to shoot her, and the cop should be charged with murder.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Three months later, federal prosecutors cleared the Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt of any wrongdoing, saying he had not violated her civil rights.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. Capitol Police officer cleared of wrongdoing in fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt during Capitol attack</p></div>
<div><div><p>The officer, a lieutenant, was not identified, an omission seized on by House Republicans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gosar’s statements about Babbitt’s death, as well as those arrested, have been echoed by Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Louis Gohmert (R-Tex.), and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If this country can demand justice for someone like George Floyd,” Greene told a Newsmax host, “then we can certainly demand justice for Ashli Babbitt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, she, Gaetz, Gosar and Gohmert showed up at the D.C. jail, demanding to inspect the treatment of those detained in connection with Jan. 6. They were turned away.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. jail officials turn away GOP members of Congress who showed up to check on Jan. 6 suspects</p></div>
<div><div><p>Michael Edison Hayden, a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the narrative suggested by such assertions allows Trump and his allies to “flip what happened and present the attackers as victims.”</p></div></div>
<p>“The only word that comes to mind is the amplification of a fringe narrative,” he said. “It’s not as though the narrative has changed. It’s spread and taken hold in larger portions of Trump’s base.”</p>
<div><div><p>But he said he has had an easier time more recently — a Phoenix rally in mid-July drew 250 people — “because the issue is being taken seriously.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Until those son-of-a-b----es took her out of it, she was in her moment,” Witthoeft said. “They tried to silence Ashli’s voice but all they did was make it louder because America was watching.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Stand tall, stand proud, stand together,” she told the crowd.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the call ended, Castronuova promised the audience that “insurrectionist is no longer going to come up” when they “Google Ashli Babbitt’s name in five years.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They will not rewrite history,” Castronuova shouted. “She’s a martyr, okay?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘A bigger cause’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not long after, her family boarded a boat and scattered her ashes in the waters off Dog Beach. A bagpiper played “Amazing Grace.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witthoeft, during the hour-long telephone interview, said she has avoided watching footage of Jan. 6, including “the video of my daughter being murdered.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just won’t do it,” she said, beginning to cry. “They carried my daughter out like a dying animal.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since her daughter’s death, she has become politically active. On Saturday, she attended a Trump rally in Phoenix, where she received a standing ovation when Gosar introduced her.</p></div></div>
<p>Asked about Trump, whose call to her occurred six months after her daughter’s death, Witthoeft laughed nervously and said, “It’s a tricky question. This is such a roller coaster. I feel different things depending on the day.</p>
<p>“Like every other rally, people would’ve cheered them on, and there might have been some little bit of stuff going on,” he said. “Everyone was just pumped up, and the word selection wasn’t the greatest.”</p>
<div><div><p>These days, Michelle Wittheoft said, she writes letters to Jan. 6 arrestees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I plan on writing them all — not because I’m Ashli’s mom — I love and support what they did,” she said. “They’re in jail because they are Trump supporters.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Referring to her daughter, she said, “She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,” she said. “It’s weird to have your child belong to the world.”</p></div></div>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>

<div><div><p>December felt more like an extension of autumn rather than the start of winter, and, indeed, Washington’s average temperature during the month was only 0.3 degrees colder than November.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mild December fit into a recent tendency for this month to be warm. Five of the 10 warmest Decembers on record have occurred since 2000.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington’s most significant weather events of 2021</p></div>
<div><div><p>The toasty December helped 2021 close as the fifth-warmest year on record in Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The month featured several warm periods with only a few small tastes of winter. And even the few chillier-than-normal days still reached at least 40 degrees. Meanwhile, 10 of the 31 days reached at least 60 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Numerous high-temperature records were set during the month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>On Dec. 11:</b></p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Washington set a record high of 70, topping 68 from 1897.</li><li>Dulles set a record warm low of 46, topping 44 from 1965.</li><li>Baltimore set a record high of 70, topping 69 from 1979.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>On Dec. 17:</b></p></div></div>
<li>Washington set a record high of 65, topping 64 from 1939 and 1984.</li>
<li>Washington set a record warm low of 54, topping 48 from 1984 and 2012.</li>
<li>Dulles set a record warm low of 53, topping 49 from 1984.</li>
<li>Baltimore set a record warm low of 52, topping 47 from 1984 and 2012.</li>
<div><div><p><b>On Dec. 19:</b></p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Washington set a record warm low of 50, topping 49 from 1984.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>The prevailing December weather pattern featured a big chunk of cold air trapped in Western Canada as a warm zone of high pressure frequently resided over much of the Lower 48.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was unusually warm not only in Washington but also in much of the eastern two-thirds of the Lower 48. But that cold air that was locked over Canada is finally getting unleashed as we kick off January.</p></div></div>
<div><p>January should bring colder weather and snow chances to D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Year-in-review</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>2021, overall, was a warm year. It was the fifth-warmest year on record in Washington, with only 2020, 2019, 2017 and 2012, the warmest year, milder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here is how 2021′s temperature compares with the warmest and coldest years on record and recent 10-year and 30-year averages:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From the standpoint of precipitation, the dry December wasn’t enough to keep 2021 from being wetter than the most recent 30-year average, but it was considerably drier than last year:</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Three-year-old Lina Sardar Khil was romping around the playground of a San Antonio apartment complex last week when her mother stepped away to get water.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the woman returned, her daughter was gone.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Ronnie Bechtel heard his son’s voice for the last time around 9 p.m. on April 3, 2000. Jeremy called to ask his father for a ride the next day, but when Ronnie arrived, Jeremy was nowhere to be found.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>neighbors in Sparta, a small town in central Tennessee, whispered rumors and steered investigators in wrong directions.
<div><div><p>“They were murdered,” some said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No, they ran away to Florida.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I heard they were involved in a drug operation gone awry.”</p></div></div>
<a>YouTuber</a> who solves cold cases, called White County Sheriff Steve Page to report that, after diving in a local river, he had found Erin’s car with human remains inside.
<b> </b>families are grappling with grief and closure — how do they reframe the narratives that ran through their minds for so many years? Jeremy and Erin were not brutally murdered.
<b> </b>They did not run away. It was probably a freak accident.
<div><div><p>“I thought, ‘I wonder if I can figure out a way to … make a living doing it,’ ” Sides, 42, told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Cars don’t just disappear,” Sides said. “Nine times out of 10 they’re in the water.”</p></div></div>
<a>video about Erin and Jeremy</a>. Sides said he was unsuccessful but noted he’d come back to Sparta in a few weeks to try again.
<div><div><p>“I don’t have an easy way to say it,” Sides told Page in his<a> YouTube video </a>after the dive, “but I found them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The medical examiner’s office has not yet confirmed the remains belong to Erin and Jeremy, but Page is confident the findings will prove they were in the car.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the party into the station for questioning, Ronnie, 57, said.
<div><div><p>“People could be cruel sometimes,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both families became accustomed to growing hopeful about<b> </b>leads, only to be disappointed. Ronnie said he believed the stress and worry took a toll on Jeremy’s mother. She died four years ago of cancer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So when Sides entered the picture, they couldn’t believe the nightmare they lived for 21 years was finally coming to an end.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sides left town before the families could thank him in person. Cecil and Ronnie said they hope to speak to him soon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was very humbled that I could just help out,” Sides said. “I would like to think the police did what they could. But this one just slipped through the cracks.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a thank you<b> </b>to the sheriff, Cecil and Leigh Ann gave Erin’s license plate to Page.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They believed in me that I would never give up, and I didn’t, and it worked,” Page said. “It meant so much to them and so much to me. These are my people.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The families plan to have separate funerals but a joint memorial service to celebrate Jeremy and Erin’s short lives. <a>GoFundMe </a><a>pages</a> has been set up to help with costs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ronnie is thankful for a “sense of closure.”</p></div></div>
<p>“I can bury my son,” he said. “I’ve prayed that if he’s not on this Earth, that he’s with Jesus and with mama, and there’s no doubt they’ve all seen him by now and know what’s happened.”</p>

<div><div><p>The last time anyone reported seeing 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery was Oct. 1, 2019 — more than two years before police say they learned she had disappeared from a home in southern New Hampshire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to Harmony’s recovery, and police are accepting tips at 603-203-6060. Local business executives are offering an additional $10,000 reward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Police over the weekend visited a home on the city’s west side, where Aldenberg said Harmony was once seen. The current homeowner is unrelated to the case, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sorey often seemed worried about her daughter and frequently said she could not reach her, Miller said. He said he and his husband recently made their own effort to reach Harmony’s father through social media but did not hear back.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Miller said his family had not given up on reuniting Jamison and his sister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We even still get Christmas gifts for her and stuff,” Miller said. “We’re holding on to the ones that we have right now because it’s that important for us to have that relationship.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A 3-year-old disappeared from a playground a week ago. She’s still missing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester police have discussed the case with the FBI, which is not investigating, Aldenberg said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the division for children and families, declined to answer questions about the case.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harmony is described as White, about 4 feet tall and 50 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and glasses. She is blind in her right eye.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although more than two years has passed since Harmony disappeared, Aldenberg said, his department is operating under the assumption that she is alive.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’m in rescue mode right now. This is not a recovery,” he said Monday. “All efforts are focused on that Harmony is alive, and we are going to do everything that we can to find her in that condition.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>After his marketing business collapsed and a home repair wiped out his savings, David Nolan was in crisis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he asked his local congregation’s leader for help paying his mortgage. That bishop, Nolan says, authorized him to receive $40 for food.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So he channeled his anger into a musical.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The show is slated to debut in March with five performances in Ogden, Utah, about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City. Tickets start at $19, plus a processing fee.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the LDS Church, declined to comment on the musical or confirm Nolan’s interaction with his bishop.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mormon Church has misled members on $100 billion tax-exempt investment fund, whistleblower alleges</p></div>
<div><div><p>Nolan also expressed exasperation that the church tracks members’ tithing to hold them financially accountable.</p></div></div>
<a>he told the Salt Lake Tribune</a>, which first reported on his musical. “And yet, they don’t give a shred of transparency.”
<a>“They’re So Needy,”</a> Nolan writes, “I can see you’re in need / Hanging by a thread / Well, here’s a T-shirt and a loaf of bread.”
<div><p>These Mormon twins worked together on an IRS whistleblower complaint over the church’s billions — and it tore them apart</p></div>
<div><div><p>Nolan said he hopes his show will spark more conversations about how the LDS Church handles its money. He offered a free ticket to any employee of Ensign Peak Advisors, a company that manages the church’s investments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although Nolan is slightly nervous about how church leaders will react to his show, he said he is buoyed by his confidence that some other members of the faith must share his qualms with the organization’s finances.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Come what may, he has no plans to leave the church. Many LDS leaders believe that they must be acting rightly if the secular world opposes them, Nolan said. But he hopes disapproval from church members will spark a different reaction.</p></div>

<li>Omicron is the dominant variant in the United States, making up about 59 percent of infections for the week ending Dec. 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.</li>
<li>The coronavirus is again spreading on cruise ships, with 86 vessels in U.S. waters reporting infections onboard through Tuesday, according to CDC data. Unlike during earlier outbreaks, there is no indication of a pending industry shutdown.</li>
<li>Officials are working to accelerate testing at schools in New York City so that those who test negative or are asymptomatic can continue with in-person classes. The new policy, “Stay Safe, and Stay Open,” will take effect Jan 3.</li>

<div><div><p>The emergency phase of the pandemic could end next year if 70 percent of people worldwide get vaccinated against the coronavirus, World Health Organization officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The acute phase of the pandemic, the pandemic that’s been associated with the tragedy of death and hospitalizations, that can end in 2022,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, told reporters.</p></div></div>

<h2>Omicron will probably lead to comparatively fewer hospitalizations than delta, officials say</h2>Return to menu
<div><div><div>By Marisa Iati1:03 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<p>Preliminary data suggests that the omicron variant of the coronavirus may be less severe than the previously dominant delta variant, Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration’s chief medical adviser, said at a Wednesday news conference.</p>
<div><div><p>It is unclear how much of omicron’s lessened severity is caused by intrinsically lower virulence versus existing immunity from vaccination or previous infections, Fauci said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The officials’ remarks reinforce other comments from health experts suggesting that healthy, vaccinated people — especially those who have gotten booster doses — appear unlikely to be hospitalized by omicron.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The final conclusion about the level of severity in children remains to be determined,” Fauci said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci said that it is not yet clear whether a second vaccine booster dose for adults will be necessary and that officials hope protection from the currently recommended booster will prove durable.</p></div></div>

<p>An investigation of one of the earliest clusters of the omicron variant in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests it could have a shorter incubation period than previous versions of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<div><div><p>But a shorter incubation period might help authorities detect symptomatic infection faster, thereby reducing the number of people coming into close contact with the infected, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the same day, the CDC lowered an earlier estimate of the prevalence of the omicron variant nationwide, suggesting that delta is responsible for many more recent infections than previously<b> </b>expected.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>BOULDER COUNTY, Colo. — Outside the smoldering rubble of an apartment building, Alex Hager distributed coffee and breakfast sandwiches Friday from the back of his pickup truck.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As he flagged down passing cars in the town of Louisville, Hager said he wanted to offer hope during a difficult time for this region northwest of Denver.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And on Thursday, runaway grass fires bore down on the area amid 100-mph-plus winds and eviscerated the homes of at least 500 families just before the dawn of 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Anything to help,” said Hager, of Boulder City. “This community has been through a lot this year.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>How extreme climate conditions fueled unprecedented Colorado fire</p></div>
<p>More than 16,000 customers were without power as of mid-Friday, according to utility company Xcel Energy. Police set up checkpoints to keep people at least 1½ miles from Superior’s destroyed areas, and military Humvees blocked roads.</p>
<a>Photos showed houses ablaze</a> and clouds of smoke climbing high into the air as the fire mushroomed to about 6,000 acres. As it began to snow Friday, officials said that they did not expect fire growth.
<div><p>What you need to know about how wildfires spread</p></div>
<a>wildfires </a>in the West, fueled by drought, heat and dry vegetation. The colder months have been unusually dry — a condition that, combined with strong winds, appears to have made this week’s infernos mushroom quickly.
<div><div><p>Wildfires pose an increasing threat to Colorado, with four of the state’s largest fires occurring since 2018, according to state records. Colorado’s top 20 largest recorded wildfires have happened since 2001.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Temporary shelters were stood up to house people in Boulder County, and officials said they planned to publish a list of burned addresses after they assess the damage.</p></div></div>
<p>“This was a disaster in fast motion all over the course of half a day,” Polis said. “Many of the families [had] minutes to get whatever they could — their kids, their pets — to get into the car and leave.”</p>
<div><div><p>Ten miles north, at the Boulder County Fairgrounds in Longmont, stables housed about 245 horses, six llamas and some chickens. Some owners who lost everything were trying to figure out where to take their horses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a tawny Mustang reared up to kick the edge of a metal stall, Michelle Sander, 48, recounted whisking 19 horses from her ranch on Thursday as the Middle Fork Fire came within a mile of her home.</p></div></div>
<a>asking for donations</a> of hay and other animal supplies.
<div><div><p>Despite that uncertainty, Dupre said he’s more worried about how sinking temperatures will affect his house amid the gas shut-off and about the hundreds of people whose homes burned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s already a housing shortage here,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the hills behind Boulder Valley Christian Church in Boulder County, dozens of homes continued to smolder. Cattle roamed scorched fields where families gathered to spot remnants of their homes through the smoke.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As resident Eric Lundeen set up a drone to try to catch a glimpse of the wreckage, snowflakes began to fall. He held out his hand to catch some of the white specks on his gloves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t tell if this is ash or snow coming down,” he said. “I think it’s both.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Reality kicks in when we have to find a place to stay now,” said Alex Stickelberger, who was staying with relatives after fleeing with his family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fire grew to more than 6,000 acres before the snow helped extinguish remaining flames.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The snow is an awesome thing for fire behavior, and it’s a hard thing for crime scenes and recovery efforts and damage assessments and all those things,” Pelle said. “So it’s a mixed blessing.”</p></div>
