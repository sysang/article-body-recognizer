<h3><a>EPISODE 41: THE GIANCARLO STANTON SITUATION FEAT. ROY WHITE</a></h3>
<a>lost two of three games to open the season</a> against the Blue Jays in The Bronx. The bats didn’t do much, but they did get 
<a>six dominant innings out of the bullpen</a> Sunday from Michael King. Shockingly enough though, Giancarlo Stanton 
<a>was booed by some Yankees fans</a>…on Opening Day. He then was not in the lineup on Sunday. Should fans boo a player this early, and should Stanton be getting a day out of the lineup so soon?

<p>Round numbers and recognition used to get you into Cooperstown. Then came baseball’s analytical revolution.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis also boosted the candidacies of Edgar Martinez (a 147 OPS+) and Mike Mussina (a 123 ERA+) into the end zone.</p>
<p>On this 2022 writers’ ballot, here’s a look at beneficiaries and victims of the voting body’s evolution:</p>
<li>Scott Rolen. A master glovesman like Jones, the third baseman put up a 122 OPS+ as he excelled at the hot corner for nearly all of his career. He began with 10.2 percent in 2018 and is on track to gather over 60 percent of the votes this time.</li>

<h1> Rangers’ concerning offensive flaws are being exposed</h1>
<div> January 11, 2022 7:55pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 7:56pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>SAN JOSE, Calif. — Regarding the Rangers, who will get back at it with a practice Wednesday before facing the Sharks on Thursday night:</p>
<h1> Rangers’ resilience to in-season adversity helping them stay afloat</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 12:10am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 12:10am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Each NHL team has faced its fair share of obstacles this season, between COVID-19 protocols, injuries and the readjustment to an 82-game schedule with extensive travel, but the Rangers have yet to balk at a single challenge. </p>
<p>“But they played hard. They played a good, consistent hockey game. They played for 60 minutes, and that’s why I was really proud of a group tonight. We competed, we played well and everybody chipped in.” </p>
<p>The resilient Rangers entered Sunday tied for the second-most wins in one-goal games in the league, having won 12 games by a single tally. </p>
<p>Forwards Barclay Goodrow and Alexis Lafreniere are eligible to clear COVID-19 protocol and slot back into the lineup in time for Wednesday’s matchup with the Maple Leafs at Madison Square Garden. </p>
<p>Jonny Brodzinski and Tim Gettinger were reassigned to the taxi squad, while Anthony Greco was sent back to AHL Hartford. </p>
<h1> Morgan Barron: Rangers have a ‘different vibe’ this season</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:43pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:43pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>But it’s not just Barron who is different, the Rangers are, too.</p>
<p>“But for now, it just feels like the teams kind of hit a good stride and is winning some hockey games,” he said. “So for me to just get thrown in, I kind of follow the lead of the other guys and try to do my thing.”</p>
<p>Ryan Strome had a maintenance day and didn’t participate in practice on Monday.</p>
<sup>th</sup> overall pick in the 2020 NHL Draft, dished three assists in the Windsor Spitfires’ 6-3 win over the Flint Firebirds, who received two goals and an assist from 2021 first-round pick Brennan Othmann.
<h1> Gerard Gallant’s lineup decisions loom as Rangers near full strength</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:48pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:48pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gallant said both Lafreniere and Goodrow have been skating on their own, though they were still not cleared to join the team for practice on Monday.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dryden Hunt could be activated off injured reserve to play in his first game since the Rangers’ 5-1 loss to the Golden Knights earlier this month. He has missed the last four contests with an undisclosed upper-body injury.</p>
<p>“But good for him so far, he’s played well. I think he’s got a four-game point streak and the goal in last game, big goal for us, too. But we’ll see.”</p>
<a>Goodrow in the top six</a> and could wish to see more of Lafreniere on the second line. If Chytil sticks, however, Goodrow could center the third line next to Lafreniere.

<h1> Pavel Buchnevich was never going to be a part of the Rangers’ long-term future</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 8:20am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 10:55am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Questions have been raised about my omission of the name, “Pavel Buchnevich,” and of the offseason trade that sent No. 89 to the Blues in last week’s column about the Rangers’ need to add a top-six right wing.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3> <a> Rangers' season about to be put to test</a> </h3> January 18, 2022 | 7:41pm <p> Of the next 12 Metropolitan Division-leading Rangers games, eight are against playoff teams.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> <a> Rangers' Kevin Rooney on his doubters, killing penalties and Boston sports</a> </h3> January 18, 2022 | 6:02pm <p> Rangers winger, and former Devil, Kevin Rooney takes a shot at some QA with Post columnist Steve Serby.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3> <a> The Pavel Buchnevich fallacy</a> </h3> January 18, 2022 | 8:20am <p> Pavel Buchnevich was not a realistic candidate for the Rangers roster…for this year or beyond.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> <a> Gerard Gallant's lineup decisions loom as Rangers near full strength</a> </h3> January 17, 2022 | 7:48pm <p> The Rangers' ever-shifting lineup has given Gerard Gallant plenty to think about as his roster returns to full health.</p> </div>
<h3> <a> Rangers have a 'different vibe' this season</a> </h3> January 17, 2022 | 7:43pm
<p> Morgan Barron agreed with head coach Gerard Gallant’s assessment that he’s playing with more confidence. But it’s not just Barron who is different, the Rangers are, too.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3> <a> Rangers finding answers to in-season adversity </a> </h3> January 17, 2022 | 12:10am <p> The Rangers' season has been marked by an ability to bounce back from losses and adversity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3> <a> Rangers fueled by winger's career year</a> </h3> January 16, 2022 | 8:30pm <p> This just might be the year for Chris Kreider.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3> Rangers forward finding groove after move to second line </h3> January 16, 2022 | 3:39am
<p> After dishing out an assist in each of the previous three contests, Filip Chytil registered the game-tying tally of the Rangers’ win over the Flyers on Saturday.</p>
<h3> <a> Rangers end longest road trip of season in style</a> </h3> January 15, 2022 | 9:45pm
<p> The Rangers scored two third-period goals to pull out a win over the Flyers in an otherwise monotonous matchup Saturday night in front of a stiff, lifeless crowd in Philly.</p>
<h3> <a> Rangers' 2020 first-round pick plays like veteran in NHL debut</a> </h3>
<p> Braden Schneider knows that an impressive NHL debut doesn’t necessarily mean he has made it as an NHL player.</p>

<div> <div> <h2> Today's Horoscope</h2> December 22 - January 19 </div> </div>
<div> <p>If you need to make a bit of a fuss then do so and don’t feel guilty about it. Certain individuals have not lived up to their side of a bargain and you cannot allow them to get away with it. Tell them to shape up or ship out.</p> </div>
<h3> Yesterday's Horoscope</h3>
<div> <p>It would be nice if everyone were as logically-minded as you but, of course, they are not and you need to keep that fact in mind today. For your own safety it might be smart to put some distance between yourself and the masses.</p> </div>

<div> <div> <h3> Aquarius </h3> January 20 - February 18 </div> </div>
<p>Some people will try to convince you that the end is nigh but you have never been the sort to fall for that kind of apocalyptic nonsense. Despite what all the doom-mongers say the world is still a wonderful place – enjoy it to the full.</p>
<div> <div> <h3> Pisces </h3> February 19 - March 20 </div> </div>
<div> <p>You may not be able to prove that someone is lying to you but your sixth sense rarely lets you down in situations like this, so find out what their game is and then put a stop to it. Demand the truth from everyone on all occasions.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Aries </h3> March 21 - April 19 </div> </div>
<div> <p>Few things in life come for free and those that do often turn out to have a string or two attached, so if someone offers you something for nothing today be on your guard. Sometimes, like now, it’s okay to be a bit distrustful.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Taurus </h3> April 20 - May 20 </div> </div>
<div> <p>Now that changes planet Uranus is moving in your favor again you should be able to make up your mind which direction to take both in your personal life and at work. That decisive Taurus we all know and love is about to make a comeback!</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Gemini </h3> May 21 - June 20 </div> </div>
<p>You have been too fearful by far in recent weeks but the good news is you will find your confidence again over the next few days – or, at the very least, know for sure when it’s right to fight and when it’s right to run away.</p>
<div> <div> <h3> Cancer </h3> June 21 - July 22 </div> </div>
<p>You can be a bit too soft and sentimental at times but now the cosmic picture is beginning to change your head will overrule your heart and you won’t let others get away with things that could harm you personally. Time to toughen up.</p>
<div> <div> <h3> Leo </h3> July 23 - August 22 </div> </div>
<p>Your opinions about certain issues are incredibly strong but you need to recognize that a friend or loved one has an equally fixed view of the world, and it may not be fixed in the same direction. For best results, steer clear of each other today!</p>
<div> <div> <h3> Virgo </h3> August 23 - September 22 </div> </div>
<div> <p>Speak up and let friends and family members know what you are thinking. This is not the time to keep quiet about issues that are of importance to you, and you may be surprised to discover others are very much on your side.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Libra </h3> September 23 - October 22 </div> </div>
<div> <p>The more someone questions your authority today the more determined you must be to show them you are entitled to call the shots. If you want to be top dog, and remain top dog, you cannot afford to let challenges go unanswered.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Scorpio </h3> October 23 - November 21 </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h3> Sagittarius </h3> November 22 - December 21 </div> </div>
