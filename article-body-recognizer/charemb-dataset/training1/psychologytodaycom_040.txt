<a>emotional eating</a>. When you experience negative feelings about your body, it may be the result of past hurtful experiences from
<a>childhood</a>, which can lead to a disconnect between you and your body. This can lead to your self-evaluation being tied to your body size or shape and a desire to whip your body into shape. Here is the story of a patient with body image issues:

<p>Here are some questions to help you begin to think about your relationship with your body:</p>
<li>Describe how your weight and food issues led you to play certain roles in your life, to choose certain careers, or even to marry or have relationships with certain people.</li>
<li>If you were to listen to your body’s wisdom, how would you address your negative body thoughts differently? (Example: I would interrupt these negative thoughts and speak more kindly to my body.)</li>

<h1> 5 Things Not to Say to Someone Over the Holidays—Or Ever </h1>
<h2> Ditch the chitchat about eating and weight and talk about what's meaningful. </h2>
<li>Making commentary on people's eating and weight is not helpful. </li>
<li>You can't determine someone's health based on their shape or size. </li>
<li>Weight-related commentary perpetuates diet culture and takes away from having more meaningful interactions with others. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Klara Kulikova/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>1. "Have you lost weight?"</h3>
<p>Things to say instead: Try to be curious about how they are doing and what is happening for them—not to “get the dirt,” but to show that you’re there for support if they need it.</p>
<ul><li>How are you doing? It has been a long time since I’ve seen you, how have things been in your life?</li> <li>How are/have you been feeling?</li> </ul>
<h3>2. "Have you gained weight?"</h3>
<a>fear</a> of fatness or weight gain that you’re trying to protect yourself from. Either way, shaming someone else doesn’t have to be part of the interaction.
<p>Things to say instead: Try for commentary that validates the person for who they are, and not what they look like.</p>
<ul><li>You’re so funny, I love your sense of humour and have missed spending time with you.</li> <li>You’re always so compassionate. It feels really easy to be myself around you.</li> </ul>
<h3>3. "I’ve been trying out X diet. Let me tell you all about it."</h3>
<p>Things to say instead: Try asking about what habits people have found to be helpful in maintaining their physical and mental health over the year, particularly during COVID times.</p>
<ul><li>What have people found to be helpful to their physical/mental health (during COVID)?</li> <li>I’ve been feeling kind of stuck lately. What helps you to maintain your sense of well-being?</li> </ul>
<h3>4. "You really should do more of X (e.g., going to the gym, eating less carbs); it will make you feel better."</h3>
<li>I’ve found it really helpful to focus on X this past year. It gives me something to look forward to in my day and helps to keep me on track.</li>
<li>I find it pretty difficult to maintain Y habit. Does anyone have any suggestions based on what has worked for them?</li>
<h3>5. "Why are you eating that?"</h3>
<p>Things to say instead: Try commenting on your own experience rather than putting it on others.</p>
<ul><li>This dish is so tasty! What’s the recipe?</li> <li>I’m having such a great evening. It’s so nice to be here sharing a meal with everyone. </li> </ul>

<h1> Have You Forgotten How to Eat Intuitively? </h1>
<h2> Signs that diet culture is controlling your eating, and tips for breaking free. </h2>
<li>We're all born eating intuitively, but the outside world disconnects us from our body's cues for hunger, fullness, and satisfaction.</li>
<li>Recognizing and managing signs of disordered eating can help us reconnect to our inner signals around food.</li>
<li>If you count, track, or measure everything you eat, try focusing more on whether you feel full and satisfied than the number on the package.</li>
<li>Neutralize "trigger foods" by exposing yourself to them more, not by trying to restrict them.</li>
<a>disordered eating</a>, or patterns of eating that are less entrenched or less severe than an ED but still cause a lot of
<p>Here are some common signs that your relationship with food may be disordered, and suggestions to help you get back to the <a>intuition</a> you were born with:</p>
<h3>You count, track, or measure everything.</h3>
<p>Many of my clients are obsessed with portion control. They worry that if they don’t measure what they’re eating, they’ll go overboard. Ironically, that <a>fear</a> can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>When you fixate on counting out the exact portion size you think you’re supposed to have, you create pressure to feel like it’s “enough” when you’ve finished even if you wish you had more.</p>
<p>This can set you up for a pattern called the restrict-binge cycle, where you eat super carefully for a period of time until eventually you “cave” and go to town on the foods you usually try to control.</p>
<p>Intuitive Eating Tip: Serving sizes are not mandates. Sometimes you might be hungry for less than the amount listed, and sometimes you might want more.</p>
<h3>You try to “outsmart” cravings.</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Food is supposed to bring us pleasure!</div> <div>Source: Body Liberation Stock/ Body Liberation Photos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>You don’t trust yourself around certain foods.</h3>
<a>anxious</a> when that food unexpectedly shows up, like when a coworker brings a box of donuts to the morning meeting or they arrive at a friend’s home to find a plate of cookies on the table.
<p>Reconnecting to your intuition around food can take time. After all, it’s possible you haven’t been in touch with this part of yourself in many years.</p>

<p>Charlotte: Alli, how are you feeling as 2021 comes to a close and 2022 ("New year, new you!”) is around the corner? Diet season is nearly upon us.</p>
<p>Alli: I’m fine with 2021 flipping to 2022. I use birthdays and New Year’s as cues to reflect, assess, and plan. Other than that, I don’t have a lot of <a>attachment</a> to the numbers. </p>
<p>Regarding diet season, it’s probably going to be especially intense after nearly two years of various lockdowns. I suspect the marketing for diets, lifestyles, and wellness programs is going to come at us strongly and boldly.</p>
<p>What about you, Charlotte?</p>
<p>Alli: I always liked your tag of “Smart People Don’t Diet." </p>
<a>happiness</a>, health, social acceptance, success.
<a>nutrition</a> due to food restriction, or even developing a clinical
<a>eating disorder</a>. I think it’s mind-blowing, sad, and ugly how industries seem to prey on people’s hopes and vulnerabilities.
<p>To some readers, my attitude may sound unreal. I get that. It was not automatic or instant and has evolved—with work—over the years. </p>
<p>Charlotte, first, how do you deal with the days where you just feel uncomfortable in your own body. And second, what do you wish for anyone reading this conversation between two professionals to take from it? </p>

<h1> Did the Holidays Trigger Emotional Eating? </h1>
<h2> To cope with guilt, anxiety, and stress, start counting memories, not calories. </h2>
<li>Money, lack of sleep, socializing, alcohol, and conversations centering around food and appearance are common emotional eating triggers. </li>
<li>Emotional eating happens when a person uses food to cope with extra stress, anxiety, or negative emotions.</li>
<li>While guilt, anxiety, and dieting are not the answer, actively planning ahead is one way to greatly reduce emotional eating and binge eating.</li>

<p>This post was written by Gia Marson, Ed.D.</p>
<ul><li>Your emotions are intense</li> <li>You have high standards </li> <li>You compare yourself harshly to others </li> <li>You don’t know how to stop impulsive behavior </li> </ul>
<p>Eating special foods when celebrating is a normal part of many traditions. If you find yourself looking back at how you lost control with food, focus on the positive moments and the memories you made, not on what or how much you ate. </p>
<p>As for the future, improving your ability to cope with negative emotions can make a real difference.</p>
<h3>Identify your triggers </h3>
<p>Identifying the triggers that lead you to lose control when it comes to food is an important step in creating healthy habits. Common triggers associated with the holidays can include:</p>
<p>Money: Dollars spent on gifts, travel, or socializing—or feeling guilty for not spending enough—can lead to feelings of anxiety and <a>stress</a>. </p>
<p>Lack of sleep: Fitting in time to buy gifts, attend events, and commute long distances can leave you running on empty when the holidays are over. </p>
<p><a>Alcohol</a>: Drinking alcohol is a part of many holiday traditions, but it can heighten negative emotions and cause loss-of-control behaviors. </p>
<p>Emphasis on food: At social gatherings, talk about food and appearances can be expected. Regrettably, this can create pressure to eat less or differently in the new year. </p>
<h3>6 ways to cope with post-holiday emotions</h3>
<p>When negative emotions get out of hand, it’s important that you acknowledge them, tolerate them, and build <a>resilience</a>, instead of pushing them away and trapping yourself in a negative emotion cycle. </p>
<p>Remember that being human is an emotional experience. If you numb your emotions, you might feel protected in the short term, but you’ll miss out on all of the good ones too. </p>
<a>attention</a> to all of the details related to one positive
<a>memory</a> and notice the way it makes you feel.
<p>Own the emotion. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, sad, or frustrated, notice what you are feeling and name it. Once you identify an emotion, it can feel less scary and all-consuming. </p>
<p>Get moving. A brisk walk, vacuuming, or even singing along with a favorite song can reduce the intensity of negative emotions and keep you from turning to food in response to them. </p>
<p>“[S]imply writing down our account of a challenging experience can lower physiological reactivity and increase our sense of well-being, even if we never show what we’ve written to anyone else.” ―Daniel J. Siegel, M.D.</p>
<a>anxious</a> about returning to your usual way of eating, write down what you’re eating now. Doing so may lower your stress response and give you the evidence you need to eat intuitively.
<p>Share. Sharing your feelings with people you trust can be helpful if the urge to emotionally eat or binge eat rises. </p>
<h3>The holidays—and you—are imperfect </h3>
<a>negative thinking</a>—and that is likely to exacerbate binge eating, compulsive eating, or emotional eating.
<p>Be kind to yourself. The secret to success...</p>
<a>fear</a> will often lose its grip over you.” ―David D. Burns, M.D.
<p>A simple shift in your perspective can help balance your emotions. Hold on to meaningful memories from the past and look ahead for sparks of joy. </p>
