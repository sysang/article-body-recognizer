<p>This affects the cap for the tax reliefs, which will be set at S$8,000 in total for top-ups to the Retirement Sum and to MediSave. The cap is separate for top-ups to the members themselves, and to loved ones, making a total of S$16,000 a year.</p>
<p>The rules for the top-up limits for MediSave will also be simplified. Now, members have to refer to both the Basic Healthcare Sum and the CPF Annual Limit and take the lower of the two.</p>
<p>The Basic Healthcare Sum is the estimated savings needed in the MediSave Account for basic subsidised healthcare needs in old age. The prevailing rate for the Sum is S$63,000.</p>
<p>The CPF Annual Limit is now S$37,740, and is the maximum amount one can put in all three accounts in a year.</p>
<p>The amendment means that members can make voluntary contributions to MediSave up to the Basic Healthcare Sum without taking into account the Annual Limit. Mandatory contributions are still subject to the Annual Limit.</p>
<p>He added that 2020 saw a record amount of top-ups via the Retirement Sum Topping-Up scheme – about S$3 billion across 140,000 members.</p>
<h2>DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS AFTER DEATH</h2>
<p>Dr Tan also explained other changes to streamline the administration of CPF schemes, making it easier to disburse bequeathed discounted Singtel shares and to disburse unnominated CPF funds under S$10,000.</p>
<p>One of the main changes is to allow for a beneficiary representative to receive the unnominated CPF funds of a deceased person on behalf of other beneficiaries, if they are all agreeable.</p>
<p>Under the current process, all eligible beneficiaries must submit their information and supporting documents to the Public Trustee’s Office (PTO) under the Ministry of Law (MinLaw). </p>
<p>MinLaw said that it received feedback that this process can involve significant time and effort, and can be streamlined to be more efficient, particularly for smaller amounts.</p>
<p>Under the new approach, a representative may be appointed to represent all eligible beneficiaries and make one consolidated claim for the deceased CPF member’s unnominated CPF monies. </p>
<p>In the event of a dispute over the nomination of a representative, the PTO will not proceed with the application until a consensus has been reached among the beneficiaries. </p>
<p>And if they fail to reach an agreement, they will need to re-submit their application under the standard administration process. This is due to be implemented by the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Responding to some MPs’ concerns that this process may lead to disputes, Minister for Law Edwin Tong said that MinLaw is introducing safeguards to ensure that the beneficiaries’ rights and interests remain protected.</p>
<p>The beneficiary representative must declare that he or she is either a sole beneficiary or that he or she has obtained the consent of all the other beneficiaries.</p>
<p>“The PTO will then confirm with the other eligible beneficiaries directly that they have given their consent before the PTO pays out any unnominated funds, CPF monies to the (beneficiary representative),” he said.</p>
<p>He added that if there are disputes that surface after the funds are disbursed to the representative, beneficiaries can seek recourse under the law.</p>
<p>The limit of S$10,000 will affect about half of current cases handled. “We believe that of this half a substantial number will be uncontentious and will benefit from an expedited scheme,” said Mr Tong.</p>
<h2>SHORTER TIME FOR CPF FUNDS TO BE RETAINED</h2>
<p>Dr Tan said that with these developments, there is no longer a need to allow for the retention of unclaimed CPF monies over such a long period. </p>
<p>The CPF Board will therefore shorten this duration from seven years to six months after the Board is notified of the member’s death. </p>
<p>“I want to reassure all members that if the CPF Board subsequently learns that a dormant member is alive, the Board will restore the monies to the member’s original accounts with interest,” he said.</p>
<p>The new durations will apply from Apr 1, 2022. Dr Tan added that over the last five years, about 98 per cent of CPF monies have been distributed to beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Another technical update caters for recovery of grants given to members who later become ineligible for the grant.</p>
<p>For example, if a member gets a matching grant for topping up the account of a loved one under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, but later appeals for a reversal, the grant will be recovered.</p>
<p>Dr Tan said in conclusion that changes will be made to simplify the CPF Act for better readability, while assuring members that this does not change any existing withdrawal policies.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h5> Statutory retirement age still needed, says Manpower Minister as Bill passed for higher retirement and re-employment ages </h5> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Statutory retirement age still needed, says Manpower Minister as Bill passed for higher retirement and re-employment ages </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>The Bill passed on Tuesday amends the Retirement and Re-employment Act so that the Minister for Manpower can prescribe a retirement age and re-employment age of up to 65 and 70 respectively.</p>
<p>This is in line with recommendations by the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers in 2019 that both the retirement age and re-employment age be raised by three years to 65 and 70 respectively by 2030.</p>
<p>The prevailing retirement and re-employment ages will continue to be prescribed by notification in the Gazette, said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>As announced earlier, the statutory retirement age and re-employment age will be increased to 63 and 68 respectively, on Jul 1, 2022. The public sector has already implemented it on Jul 1.</p>
<p>These ages will be raised gradually, subject to consensus by tripartite partners.</p>
<p>“Some progressive employers may take the initiative to abolish their internal retirement ages and allow workers to work as long as they wish, and we wholeheartedly applaud them,” he said.</p>
<p>“But as Mr Heng Chee How emphasised, the statutory retirement and re-employment age is still important as a floor and safeguard against employers who might not be as progressive.”</p>
<h2>"SEAWALL" FOR OLDER WORKERS</h2>
<p>He added that Singapore’s average effective retirement age has risen faster than the OECD average.</p>
<p>Mr Heng (PAP-Jalan Besar), who is NTUC's deputy secretary-general and Senior Minister of State for Defence, was part of the Tripartite Workgroup for Older Workers.</p>
<p>Speaking during the debate on Monday, he said that the statutory ages are like “a pair of seawalls” for older workers.</p>
<p>“They stand as visual reminders of our nation’s commitment to protecting our older workers as an asset,” he added.</p>
<p>Another recommendation of the workgroup was to raise the CPF contribution rates for workers aged above 55 to 70 over the next decade, to boost retirement adequacy for seniors. </p>
<p>The first increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rate will take effect from Jan 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Employees aged above 55 to 70 will see an increase in total CPF contribution rates of up to 2 percentage points. </p>
<p>This increase was deferred by a year from the original announced timeline of Jan 1 this year to help employers manage costs amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The re-employment framework is designed to balance the need to enable senior workers to continue working, while giving employers sufficient flexibility so that businesses can remain nimble and sustainable," said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>"Different businesses may also face different challenges, so we must strike a careful balance."</p>
<h2>FAIRNESS OF RE-EMPLOYMENT OFFERS</h2>
<p>Several MPs also raised questions on the need to ensure that employers fulfil their re-employment obligations and that re-employment offers are fair.</p>
<p>MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) was concerned that some senior workers who need the income may not have much room in re-employment negotiations.</p>
<p>“Older workers with lower education levels are particularly vulnerable to poorer workplace treatment. The fear of losing jobs keep some in unfair arrangements or toxic work environments,” she said.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, due to such difficult conditions, there are workers who resign before reaching their retirement age or forgo re-employment offers. We need to find ways to protect and help them.”</p>
<p>In response, Dr Tan said that there are guidelines laying out employers’ and employees’ responsibilities for re-employment, raising some of them as examples.</p>
<p>The Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees make clear that employers should engage employees at least six months before they reach retirement age, he said.</p>
<p>On the issue of medical fitness, they should offer re-employment to eligible workers who are medically fit to perform any job within the company, not just their existing job role. </p>
<p>Employers are also advised to presume that their senior employees are medically fit, unless there are clear reasons to believe otherwise. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> GST to be imposed on all imported goods purchased online from 2023 under Bill passed, MPs debate impact </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Matthew Mohan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be imposed on all imported goods from 2023 after a Bill was passed in Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 2).</p>
<p>Under the Goods and Service Tax (Amendment) Bill, GST will be extended to low-value goods worth up to S$400 that are imported via air or post from Jan 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Imported goods brought in via sea or land, and items valued above S$400 that are brought in via air or post, are already subjected to GST.</p>
<p>GST will also be introduced for business-to-consumer (B2C) imported non-digital services, such as live interaction with overseas providers of educational learning and telemedicine. </p>
<p>These measures were previously announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Budget speech earlier this year.</p>
<p>Another change will see an update to the GST treatment for supplies of media sales.</p>
<p>From Jan 1 next year, the GST treatment will be based on where the customer and where the direct beneficiary of the service belongs, rather than where the advertisement is circulated.</p>
<p>"SINGAPOREANS STILL REELING"</p>
<p>During the debate, Member of Parliament (MP) Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) noted that charging GST on lower-cost goods would affect lower-income households. </p>
<p>“Some Singaporeans buy products from overseas that they cannot find locally. They will now have to contend with significantly higher costs as a result of increasing shipping costs and GST costs,” he said.</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was echoed by MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang), who emphasised the need to provide more support for lower-income households amid the change. </p>
<p>Mr Saktiandi noted that the move would also happen in tandem with an impending increase in local GST rates, which is expected to take place before 2025. </p>
<p>In response, Ms Indranee noted that the bulk of consumption by individuals such as food, utilities, transport, education and healthcare will not be affected by the change. </p>
<p>“These goods and services are typically bought from local suppliers rather than from overseas suppliers and thus are not affected by the extension of GST to low-value goods imported via air or post and B2C imported non-digital services,” she said.</p>
<p>“The Government remains committed to supporting Singaporeans, with more help given to the lower-income.”</p>
<p>Mr Chua said he could not support a GST hike, which he described as an “unnecessary burden” on Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Ms Indranee responded that it was not really the time to have a debate on whether or not to raise GST as a whole, because the Bill was focused on a very specific aspect - low-value goods. </p>
<p>However, she noted that it was important to consider Singapore’s revenue and expenditure situation. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for the changes was to address a “gap” which puts local businesses at a disadvantage, Ms Indranee noted.</p>
<p>“These amendments will also keep our GST system resilient in a growing digital economy.”</p>
<p>Noting that there has been a “significant increase” in interest in online shopping, Mr Saktiandi pointed out that the borderless nature of the Internet would mean that Singaporeans also have easy access to foreign online marketplaces. </p>
<p>“Local businesses would now find themselves competing with online sellers from overseas, who are often more experienced, and able to offer their goods and services at lower prices due to lower production costs and lack of taxes,” he said.</p>
<p>MP Sharael Taha (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol) noted that amid the rise in online shopping, Singapore’s small retail merchants are “struggling”.</p>
<p>He explained that during a recent discussion with the Merchants Association at Pasir Ris, they shared that since the pandemic, business had gone down by up to 40 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised by MPs on how the new measures would be implemented. </p>
<p>Mr Saktiandi noted that policies must be “pragmatic and enforceable”. </p>
<p>“How will the Government ensure that there are adequate resources to enforce the new policies in an efficient manner?” he asked.</p>
<p>In her response, Ms Indranee noted that the new measures to impose GST on low-value goods will be implemented by “widening the scope” of Singapore’s existing overseas vendor registration (OVR) and reverse charge (RC) regimes. </p>
<p>These regimes are not new and have been successfully implemented from the start of last year, she added.</p>
<p>Ms Indranee also explained that when consumers check out their purchases, GST-registered overseas vendors will charge and collect GST on the low-value goods at the point of purchase when the order is confirmed. </p>
<p>“This is similar to how since 1 January 2020, GST is collected on imported B2C digital services,” she noted.</p>
<p>On compliance with the new GST regime, Ms Indranee noted that the regime is already in place for overseas vendors that sell B2C digital services to local consumers. </p>
<p>“Our experience with OVR thus far since 1 January 2020, and the experience of other jurisdictions with OVR show that these multinational businesses do comply with GST or VAT obligations of the jurisdictions they make supplies to.”</p>
<p>IRAS will also make use of “various information sources” to identify and engage overseas vendors that should be GST-registered and verify their GST reporting after GST registration, she added.</p>
<p>“In the event of non-compliance, the existing penalty and enforcement regime under the GST Act will apply.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Mainstream HDB rental could 'weaken our communities', reshape social norms: Sim Ann </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheryl Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Extending public housing rentals to the mainstream will change social norms and could weaken communities, said Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann on Tuesday (Nov 2).</p>
<p>This is not something the Government will embark on “without deep consideration”, she said in Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It will reshape our social norms and could weaken our communities, because unlike home ownership, where people sink their roots, rentals are more transitory. This is not something we will embark on lightly without deep consideration," she said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Development (MND) will continue to study how Singaporeans’ preferences and aspirations evolve, and continue to develop the public housing programme to meet these changing needs, she said.</p>
<h2>SEVERE SHORTAGE OF RENTAL UNITS</h2>
<p>In his adjournment motion, Mr Chua pushed for a greater diversity of housing options. But the key problem is the “severe shortage” of Housing Board (HDB) rental flats, he said.</p>
<p>There were 1.019 million sold HDB flats in Singapore as of March this year, but only 63,773 rental units, he added.</p>
<p>Mr Chua pointed out that there were only about 1,600 rental flats under construction, which will be completed progressively by around 2025.</p>
<p>But current average waiting times for rental units have already lengthened to five months, he said, adding that MPs have received requests to help with appeals for such units.</p>
<p>It is a similar situation for PPHS, and although there are plans to nearly <a>double existing supply with another 800 such units</a>, supply remains tight, he said.</p>
<p>The MP noted that there were 544 applications for 60 available PPHS flats in October, “indicating excess latent demand that cannot be met”.</p>
<h2>MORE DIVERSITY IN HOUSING NEEDED</h2>
<a>especially for millennials who are faced with limited living options</a>, he said. It would also cater to a growing class of gig economy workers, added Mr Chua.
<p>Expanding public rentals could help get rid of the stigma of HDB rental housing, he noted.</p>
<p>“Renting an HDB flat need not and should not be seen as a sign that you are poor and needy, and our position on rentals need to reflect that.”</p>
<p>Mr Chua said one of the biggest misconceptions is that home ownership is "superior" to home renting.</p>
<p>“The correlation between home ownership and the level of prosperity of a country may not be as clear cut. Home ownership is thus more of a preference than a superior option,” he said.</p>
<p>On how to provide this housing, Mr Chua mooted allowing private developers to partner with the HDB in coming up with Build-to-Rent (BTR) models.</p>
<p>If HDB were to provide more rental options, they could also be priced between that for public rental flats and open market rentals. This would also be “simply just a shift from a home ownership subsidy to a home renting subsidy instead”, he said.</p>
<p>He also suggested that the stock of HDB rental units could be held in a real estate investment trust (REIT) structure.</p>
<p>“This would also have the additional benefit of supporting the financing of the construction of new rental flats and is self-sustaining, reducing the cash costs on the part of the Government," said Mr Chua.</p>
<h2>BENEFITS OF HOME OWNERSHIP</h2>
<p>Responding to Mr Chua, Ms Sim outlined the benefits of home ownership, such as developing "a sense of rootedness and a concrete stake in Singapore's progress". </p>
<p>"Beyond being homes, HDB flats are also valuable assets that can be monetised to supplement their owners’ income during their retirement years," she said.</p>
<p>“More remarkably around 85 per cent of our low-income households own their homes,” Ms Sim added. </p>
<p>She said that housing subsidies are one of the “most significant bundles of subsidies” that most Singaporeans enjoy.</p>
<p>"Our home ownership policies also support our family formation policies, which reflects another important aspiration for many Singaporeans," she added.</p>
<p>While overall housing policy continues to support families, Ms Sim said authorities recognise the home ownership aspirations that many single people have.</p>
<p>“We are very mindful of the circumstances of this group and will continue to study ways to assist them.”</p>
<h2>GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER POLICY “VERY CAREFULLY”</h2>
<p>She noted that there is already a wide range of open market rental options, including co-living – <a>a growing trend that authorities are studying</a>.</p>
<p>“We see the provision of a subsidised rental option as a means towards achieving home ownership, because we believe in the benefits that home ownership brings to Singaporeans.”</p>
<p>She added that without substantial rental subsidies from the Government, most Singaporeans would be unlikely to find it attractive to pay market rent using cash.</p>
<p>In addition, flat owners who pay off their loans are “assured of a roof over their heads for the rest of their lives”, but for those who rent, rental payments would continue to recur, even after retirement.</p>
<p>“We will also need to study the impact of introducing a new supply of rental flats at rates lower than market, which may affect rental rates across the board,” said Ms Sim.</p>
<p>Concluding her speech, she said home ownership has been and will continue to be a key housing strategy for Singapore.</p>
<p>"Beyond just a roof over our heads, home ownership has provided Singaporeans with a sense of stability, security and belonging, and has given us a strong stake in our country’s progress," she said.</p>
<p>"Given our limited fiscal space, we will continue to prioritise our resources to support Singaporeans in achieving their home ownership aspirations - that is, homes owned by Singaporeans, and not by private investors through REITS," Ms Sim added.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> MPs suggest more ways to support Singaporean families who rely on maids for caregiving needs </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jalelah Abu Baker </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Amid challenges faced by some households in hiring maids as caregivers, two Members of Parliament on Wednesday (Nov 3) put forward suggestions to better support such families. </p>
<p>These include a higher maid levy for high-income non-local households, a ban on private bartering for domestic workers via social media platforms, as well as a cap on the number of transfers initiated by a domestic worker.</p>
<p>Speaking during an adjournment motion in Parliament, MP Tin Pei Ling (PAP-Macpherson) said many Singaporean families who rely on maids for caregiving needs are “crying for greater support”.</p>
<p>Domestic workers are an integral part of the caregiving landscape in Singapore, said Ms Tin, citing figures showing that the number of these workers increased by 27 per cent from 2010 to June 2019.</p>
<p>She outlined three categories of challenges faced by families in hiring maids - escalating salary expectations, allegations of abuse, as well as demands for a transfer using an ultimatum.</p>
<p>“These challenges had been fomenting pre-COVID. But the challenging situation boiled over when the supply of migrant domestic workers was curbed by travel restrictions during the pandemic,” Ms Tin said in her speech.</p>
<p>“A number of Singaporean employers wrote to me to express their desire for fairer treatment and called for more help,” she added.</p>
<p>In a bid to secure domestic workers urgently, some salary offers went up to as high as above S$1,000 per month, said Ms Tin, adding that these offers were publicised in Facebook groups like “Singapore transfer helpers (maids) direct hire”.</p>
<p>Such high salary offers prompted some workers to demand an end to their existing contracts so that they can be transferred to employers who pay more, Ms Tin added.</p>
<p>“Families stunned by such requests have little option – they could not just find a replacement easily, especially during the pandemic period,” she said.</p>
<p>"Many of such families dare not ask the MDWs (migrant domestic workers) to honour the contracts and stay on because their loved ones are literally in the hands of the MDW.</p>
<p>"Hence, they either offer a higher salary or consent to the transfer. The latter obviously leaves families with real care needs in the lurch. Such a phenomenon would also come across as favouring the high earners."</p>
<p>Ms Tin said it is important to ensure equitable access to hiring domestic workers for “ordinary Singaporean families" with real care needs.</p>
<p>“Could we consider introducing a higher tier of MDW levy for high-income non-local households to mitigate the imbalance of paying power?” she asked.</p>
<p>She also asked if the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) could consider disallowing “private bartering” via social media platforms, meaning only maid agencies will be allowed to match workers with employers. </p>
<p>Ms Tin acknowledged, however, that there are concerns about whether this will give employment agencies too much power and risk high agency fees.</p>
<p>In some instances where families were reluctant to agree to the transfer, allegations of abuse were made to force the move, Ms Tin said.</p>
<p>She shared the experience of a young working mother who was accused by her maid of providing insufficient food and rest. The allegations by the maid, who had demanded a transfer, were found to be untrue based on camera footage, Ms Tin said.</p>
<p>She added that MOM’s investigation of complaints can take months, and meanwhile, families face challenges hiring replacements.</p>
<p>“Even if the allegations were eventually found to be baseless, the MDWs often faced no legal consequence and were sent back to their home countries, at worst,” Ms Tin said.</p>
<p>“Innocent families that had endured the ordeal are then left to pick up the pieces on their own. Many felt helpless."</p>
<p>Ms Tin proposed imposing a cap on the number of transfers initiated by the domestic worker in a year.</p>
<p>“It would seem fair to ensure all parties involved to take the contract seriously,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms Tin also suggested more stringent checks or restrictions on domestic workers with a poor performance record when re-entering Singapore for new jobs.</p>
<p>MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) also spoke on the matter, with a focus on care needs for the elderly.</p>
<p>Families who need to care for seniors turn to domestic workers due to unfamiliarity with existing schemes, she said.</p>
<p>Some have also raised concerns about the waiting list for subsidised elder sitting services, daycare centres and nursing homes, she added.</p>
<p>“Looking for suitable step-down care services causes stress for families, and many also find it risky to wait and see if their loved ones qualify for a subsidised space or not,” Ms Nadia said.</p>
<p>Ms Nadia also suggested expanding the home caregiving grant by using a points system instead of separate financial and functional criteria to qualify.</p>
<p>“The number of activities of daily living that require assistance and household per capita monthly income can be tiered. A combination of these scores can provide a fuller picture for families in greater financial need,” she said.</p>
<h2>MOM HAS INTRODUCED SEVERAL MEASURES: GAN SIOW HUANG</h2>
<p>Addressing the issues and suggestions raised by the two MPs, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang noted that MOM already pays special attention to local households with caregiving needs.</p>
<p>Only households with at least one Singaporean with care needs are eligible for the concessionary maid levy rate of S$60 dollars per month, while non-local households with or without caregiving needs pay S$300 per month.</p>
<p>Instead of placing a cap on the maximum number of transfers for a domestic helper, Ms Gan said that MOM has adopted the approach of making the information more transparent. This allows employers to make “informed decisions” when hiring, she said. </p>
<p>Employers may access information relating to prospective workers' work experience, the types of households they have worked for, the length of each past employment and the reasons why they left employment.</p>
<p>"We started collecting the reasons from employers for the cancellation of the MDW’s work permit since September last year. With time, the information in the MDW employment history will become more comprehensive," said Ms Gan.</p>
<p>The employer reference channel also allows prospective employers to contact former employers of workers, she said, adding that MOM will look into how it can raise awareness of these existing initiatives.</p>
<p>Ms Gan noted that more than 80 per cent of employers hire domestic workers with the help of a maid agency.</p>
<p>For the remaining employers who prefer to hire workers directly to avoid incurring the additional cost of engaging an employment agency, disallowing them to do so would inadvertently increase the cost of hiring, she said.</p>
<p>MOM takes all allegations of abuse seriously, she added.</p>
<p>“We will continue to find ways to safeguard the interests of MDW employers while protecting the well-being of the MDWs,” Ms Gan said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately for MDWs to continue to be part of our caregiving landscape we strive to build a system that is fair to both the MDW employers and the MDWs.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Food prices expected to rise further in coming months amid higher energy costs: Gan Kim Yong </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Natasha Ganesan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Food prices are expected to “rise further in the coming months” as energy prices are set to increase, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday (Nov 3).</p>
<p>In a written answer to a question by MP Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (PAP-Jurong GRC) about the impact on food prices given supply chain disruption and increase in energy costs, Mr Gan said that energy prices contribute to the global cost of food.</p>
<p>He added that suppliers may need to adjust prices to reflect the cost increases.</p>
<p>“The cost of food is affected by a combination of factors, including the imported prices, energy costs, freight, labour, and seasonal weather changes,” he said.</p>
<p>Domestic food prices have risen in the past six months, mainly due to “increased prices for global food commodities, higher energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages”, said the minister.</p>
<p>Five electricity retailers have pulled out of the Singapore market over the past three weeks, citing volatile market conditions after a spike in <a>wholesale energy prices</a>.</p>
<p>Global supply chains have been under pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced manpower, delayed ships and caused bottlenecks at major ports worldwide.</p>
<p>Mr Gan said that the Government will assist families in Singapore in “various ways” to mitigate the impact of higher food prices.</p>
<p>“For example, the Ministry of Social and Family Development's social service offices provide ComCare assistance to low-income households to support their daily living expenses,” he said.</p>
<p>"The Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme has also helped less well-off Singaporeans with their household expenses during this period of economic uncertainty."</p>
<p>Last month, about 160,000 eligible Singaporeans received <a>S$100 worth of grocery vouchers</a>.</p>
<p>“Singapore will continue to diversify our import sources to keep prices competitive and enhance supply resilience,” Mr Gan said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Pandora Papers: No significant concerns over money laundering by Singapore institutions, says Lawrence Wong </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aqil Haziq Mahmud </a> </div> </div>
<a>Pandora Papers</a> has "not raised significant concerns" over money laundering and terrorism financing by financial institutions in Singapore, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong told Parliament on Wednesday (Nov 3).
<p>He was responding to questions by two Members of Parliament on whether the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is investigating the matter, after it was reported that <a>Singapore-based firm Asiaciti Trust</a> was named in the leaked papers.</p>
<p>According to the documents, Asiaciti Trust had helped at least 25 politicians set up and manage trusts and shell companies in secrecy jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"Based on MAS' assessment and information available thus far, the Pandora Papers have not raised significant concerns over the anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing (AML/CFT) controls of our financial institutions," Mr Wong said.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, MAS is engaging the relevant institutions to assess if tightening of controls are warranted."</p>
<p>Besides Asiacity Trust, Trident Trust Company Singapore was also mentioned in the Pandora Papers.</p>
<p>Both are foreign-incorporated trust companies with subsidiaries in Singapore. They are licensed and regulated by MAS, Mr Wong said.</p>
<p>Before the leak, the two companies had already been subject to supervisory and enforcement action in Singapore.</p>
<p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) first obtained the leaked documents and shared them with 150 media organisations to start a nearly two-year investigation. The findings were released on Oct 3.</p>
<p>The ICIJ reported that 336 prominent individuals from around the world had established offshore structures to hold assets, assisted by 14 service providers operating in at least 38 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Mr Wong said that MAS takes these disclosures "very seriously".</p>
<p>He acknowledged what while there were legitimate reasons to set up offshore structures, these structures often lack transparency and are thus vulnerable to abuse for illicit activities.</p>
<p>As such, MAS has clear requirements for financial institutions in Singapore to identify and verify the identities of people who are beneficial owners or effective controllers of their customer accounts.</p>
<p>"MAS also supervises the financial institutions to ensure that their boards and managements have implemented robust controls against money laundering and terrorism financing," Mr Wong added.</p>
<p>Mr Wong said that Singapore, as a major financial centre, will always face the risk of illicit financial flows, but he stressed that the Government takes the integrity of its financial sector very seriously.</p>
<p>"What is important is that we supervise our financial institutions well, and take strong enforcement actions where necessary to reduce this risk as much as possible," he added.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> 1 written warning, no fines issued since enforcement began for diners who do not clear tables: MSE </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Grace Yeoh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Since enforcement action against table littering in hawker centres began on Sep 1, there has been one written warning issued to a diner for refusing to heed enforcement officers' advice to return dirty crockery.</p>
<p>No fines have been issued thus far.</p>
<p>The enforcement action kicked in after a three-month advisory period. </p>
<p>"The common reason given by diners for not clearing the table after eating is that they had forgotten."</p>
<p>Dr Khor was speaking in response to Member of Parliament Joan Pereira's (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) question on the number of warnings and fines issued under the Clean Tables Campaign.</p>
<p>Under the regulations, diners who don't clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter will first be advised by enforcement officers, added Dr Khor. </p>
<p>If they refuse to heed officers' advice, they will have their particulars taken down and be issued warnings if it is their first offence. Only second or subsequent offenders will be issued fines or sent to court. </p>
<p>Dr Khor added that the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) will continue with "extensive outreach efforts" to ensure people are aware of the requirement to return dirty trays and crockery after dining in public dining spaces. </p>
<p>From Jan 1, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will also be <a>commencing enforcement</a> against table littering at coffeeshops and food courts. </p>
<p>This will follow a two-month advisory period from Nov 1 to Dec 31. </p>
<h2>"SELF-SERVICE CONCEPT" MOST SUSTAINABLE </h2>
<p>In response to Dr Khor, Ms Pereira asked whether MSE would support the adoption of technology to improve cleanliness in these dining areas, such as deploying tray return robots or automated food waste digesters.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the cleaning services and waste management sectors are facing a manpower crunch with the ageing population and declining workforce, Dr Khor said the situation is "likely to become more acute". </p>
<p>Dr Khor said this could help meet manpower constraints with "better retention", and people who are thinking of joining the sector might actually do so.</p>
<p>However, companies are also encouraged to refer to the Environmental Services Industry Transformation map under the National Environment Agency (NEA) to improve productivity, such as by redesigning their workflow or adopting technology, she added. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> More than 103,000 new firms set up, while 73,000 companies shuttered since pandemic hit </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheryl Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Over the past 18 months, more firms have been set up than closed in Singapore, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Between March 2020 and September 2021, more than 73,000 business entities ceased operations, while nearly 103,600 were formed, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling told Parliament on Wednesday (Nov 3).</p>
<p>Responding to a question from Member of Parliament (MP) Wan Rizal (PAP – Jalan Besar), Ms Low explained that over the last two years, about 3,840 firms were deregistered on average each month – similar to the period from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>But at the same time, a monthly average of more than 5,000 new firms were registered, “reflecting an increase in the total number of businesses operating in Singapore”.</p>
<p>Noting that "business formations continue to flourish”, she added that the sectors with the largest number of new businesses formed included professional services, wholesale trade, and retail.</p>
<p>This includes strengthening physical and digital connectivity, through the re-opening of borders and investing in digital infrastructure and capability building for firms.</p>
<p>Authorities are also helping firms capture new opportunities, such as those from the green sector, said Ms Low. Sector-specific transformation plans are also underway.</p>
<h2>RETAIL AND TOURISM SECTOR</h2>
<p>MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP- Bishan-Toa Payoh) also asked about the situation in retail and tourism-related sectors, which have been battered by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan noted that from January 2020 to September 2021, 8,600 retail businesses have shuttered. This is 330 more than the same period between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>“However, there were 15,570 new retail businesses set up, resulting in a net increase of 6,970 retail firms over the same period from January 2020 to September 2021,” said Mr Tan.</p>
<p>As for the tourism industry, there have been “some exits” since January last year, but new entrants have kept the number of businesses in operation “fairly stable”, he said.</p>
<p>For instance, though 13 hotels have shut, the number of licensed hotels remains at around 420.</p>
<p>The total number of licensed tourist guides also still hovers around 2,900, even though 176 guides chose not to renew their licences during this period, he said.</p>
<p>Travel agents have been harder hit, with 157 – or eight per cent of all licensed travel agents – ceasing operations, although around 30 new ones entered the market.</p>
<h2>HOW MANY WORKERS RETRENCHED?</h2>
<p>Between January 2020 and Oct 20, 2021, about 4,370 workers across core tourism industries were retrenched – and 58 per cent of them were locals, said Mr Tan.</p>
<p>“However, with early intervention and support under the SG United Jobs and Skills initiative, 67 per cent of the locals who were retrenched between January and September 2020 found new employment within six months.”</p>
<p>He added that in 2020, about 1,180 retail employees were retrenched, translating to 16.9 retrenched workers per 1,000 employees. More than half of them were able to enter a different industry within six months of retrenchment.</p>
<p>As for tourist guides, about 250 have served as safe distancing ambassadors under the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), he said.</p>
<p>Mr Tan reiterated that the Government has provided the sector with the highest tier of support under the Jobs Support Scheme, alongside other broad-based measures.</p>
<p>For instance, between the launch of the SRV scheme and the start of Heightened Alert in May 2021, monthly tour participants grew from more than 10,000, to more than 50,000.</p>
<p>The Singapore Tourism Board expects tourism to reach pre-pandemic levels in the next few years, said Mr Tan, adding that in the meantime, authorities are helping firms in retail and tourism sectors upgrade themselves.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The Office of the Clerk of Parliament said on Friday (Nov 26) that the Committee of Privileges has begun its work into a complaint against MP Raeesah Khan (WP-Sengkang).</p>
<p>"It will consider any matters pertaining to the complaint referred to it. The committee will present its report to Parliament in due course," said the Office, in response to CNA's queries.</p>
<p>The Office of the Clerk of Parliament added that meetings of select committees are held in private unless resolved otherwise.</p>
<p>Ms Khan was referred to the Committee of Privileges for breach of parliamentary privilege after she admitted on Nov 1 to lying in Parliament about the details of a case of sexual assault, which she had claimed was mishandled by the police.</p>
<p>She first mentioned the case on Aug 3 during the Workers' Party's motion on empowering women.</p>
<p>She said she had accompanied a 25-year-old woman to make a police report three years ago, and that the victim had come out crying because a police officer allegedly made comments about her dressing and the fact that she had been drinking.</p>
<p>When Mr Shanmugam asked Ms Khan to confirm that she had accompanied the victim to the police station, she affirmed it. She did not respond to requests from the police to provide details on the sexual assault case, the police said.</p>
<p>In Parliament on Nov 1, Ms Khan admitted that she was "not present with the survivor in the police station as I described".</p>
<p>"The anecdote was shared by the survivor in a women's support group for women which I was a part of. I did not share that I was a part of the group as I did not have the courage to publicly admit that I was a part of it," she said.</p>
<p>She revealed that she was sexually assaulted when she was 18, while studying abroad, and that it had traumatised her.</p>
<p>Mr Tong, Mr Zaqy and Ms Rahayu are standing in for Mr Shanmugam, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli and Leader of the House Indranee Rajah, who have recused themselves from the proceedings.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This story has been amended to reflect that Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad is replacing Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli in the Committee of Privileges.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Raeesah Khan resigns from Workers' Party and as MP after admitting to lying in Parliament </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Workers' Party (WP) on Tuesday (Nov 30) announced that Raeesah Khan has resigned from the party, which also "entails the resignation of her position" as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Sengkang GRC. </p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Tuesday night, the party said that its Central Executive Committee (CEC) met at 8pm on Tuesday to "deliberate and decide" on the recommendation of the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee was formed on Nov 2 to investigate Ms Khan’s <a>admission in Parliament</a> that she had lied about a sexual assault case.</p>
<p>At 4.30pm on Tuesday, Ms Khan indicated to party leader Pritam Singh that she intended to resign from the party, said WP in its Facebook post. </p>
<p>She attended the CEC meeting at 8pm and "conveyed in person her intention to resign".</p>
<p>WP said it will hold a press conference on Thursday to provide more information.</p>
<p>In a letter of resignation to Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin that was shared on her social media accounts, Ms Khan said it was with "a heavy heart" that she was resigning as MP for Sengkang GRC.</p>
<p>She added that she will assist with the Committee of Privileges, which said last Friday that it had <a>begun its work</a> into a complaint against Ms Khan.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Committee said in a press statement that it will <a>continue with its work</a> on the matters "pertaining to the complaint" it was referred to.</p>
<h2> Raeesah Khan's letter of resignation </h2>
<p>Finally, I will assist with the Committee of Privileges.</p>
<p>Ms Khan was referred to the Committee of Privileges for breach of parliamentary privilege after she admitted on Nov 1 to lying in Parliament about the details of a sexual assault case, which she claimed had been mishandled by the police.</p>
<p>She first mentioned the case on Aug 3 during the <a>WP’s motion on empowering women</a>.</p>
<p>She claimed she had accompanied a woman to make a police report three years ago, and that the victim had came out crying because a police officer allegedly made comments about her dressing and that she had been drinking.</p>
<p>Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam asked Ms Khan in Parliament on Oct 4 <a>for more details</a>, but she repeatedly declined, citing the need for confidentiality.</p>
<p>She confirmed with Mr Shanmugam that she had accompanied the victim to the police station, but <a>did not respond to requests from police</a> to provide details.</p>
<p>On Nov 1, she admitted she was "not present with the survivor in the police station as I described".</p>

<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Ms Raeesah Khan <a>resigned from the Workers’ Party</a> on Tuesday (Nov 30) night, effectively removing her from her position as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sengkang GRC. What’s next for her vacant seat?</p>
<p>Her resignation follows her admission that she had <a>lied in Parliament</a> about accompanying a sexual assault victim to the the police station.</p>
<p>In a speech on a WP motion on empowering women on Aug 3, she had claimed that the case was <a>mishandled by the police</a>. </p>
<p>With her resignation, WP members Ms He Tingru, Dr Jamus Lim and Mr Louis Chua are the remaining representatives of Sengkang GRC. </p>
<p>What will happen to the Sengkang GRC team now that her seat is vacant? Does her position as the only minority member of the team warrant a by-election? </p>
<p>According to the Parliamentary Elections Act, a writ of election will only be issued if all the MPs for the GRC have vacated their seats. </p>
<p>If only one of the members vacates their seat, the GRC will continue to be served by the remaining members of the GRC team. </p>
<p>When President Halimah Yacob stepped down from her position as an MP in <a>Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC</a> to run for president in 2017, a similar situation arose. </p>
<p>Like Ms Khan, Mdm Halimah was the only minority member of the GRC team. </p>
<p>When fielded for general elections, each GRC team must include a candidate who is Malay, Indian or a person belonging to other minority communities. </p>
<p>In the case of Marsiling-Yew Tee, a by-election was not held, and Senior Minister of State at the Ministries of Manpower and Defence Zaqy Mohamad assumed the role of adviser to the ward following her departure. </p>
<p>In a bid to push for a by-election for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) member Wong Souk Yee in early-2019 called on the courts to issue a mandatory order to compel its three MPs to step down. </p>
<p>In the design of the legislation behind the GRC scheme, it was Parliament’s intention that there would be no need to call for a by-election if one or even more than one MP of a GRC were to vacate their seat, he noted. </p>
<p>A by-election would only have to be called if all the members representing the GRC vacated their seats, Chief Justice Menon stressed. </p>
<p>WP said on Tuesday night that its Central Executive Committee (CEC) met at 8pm on Tuesday to “deliberate and decide” on the recommendation of the <a>Disciplinary Committee</a>, which was formed on Nov 2 to investigate Ms Khan’s admission. </p>
<p>At 4.30pm on Tuesday, Ms Khan indicated to WP chief Pritam Singh that she intended to resign from the party, WP said in a Facebook post. </p>
<p>Ms Khan then attended the CEC meeting that evening and “conveyed in person” her intention to resign. </p>
<p>The party will hold a press conference on Thursday to provide more information.</p>
<p>In a letter of resignation to Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin that was shared on her social media accounts on Tuesday, Ms Khan said it was with "a heavy heart" that she was resigning as MP for Sengkang GRC.</p>
<p>She also said that she would assist the <a>Committee of Privileges</a>, which said last Friday that it had begun its work into a complaint against Ms Khan.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Parliament of Singapore said the Committee would continue with its work on the matters "pertaining to the complaint" and present its findings to Parliament "in due course".</p>
<p>Singapore last saw a by-election in 2016, when Bukit Batok SMC’s People’s Action Party (PAP) MP David Ong resigned, acknowledging a “personal indiscretion”. </p>
<p>PAP’s Murali Pillai went up against SDP’s secretary-general Chee Soon Juan in the by-election, and won with 61.2 per cent of the votes. </p>
<p>Former Speaker of Parliament Michael Palmer resigned in 2012 after admitting to an extramarital affair. </p>
<p>A by-election was then called for Mr Palmer’s PAP seat in Punggol East SMC. The 2013 by-election was contested by WP’s Lee Li Lian and PAP’s Koh Poh Koon, with the former winning with 54.5 per cent of the votes. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Raeesah Khan's resignation relieves pressure on Workers' Party after she lied in Parliament, say observers </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aqil Haziq Mahmud </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The resignation of Raeesah Khan from the Workers' Party (WP) and as a Member of Parliament (MP) helped relieve some of the pressure the party was facing, political observers told CNA on Wednesday (Dec 1).</p>
<p>This was the best way forward for the party to assert zero tolerance for improper conduct by its MPs, they said, adding that this episode is a "blip" in the party's progress.</p>
<p>The party announced on Tuesday night that Ms Khan had resigned from the party and as an MP, after she admitted on Nov 1 to lying in Parliament about a sexual assault case.</p>
<p>But the resignation is not the end of the matter, observers said, pointing to an ongoing investigation by the Committee of Privileges, and WP's need to fill the void left in Sengkang and reassure Singapore residents about the conduct of its MPs.</p>
<p>Ms Khan was referred to the Committee of Privileges for breach of parliamentary privilege after lying in Parliament about the details of a sexual assault case, which she had claimed was mishandled by the police.</p>
<a>pressed in Parliament</a> for more details so that the police could investigate, but she refused, citing the need for confidentiality. She
<a>did not respond to requests from the police</a> to provide details on the sexual assault case, the police said.
<p>On Nov 1, Ms Khan admitted in Parliament that she was "not present with the survivor in the police station as I described", and that she wanted to retract the allegations against the police.</p>
<p>Following that, the Committee of Privileges started looking into her admission, and the WP <a>formed a disciplinary committee</a> to conduct a separate investigation.</p>
<h2>MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DECISION</h2>
<p>Associate Professor Eugene Tan at the Singapore Management University (SMU) said the resignation presents Ms Khan as taking responsibility for her actions, and that the party has zero tolerance for such conduct.</p>
<p>"Resigning is a more graceful option for WP and Ms Khan," he said, calling it a "win-win" outcome for both the party and her.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Bilveer Singh, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, agreed that the outcome was mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>"(Ms Khan) is a social media person. She must have seen the antipathy towards her since the thing started. So, if you're a political animal, then I think you must have seen how hostile the ground has become," he said.</p>
<p>"So, there's a personal level there to get out while there's an opportunity to do so without being punished, hopefully."</p>
<p>By resigning, Ms Khan is "taking away ... the target" on the Workers' Party, after her actions were criticised by the public, said Dr Felix Tan, a political analyst at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).</p>
<p>"It takes away the pressure on the party itself and puts it upon herself. So, I think she's saving some face for the Workers' Party," he added.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh believed that her resignation was part of a "damage limitation exercise" to ensure the party was "not hurt as much as possible".</p>
<p>"The longer she stays in the party, the longer she remains as an MP, the more she will hurt the WP," he said.</p>
<p>"To say it's her own decision (to resign), maybe, but I think it's more than her own decision, I'm very sure," he added.</p>
<p>While the WP mentioned that Ms Khan had intended to resign, Assoc Prof Tan did not discount the possibility that the party gave her "an ultimatum" to resign or be sacked.</p>
<p>"There is probably some pressure to ask her to resign, I think that is the best way forward," NTU's Dr Tan said. "Probably, the party did not want to be seen to be too draconian, to like fire her or to get rid of her."</p>
<p>Still, Dr Tan said the WP could have given her an option to stay on and "do her best in trying to move forward from the incident". However, he believes that resigning was the better option, given the severity of her admission.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh said Singaporeans hold integrity in very high regard. "So if you undertake, and then you admit you've done it, then it's time to go," he added.</p>
<p>If Ms Khan continued being in Parliament, the WP could potentially be subjected to heavy scrutiny that would distract from its legislative agenda, Assoc Prof Tan said.</p>
<p>"(The episode) is a setback but not one that the WP cannot manage. Their political cachet as the leading opposition party remains salient and will tide them over," he added.</p>
<h2>"SMALL BLIP" FOR WORKERS' PARTY</h2>
<p>Dr Tan said the WP has survived similar incidents before, like when it <a>expelled its former Hougang SMC MP Yaw Shin Leong</a> from the party in 2012 after he failed to explain allegations of an extramarital affair with a fellow party member.</p>
<p>"That was far worse than what Raeesah has done. In terms of morality, adultery is not really condoned in Singapore society," Dr Tan said.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh also called it a "small blip", saying that these things are expected in politics.</p>
<p>"Whether it's corruption, extramarital affairs or in this case just not telling the truth, which is actually to me very stupid," he said.</p>
<p>"So, for many people, it might not be as fatal as extramarital affairs or corruption."</p>
<p>Ms Khan's resignation might even boost the leadership of party chief Pritam Singh, said Assoc Prof Tan, highlighting similarities with how then-WP leader Low Thia Khiang handled the case involving Mr Yaw.</p>
<p>"It will stamp his authority ... The approach is similar: Cut the losses so that no WP MP will be a political liability and reduce the impact and, if possible, earn brownie points for the way the party dealt with the misconduct," he said.</p>
<p>Had Ms Khan completed her term as MP, Assoc Prof Tan suggested that her conduct would crop up at the next General Election, which must be held by August 2025.</p>
<p>"With more than 3.5 years left of the term, Ms Khan's misconduct will be less likely to feature on the campaign trail in 2025," he added.</p>
<p>Dr Tan felt that the issue would resurface at the next election, "knowing how Singaporeans are like and how our political landscape is".</p>
<p>"These sorts of issues will come back to haunt the political parties no matter when or where it is," he added. "But I think (the resignation) minimises the fallout so ... the political party can move on from this incident and nip it in the bud."</p>
<h2>WHAT NOW FOR SENGKANG?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Dr Tan said WP's three other MPs in Sengkang GRC – He Ting Ru, Louis Chua and Jamus Lim – have to work "really hard" to galvanise support from Ms Khan's ward of Compassvale.</p>
<a>by-election does not need to be called</a> when a single vacancy arises in a GRC, as it dismissed an appeal to hold a by-election in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC after Madam Halimah Yacob resigned to run for president.
<p>In its Facebook post announcing Ms Khan's resignation on Tuesday, WP said it would hold a press conference on Thursday to share its plans on ensuring that Sengkang residents "continue to be cared for and represented".</p>
<p>"A lot more work ahead for the Workers' Party members in Sengkang," Dr Tan said. "Not just the MPs themselves, but also the (other) Workers' Party members and ... the supporters to help out and take over the role of Raeesah Khan."</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Tan said the WP could "deploy" its former MPs Mr Low and Mr Png Eng Huat in Compassvale to "beef up" its ground presence there and demonstrate that "normal service" has resumed.</p>
<p>The party will also need to demonstrate that residents in the constituency will be "adequately represented inside and outside Parliament".</p>
<p>"The WP will be sure to ensure that the residents do not feel that they have been let down, such as in estate management issues," he said.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh said Sengkang residents will judge the WP's response not by what it says but by what it does on the ground.</p>
<p>"You need to double up to be seen to be doing more for Sengkang," he said, noting that the younger residents are "very critical", "very analytical and very demanding".</p>
<p>"So, I think delivering on the ground, not with words, is going to be the ... litmus test of how good the Workers' Party is and whether it's worth re-electing such a party in the next election."</p>
<h2>FURTHER ACTION COULD BE TAKEN</h2>
<p>Beyond attending to Sengkang, Assoc Prof Tan said the WP will also have to cooperate with the Committee of Privileges' inquiry into the complaint against Ms Khan, noting that this will continue notwithstanding her resignation.</p>
<p>"Parliament has the power to still sanction her," said Assoc Prof Tan, who is also an expert in constitutional law at SMU.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Tan added that the WP still has to impress upon Singapore residents that it upholds high standards of conduct and probity for its MPs.</p>
<p>"For this, the party has to state unequivocally what it knew of Ms Khan's allegations before her speech and what it sought to do after she made those allegations," he added.</p>
<p>The Committee of Privileges could still penalise Ms Khan, said Dr Tan, adding that the committee "should not be more forgiving" just because she resigned.</p>
<p>"They need to remain neutral in such a situation, that they have done their due diligence and that they have done their best according to the law," he stated.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh said if the People's Action Party (PAP) "pursues" further action, it could make the ruling party look bad, and lead to suggestions it was "revenge seeking".</p>
<p>Dr Tan said that "opportunists" in other parties could use the incident involving Ms Khan as fodder for political gain. "That's rather insensitive, what could arise from this," he said.</p>
<p>Now that Ms Khan has left the WP, Dr Tan said people should "not keep harping" on her actions or words, and realise that Singapore's current political and social landscape has evolved to include "woke" or <a>cancel culture elements</a>.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Tuesday, NTU Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah said Ms Khan's decision to step down was the right one.</p>
<p>"The faux pas aside, I think she was a trailblazer in many ways. The first opposition minority woman Parliamentarian; the first ‘woke’ politician in Parliament; and in GE2020, she inspired many youngsters," he wrote.</p>

<p>Editor's note: After this story was published, the Committee of Privileges released its report to the media at about 11.20pm on Friday, <a>detailing its findings</a> based on oral evidence from Ms Raeesah Khan and three WP members.</p>
<a>resigned on Nov 30</a> after she
<a>admitted to lying in Parliament</a>.
<p>Assoc Prof Singh added that the onus was on Ms Khan, as an elected MP, to correct what she had done.</p>
<p>On Aug 3, Ms Khan gave a speech in Parliament saying that she had accompanied a sexual assault victim to the police station and alleged that the police had mishandled the case.</p>
<p>Of "immediate concern" to Mr Singh was that Ms Khan had not previously informed her family that she was a victim of a sexual assault, he said.</p>
<p>"In view of a sexual assault and my assessment of her state of mind, I was prepared to give her the space necessary to address the matter with her loved ones," he said.</p>
<p>But she was told that "any parliamentary clarification on this matter was hers to make in her capacity" as an elected MP.</p>
<p>Ms Khan did not attend Parliament in September as she had shingles. At the next sitting in October, Ms Khan declined to reveal more details despite being pressed by Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.</p>
<p>She claimed she had not been successful in contacting the victim.</p>
<p>On Nov 1 in Parliament, Ms Khan admitted that she had lied about accompanying the sexual assault victim to a police station, and retracted the allegations against the police.</p>
<h2>"SHOULD NOT TAKE THREE MONTHS"</h2>
<p>Dr Koh said many people will understand that Ms Khan needed time to settle her personal issues, given that she cited this as a reason behind her misleading statement in Parliament.</p>
<p>"But that is balanced against ... how much time is needed," she told CNA on Friday, acknowledging that Ms Khan had shingles in September.</p>
<p>"But really, this is quite a serious matter of misleading Parliament ... So if it's so serious, yes time might be given, but you would imagine that should not take three months (for the truth to emerge)."</p>
<p>Dr Koh said the "sharp point" was when Ms Khan repeated the untruth "in front of her party leaders" during the sitting in Parliament in October.</p>
<p>"By that time, they could very clearly have just called a press conference and used their own platform and set it straight. And then wait for the next parliamentary sitting and also put it on parliamentary record," she added.</p>
<p>When asked about Mr Singh's assertion that it was up to Ms Khan to correct her statement, Dr Koh said: "She needed to set the record straight, but she couldn't take three months about it, and certainly not lie again."</p>
<p>"If she couldn't do it in a timely manner, and yet go on to reiterate the untruth, then how is that reasonable anymore?" Dr Koh asked.</p>
<p>"So I think that the Committee of Privileges is going to take this very seriously ... They will probably issue a penalty, even if they waive it, they have to make a statement that such behaviour is not acceptable."</p>
<a>will continue to look into the complaint against Ms Khan</a>, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament said on Dec 1 after her resignation.
<h2>"THREE MONTHS IS NO BIG DEAL"</h2>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh disagreed that WP should have revealed Ms Khan's untruth immediately after party leaders knew about it.</p>
<p>He told CNA on Friday that "each political party has got its own process of managing issues like this".</p>
<p>"Ms Khan did not act fast, she acted a bit late. But to me, three months is no big deal," he said.</p>
<p>"I think the sexual assault part needed to be managed at the family level. All this requires time," he added. </p>
<p>"She was ill, then how to deal at a family level that she had been assaulted before ... I think Pritam would have seen the bigger picture and said 'okay', but I think after November that was it."</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Singh said it was clear from WP's press conference that the party would not support Ms Khan's untruth, and that she would have had to resign or be expelled eventually.</p>
<a>save her and save her party.</a>"
<p>If the WP had "gone out and hurt" Ms Khan, Assoc Prof Singh said there could have been a "backlash from the public", and that the party could have been seen as "oppressive" and "very authoritarian".</p>
<p>"So, I don't think Pritam wanted to appear like that. I think he wanted to appear consultative. He was clear that 'I'm not going to support your lies'," Assoc Prof Singh added.</p>
<h2>HAS WP'S CREDIBILITY BEEN AFFECTED?</h2>
<p>When asked how the WP's handling of the episode would have affected its credibility, Assoc Prof Singh said the party would have to "work very hard to regain the confidence of Sengkang voters".</p>
<p>MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) will support the remaining Sengkang GRC MPs He Ting Ru, Louis Chua and Jamus Lim, who will each take over a part of the Compassvale ward vacated by Ms Khan.</p>
<p>But Assoc Prof Singh said he wants to see WP's heavyweight figures like Low Thia Khiang, Sylvia Lim and Lee Li Lian to "boost up and bump up" WP's presence in Sengkang.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, shocks like this (the incident involving Ms Khan) are good for everybody," he added.</p>
<p>Dr Koh said the public will give the WP "some concession" as it is an opposition party "fighting hard".</p>
<p>"On the other hand, it's difficult to give them that concession because the public will feel this is a serious matter dealing with the integrity of its leaders," she said.</p>

<p>Ms Khan resigned as an MP on Nov 30, following her admission that she had lied in Parliament.</p>
<p>After evidence was heard over Thursday (Dec 2) and Friday, the Committee of Privileges presented a special report to Parliament on Friday, including a summary of key points from the evidence.</p>
<h2>"CONTINUE WITH THE NARRATIVE"</h2>
<p>The special report, released to the media at about 11.20pm on Friday, included a summary of the key points of Ms Khan's evidence.</p>
<p>According to the summary, Ms Khan said she spoke with Mr Singh on Aug 7 and informed him that her statement on Aug 3 was untrue.</p>
<p>On Aug 8, she met Mr Singh, WP chair Sylvia Lim and WP vice-chair Faisal Manap.</p>
<p>“At the meeting, Ms Khan told them that she had lied in Parliament on Aug 3, and that she had no way of substantiating the statements she had made,” the summary said.</p>
<p>"As they (Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap) were more seasoned politicians, Ms Khan confessed to them that she had lied, and sought their guidance.</p>
<p>"They (Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap) told her that the best thing for her to do would be to continue with the narrative that she had already given in Parliament on Aug 3 (ie keep to the lie).</p>
<p>"If Ms Khan and the WP could get away with it, there was no need to clarify the lie. If the matter was brought up again, there would also be no need for her to clarify and there was no need for the truth to be told."</p>
<p>The message referred to two issues: About certain Muslim issues affecting women, and her untrue anecdote in Parliament and the allegation against the police.</p>
<p>"The reference to a 'statement' in the last line of the message refers to the Muslim issues," said the summary. </p>
<p>"The reference to taking the 'information to the grave' was that Ms Khan should continue to lie about the sexual assault case and allegation against the police."</p>
<p>Mr Singh visited Ms Khan at her home on Oct 3 and “told her that if she kept to her existing narrative on the untruths which she had said on Aug 3, there would be no judgment by him”.</p>
<p>“Ms Khan understood, from what Mr Pritam Singh said, that Mr Pritam Singh was advising her to continue to lie, should the matter come up the next day (Oct 4) during the Parliamentary session,” the summary said.</p>
<p>Mr Singh did not ask Ms Khan to clarify and state the truth in Parliament, and no one in the WP told her she should do so, the summary added. "To the contrary, Ms Khan was advised that she can continue to lie."</p>
<p>Ms Khan was questioned in Parliament on Oct 4 by Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam about it, and she maintained the lie.</p>
<p>She then met with Mr Singh and Ms Lim on Oct 4. They discussed the next steps, including about a possible Committee of Privileges that might be set up to look at Ms Khan’s conduct. </p>
<p>“Neither Mr Pritam Singh nor Ms Sylvia Lim asked Ms Khan why she had lied again earlier, in answering questions asked by the Minister for Home Affairs. Nor did they suggest that Ms Khan clarify the truth in Parliament.”</p>
<h2>DIRECTED HER "NOT TO RESPOND TO THE POLICE"</h2>
<p>Ms Khan also sought advice from Mr Singh and Ms Lim when she received an email from police on Oct 7, inviting her to assist them in investigating the matters she had raised.</p>
<p>“They directed her not to respond to the police and to ignore the requests, as the police could not compel Ms Khan to speak with the police,” the summary said.</p>
<p>On Oct 12, she was called to a meeting by Mr Singh, during which she met with him and Ms Lim. The WP leaders were of the view that the matter would not be dropped and was "not going to go away".</p>
<p>“The three of them discussed together, and decided that Ms Khan should come clean and tell the truth. At this meeting, Ms Khan asked, if disciplinary action will be taken against her and the answer given to her was no.”</p>
<p>She then told Parliament on Nov 1 that she had lied during the Aug 3 and Oct 4 sittings.</p>
<p>Mr Singh also met Ms Loh and Mr Nathan on Oct 12 evening. During the meeting, he told them that he "will not judge Ms Khan", according to the summary. He explained that he had met Ms Khan on Oct 3, before the Oct 4 parliamentary sitting.</p>
<p>"In saying this, on Oct 3, Mr Pritam Singh had left the choice to Ms Khan, as to whether she should tell the truth about her Aug 3 statement, if she was asked about it in Parliament on Oct 4," said the summary. </p>
<p>"Ms Loh was disappointed that Mr Pritam Singh had said this to Ms Khan."</p>
<h2>"NO ORDER TO CLARIFY THE FACTS"</h2>
<p>When asked by the Committee of Privileges, Ms Khan said that if the WP leadership “had told her to come clean to Parliament in October 2021, or to assist the police in their enquiries and tell them the truth, she would have done so”.</p>
<p>“She had done neither because they had told Ms Khan that there would be no judgment if she did not clarify the truth in Parliament,” the summary said.</p>
<p>Ms Khan added that “no senior WP leader or activist had told her to come clean to Parliament on Oct 4”.</p>
<p>During a press conference held by the Workers’ Party on Dec 2, Mr Singh said there “had been an order to Ms Khan to clarify the truth in Parliament in October, but she acted contrary to that”, said the summary.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Ms Khan disagreed and said “there was no order for her to clarify the facts in October”.</p>
<p>"No one from WP advised her to tell the truth," the summary said.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, she had been advised by Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap, on Aug 8, to continue her false narrative. </p>
<p>"And (she) had been told on Oct 3 (by Mr Pritam Singh) that there would be no judgment if she continued with her lie."</p>
<p>Mr Singh also said during the press conference that the disciplinary panel had put to Ms Khan that if she did not resign on her own accord, she would be expelled from WP, according to the summary.</p>
<p>Ms Khan countered this, saying that this “was not said to her”.</p>
<p>“When she met the (disciplinary panel) on Nov 29, it was suggested to her that she should resign, as it was for her well-being and because she had lost the support of her Sengkang GRC MPs," said the summary.</p>
<p>Ms Loh said Ms Khan was "not the sole actor" in how things transpired. </p>
<p>Ms Loh also told the committee that "several parts of the statement" made by Mr Singh to the media on Dec "were not true".</p>
<p>The party released a statement on Nov 1, attributed to Mr Singh, that Ms Khan had shared with him that she "wanted to set the record straight in Parliament", and that "this was the correct thing to do".</p>
<p>Ms Loh said she was "not fully happy" with WP's statement on Nov 1 because it did not reveal Mr Singh's knowledge of the matter, said the summary.</p>
