<div><h1>America’s living presidents — save one — warn about the danger our democracy faces</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Philip Bump</div></div>National correspondent </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:48 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>With one exception.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Writing for the New York Times, former president Jimmy Carter <a>echoed</a> Biden’s concerns.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> that he was “appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.”
<div><p>“Insurrection could do grave damage to our Nation and reputation,” he continued. “In the United States of America, it is the fundamental responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>On Sept. 11, he went further. Speaking at a memorial to those killed in the 2001 terrorist attacks on that day, Bush tied that attack to the current threat.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Annie Linskey</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 4:05 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div>Correction</div><p> An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a line from Vice President Harris’s speech, citing the “fragility of democracy,” to President Biden. The article has been updated. </p></div>
<p>President Biden on Thursday delivered his most forceful rebuke of former president Donald Trump and his followers who mounted an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol a year ago, making a speech that many Democrats have wanted him to give for months.</p>
<div><p>Without mentioning him by name, Biden said that “the former president,” who lost the election, has gone to extraordinary lengths in an effort to cling to power that is unprecedented in the history of American democracy.</p></div>
<div><p>Watch: Biden’s speech in 3 minutes</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the Capitol on Thursday, Biden charged that Trump and his supporters are using inconsistent and even hypocritical arguments as they assert, contrary to the evidence, that Trump had the election stolen from him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said. “You can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient. You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>How the GOP became the party of Trump’s lie</p></div>
<div><div><p>(The “theirs” grammatical error was in the written statement.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden, and Vice President Harris before him, framed this moment as a juncture when America must choose between an unraveling of democracy and a rededication to the country’s founding principles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conservatives took umbrage at her decision to put the three dates on equal footing, with Fox News focusing on that line in her speech in its coverage.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Rival Jan. 6 vigils reflect ‘two wildly different realities,’ expert says</p></div>
<div><div><p>At times, Biden described Trump and his actions in great detail. He reminded viewers that Trump watched the insurrection on television rather than intervening to stop it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for those who physically attacked the Capitol and those who incited them, he said, they “held a dagger at the throat of America.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Visual timeline: How Jan. 6 unfolded</p></div>
<div><div><p>Biden shied away from giving this type of address for months, instead holding firm to the idea that the best way to preserve democracy is to show that it works by delivering results.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> relief plan and a bipartisan bill to shore up the country’s infrastructure — and is working to pass a broader social program, despite roadblocks.
<div><div><p>But the process has hardly been smooth, and Democratic squabbling has been on vivid display.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden also sought to separate Trump and his followers from the traditional Republican Party, which he defined as the party of Abraham Lincoln, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.</p></div></div>

<a>Trump’s role</a> in the riot at the U.S. Capitol was precisely as you might expect. Or, I should say, each of the three separate reactions Trump offered was precisely as you might expect: rambling, furious, accusatory, dishonest.
<p>A remarkable allegation, centered on the idea that something new had been “revealed.” And, if you are immersed in the pro-Trump — or anti-anti-Trump — media world, you’ve probably already come across the claim.</p>
<a>a fundraising campaign</a> on providing just this sort of evidence. (A lawsuit
<a>filed</a> against True the Vote by a donor frustrated at the organization’s failure to prove fraud was dismissed in April.)
<a>Stephen K. Bannon</a> as its 2021 “Patriot of the Year”)
<a>picked up</a> the Just the News story, prompting a spate of enthusiastic “now-we-got-’em” style

<div><h1>Sean Hannity’s texts and the duplicity they reinforce</h1></div>
<h2>The Fox News host apparently knew about unrest in the White House over Trump’s Jan. 6 campaign. He didn’t share it — or even allude to it. And he has company.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>January 5, 2022 at 11:44 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hannity did not share this with his viewers, mind you. And as has been <a>revealed of other Fox News hosts</a>, he provided those same viewers with a perspective markedly different from the one he was espousing privately.</p></div></div>
<a>detailed by the House Jan. 6 committee</a> Tuesday night. Hannity added, apparently referring to Trump, “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.”
<div><div><p>Hannity in a Jan. 5 text again referenced departures from the White House Counsel’s Office: “Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hannity sent his “Pence pressure"/"WH counsel will leave” text the next evening, according to the committee. In another text the same night, Hannity said he was “very worried about the next 48 hours.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So we may only have 180 precious minutes tomorrow to make our case that there was real voter fraud, a case the media says we can’t possibly make,” Gaetz said.</p></div></div>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what Hannity was “very worried” about — Trump’s plot blowing up, the prospect of violence, resignations or anything else — but he certainly had a forum to discuss that and did not.</p>
<div><div><p>Hannity echoed this on Jan. 14.</p></div></div>
<p>Ingraham privately expressed concern about Trump’s delayed response on Jan. 6 but <a>said nothing to that effect on her show</a>. Hannity privately expressed concern about Trump’s plotting and his election theories and also said nothing.</p>
<a>raises concerns about “freedom of the press.”</a> There is no question that would be the case if Hannity were engaging in actual journalism.

<a>made no mention of the whole thing</a>.
<div><h1>Garland hints at bigger things in Jan. 6 probes, as Dems call for scrutiny of Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 4:25 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 5:40 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>But Garland delivered <a>his remarks</a> with clear knowledge of the political backdrop and with several notable comments on that front. And they’re worth a parse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early in his remarks, Garland reinforced the idea that the investigations are far from complete and that these efforts, by necessity, were starting small.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We resolve more-straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more-complex cases,” Garland said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after came <a>the money quote</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Garland seemed to address critics again later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Most important, we follow the facts — not an agenda or an assumption,” he said. “The facts tell us where to go next.”</p></div></div>
<p>In the very next breath, though, Garland alluded to another major investigation involving a president — Watergate — in a way that he had to know might stand out. And he again cited the idea that the powerful weren’t above the law.</p>
<div><div><p>The biggest question moving forward is how broadly Garland views, in the money quote, the concept of those who “were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.”</p></div></div>
<a>might be the crime to focus on when it comes to Trump</a>. Or does this include inciting Capitol rioters or declining to forcefully call them off even as your
<a>own supporters pleaded with you to do so</a>? Or does it include trying to overturn a democratic election based upon false claims?
<div><div><p>Garland gave no indication about that Wednesday, except to say that some crimes might have involved conduct well outside the Capitol and outside the context of the rioters themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) labeled the speech “important and eloquent,” but indicated he was hoping for more specificity on this front.</p></div></div>
<a>an investigation by a local prosecutor</a>.)
<div><div><p>But we’ve generally had little to work with when it comes to where the criminal portion of these investigations might lead. And Garland at least suggested Wednesday that it might well reach higher.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amber Phillips</div></div>Politics Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 2:52 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 6:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>One year after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, there has been precisely zero legislation in Congress to prevent it from happening again. (There’s a committee investigating what to do, but it’s not done yet.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what’s going on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is the Electoral Count Act, and how did it come up on Jan. 6?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Congress has a very limited role in choosing the next president of the United States. The Constitution says states choose how to run their own elections.</p></div></div>
<p>Congress was certifying those results on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters broke in and invaded the Capitol. Lawmakers returned that night amid broken glass and confirmed that Joe Biden had won enough electoral votes to be the next president.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are we talking about the Electoral Count Act now?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was not something that Congress considered immediately after the attack, which is when it would have arguably made the most sense to address it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as the Jan. 6 anniversary nears, some conservative thinkers have suggested changing this law as a way to respond to the attacks.</p></div></div>
<a>They are considering</a> weakening the filibuster to do it, an action that Republicans correctly view as a major threat to their ability to block Democratic legislation.
<div><div><h3><div>What do Republicans want to do?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>They’re not really sure yet. The Electoral Count Act was passed in 1887, and it’s an old and confusing law that tries to guide Congress in how it should handle any disputes in the states about who won. That actually happened in 1876.</p>
<a>that Pence considered it</a>.
<p>Yuval Levin of the conservative American Enterprise Institute <a>told Axios:</a> “It should be pretty clear that it needs to be clarified, that a vice president shouldn’t have to be in the position of saying no to the president.”</p>
<div><div><p>Members of Congress in both parties going back to the election of George W. Bush in 2000 have used the Electoral Count Act to make objections to the winner.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What do Democrats think of this?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The top Senate Democrat is wary, to say the least. Addressing Congress’s role in certifying the presidential election was never on party leaders’ radar as they weight vote protections.</p></div></div>
<p>Democrats rightly point out that Congress has a perfunctory role in certifying the winner. Any notion otherwise is a misreading of the Electoral Count Act, said Adav Noti, a lawyer specializing in election law with the Campaign Legal Center.</p>
<div><div><p>“Congress is not supposed to be deciding who won a presidential election in a given state,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>brought Republican state legislators from Michigan to the White House</a>. He
<a>spent an hour on the phone urging Georgia’s secretary of state </a>to “find” just enough votes for him to win the state. He continues to cheer on Wisconsin legislators who are still trying to overturn his election loss in that state.
<div><div><p>Only after all that failed did Trump turn to Congress and urged Pence to reject states’ electors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>But could there be some changes everyone agrees on?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maybe. Democrats have been spending the past year talking about why they think democracy is in danger, and they risk appearing hypocritical if they outright reject Republican efforts that could help prevent another Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My party has a lot of blame in the election space,” said former Republican secretary of state Trey Grayson, “but if Democrats blow this opportunity, then they deserve some blame, too.”</p></div></div>
<a>In an interview with Politico</a>, Thune endorsed those ideas.
<div><p>But what seems more likely is that whether to change the Electoral Count Act, and whether it should replace broader election legislation, will be something new for Democrats and Republicans to fight over on the anniversary of Jan. 6.</p></div>
