<div><div><p><i><b>This story contains spoilers for “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “Hawkeye.”</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just as shocking as<b> </b>the number of Spider-Men who<b> </b>show up in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” is the lawyer who is representing one of them.</p></div></div>
<a>lawyer without fear</a> nearby.
<b> </b>thrown at Parker’s window, Murdock stops it with his bare hands while barely flinching.
<div><div><p>This no-one-saw-it-coming moment means two things. Aunt May is clearly still paying her Netflix bill. And Murdock’s alter ego, Daredevil, is now officially a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p></div></div>
<a>Kevin Feige recently revealed</a> in a press interview for “No Way Home” that whenever Daredevil returns to the screen, it would indeed be Cox under the horned mask. We just didn’t know it would be this soon.
<a>War Machine</a>), but he’s also smart enough to know that if it isn’t broke, don’t try to fix it. Cox is absolutely still the best man for the job if he wants to be.
<b> </b>man is Vincent D’Onofiro’s Kingpin. The same Kingpin Cox frequently fought in “Daredevil.” This is a big bald deal.
<div><div><p>D’Onofrio is so excited to be back in the role that<b> </b>he tweeted about it.</p></div></div>
<div><p>This means Daredevil and the Kingpin are now MCU-certified fresh. Could a new series featuring the two on Disney Plus be in their<b> </b>future? Maybe a movie? Or they could just continue appearing sporadically throughout the MCU.</p></div>
<div><div><p>So now, when you see them in the MCU, it’s not a multiverse thing. It’s the real deal.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Nicki Jhabvala</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:27 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A frantic nine-minute 911 call provided some details about the December car accident in Loudoun County that killed 29-year-old Olivia S. Peters and left Washington Football Team safety Deshazor Everett seriously injured.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first witness told the dispatcher that he “just saw a car flip over” and confirmed the location of the crash. “I think some of his friends are coming to assist him,” he told the dispatcher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after, the other male witness was heard in the background saying, “He’s like all the way in the ditch,” before pleading: “Just get somebody. Just get some help.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The car is, ma’am, the car is — it’s trapped. It’s trapped in the trees,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the dispatcher checked the location of emergency responders, he repeatedly begged her: “Please hurry. Please hurry.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He later told her: “I don’t even know what happened.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After hearing the conversation in the background, the dispatcher asked how many people were in the vehicle, and the second witness said, “It was him and his girlfriend.” He added that one person was trapped inside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Moments later, sirens could be heard in the background, and he told the dispatcher: “They see me. They see me.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesperson for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said the investigation of the crash is ongoing and no charges have been filed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Peters, the longtime girlfriend of Everett and an occupational therapist from Montgomery County, Md., was taken to StoneSprings Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>. The extent of his injuries from the crash is unclear.
<div><p>On Thursday afternoon, Everett issued his first public comments since the accident, tweeting: “Thank you for all of your prayers, continue to pray for Olivia’s family and me. Thank you all Folded hands #Live4Liv”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Everett, a seven-year NFL veteran, is a core special-teamer and captain for Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Everett’s attorney, Kaveh Noorishad of Northern Virginia-based firm Noorishad Law, P.C., released a statement Wednesday regarding the accident:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There are no words to convey our collective sadness over the tragic accident that took the life of Olivia Peters, a loving daughter, friend, and longtime girlfriend of Mr. Everett,” Noorishad wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The family detailed her work as an occupational therapist, with practices in Las Vegas and New York City, and later launched the Olivia S. Peters Pediatric Therapy Foundation.</p></div></div>
