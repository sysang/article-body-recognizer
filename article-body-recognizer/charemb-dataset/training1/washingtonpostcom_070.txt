<div> <div> <div> <div> By <a> Judith Martin</a> , </div> <div> <div> <a> Judith Martin</a> <div> <a>Bio </a> </div> </div> </div> </div><div> <div> Nicholas Martin and </div> </div><div> <div> Jacobina Martin </div> </div> </div> </div> November 29, 2016
<p> <b>Dear Miss Manners:</b> Is it proper to renew vows after one year?</p>
<p> <b>Were they running out?</b> </p>
<p>My friend and the toddler had to leave three-fourths of the way through the service, due to a full diaper and a tantrum. It was a pretty stressful day for all of us.</p>
<p>My deceased husband’s mother and two siblings, as well as some uncles and aunts (siblings of the mother), were seated in the second pew.</p>
<i>her </i>family should have sat in the first pew. She was extremely angry and vocal, complaining that I “got all the attention.’’ I was shocked and confused, mumbled something about not arranging the seating, and left.
<p>Can you please give me your opinion on my former mother-in-law’s behavior?</p>
<p>P.S. I was happily married to my husband for 21 years and still miss him.</p>
<p>While it might have been reasonable to seat your husband’s mother ahead of your parents, this is no longer relevant. Fighting over recognition at the funeral of a loved one is loathsome.</p>
<p> <b>Returning a gift </b>is generally an insult and therefore best done only if that is your intention. In the situation you describe, it is both unnecessary and, because of the possibility of misunderstanding, unwise.</p>
<p>Although the trinket turned out not to be a trinket, Miss Manners believes that the value of a gift is measured by its meaningfulness to the recipient — and therefore notes that its value was always high.</p>
<p>It would be charming to write a second thank-you note mentioning how much the item means to you even after all these years — if you can promise Miss Manners that you will not mention the current bidding at online auction sites.</p>

<div><h1>Ask Amy: The wedding’s a year away, but the nightmare has begun</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Dickinson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>October 17, 2018</div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Dear Amy: </b>My daughter is getting married in a year. The wedding is a long way off, but the nightmares are already beginning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>My daughter isn't the problem, but my mother is! When I got married my mother informed me it was NOT my wedding, but a celebration she was putting together and therefore she would call all the shots, which she did.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I barely remember any of it because I really wasn't involved in the planning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now she is starting this with my daughter.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Right now, my daughter and her fiance want to elope. I'm fine with that, but I know my daughter wants a nice wedding with family. I told her that if they want to elope I will support that and we'll have a HUGE reception when they return.</p></div>
<div><div><p>I feel they are being shortchanged, but no one can stand Mom's interference. Trust me, if you knew her, you would know there is no talking to her. What can we do?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Desperate</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Desperate:</b> If there is simply no talking to your mother, then I vote for not talking to her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, yes, elopement might be the best idea for them, but if they do decide to host a wedding, the couple should not share any details with your mother (nor should you discuss this wedding with her).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You seem to have developed survival skills, but not necessarily boundary-keeping skills. I suggest you work on your own boundary setting and continue to explore the (negative) lessons your mother has taught you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Recently, I found out from the daughter of one of these cousins that their mother has terminal cancer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What would you do?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conflicted</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Conflicted:</b> I would respect the privacy of the person with a terminal illness — even if I didn’t agree with her choice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Dear Amy: </b>I was annoyed by "Too Old for Drama's" proclamation that because she is "a very strong, independent woman," she has no need for friendship.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I too am a strong, independent woman, with many treasured friends.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Having friends does not make you weak or needy; strength and independence appear in people with three friends, 100 friends or no friends.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one is obligated to remain friends with someone who takes all the energy and fun from things, but please don't equate needing companionship with being of weak moral character. It simply isn't true.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Good Friend</b> </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Good Friend:</b> I also noticed this person’s characterization, and implication that “strong, independent” people don’t necessarily need friendships.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Having and keeping friends is definitely something that strong and independent people do.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Peggy McGlone</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A few months after taking the reins of one of the smaller Smithsonian museums in July, Ngaire Blankenberg removed 18 Benin Kingdom Court Style works from their cases, saying their presence was harmful.</p></div></div>
<p>“We need to develop trust and transparency among our core constituents in order to build a 21st-century African art museum,” she said. “A huge impediment to that conversation is to have stuff you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<div><p>A new Smithsonian initiative aims to help America deal with the history and legacy of racism</p></div>
<div><p>The panel is examining past collecting standards through a moral rather than legal lens. The new guidelines will require Smithsonian museums to dig into the circumstances behind their acquisitions and make an effort to address any wrongs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The review will bring the entire institution in line with the practices he put in place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which <b/>opened in 2016 with Bunch as its founding director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a moment to say, ‘We can be better,’ ” Bunch said. “By accepting our troubled past, we can point to a better future.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>works stolen by Nazis from Jewish families; in the early 2000s, Italian officials used the courts to force the return of antiquities.
<div><p>Hobby Lobby’s forfeited Gilgamesh tablet is headed back to Iraq, and authorities hope it will be a warning to smugglers</p></div>
<b> </b>and protests around the country that led to
<div><div><p>The display was meant to celebrate the royal court’s rich artistic tradition of metalworks, including bronze plaques and sculptures, and ivory carvings that date to the 1300s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That historical context was not enough for Blankenberg.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My strategy is to create a space of recognition for global Africans — a place where we feel belonging, kinship and inspired by art as defined by us,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s first Black leader, on the challenge of making it ‘a place that matters’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Buyers also worked regularly with dealers and often relied on their reputations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Buyers didn’t ask that many questions before agreeing to a sale,” said Victoria Reed, curator for provenance at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. “Today, we see there is a tremendous risk to that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is giving voice to individuals, communities and institutions that have not always had a voice,” Kreamer said. “Engagement with communities will be part of curatorial practice going forward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Blankenberg, the question of legal ownership is not the central concern.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The important thing is not so much this option or that option but who gets to decide,” she said. “Is there an equitable conversation between source communities and museums to decide what happens to the objects?”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of Smithsonian-wide staff shortages related to the region’s coronavirus surge, the National Museum of African Art is open only on Saturdays and Sundays until Jan. 19.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Smithsonian is on a massive search for six new museum directors. Their work could reshape the institution for generations.</p></div>

<div><div><p>After five years, countless tabloid headlines, tons of rumors and many story lines on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” could the Khloé Kardashian-Tristan Thompson saga finally be coming to an end?</p></div></div>
<a>the<b> </b>very dramatic message</a> that Thompson posted to Instagram Monday night. Thompson, an NBA player who won a championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, confirmed that a paternity test has revealed that
<b> </b>Thompson and Kardashian’s relationship — and Thompson’s rumored infidelity — fueled an enormous amount of interest in the famous family and their reality TV empire. E!'s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which
<a>ended last June</a> after 20 seasons, devoted plenty of airtime to addressing rumors that cropped up about the pair. Their journey was often cringe-inducing to watch, as deeply personal issues played out in front of millions of viewers.
<a>on the series</a>, the family gets to decide on their own terms how to tackle this latest and upsetting chapter for Khloé.
<a>told the E! cameras</a>. “And even though I know not to believe everything on the Internet, Khloé and an NBA player do go hand-in-hand.”
<a>when cameras captured</a> each family member’s individual reaction to learning that a video had been posted online
<a>that showed</a> Thompson kissing another woman. It was particularly unfortunate timing, given that Khloé was nine months pregnant and about to give birth at any second.
<div><div><p>“Khloé’s gonna die,” Kim said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is really shocking and heartbreaking,” Kourtney added.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>was about to have her baby, Thompson walked into the room. (At one point, Kim, standing behind Thompson, dragged her finger across her throat in the gesture for “I’ll kill him.”) Later, Khloé
<a>told viewers</a> that she let Thompson attend the birth because “regardless of what Tristan did to me, I was never going to take that moment away from True or Tristan. She should not be punished for his actions.”
<a> Internet frenzy</a> broke out in early 2019 when TMZ reported that Khloé broke up with Thompson after he cheated on her with Jordyn Woods, a model and best friend of Kylie. Woods, who became one of the
<a>most-Googled</a> people of 2019 after this incident, went on
<a> Jada Pinkett Smith’s “Red Table Talk”</a> to try to clear her name (she said the two just kissed once after drinking at a party), but the Kardashians wouldn’t let go; Khloé tweeted that Woods had broken up her family.
<p>Alas, as everyone now knows (thanks to <a>court documents</a>), Thompson said that he and Nichols slept together on his birthday. Khloé, 37, and Thompson reportedly broke things off again in June, before Nichols’s lawsuit became public.</p>
<p>Does Thompson’s apology on Monday signal an end to this chapter of the Kardashian family epic? With a new show on the way and millions of Instagram followers waiting to see what happens next, there can really be just one response: Stay tuned.</p>

<a><h2>T.S. Eliot may have been flawed, but a new book reminds of his greatness on the page</h2></a>
<p>As we reach the centenary of "The Wasteland," a new look at Eliot beyond the poem that defined him</p>
<a><h2>12 books I should have reviewed last year: A critic’s lament</h2></a>
<p>There were too many worthy books, but I had too little time — and, alas, too many excuses.</p>
<a><h2>‘Around the World in Eighty Days’ — about to get a reboot — is the perfect Christmas tale</h2></a>
<p>The classic adventure story mirrors the holiday season — weeks of madcap action and inner turmoil that usher in a morning of gladness and goodwill.</p>
<a><h2>Looking for a seasonal tale of mystery, murder and ghosts? Here are 9 books just for you.</h2></a>
<p>You can’t beat Holmes for the holidays. Also, Victorian Christmas ghost stories for those cozy nights by the fire.</p>
<a><h2>Books make the best gifts. Here are seven surprising choices for the readers on your list.</h2></a>

<a><h2>‘True Grit’ is a modern classic, but it’s not the only great work by Charles Portis</h2></a>
<p>I binge-read Portis’s books — “Norwood,” “The Dog of the South” and more. They offered just the lift I needed.</p>
<a><h2>‘A Voyage to Arcturus’ may have sold 596 copies in its first printing, but it deserves a wider audience</h2></a>
<p>This titanic mix of fantasy, science fiction and philosophy is a challenging but worthwhile read. C.S. Lewis agreed.</p>
<a><h2>If you like action-packed historical novels, ‘The War of Jenkins’ Ear’ is just the book for you</h2></a>
<p>Robert Gaudi’s lively account of the 18th-century conflict salts an already exciting narrative with vivid details and gossip.</p>
<a><h2>H.G. Wells wanted to change the world. A new book explores the author’s outsize ambitions</h2></a>
<p>Claire Tomalin’s ‘The Young H.G. Wells’ is a fascinating look at the prolific writer’s rocky beginnings and complicated personal life.</p>

<a>The Complete Prose of T.S. Eliot</a>.”
<b> </b>Under the general editorship of Ronald Schuchard, this set — from Johns Hopkins University Press, which also offers its eight volumes in a less expensive digital format — must be one of the most ambitious and

<a>The Idea of a Christian Society</a>” could also bring out, in the same year (1939), the light verse of “
<a>Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats</a>.” Needless to say, Eliot’s later ruminations as a public intellectual, though sometimes pompously expressed, remain touchstones of traditional conservative thought.
<div><div><p>I marked up many passages in “The Complete Prose” — thus ruining its resale value for my heirs — but let me share at least a few of Eliot’s more pointed observations:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dostoevsky “appears to satisfy the usual definition of genius; that is, an infinite capacity for taking no pains.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Henry James’s “technique has received the kind of praise usually accorded to some useless, ugly, and ingenious piece of carving which has taken a very long time to make.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of Sir Philip Sidney’s “Arcadia” and John Lyly’s “Euphues”: “The latter is a very dull book; the former I believe to be the dullest novel in the language.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Liberalism and Conservatism: Both “can be equally repellent: if the former can mean chaos, the latter can mean petrifaction.”</p></div></div>

<a>he said in an interview with The Associated Press.</a> “It was a very simple sentence but it profoundly effected everything I’ve done.”
<div><div><p>“Right up to the end, he was fighting for the art of cinema and the people who created it,” Scorsese wrote.</p></div></div>
<p>He would go on to make two other films with Shepherd, an adaptation of Henry James’s “Daisy Miller” and the musical “At Long Last Love,” neither of which were particularly well-received by critics or audiences.</p>
<div><div><p>And he also passed on major opportunities at the height of his successes. He told Vulture he turned down “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” and “The Exorcist.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the interview with the AP in 2020, Bogdanovich acknowledged that his relationships had an impact on his career.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The whole thing about my personal life got in the way of people’s understanding of the movies,” Bogdanovich said. “That’s something that has plagued me since the first couple of pictures.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They call me ‘Pop,’ and I allow it,” he told Vulture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just keep going, you know. Television is not dead yet,” he said with a laugh. “But movies may have a problem.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet even with his Hollywood-sized ego, Bogdanovich remained deferential to those who came before.</p></div></div>
