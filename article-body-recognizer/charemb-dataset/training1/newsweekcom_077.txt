<p>Also, your 401(k) surely did not "go to hell," as the previous guy predicted. On the contrary, stocks in the SP 500 are up 26 percent as the first year of the Biden presidency is about to end.</p>
<p>How good is that? "U.S. financial markets are outperforming the world by the biggest margin in the 21st century" is how Bloomberg put it.</p>
<p>The U.S. gross domestic product is expected to have grown an extraordinary 5.6 percent this year, according to economists. And that's after adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is down to 4.2 percent. Retail sales in the recent Christmas shopping season rose 8 percent from the same period last year—the biggest gain in 17 years.</p>
<p>As Bloomberg summed it up, "America's economy improved more in Joe Biden's first 12 months than any president during the past 50 years."</p>

<div> Can the Ukraine Standoff be Solved Diplomatically?</div>
<h2><a>Can the Ukraine Standoff be Solved Diplomatically?</a></h2>
<div>Washington and Europe don't want to be in a position where their troops are facing off against a nuclear-armed Russia, something Ukraine's incorporation into NATO would enable practically overnight.</div>
<h2><a>A New U.S. Policy Toward the Taliban</a></h2>
<div>Rather than isolating the Taliban government in perpetuity, U.S. officials should be explicit during their conversations with Taliban ministers.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. is Deprioritizing the Middle East</a></h2>
<div>There has been a reduction in the U.S. force posture in the Middle East, even if it isn't yet accompanied by a change in underlying strategy as some would like.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Shouldn't Give up Too Soon on Iran Nuclear Talks</a></h2>
<div>While there may come a point in time when U.S. and European officials conclude Iran is unwilling to budge from its maximalist position, now is not that time.</div>
<h2><a>Don't Give Ukraine a U.S. Security Guarantee</a></h2>
<div>If U.S. officials were being honest with themselves, they would recognize that more military assistance to the Ukrainians is unlikely to do much of anything except prompt Russia to retaliate in kind.</div>
<h2><a>There is No Such Thing as a One-Size-Fits-All China Policy</a></h2>
<div>U.S. officials should continue to encourage its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to take ownership of their own security, bolstering the region's ability to check China from becoming a Eurasian hegemon.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Isn't All Powerful</a></h2>
<div>The U.S., to put it bluntly, is not the all-powerful player at the head of the table with infinite resources and an unending reservoir of leverage.</div>
<h2><a>Will Biden's Drone Policy Get Back to the Basics?</a></h2>
<div>Just because the U.S. can find, track and kill terrorists wherever they are doesn't mean the U.S. shouldn't be judicious about utilizing this capability.</div>
<h2><a>To Move the Nuclear Talks Forward, the U.S. Needs to Go First</a></h2>
<div>The last thing the U.S. needs is another crisis in the Middle East. Common-sense diplomacy can help us escape it.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. is Addicted to Sanctions. Do They Work?</a></h2>
<div>If there is one tool policymakers and lawmakers in Washington are almost always predisposed to use, it is the economic stick commonly known as sanctions.</div>
<h2><a>The Shifting Tides of Middle Eastern Diplomacy</a></h2>
<div>The U.S. is slowly but surely diverting its focus from the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific. For leaders like Mohammed Bin Salman and Mohammed Bin Zayed who are used to being catered to by the U.S., times are changing.</div>
<div>Is there a better way to defend the U.S. from anti-American terrorism other than weighing into internal fights on behalf of governments that oftentimes disillusion their own populations?</div>

<div>Twenty years after President George. W. Bush's infamous Sept. 20 speech to a frightened nation, the war on terrorism continues to this very day.</div>

<div>The most effective way to push Europe into becoming more self-sustainable, if not independent, is for the U.S. to do less on the continent.</div>
<h2><a>Spotlight Still on Saudi Arabia 20 Years After 9/11</a></h2>
<div>But let's face it: two decades after 9/11, Saudi Arabia's political leadership has a long way to go in cracking down on the sources of terrorism funding.</div>
<h2><a>The Taliban Won Afghanistan's Civil War. But Will it Win the Peace?</a></h2>
<div>Taliban fighters spent 20 years seeking to return to power, a goal they finally accomplished recently. But sustaining an insurgency is not the same thing as running an even semi-competent government.</div>
<h2><a>Is Biden's Summit for Democracy a Good Idea?</a></h2>
<div>The U.S.-organized Summit for Democracy is meant to give democracies a boost and put autocracies on notice. But the summit carries the risk of being counterintuitive.</div>
<h2><a>North and South Korea are Talking Again</a></h2>
<div>Until the Biden administration puts more flesh on the bones of its North Korea policy, it's difficult to see how attempts to improve inter-Korean relations will be anything other than minor or symbolic.</div>
<h2><a>Why the U.S. Should be Wary of Calls for Foreign Intervention</a></h2>
<div>From the outside, intervening in a dicey situation can seem like the easy solution to a devil of a problem. Too frequently, though, it turns out to be the wrong one.</div>
<h2><a>Biden Shouldn't Ignore the Perils of Ideological Competition</a></h2>
<div>Is it wise to pit every democracy against every autocracy and turn the complicated game of geopolitics into a simplistic, zero-sum existential struggle?</div>

<div>President Joe Biden's latest military action exposes the hot mess otherwise known as Washington's Middle East policy.</div>
<h2><a>Is Congress Finally Asserting Themselves on War and Peace? TBD</a></h2>

<p>A total of 8,344 cases were reported in the state last week, an 80 percent jump from the week prior, largely due to the spreading of the Omicron variant, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers.</p>
<p>"We really are in the fifth wave now of COVID for Mississippi," Byers said during the news conference.</p>
<p>Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said those who test positive should follow the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and isolate for at least five days followed by strict mask-wearing around others.</p>
<p>At least 400 people were hospitalized from COVID in the state as of Monday, a significant jump from 239 reported late last week on Christmas Eve, according to the state health department.</p>
<p>"We're in the midst of a peak of transmission that we've never seen, most likely, this whole pandemic," Dobbs said.</p>
<p>"Don't perpetuate the chain of transmission," he said. "This is really a 'love thy neighbor' sort of moment, and 'love thy family,' also. Stay home."</p>
<p>"It is becoming increasingly difficult for our smaller community, county hospitals to transport patients to some of our larger centers. ... It all plays back to the staffing issue," he said.</p>
<p>Health officials said Tuesday that 48 percent of Mississippi residents were fully vaccinated, and 29 percent had received a booster shot. About 63 percent nationwide are fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>With the surge in new virus cases, there has also been a rise in demand for testing. Dobbs said the state is expanding the number of available testing sites, and asked residents to be patient.</p>
<p>Due to a surge in new confirmed coronavirus cases, the mayor of Mississippi's capital city has ordered the closure of city hall and other offices.</p>
<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's new executive order closing offices went into effect Wednesday. Only essential employees will continue to work in person, he said. The order will stay in place until at least Jan. 5, 2022.</p>
