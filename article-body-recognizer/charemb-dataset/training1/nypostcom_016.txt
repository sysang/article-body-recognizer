<h1> Ilya Sorokin bails out Islanders in much-needed win over Flyers</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 10:27pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 11:37pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>It’s not particularly fair to declare Game 31 of 82 a must-win under any circumstances. But the Islanders will be breathing a sigh of relief after Monday.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the cleanest of wins. The Islanders turned to goaltender Ilya Sorokin to bail them out with 26 saves, but it wasn’t the number so much as the manner in which they were made.</p>
<p>In the second period alone, Sorokin made a sprawling stop on a two-on-zero rush, denied two more odd-man rushes when the Islanders were on the power play, then stopped Joel Farabee, who was in all alone, in the waning minutes of the period.</p>
<p>“I just work on the puck,” Sorokin said of the two-on-zero stop. “I wait for when a player shoots or gives a pass. And he made a shot in the middle, off the net. And I was in a good position.”</p>
<p>“Really the story was right there,” head coach Barry Trotz said. “Ilya Sorokin with a couple of outstanding saves. They score a couple on that, I think our bench deflates, and they didn’t.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time coming, to be honest with you,” Cizikas said of his first goal of the year. “When I turned around and I saw [Matt Martin’s] hands in the air, honestly I thought it hit him and went in.”</p>
<p>Despite the mishap cutting the lead to one going into the third, the Islanders made it 3-1 at 4:44 of the final period after Anthony Beauvillier swept in Oliver Wahlstrom’s rebound on a delayed penalty.</p>
<p>Between now and then — they’ll go into the break nearly at the halfway mark, having played 39 games — we should get an idea of whether a run at the playoffs is anything more than the empty rhetoric of a lost season.</p>
<p>The Islanders are playing with a nearly healthy lineup, and no more games have been wiped off the schedule (fingers crossed). They’re close to .500, and they’ve got two weeks to determine where the season goes.</p>

<h1> Tom Thibodeau: Kemba Walker hasn’t given Knicks green light to return</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:49pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>During the last Garden holiday matinee, Kemba Walker became a triple-double Christmas Day hero. </p>
<p>On MLK Day, Walker was a spectator donning a bright-orange sweatshirt — his arthritic left knee appearing as solid as slush. </p>
<p>His mysterious absence continued Monday when Walker sat out his ninth straight game. </p>
<p>Tom Thibodeau has touted how close Walker has been for a week, but the Knicks coach said it is the veteran’s call and The Bronx product hasn’t given the green light. </p>
<p>According to Thibodeau, the delay, too, is because the Knicks want Walker strong enough to not have to take games off after he returns. But is that really possible? </p>
<p>The Knicks will play Minnesota on Tuesday in the second leg of a back-to-back, but Thibodeau didn’t sound confident Walker would make his big return. </p>
<p>It seems unlikely the Knicks would use Walker in both legs of a back-to-back the rest of the season. </p>
<p>Walker’s shutdown occurred after he was relaunched following Thibodeau exiling him for nine games because of ineffective play. </p>
<a>showed no structural damage</a> but it’s now been nearly three weeks since he last played — in Detroit on Dec. 29. 
<p>“I don’t want to get into a situation where it’s on off, on off,’’ Thibodeau said. “I want to get to a point where he feels confident, in a good spot, a good place and he can go.’’ </p>
<p>The Knicks have played 44 games and Walker has been a part of just 24 of them. Alec Burks has filled in well recently as starting point guard but had a six-point clunker Monday. </p>

<p>Budda Baker, a defensive back on the Cardinals who sustained a scary hit in Monday night’s playoff loss to the Rams, has been released from the hospital and appears to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>Mark Dalton, a publicist for the Cardinals, tweeted Tuesday that Baker was evaluated overnight at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Vegas. </p>
<p>“He was cleared by the physicians there, released this morning and is on his way back to Arizona,” Dalton wrote. </p>
<p>Late in the third quarter, with the Rams leading 28-8, Los Angeles running back Cam Akers bowled over Baker on an 11-yard run in the red zone. </p>
<p>Down on the field while players from both teams knelt in prayer, Baker was then taken off on a stretcher and transported to the hospital. </p>
<p>“Thank you all for the prayers. I am doing good,” Baker tweeted early Tuesday morning.</p>

<div> January 18, 2022 8:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 8:37pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>WASHINGTON — There’s no good time to lose Kevin Durant for a month, which is just what the Nets are facing. There are only bad times and worse times.</p>
<p>But at least now is merely a bad time.</p>
<p>The Nets are embarking on their longest concentration of road games this season. Normally that would be a bad time to be without their star, but there’s been nothing normal about this season or Kyrie Irving’s situation.</p>
<p>The Nets were 16-4 last season with that dynamic duo and no Durant. Can Brooklyn repeat that success, starting Wednesday in Washington?</p>
<p>But time is of the essence, because the Nets can’t waste Irving’s presence on this four-game trip followed by a back-to-back at home before embarking on a five-game trek.</p>
<p>Irving admits he’s still finding his rhythm, and that he can’t replicate Durant, because no one can.</p>
<p>But that three-game stretch will put even more burden on Harden, who hasn’t looked like his MVP self. He’s a minus-21 in his last 10 games, and admitted after a minus-18 performance against the Cavs that he has to raise his game.</p>

<h1> Aaron Rodgers’ impeccable resume needs legacy-boosting second ring</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 8:46pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 8:47pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Aaron Rodgers’ greatness is undeniable.</p>
<p>His résumé is impeccable.</p>
<p>There’s probably not enough shelving in his Wisconsin home to fit all the trophies and plaques that illustrate his remarkable feats in 14 seasons as the Packers’ starting quarterback.</p>
<p>But, when it’s all over for the 38-year-old Rodgers, are those the things he wants as the ultimate definition to his legacy?</p>
<p>Rodgers has everything, even a Super Bowl ring.</p>
<p>This is the one blemish on the Rodgers résumé. For all the remarkable things he’s accomplished, he should have more than one Super Bowl ring on one of those trophy shelves.</p>
<p>Peyton Manning, who before Rodgers was the most prolific quarterback ripping apart record books with personal accomplishments, eventually got a second Super Bowl ring when he left Indianapolis for Denver.</p>
<p>Even Eli Manning, whose career statistics are pedestrian compared to those of his brother or Rodgers, won two rings with the Giants thanks to a couple of magically timed hot streaks.</p>
<p>Rodgers, whose Packers (13-4) play the 49ers (11-7) in the NFC divisional round Saturday night at Lambeau Field, needs another ring to elevate his legacy. And, at his age, the window is not opening wider, it’s slowly closing.</p>
<p>“If it was good enough to get us this far, it’s good enough to get us past this point.’’</p>
<p>He has a very good team around him — on both sides of the ball. That puts a lot of pressure on Rodgers, who happens to be 0-3 in the postseason against the 49ers, the team he rooted for as a kid.</p>
<p>Rodgers, who of course isn’t thinking about that, knows it.</p>
<p>Legacy, of course, falls in the latter of those two standpoints.</p>
<p>And Rodgers, for all of his greatness, knows that in order for him to enhance his legacy he has to make one of those <a>personal-accomplishment categories</a> plural — from ring to rings.</p>
<h1> Joe Judge gave the Giants no choice</h1>
<div> January 11, 2022 10:43pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 10:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>There was nothing that Joe Judge should have been able to say when he stated his case to convince Giants ownership to keep his job.</p>
<p>If John Mara and Steve Tisch had saddled their next general manager with Judge, they would have indeed exposed the Giants as a clown show organization.</p>
<p>Hallelujah! Heavens to Wellington Mara!</p>
<p>They got this one right.</p>
<p>Judge had to go, case closed.</p>
<p>Judge appeared to be steaming toward the end zone when he fumbled his opportunity at the goal line, and Mara and Tisch recovered.</p>
<p>Giants fans will now keep their fingers crossed that Mara and Tisch can do a better job this time identifying their next general manager than they’ve done with their three head-coaching hires since Tom Coughlin left the building.</p>
<p>Bills assistant GM Joe Schoen, batting leadoff on Wednesday morning from the not-so-short GM list drawn up by ownership, won’t have to worry about getting to know Judge and trying to discern whether Judge was his cup of tea.</p>
<p>Now the owners need to step out of the way so the new GM can recommend <a>the right head coach</a> — his head coach. Who can attract an offensive coordinator who won’t have to worry about a lame-duck Judge.</p>
<p>Mara’s eyes told him all he needed to know when Judge, at the end of his six-game losing streak, ran back-to-back quarterback sneaks from the shadow of his goal line with Jake Fromm.</p>
<p>This was no Coughlin, no Bill Parcells. Just another wannabe.</p>
<p>Mara and Tisch were as smitten with Judge during their interview with him as Joe DiMaggio was with Marilyn Monroe once upon a Hollywood time.</p>
<p>He commanded a room the way Coughlin did, the way Parcells did.</p>
<p>In fairness, Judge inherited a mess and navigated his way as a rookie head coach expertly through the beginnings of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But Mara himself believed that it was finally time to win after Kenny Golladay ($72 million) was signed and Kadarius Toney drafted to help Daniel Jones get over the hump.</p>
<p>Now? The new GM might want his own quarterback to compete with Jones, and that would be a good thing as long as he picks the right quarterback.</p>
<p><a>Judge presided over a regression and a collapse</a> during which his explanations became laughable and delusional, punctuated by that 11-minute postgame rant unbecoming a Giants head coach.</p>
<p>Remember too that Judge was aligned with Dave Gettleman in trusting that his young offensive linemen would jell this season.</p>
<p>And no one held him at gunpoint and ordered him to sign Mike Glennon as backup quarterback.</p>
<p>Judge fired offensive line coach Marc Colombo in the middle of the 2020 season and could never find the right O-line coach, or coaches, this season.</p>
<p>He talked a much better game than he coached.</p>
<p>He talked tough but could not walk the talk.</p>
<p>There was no way he was going to save his job by telling the owners what he volunteered in his unbecoming 11-minute rant in Chicago: “I know we got the right culture in terms of teaching the players.”</p>
<p>Whatever he was teaching the players, it was sinking in on every day except game day?</p>
<p>Remember when he vowed to hire a staff of teachers who would explain how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?</p>
<p>You know that Mara did his locker-room homework this time as well. Believe what players say publicly about their head coach at your own peril.</p>
<p>“I know we’re a whole lot closer where we’re going than further away,” Judge had said.</p>
<p>What was it Mara always used to say? He needed to see the arrow pointing up at the end of the season, right?</p>
<p>Let’s not expect The Next George Young or The Next Parcells or The Next Coughlin. Hope, however, for a Black Tuesday a long, long time from now.</p>

<p>So once again, the fan base is at wit’s end, sick and tired of being sick and tired, as sick and tired of being sick and tired as Mets fans were during too much of the Wilpon Era.</p>
<p>His once-proud franchise has fallen and it can’t get up.</p>
<p>And he is the reason it has fallen.</p>
<p>Another mea culpa, an acknowledgment that he has never been more embarrassed over the plight of his Giants, won’t stop the angry emails that are coming at him again, won’t soothe the savage beast inside the Giants fan. Nor should it.</p>
<a>without a general manager</a> or a head coach, the presence of his brother Chris and nephew Tim inside 1925 Giants Drive a source of contention for many who choose to hold them somewhat accountable for the failure of The Mara Way.
<p>You wonder how Mara can walk past the four Lombardi Trophies inside the glass case in the lobby without a yen to go watch “The Way We Were.”</p>
<p>“We’re gonna get it right this time,” Mara vowed.</p>
<p>Now there is a promise certain to fall on deaf ears if there ever was one … unless there are Giants fans who cling desperately to the hope that the law of averages will save him, and them.</p>
<p>No one knows better than the Giants fan — well, maybe the Jets fan, maybe the Lions fan — that there are no guarantees Mara will get it right this time.</p>
<p>More than ever, now that he recognized and acknowledged he finally had to blow it up, the message is a simple one:</p>
<p>Don’t just tell us, John.</p>
<p>He has talked about losing credibility with the fans so often since Coughlin left that Giants fans view him as Wellington’s Boy Who Cries Wolf.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna have to earn their trust again,” Mara said.</p>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell won’t be playing the part of Pete Rozelle delivering any George Young facsimile, not that there is one, to the Giants.</p>
<p>This will be Mara’s baby.</p>
<p>“I feel very good about the group of candidates for the general manager position that we have scheduled right now,” he said. “I think any one of a number of them would make an excellent general manager.”</p>
<p>“I am confident that we have the resources to make the right choice here,” Mara said.</p>
<p>The reset button has been hit.</p>
<p>Giants fans will be praying for a Maracle in the Meadowlands.</p>
<p>So just don’t tell us, John.</p>
<h1> NFL playoff predictions from Wild Card Round through Super Bowl 2022</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 3:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 12:58am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Fourteen teams. One dream. </p>
<p>One more chance for Tom Brady to repeat for the second time and hoist his eighth Lombardi Trophy. </p>
<p>One matchup in Super Bowl LVI above all others that would break the internet: Brady versus Bill Belichick. </p>
<p>One GOAT versus another GOAT. </p>
<p>One Crystal Ball that can see what it sees as only it can see. </p>
<p>The Post’s Steve Serby breaks down the postseason: </p>
<h2>SUPER WILD CARD ROUND </h2>
<h2>Las Vegas Raiders (5) at Cincinnati Bengals (4) </h2>
<p>Prediction: Bengals 27, Raiders 20. Burrow lights up the postgame cigar and leads the dancing to Get the Gat, following the franchise’s first playoff win in 31 years. </p>
<h2>New England Patriots (6) at Buffalo Bills (3) </h2>
<p>Sean McDermott has made it clear he didn’t take the Bills job to kiss Bill Belichick’s rings. Temperatures for this cold-blooded grudge rubber match will be hovering near zero at kickoff. Chill Belichick says brrrrrring it on! </p>
<a>Pats offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels</a> tries the Kendrick Bourne-to-Nelson Agholor trickeration that resulted in a 25-yard Week 7 TD against the Jets, but Micah Hyde isn’t fooled and intercepts the pass in the end zone. 
<p>Prediction: Bills 26, Patriots 23. No <a>Belichick versus Brady</a> Super Bowl. </p>
<h2>Philadelphia Eagles (7) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2) </h2>
<p>Prediction: Buccaneers 28, Eagles 20. No Philly Special to <a>stun Brady</a> this time. </p>
<h2>San Francisco 49ers (6) at Dallas Cowboys (3) </h2>
<a>make life miserable enough for Jimmy Garoppolo</a> that Trevon Diggs intercepts him twice. 
<p>Prediction: Cowboys 26, 49ers 24. Star Wars, for 60 minutes. </p>
<h2>Pittsburgh Steelers (7) at Kansas City Chiefs (2) </h2>
<p>Prediction: Chiefs 28, Steelers 17. Appearing soon on the ManningCast, Big Ben. </p>
<h2>Arizona Cardinals (5) at Los Angeles Rams (4) </h2>
<p>Prediction: Rams 24, Cardinals 23. DeAndre Hopkins would have made the difference. </p>
<h2>DIVISIONAL ROUND </h2>
<h2>Cincinnati Bengals at Tennessee Titans </h2>
<p>Logan Wilson, meet Derrick Henry. Joe Mixon, meet Jeffery Simmons. <a>Ryan Tannehill </a>plays a clean game, connects with A.J. Brown when he isn’t handing off 30 times to King Henry and keeps Burrow and company off the field. </p>
<p>Prediction: Titans 30, Bengals 24. Mike Vrabel — tough coach, tough team. </p>
<h2>Buffalo Bills at Kansas City Chiefs </h2>
<p>Prediction: Bills 31, Chiefs 27. Cole Beasley is so excited he promises to get vaccinated. </p>
<h2>Los Angeles Rams at Green Bay Packers </h2>
<p>Prediction: Packers 31, Rams 24. Rodgers vows <a>he won’t boycott the NFC Championship game. </a></p>
<h2>Dallas Cowboys at Tampa Bay Buccaneers </h2>
<p>Prediction: Buccaneers 33, Cowboys 27. Brady can smell the Super Bowl. </p>
<h2>AFC CHAMPIONSHIP </h2>
<h2>Buffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans </h2>
<p>Prediction: Bills 27, Titans 23. Better quarterback wins. </p>
<h2>NFC CHAMPIONSHIP </h2>
<h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Green Bay Packers </h2>
<a>hugs Erin Andrews anyway.</a>) A bare-chested Antonio Brown spends the first half holding up a deflated football for Brady to see before leaving Lambeau with frostbite. 
<p>Prediction: Buccaneers 27, Packers 24. Brady tells Andrews he will play until he’s 70. </p>
<h2>Buffalo Bills vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers </h2>
<p>Prediction: Buccaneers 30, Bills 21. Sixteen years after he became the last Super Bowl quarterback to repeat, Brady does it again. </p>

<div> January 14, 2022 7:03pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 7:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A hostile stadium spewing venom at him, at his team, never bothered Bill Belichick, and it didn’t matter which team was waiting in ambush for the Patriots over the course of two decades. </p>
<p>He has a rookie quarterback, Mac Jones. </p>
<p>The Bills have Josh Allen. </p>
<p>Brady will be in Tampa either studying the playbook for his wild-card game against the Eagles or stealing glances at his old coach bundled up in his hoodie on television … or both. </p>
<p>The Bills, their manhood and pride challenged, intercepted Jones twice and returned the favor in Week 16 at New England. </p>
<p>Which sets up The Thrilla in Orchard Park. </p>
<p>The heavyweight slugfest of the Super Wild Card Round. </p>
<p>Sixty minutes — or more — of bone-crunching mayhem and take-no-prisoners brutality in the center of the ring. </p>
<p>Now understand what this means to each side: </p>
<p>Not only did Belichick miss the playoffs last year in his first season without Brady, but then he had to watch Brady beat him to a seventh Lombardi Trophy by winning the Super Bowl at home in Tampa with Bruce Arians. </p>
<p>So Belichick the general manager spent $159.6 million in guaranteed money at the whirlwind start of free agency to give Belichick the head coach enough to be dangerous again. </p>
<p>Now try to put yourself in the shoes of Bills fans: </p>
<p>The Bills, with Marv Levy as head coach and Jim Kelly at quarterback, lost four consecutive Super Bowls from 1991-94. While Belichick and Brady were fronting their six-ring dynasty, Bills fans could only dream about winning their first. </p>
<p>Sean McDermott and Brandon Beane have built a power that was 60 minutes from Super Bowl LV and defends Highmark Stadium now as back-to-back AFC East champs. </p>
<p>Allen has a 60.8 completion percentage in four playoff games with five touchdowns and one interception, and 237 rushing yards and another TD. “He’s hard to defend,” Belichick said. </p>
<p>Allen is 2-2 in the postseason. Brady was 30-11 with Belichick. </p>
<p>Jones is 0-0. And he will be greeted by the NFL’s No. 1 defense. </p>
<p>“You have to realize that there’s not a lot of room for error,” Jones said. “That’s kind of what makes it fun.” </p>
<h1> Bills exorcise decades of demons against Bill Belichick, Patriots</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 2:15am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 2:15am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Their devil wore a hoodie and a mask, and you don’t cancel an exorcism because of the threat of frostbite when you believe you and the team you love can unite as one to make life hell for Bill Belichick.</p>
<p>Especially after all those years when he made life hell for you and your team.</p>
<p>“In terms of like a hated, there is not a love lost with Bills fans and the Patriots, just to have been under their thumb for so long,” Bills Mafia cofounder Del Reid said.</p>
<p>“So we walked out of that stadium, and I said, ‘I hate the Patriots,’ ” Reid said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Second-worst loss in the Belichick Era.</p>
<p>There will be no Belichick versus Tom Brady Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“We just couldn’t keep up with them tonight,” a somber Belichick said.</p>
<p>The famous Anchor Bar in Buffalo, known for its chicken wings, could have been serving GOAT wings following this game.</p>
<p>Belichick was standing in his way, standing in his team’s way, standing in all of Buffalo’s way with the franchise’s elusive first Super Bowl victory clear In the distance.</p>
<p>Buffalo, all of western New York, had waited for so long their next Jim Kelly, and they have him now.</p>
<p>When Allen wasn’t putting his hands inside the comfort of his white pouch in between plays, he was putting Belichick inside there as well.</p>
<p>Asked about Allen, Belichick said: “I said we couldn’t keep up with them. They were great tonight.”</p>
<p>When Allen hit Gabriel Davis with a 19-yard TD pass early in the fourth quarter, it meant: six drives, six TDs.</p>
<p>And then, showing Belichick no mercy, giving him a taste of his own old medicine, a 1-yard flip on a tackle eligible to Tommy Doyle meant: an unprecedented seven drives, seven TDs.</p>
<p>“They deserved to win,” Belichick said.</p>
<p>“We were ready to play,” Allen said.</p>
<p>It was asking too much even of a precocious rookie quarterback like Mac Jones (two TDs, two INTs) to deal with this bunch and this night.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to feel sorry about,” Jones said. “It’s just a learning experience to get better for next year.”</p>
<p>Allen and the Bills delivered a loud, emphatic message heard ’round the NFL, and especially in Foxborough: We are the champions of the AFC East, last year and this year. Not Bill Belichick and the Patriots. Us. The Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p>“These are the best fans in the world,” Allen said. “They deserve it.”</p>

<p>Run CMC’s show could be going on the road.</p>
<p>McCaffrey has $44 million remaining on the record-breaking four-year contract that made him the highest-paid running back in NFL history. However, his promising career has been derailed by injuries since signing the deal. </p>
<a>season-ending ankle injury</a> in his November return.
<p>The running back was drafted by the Panther in 2017 as the No. 8 overall pick. Between 2017 and 2019, he scored 39 touchdowns and led the league in yards from scrimmage with 5,443. </p>
<p>When healthy this season, he was averaging 112.1 yards from scrimmage in his seven games this season. </p>
<p>The Panthers are entering their final game of their disappointing 2021 campaign at 5-11 and will face the Buccaneers on Sunday. </p>
<p>Next season, if they retain McCaffrey, keeping him healthy and <a>finding a new franchise quarterback</a> will be their top priorities. </p>
<h1> Panthers planning to stick with Matt Rhule for third season</h1>
<div> January 8, 2022 3:58pm </div>
<p>It still is unclear if the Giants will stick with Joe Judge, but the Panthers are giving Judge’s old competition a longer leash.</p>
<p>Matt Rhule will get what Judge wants — a third season — with the Panthers, ESPN reported Saturday. </p>
<a>embarrassed by the seven-year, $62 million deal </a>he gave Rhule and “Fire Rhule” chants during the most recent Carolina home game.
<a>Athletic report</a>, Panthers players have felt as if Rhule treats them like they’re still in college, and many throughout the game believe he values his Temple and Baylor connections — which fill his roster — too highly.
<p>Still, he will get a third season to show he can turn the team around, while New York awaits to see what the Giants do with Judge.</p>
<a>Matt Nagy is on shaky ground</a> in Chicago, and there are questions whether Denver (Vic Fangio) and Minnesota (Mike Zimmer) will have openings, too.
<h1> Browns vs. Bengals prediction: Cincinnati the pick</h1>
<div> January 9, 2022 9:30am <div> Updated <div> January 9, 2022 5:53am </div> </div> </div>
<p>VSiN’s NFL expert offers a couple of selections for the final Sunday of the 2021 regular season.</p>
<h2>Cincinnati Bengals at Cleveland Browns (-6, 37.5): </h2>
<p>All of the talk is about who isn’t playing for the Bengals, but the Browns have zero incentive to play banged-up guys such as Nick Chubb, Myles Garrett and Denzel Ward, among others. </p>
<h2>Carolina Panthers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-8.5, 41.5): </h2>
<h1> Sam Darnold ‘will be back’ with Panthers after strange season</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 5:07pm </div>
<p>The Panthers do not view Sam Darnold as the problem.</p>
<p>Darnold “will be back” in Carolina next season, general manager Scott Fitterer said Monday, not yet committing to the former Jet as the franchise quarterback, but saying he is open to the label. </p>
<p>“When we protect him and he gets the ball out quick,” Fitterer told reporters, “he looks like a good NFL quarterback.”</p>
<p>Darnold, who was flipped for three draft picks last April after three seasons, in which the Jets were not sure if he was The Guy, again was perplexing with the Panthers. </p>
<p>In all, Darnold’s 71.9 quarterback rating was the second-worst among the qualified in the NFL — besting only the quarterback who replaced him with the Jets, Zach Wilson.</p>
<p>“He had a lot of leakage. He had a lot of pressure in his face. And it’s tough to play the position no matter who you are if there’s pressure in your face.” </p>
<p>Darnold is the only quarterback under contract for the Panthers, who guaranteed his $18.9 million option for next season upon trading for him. It would be difficult for the team to offload him at this point.</p>
<p>Fitterer said they are open to adding more quarterback competition, so he would not guarantee Darnold has the job. But he will have a roster spot.</p>
<p>“He’s still developing,” Fitterer said. “He’s still a young quarterback.”</p>

<h1> Russell Westbrook answers Magic Johnson’s rip of Lakers: ‘Not here every day’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 10:51am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 10:52am </div> </div> </div>
<p>“We as Lakers fans can accept being outplayed, but we deserve more than a lack of effort and no sense of urgency,” Johnson tweeted. “Owner Jeanie Buss, you deserve better.”</p>
<p>The loss was the second-biggest defeat of LeBron James’ career. James didn’t speak to reporters after the game. But Russell Westbrook was asked about the Lakers legend’s comments.</p>
<p>Dwight Howard told reporters it was telling that Johnson criticized the team online and not in person. </p>
<p>The message, though, was one the Lakers struggled to argue with.</p>
<p>“We just got to play hard,” Westbrook said. “Sometimes the schemes and how you play doesn’t really matter. You got to play hard sometimes. Teams are playing harder than us, simple as that.”</p>
<p>It’s the second time this year Johnson has gone after the Lakers on social media.</p>
<p>Back in October, he tweeted, “The @Lakers have team issue and a basketball issue,” after the team got off to an 0-2 start.</p>
<p>Things haven’t gotten much better since then. At 21-22, the Lakers are below .500, and after that loss, they don’t look close to figuring things out.</p>

<h1> LeBron James tweets apology to Lakers fans after Magic Johnson rips team</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 2:19pm </div>
<p>Magic Johnson said the Lakers’ fans “deserve more.” LeBron James wholeheartedly agrees. </p>
<p>As the Lakers cling to a tenuous playoff spot after three straight losses — including the second-most lopsided of James’ career — the 37-year-old took a moment to tell the fanbase that better things are ahead.</p>
<p>“LakerNation I apologize and I promise we’ll be better!” James tweeted Sunday night after a demoralizing destruction in Denver, 133-96, a night prior.</p>
<p>The defeat dropped the Lakers to 21-22 — for context, the Knicks have been stronger for the season’s first half — and in eighth place in the West. </p>
<p>Anthony Davis has been out for more than a month with a sprained MCL and likely will miss a few more weeks. James has been typically great but sometimes not enough, and Russell Westbrook is shooting 29 percent from 3. </p>
<p>Saturday’s collapse led to some harsh criticism from the team’s former superstar and former team president.</p>
<p>The critique from a legend who essentially chose being Magic Johnson over being Lakers president appeared to go down differently in parts of the Lakers locker room. James publicly is absorbing the arrows and pledging the team will improve.</p>
<p>Westbrook, who did not overlap with Johnson in Los Angeles, wants the world to know that Johnson is not around the team and knows little about the effort level. </p>
<a>told reporters</a> Saturday. “Everybody is entitled, in this world, to their opinion. Regardless of what that it is. You can either take it and run with it or you can take it and put it in one ear and out the other or you cannot respond to it.
