<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> After conquering Hollywood, Singaporean rapper Masia One now speaks up against sexual abuse </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> After conquering Hollywood, Singaporean rapper Masia One now speaks up against sexual abuse </h1>
<div> <p>When she first entered the music scene, she was an Asian woman in a Western country. Against the odds, Masia One made a name for herself in Hollywood. Now she wants to bring difficult conversations to the fore.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hidayah Salamat </a> </div> </div>
<p>Masia One is one of Canada’s first Asian female rappers. She’s worked with Dr Dre and Pharrell, and had her vocals featured on the theme song of Fast Furious 8. She’s performed in more than 25 countries. </p>
<p>But in Singapore, where she was born and where she first discovered hip-hop, she remains largely under-the-radar.</p>
<p>Masia, whose real name is Maysian Lim, was still in primary school when she wandered around a market in Bedok, wondering what to buy with the Chinese New Year hong bao money in her pocket. </p>
<p>She found a shop selling cassette tapes and for some reason decided on an album by popular – and at the time, controversial – US rap group Public Enemy. </p>
<p>“When I put the tape in, I didn’t understand the political messages but I remember thinking, ‘Wow, I’ve never heard anything like this before’. </p>
<p>When she was eight, Masia’s father got a job opportunity in Canada and moved the family there. </p>
<p>While migrating to another country as a child was admittedly “easier for a kid”, “it was definitely very different”, said the 39-year-old.</p>
<p>At the time, her family was the only Asian one in the neighbourhood. </p>
<p>“No one could pronounce my real name (mei-sian),” she said. “And we were seen as the immigrant family, we were the minorities. I definitely experienced a lot of prejudice and racism.</p>
<p>“But there’s a flipside – when you feel alienated you can either crawl into your shell or you start becoming creative because all you have is your imagination. As a kid, I would make up languages and songs in my head, make up my own universe. </p>
<p>“I think that was what inspired me to always be creating.”</p>
<p>It was a female breakdancer that inspired Masia’s stage name.</p>
<p>“And I thought, ‘Maybe I will!'” </p>
<p>She started drawing graffiti and wrote “Masia One” whenever she did. But it was only after graduating from the University of Toronto that she finally assumed the persona of Masia One, the rapper. </p>
<p>“I was either going to be an architect or a rapper. I thought about it and ... there were already a lot of female Asian architects so perhaps I’d be a rapper and fill that gap and be that representation.</p>
<p>“You can imagine the conversation I had with my Singaporean parents. I told them, ‘Here is my architecture degree, I’m going to go be a rapper now’,” she said. </p>
<p>Soon, Masia was working with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Grammy-winning producer Che Vicious, Wu-tang Clan’s frontman The RZA, Pharrell and Dr Dre. </p>
<p>Masia credited her success to a daily songwriting practice, going with the flow and the ancient Chinese philosophy of I-Ching, which taught her the value of patience. </p>
<p>Applying these was what got Warriors Tongue, a song she wrote during an audition for Che Vicious’ record label, featured on the Fast And Furious 8 soundtrack.</p>
<p>“I was so proud of it ... but when we took it to the labels, they were like ‘nah, this is terrible’. So the song sat on the shelf – no one believed in it,” she said.</p>
<p>But Masia did, and for eight years she put the song out to be remixed. </p>
<p>“I think there are like 16 official remixes for that song and each of them got placed in Netflix shows and TV shows, and one finally became a trailer song for Fast And Furious 8.”</p>
<p>Masia returned to Singapore in 2014, excited to contribute to what she felt was a burgeoning music scene. It was the “biggest shock” to her that not only did no one know who she was, no one understood her.</p>
<p>“There I was thinking I was this Singapore girl that did all these things and sat with famous people … coming back to Singapore where the scene was growing, the music industry was growing… </p>
<p>“And when I came back it was actually very difficult because no one knew who I was. They were kind of almost suspicious of me, like ‘if you’re big somewhere how come I’ve never heard of you?’” she said.</p>
<p>She added: “I had a New York way of doing business. There, you’ll have someone calling you and saying ‘Yo, you want this shit? If you don’t then we’re gone.’ It’s very harsh and very in-your-face.</p>
<p>“But in Southeast Asia, there are all these manners. You have to go to luncheons and dinners before you can make connections happen. No one knew my name or my brand or what I believed myself capable to do,” she said. </p>
<p>At the time of her return, Masia was dabbling in reggae as well, and struggled to get people interested in the genre. </p>
<p>“This is all part of going with the flow … you see what works and then you really make the push. I’m not going to fight the culture – it’s been here longer than me.”</p>
<p>SPEAKING UP ON SEXUAL ABUSE</p>
<p>Masia lives in Kuala Lumpur now, having moved during the COVID-19 pandemic when her fiance was offered a job there. </p>
<p>At this stage of her life, the focus of Masia’s work has shifted, from breaking Asian stereotypes to empowering women, particularly in the realm of sexual abuse. </p>
<p>She told us about a tour a few years ago that went awry after a headlining artiste allegedly sexually assaulted a member of her team.</p>
<p>Masia pulled herself off the tour and took her friend home, “back to where she could feel more secure”.</p>
<p>The backlash from the creative community after her pull-out was eye-opening, but what stunned her the most was just how many people told her to “sweep it under the carpet”. </p>
<p>“I thought, ‘No, something terrible has happened here and if we don’t feel comfortable enough as a community to call it out then these things are just going to keep happening.</p>
<p>Masia said she did some research about the nature of sexual abuse in the music industry in the region, including speaking to women who had similar stories to share.</p>
<p>“They’re part of labels we know, very prominent labels here in Southeast Asia and they experienced sexual abuse as well,” she said.</p>
<p>The incident also forced her to do some “soul-searching”. </p>
<p>“I have definitely been in many situations where there was sexual harassment, where there was strange behaviour, and I reflected on those times. If I maybe had had a slightly different personality, something could’ve happened to me,” she said. </p>
<p>So, instead of staying silent, Masia did the complete opposite. </p>
<p>In December last year, Masia and fellow artiste Elaine Lim, also known as General Ling, created the song Not All That Glitters Is Gold, which is about how the industry is “not always about shine, and lights … a lot happens behind the scenes”. </p>
<p>Predictably, the song didn’t receive much support, she said. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> These people are thinking: ‘I can control the narrative because you have no voice. I can make you famous ... so I’m going to put you in a compromising situation or harass you. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>To promote the song, the musicians went down another route, partnering with advocacy groups and conducting Rooms on the audio app Clubhouse – which was booming at the time – where creatives could share their stories. </p>
<p>These conversations led to a remix of the song featuring 11 women from around the world singing their story in multiple languages. </p>
<p>After suffering several “knockdowns” in life, including a cancer scare that turned out to be fibroids, Masia said she has also learned to slow down – a concept she now preaches to women in her art. </p>
<p>“The younger version of me would look at self-help like it was all hippie nonsense and soft,” she said, adding that she now understood “it goes deeper than an inspirational meme”.</p>
<p>“Where my mantra used to be ‘hustle is my art’, now I call myself ‘the holistic hustler’.”</p>
<p>This month, Masia released Go Girl Go Get It, a single she describes as a “hip hop affirmation”. </p>
<p>“I told myself that this happened to my health because I had not been very balanced. And so I accepted all these things (self-help). In fact, I did them extra,” said Masia. </p>
<p>Moving forward, Masia hopes that more people will embrace advocacy in their work. </p>
<p>“Find the people that do resonate with you. Sometimes, it’s not the person next door but someone across the world. Find that and grow that tribe until you have a voice around it."</p>

<h1> South Korea to impose 10-day quarantine on all travellers regardless of vaccination status </h1>
<div> <p>Short-term visitors to South Korea will have to serve the 10-day quarantine at a temporary facility designated by the government.</p> </div>
<p>SEOUL: All travellers to South Korea, including citizens and foreigners, will have to quarantine for 10 days on arrival regardless of their vaccination status, said the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) on Wednesday (Dec 1). </p>
<p>The new rule will start on Friday and lasts two weeks, said the agency. </p>
<p>South Korean citizens and foreigners on long-term stay will be allowed to quarantine at home while foreigners on short-term stay will have to be quarantined at a temporary facility designated by the government, reported <a>Yonhap news agency</a>.</p>
<p>All overseas travellers coming into South Korea will also be tested for the Omicron COVID-19 variant. </p>
<p>This comes as South Korea on Wednesday reported five cases of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>A fully vaccinated couple tested positive for the variant after arriving last week from Nigeria, followed by two of their family members and a friend, according to the KCDA.</p>
<p>Singapore and South Korea launched <a>vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs)</a> between both countries on Nov 15. </p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Thursday, the Singapore Embassy in Seoul said it is checking with South Korean authorities on how travellers using the VTL will be affected. </p>
<p>"We will post updates when we receive them," said the embassy. </p>
<p>Singapore Airlines operates six VTL flights from Singapore to Seoul every week - once a day from Tuesdays to Sundays. Korean Air operates four VTL flights from Singapore to Seoul every week.</p>

<h1> Does running ruin the knees? How to save your joints without giving up your workout </h1>
<div> <p>There's no magic bullet to knee health, but staying active and building muscles around the joint are crucial. </p> </div>
<p>In the annals of unsolicited advice, few nuggets have been dispensed as widely and with less supporting evidence than this: “If you keep doing all that running, you’re going to ruin your knees.”</p>
<a>nearly half</a> of Americans are expected to develop painful knee osteoarthritis at some point during their lives, the findings do raise a nagging question: If abstaining from running won’t magically protect your knees, what will?
<a>small study from 2010</a>, non-runners who followed a 10-week running program saw a 1.9 per cent improvement in a marker of cartilage strength and quality.
<p>BEWARE THE WEEKEND WARRIOR EFFECT</p>
<a>largely explained</a> by a history of traumatic knee injury rather than by accumulated wear and tear.
<p>OPTIMISE YOUR MOVEMENT PATTERNS</p>
<p>DON’T SEEK SALVATION IN A BOTTLE</p>
<p>There’s no high-quality evidence that supplements, including glucosamine and chondroitin, make any difference, according to both Dr Roos and Dr Whittaker – though they don’t appear to be harmful either.</p>
<p>“If you’re OK paying for it, and you want to take it because you think it’s doing something to preserve your joint, not a problem,” Dr Whittaker said. “But in addition, can you please also be doing some cyclical weight-bearing activity and so on?”</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Style Beauty </a> </p> <h5> Fashion legend Virgil Abloh: The man who brought the street to the catwalk </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Fashion legend Virgil Abloh: The man who brought the street to the catwalk </h1>
<p>His partnership with Kanye West catapulted Abloh from the skate and DJ culture of Chicago to the heights of the fashion world, first with his own red-hot label Off-White, and then to the apex of the traditional luxury industry in Paris.</p>
<p>Virgil Abloh reimagined the profile of a fashion designer, merging streetwear, music and high fashion, and shattering glass ceilings as the first black creative director at Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>Abloh died on Sunday (Nov 28) at the age of 41, with few aware that he had been battling a rare form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma, since 2019.</p>
<p>His cancer diagnosis came just a year after he was appointed as head of menswear for Louis Vuitton, becoming the first black person to take an artistic director role at a top French fashion house.</p>
<p>That did not stop him maintaining a gruelling schedule as he remoulded the label in his image, merging streetwear, social media and celebrity – while also moonlighting as a DJ and a furniture designer for IKEA.</p>
<p>"Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself," he was often quoted as saying, as he pulled in the influences from his youth to breathe new life into the catwalk.</p>
<p>Abloh, the son of Ghanaian immigrants, studied architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, but his career took a surprising turn after his design ideas caught the attention of West, who hired him as his creative director in 2007.</p>
<p>The pair were determined to revamp the world of high fashion, and even took on an internship together at Fendi in Rome in 2009 in their bid to learn the business.</p>
<p>Abloh started his first clothing label, Pyrex Vision, in 2012.</p>
<p>"I didn't make a conscious decision one day that I wanted to be a designer," he told GQ. "I made Pyrex, which in my mind was more like an art piece... and I needed clothing to support this idea."</p>
<p>Pyrex quickly morphed into Off-White, which took the fashion world by storm by by mixing urban style with high-end tailoring.</p>
<p>Its trademark diagonal stripes were combined with ironic messaging – often putting fashion terms in quotation marks on his clothing.</p>
<p>It all added to Abloh's youth appeal, as did his early embrace of Instagram (he had 6.5 million followers at the time of his passing).</p>
<p>His 2017 collaboration with Nike became "the Official Sneaker of Celebrities Everywhere" in the words of GQ, and many more tie-ups followed, running the gamut from Jimmy Choo and Moncler to even McDonald's.</p>
<p>With the old fashion houses desperate to attract younger buyers, Abloh was the obvious candidate to replace Kim Jones – himself a pioneer of luxury streetwear – when he left Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>The reactions to his death reflect the fact that Abloh seemed to have only just arrived and had much more to offer.</p>
<p>"We are all shocked by this terrible news," said Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH, the group that owns Louis Vuitton and had taken a majority stake in Off-White this year, in a statement.</p>
<p>"Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, but also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom," he added.</p>
<p>Abloh looked set to offer a powerful voice for change in the fashion world, vowing "to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and foster greater equity and inclusion in the industries we serve".</p>
<p>His first show for Louis Vuitton in March 2018 with models from around the world strutting down a rainbow runway.</p>
<p>Abloh faced some backlash in 2020 when he voiced anger over the rioting that accompanied protests over the murder of George Floyd in the US.</p>
<p>But that did little to dent his status as a ground-breaking figure.</p>
<p>"RIP VIRGIL ABLOH. No one will forget the impact you had. God bless you my friend," tweeted the French football star Kylian Mbappe.</p>
<p>Actor Riz Ahmed tweeted: "Gone too soon but your legacy lives on. Stretched culture and changed the game. Thank you for all you did to support so many how you pushed us to reimagine what's possible."</p>

<h1> Chris Noth dropped from TV series The Equalizer amid sex assault claims </h1>
<div> <p>Two women accused the actor of sexual assault in a story reported last week by The Hollywood Reporter. He has denied the allegations, which date back to 2004 and 2015.</p> </div>
<p>Chris Noth will no longer be part of the CBS series The Equalizer in the wake of sexual assault allegations against the actor.</p>
<p>Universal Television and CBS made a joint announcement on Monday (Dec 20) that Noth would no longer be part of filming "effective immediately".</p>
<p>Noth has played a former CIA director on The Equalizer, which stars Queen Latifah. Noth will appear in at least one upcoming episode.</p>
<p>Noth's representatives had no immediate comment on The Equalizer decision.</p>
<p>Two women accused Noth of sexual assault in a story reported last week by The Hollywood Reporter. Noth vehemently denied the allegations, which date back to 2004 and 2015.</p>
<p>One of the women who accused Noth of assaulting her said his reprisal of his Mr Big character on the Sex And The City sequel And Just Like That… prompted her to speak out about the actor.</p>
<p>Noth's demise in the first episode of the show led to widespread attention. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Friendships are fraying because of COVID-19 restrictions </h1>
<div> <p>Research shows that friendship networks have shrunk especially during pandemic lockdowns. An Australian sociologist advises on not only how we should reconnect, but who we should reconnect with.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Roger Patulny </a> </div> </div>
<p>WOLLONGONG, Australia: As we resume our social lives after strict COVID restrictions have lifted, many of us are finding it’s time to take stock of our friendships.</p>
<p>Recent research I’ve been involved in found friendship networks were shrinking in Australia during COVID lockdowns.</p>
<p>Some people pruned their networks, focusing on only the most important family and friends. Others lost friends through reduced recreational and community activities, falling out of the habit of socialising, and shifting to more digital interaction.</p>
<p>As we start to re-engage, the obvious question is – how do we get our old friends back?</p>
<p>We might also ask ourselves – which friends do we want back?</p>
<h2>WHICH FRIENDS DO WE WANT?</h2>
<p>There’s no one answer here – different people want different things from friends.</p>
<p>Data I have calculated from the 2015-16 Australian Social Attitudes Survey show the main form of support received from close friends in Australia is:</p>
<ul><li>Primarily, having a confidant who provides emotional support</li> <li>Followed by fun and good times</li> <li>And then, favours and advice of various kinds.</li> </ul>
<p>These results vary by background and life stage.</p>
<p>Women are much more likely to have a confidant who provides emotional support as their closest friend. Men are more likely to have friends who provide fun, good times, favours and advice – or else no regular support at all.</p>
<p>Younger people are more likely to have a confidant, emotional support, fun and good times. Older people, aged over 56, are slightly more likely to receive favours and advice, and are much more likely to lack a close supportive friend.</p>
<p>These results are indicative of what different people get from close friendships, but may not represent what they want or need.</p>
<p>The close confidants women report as friends may well alleviate emotional loneliness, which is defined as the absence of close attachment to others who provide strong emotional support.</p>
<p>However, it may still leave them with social loneliness, or the feeling of lacking quality, companionable connections with friends.</p>
<p>Conversely, male camaraderie built around fun, activities and mutual favours may alleviate social but not emotional loneliness.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests emotional loneliness has a stronger negative impact on well-being than social loneliness, so it’s important for everyone to have someone to talk to for emotional support.</p>
<p>We still need a variety of approaches and goals to suit different friendship needs nonetheless.</p>
<h2>BEATING SOCIAL LONELINESS</h2>
<p>The first way to reduce social loneliness is to reach out to those we already know, now that we can.</p>
<p>We can message old friends, organise get-togethers, or start new conversations and activities with everyday contacts including colleagues, fellow students, regulars at the local club or cafe, or neighbours.</p>
<p>That said, reconnecting may now be impossible or undesirable for several reasons. These can include physical distance, changed life circumstances, different interests, intractable arguments, or a masculine aversion to initiating contact.</p>
<p>Some people may benefit from joining support groups designed for people subject to stigma based on identity or life events, such as LGBTQI or health recovery groups.</p>
<p>Some groups help deal with the stigma of feeling lonely. This includes shared activity groups where people talk “shoulder to shoulder” rather than face to face, such as Men’s Sheds.</p>
<p>Groups focused on education, shared discussion, or exercise are particularly good for friendship and alleviating loneliness among older people.</p>
<p>While online options abound for connecting, it’s important to avoid activities which increase loneliness, such as passive scrolling, unsolicited broadcasting, or escapist substituting of digital communities for physical ones.</p>
<p>Interactive online contact and online groups that help us organise in-person catch ups (such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Meetup) are more effective.</p>
<h2>MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>To beat emotional loneliness, the focus should be on deepening existing relationships.</p>
<p>It’s essential to spend high quality, meaningful time with a few good quality friends (or even one).</p>
<p>It might mean repairing damage, and apologising in a considered and respectful manner if you did or said something wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes it just requires the effort of checking in more regularly. Organisations like RUOK provide sensitive, step-by-step suggestions on how to do this.</p>
<p>Some people may also need help from a professional psychologist, counsellor, or support group to process increased social anxiety, particularly after COVID lockdown.</p>
<p>Such support can reduce emotional loneliness by helping us process social situations more positively and be more realistic (and less anxious) about our friendship options.</p>
<h2>ENDING TOXIC FRIENDSHIPS</h2>
<p>In reflecting on our friendships, we may decide to end any that have become particularly toxic.</p>
<p>Where possible, we should be kind, explain this, and avoid ghosting, as this can be highly traumatic to those who are ghosted and de-sensitise us to others’ feelings if we do it regularly.</p>
<p>Before doing so, we should be careful we don’t just need a break to rebuild energy and habits of interactions.</p>
<p>We should be especially careful with ending long-term friendships. Quality relationships take time, shared history, and involve natural ups and downs – especially in a pandemic. We should look to renegotiate rather than end them wherever possible.</p>
<p>Take time, and seek counselling or another friend’s advice. Since listening is key to friendship, maybe ask yourself – have you heard everything they’re trying to say?</p>

<h1> Tom Holland and Zendaya were warned by Spider-Man producer not to date in real life </h1>
<div> <p>Spider-Man producer Amy Pascal revealed that she spoke with each star separately to discourage them from having a romantic relationship in real life. “And they all ignored me,” she said.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Richa Liz Mathew </a> </div> </div>
<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home stars Tom Holland and Zendaya have stolen the hearts of many as one of the cutest couples in Hollywood both on- and off screen. </p>
<p>It turned out, though, that they were warned not to fall in love with each other in real life by their producer, Amy Pascal. </p>
<p>Pascal revealed in an interview with the New York Times on Friday, Dec 17 that she had spoken to both actors separately about this at the start of the working relationship. </p>
<p>"I took Tom and Zendaya aside, separately, when we first cast them and gave them a lecture," she said. "Don’t go there – just don’t. Try not to.”</p>
<p>Pascal gave the same advice to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, stars of 2012’s The Amazing Spider-Man and its 2014 sequel. </p>
<p>“It can just complicate things, you know? And they all ignored me." </p>
<p>Holland and Zendaya, both 25, are not the first Spider-Man stars to turn their on-screen romance into reality. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst dated in 2001 while filming the first Spider-Man, and Garfield and Stone dated from 2011 to 2015. </p>
<p>Holland and Zendaya initially denied rumors of a romance but in July this year, they were photographed kissing in a car. </p>
<p>“I’ve always been really adamant to keep my private life private, because I share so much of my life with the world anyway,” he told the publication.</p>

<h1> Attempting to uncover the sweet-sour mystery of what Yakult really tastes like </h1>
<div> <p>Yakult is more than just a cultured milk drink. Its distinctive taste is a self-referential enigma of popular culture, posits CNA Lifestyle's May Seah, who may or may not have too much time on her hands at home.</p> </div>

<p>Much could be said about the challenges of work-from-home life during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), but the upside of it is that you find yourself with a lot more time to reflect, cultivate awareness and ponder the important questions of life. </p>
<p>One of those questions which occurred to me was: What exactly is the flavour of Yakult Original Flavour?</p>
<p>It struck me while I was having a leisurely after-dinner nightcap of the ubiquitous milky drink full of gut-friendly bacteria: Since Yakult comes in grape, apple and orange flavours, what gives Original its distinctive sweet-sour flavour? </p>

<p>Besides being a lactobacillus wonderland, is it meant to resemble a fruit, too, or a blend of fruits, maybe? How would you describe the taste to someone who’s never had it?</p>
<p>A glance at the ingredients list printed on the package yielded “sucrose, dried skim milk, glucose, fructose, flavouring, live L. casei strain Shirota”.</p>
<p>But, don’t take my word for it. I’m not a lactic acid authority. I don’t have a badge or anything.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Tastes like a bunch of bacteria went out for a party and were hung over the next day.</p> </blockquote>
<p>It turned out that many people were interested in Yakult as a discussion topic.</p>
<p>Several folks said the taste of Yakult Original was “yogurty”, “milky” and “sweet”.</p>
<p>One person said it was “a mix of citrus and vanilla”, which I thought was a solid step in a more specific direction.</p>

<p>My friend Andrea, who is a professional coffee judge, suggested “red apple”, which must be right because it is her job to sip beverages and identify their “bouquet”, “aroma”, “nose”, “chin” and “eyebrows”.</p>
<p>But another friend, in a separate conversation, said, “It tastes like green apple to me.”</p>
<p>If I were Yakult Original, sitting in my shrink-wrap package next to Grape, Apple and Orange, I would be having an identity crisis.</p>
<p>It was clearly time to get more clarity and hard-hitting answers. It was time to write to Yakult.</p>
<p>In an email to Yakult Singapore, I asked, “What is the Original Flavour of Yakult? Is it meant to taste like a specific fruit, like the other flavours such as apple, grape and orange?”</p>
<p>The answer that eventually came – and I quote, verbatim – was, “Yakult Original does not taste any specific fruit, it has its own unique refreshing citrus taste”.</p>
<p>This confused me because “citrus” refers to the fruits of citrus trees, which include lemon, lime, orange and grapefruit. Is the drink meant to taste like a unique blend of several citruses, then?</p>
<blockquote> <p>If I were Yakult Original, sitting in my shrink-wrap package next to Grape, Apple and Orange, I would be having an identity crisis.</p> </blockquote>
<p>By now the thing had snowballed out of control, like a socialite who’d had one too many Yakult cocktails.</p>
<p>An entire community had been mobilised to re-examine their previously unchallenged assumptions, namely, “Yakult just tastes like Yakult, lor”.</p>
<p>And so, an alert science-inclined friend finally discovered “the answer” in a 1980 Japanese scientific publication.</p>
<p>Protein and sugar? Erm, like char siew?</p>
<p>Anyway, there we have it. But at this juncture, the answer was no longer as relevant as the question itself. For I was finally able to see what had been eluding me all along.</p>
<p>In the words of my Instagram friend "Prairie Oyster" (probably not his real name): “Perhaps that taste is more of a Platonic ideal that cannot be further reduced, but must be understood for what it is.” </p>
<p>Now, what does Vitagen Original taste like?</p>
