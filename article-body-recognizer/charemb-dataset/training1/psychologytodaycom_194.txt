<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Antisocial personality disorder is a type of chronic mental illness in which a person's way of relating to others is abnormal—and destructive.</li>
<li>Those with narcissistic personality disorder believe they are superior to others and have little regard for other's feelings.</li>
<li>Histrionic means "dramatic or theatrical." These individuals have a strong desire to be noticed, and often behave inappropriately for attention.</li>
<li>People with borderline personality disorder often have trouble regulating emotions, show impulsive behavior, and have unstable relationships.</li>

<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, or the DSM-5, identifies 10 unique
<a>personality disorders</a>—conditions in which people have traits that cause them to feel and behave in socially distressing ways, limiting their ability to function in relationships and in other areas of their life, such as work or school.
<a>Cluster A</a> contains paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal disorders. The categories for
<a>Cluster C</a> are avoidant, dependent, and
<p>In Cluster B, discussed here, the DSM outlines diagnostic criteria for antisocial, <a>narcissistic</a>, histrionic, and borderline personality disorders. Here's what you should know.</p>

<p>Most people who have borderline personality disorder suffer from:</p>
<ul><li>Problems with regulating emotions and thoughts</li> <li>Impulsive and reckless behavior</li> <li>Unstable relationships with other people</li> </ul>
<p>People with this disorder also have high rates of co-occurring disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, <a>substance abuse</a>, and eating disorders, along with <a>self-harm</a>, <a>suicidal</a> behaviors, and completed suicides.</p>
<p>According to data from a subsample of participants in a national survey on mental disorders, about 1.6 percent of adults in the United States have borderline personality disorder in a given year.</p>
<p>Borderline personality disorder is often viewed as difficult to treat. However, recent research shows that borderline personality disorder can be treated effectively and that many people with this illness improve over time.</p>
<p>Self-injurious behavior includes suicide and suicide attempts, as well as self-harming behaviors. As many as 80 percent of people with borderline personality disorder have suicidal behaviors, and about 4 to 9 percent commit suicide.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>. DBT also reduced the use of the emergency room and inpatient services and retained more participants in therapy, compared to other approaches to treatment.
<p>Risk Factors for Borderline Personality Disorder</p>
<p>Research is being done on the possible causes and risk factors for borderline personality disorder. However, scientists generally agree that genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved.</p>
<a>twins</a> with borderline personality disorder suggest that the illness is strongly inherited. Another study shows that a person can inherit his or her temperament and specific personality traits, particularly impulsiveness and
<a>aggression</a>. Scientists are studying
<a>genes</a> that help regulate emotions and impulse control for possible links to the disorder.
<h3>What if I or Someone I Know Is In Crisis?</h3>
<p>If you are thinking about harming yourself, or know someone who is:</p>
<li>Call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to a hospital emergency room to get immediate help. If you are unable to do this yourself, ask a friend or family member to help you.</li>
<li>Call the toll-free, 24-hour hotline of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or TTY: 1-800-799-4TTY (4889) to talk to a trained counselor.</li>
<li>Call your doctor when appropriate.</li>
<li>If you are in a crisis, make sure you are not left alone.</li>
<li>If someone else is in a crisis, make sure he or she is not left alone.</li>

<div> <div> <div> <article> <div> <div> <a> What It Means to "Matter" </a> </div> <div> Our infatuation with ourselves, bolstered by selfies, personal branding, and social media, does not lead to mattering. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> What It Means to "Matter" </h1>
<h2> To matter, we must add value—not just feel valued. </h2>
<li>When a person both feels valued and adds value to themselves and others, they become happier and healthier.</li>
<li>Wellness and worthiness depend on fairness in relationships, at work, and in the community. </li>
<li>A "me culture" focuses on one's right to feel valued. A "we culture" balances one's rights with a responsibility to feel valued and add value. </li>
<a>attention</a> at all, he wrote, was sufficient to generate misery.
<h3>The Meaning of Mattering </h3>
<p>Mattering consists of <a>feeling valued and adding value</a>, to ourselves and others. By feeling valued, we mean being appreciated, respected, and recognized. By adding value, we mean making a contribution and making a difference in the world.</p>
<a>health and well-being</a>. Adding value, or making a contribution, is a prerequisite for a
<a>meaningful life</a>. The negative effects of not mattering, however, can be devastating.
<p>Ostracism, exclusion, and rejection are not only painful, but they can also lead to <a>violence and depression.</a></p>
<p>Feeling like we matter is one of the most defining features of humanity. When that feeling is present, we thrive. When it is absent, we feel ignored and helpless. Threats to mattering diminish our dignity.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Your Matter When You Are Seen</div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Coping With Lack of Mattering</h3>
<h3>Consequences of Mattering</h3>
<a>happiness</a>; it also prevents personal devaluation, relational disconnection, disengagement from work, and disintegration of the social fabric. These four problems—the four Ds—define the crisis of our time.
<a>depression</a> around the world. Too much worth results in unprecedented levels of
<a>narcissism</a>. Disconnection is seen in new heights of isolation,
<a>loneliness</a>, and relational breakdowns.
<a>Work disengagement</a>, which is rampant around the world, costs seven trillion dollars. Declining social capital and increasing inequality point to community disintegration.
<a>Racism</a>, the belief that an entire group of people does not really matter, is entrenched in the US and other countries.
<a>philosophy</a> focuses strictly on what is good for me.
<a>deceiving</a> at best. The way to matter is not to turn ourselves into commodities for sale. Rather, the way to matter is to pursue meaning by adding value to self and others.
<a>education</a>, safety, social mobility, and life expectancy. People in countries that promote fair policies in health, education, and employment report
<a>higher levels of life satisfaction.</a> These results are, in part, because people in these countries feel like they matter. As a society, the lesson is clear: We can achieve neither wellness, nor worthiness, without fairness.

<h2><a>Co-Parenting With a Narcissist: The Impossible Dream</a></h2>
<p>Co-parenting with a narcissist or someone with strong narcissistic traits can be an exercise in futility that ends in nothing but frustration. How can you improve the situation? </p>

<div> <div> <h2><a>Lying to Die: Why Narcissists May Lie About Their Health</a></h2> <p>Narcissists are obsessed with attention and may do almost anything to secure it—even exaggerating or fabricating their own health issues.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Narcissistic Control of Relationships</a></h2> <p>With Valentine's Day on the horizon, love is in the air! How do narcissists hide behind the facade of love to break down defenses and hurt the ones who care?</p> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <h2><a>Finding Sisu in Suffering</a></h2> <p>The Finnish term "sisu" translates to stoic determination, grit, bravery, and stubborn resilience. No matter one's gender, sisu will help you survive a narcissistic relationship.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Breaking the Pattern and Building Anew</a></h2> <p>A home is supposed to be a place of comfort, love, and peace. But when that home harbors narcissists, it can be a hard path to healing.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Growing Through Pain</a></h2> <p>While it is likely to develop negative side effects from the trauma of narcissistic abuse, it is equally likely to develop experience personal growth. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Narcissists That Haunt Us</a></h2> <p>“Ghosting” is no longer reserved for Halloween houses or spooky movies. The scariest thing is how common—and cruel—this form of breaking up has become.</p> </div> </div>
