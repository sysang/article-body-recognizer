<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>'Being the Ricardos' on Amazon Prime Video: Was Lucille Ball Really a Communist?</h1><div> By Samuel Spencer <time>On 12/21/21 at 6:03 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Being the Ricardos, streaming now on <a>Amazon Prime Video</a>, depicts a nightmare week for beloved '50s sitcom star Lucille Ball (played by <a>Nicole Kidman</a>).</p>
<p>In the film, Confidential magazine runs a story that implies her husband Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem) was being unfaithful, Ball discovers she is pregnant, and radio star Walter Winchell reports that she had registered as a communist in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The movie, directed by The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin, shrugs off the claims that Ball was affiliated to the Communist Party, but Hollywood historians have offered differing accounts of exactly where her allegiances lay.</p>
<p>During Being the Ricardos, the reason Ball gives for registering as a Communist was to keep her socialist grandfather happy. But how true to the real life story is that?</p>
<h2>Was Lucille Ball Really a Member of the Communist Party?</h2>
<a>FBI</a> had collected on the actor over the years. Here was all the evidence the WaPo could find in that file of Ball's ties to
<a>communism</a> (or, at least, all the evidence that it reported):
<li>In 1937, an unnamed Hollywood writer claimed she went to a Communist Party membership meeting that was held at Ball's house, though the writer said Ball was not herself at the meeting.</li>
<li>In 1946, Arnaz had starred in a show sponsored by the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions – a group the FBI believed was a communist front.</li>
<h2>No Evidence of Phone Call</h2>
<a>Amazon</a> film does take some liberties with the truth. There is no evidence, for example, that J. Edgar Hoover really rang into the I Love Lucy studio to assure the audience that Ball had been cleared from the charge of being a communist.
<p>Being the Ricardos is <a>streaming now on Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p>

<div> Culture Netflix <a>TV</a></div>
<p>Emily in Paris is back for another round, with its lead Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) once again trying to navigate life in the French capital despite not knowing the language or much at all about the culture.</p>
<p>The Netflix hit will see Emily continue to bring an "American perspective" to the French marketing firm she works for, as well as deciding what to do with not one, not two, but three suitors.</p>
<p>How will Emily handle her burdensome love life with her blossoming career as a marketing executive? And when exactly will fans be able to start binge-watching it?</p>
<h2>What time is Emily in Paris landing on Netflix?</h2>
<p>As has been the case with Netflix for many years, its original shows arrive on the streaming platform at midnight Pacific Standard Time (PT) on the day of the program's release.</p>
<p>Emily in Paris is no exception, and so the time it arrives for viewers will depend on how the time zone they are in compares to PT.</p>
<p>For those in Hawaii and Alaska this means that the show will be available earlier than the advertised day of release, as both states' time-zones are several hours behind PST.</p>
<h3>Here is what time Emily in Paris Season 2 will be available around the world:</h3>
<li>Australia: 4 p.m. AWST / 4:45 p.m. ACWST / 7 p.m. AET / 6:30 p.m. ACDT / 7 p.m. LHDT</li>
<li>Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland: 9 a.m. CET</li>
<li>Brazil: 5 a.m. BRT / 6 a.m. FNT / 4 a.m. AMT / 3 a.m. ACT</li>
<li>Canada: 12 a.m. PST / 1 a.m. MST / 2 a.m. CST / 3 a.m. EST / 4 a.m. AST / 4:30 a.m. NST</li>
<li>Indonesia: 3 p.m. WIB / 4 p.m. WITA / 5 p.m. WIT</li>
<li>Mexico: 12 a.m. PST / 1 a.m. MST / 2 a.m. CST / 3 a.m. EST</li>
<li>New Zealand: 9 p.m. NZDT</li>
<li>Puerto Rico: 4 a.m. AST</li>
<li>United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland: 8 a.m. GMT</li>
<li>U.S.: 3 a.m. EST / 2 a.m. CST / 1 a.m. MST / midnight PST / 11 p.m. on Dec 21 AKST / 10 p.m. on Dec 21 HST</li>
<p>The show's arrival on the platform on December 22, or December 21 for some lucky few, will no doubt make it a perfect Christmas treat for fans.</p>
<p>Emily in Paris Season 2 will also introduce a number of new characters to the franchise including Lucien Laviscount as Emily's third love-interest Alfie, while Jeremy O. Harris and Arnaud Binot will have guest roles.</p>
<p>Collins returns to her lead role, and Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy Beaulieu, Lucas Bravo, William Abadie, Samuel Arnold, Camille Razat, and Bruno Gouery will also return to their respective roles.</p>
<p>Emily in Paris arrives on Netflix on Wednesday, December 22.</p>
