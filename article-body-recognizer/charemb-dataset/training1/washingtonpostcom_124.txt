<div><div><a>Health</a></div><div><h1>The pandemic has caused nearly two years of collective trauma. Many people are near a breaking point.</h1></div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Marisa Iati</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 24, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the United States, an alarming number of people are lashing out in aggressive and often cruel ways in response to policies or behavior they dislike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think people just feel this need to feel powerful, in charge and connected to someone again,” said Jennifer Jenkins, a school board member in Brevard County, Fla., who said she has faced harassment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Layer that onto other recent national crises — including race-driven social unrest, an economic recession, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and myriad extreme-weather disasters — and people can hardly bear the stress.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That danger heightens the feeling of whiplash among people tired of the pandemic’s twists and turns, said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychological science at the University of California at Irvine.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>vaccines are dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have consistently said the immunizations are safe and effective.
<div><div><p>“We’re still in danger, we’re still cooped up in our houses to some extent, we’re still not free to move about because of malevolent lies,” said Penso, who lives in D.C.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On a flight this year, Teddy Andrews’s colleague walked over to him on the verge of tears. A passenger was refusing to wear a mask and giving her a hard time, his fellow flight attendant said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Andrews approached the man, who called him the n-word and said, “I don’t have to listen to a damn thing you say, this is a free country,” according to Andrews’s testimony later before a congressional committee.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A tense exchange followed, with Andrews asking the man to don a mask to protect his fellow passengers. Eventually, the man backed down and put on the face covering.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we see manifested in society, you’ll see it happening in the air, you see it happening in restaurants, you see it happening in malls, you see it happening in school board meetings,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People are also faced with constant news about the virus, making coping even more difficult, said UC-Irvine’s Silver.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In Alaska Native villages and across communities of color, the enduring silence of grief</p></div>
<div><div><p>Stress from those cascading traumas is cumulative, Silver <a>has found</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a board meeting in October, Jenkins said she supported parents’ right to protest but would not stand for credible threats of violence against her family.</p></div></div>
<a>she said.</a> “I reject that when they are using their First Amendment rights on public property, they’re also going behind my home and brandishing weapons to my neighbors.”
<div><div><p>“Part of me feels like I have to finish this,” she said. “But,” she believes, “there is never going to be a concise finish.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Laura Daily</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 4:45 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Last May, San Diego resident Maribeth Mellin fell and broke her femur on the first day of a solo trip to D.C. for her best friend’s memorial service. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was truly alone in a hospital for a week.</p>
<div><p>How to prove your vaccination status when traveling internationally</p></div>
<p>Not everyone shares Mellin’s relatively good fortune. Although most of today’s travelers are obsessed with carrying proof of coronavirus vaccination or negative test results, few take any other health information. That’s a mistake.</p>
<div><p>What to do when a hotel closure impacts your trip</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what to include in your own lifesaving medical profile.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who you are.</b> At the top of the sheet, put your legal name, address and date of birth.</p></div></div>
<div><p><b>Emergency contact(s).</b> Shepherd says to designate someone as your emergency contact, presumably a person to whom you have sent a copy of your info. It should be a friend or family member who is accountable and easy to reach.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Health-care providers.</b> Include a current list of health-care providers, both primary care and specialists, along with their phone numbers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Medical history.</b> This should include things such as childhood asthma and past diagnoses, even if you are currently taking no prescriptions for the condition, as well as any past surgeries.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Good morning — we hope you enjoyed yesterday's winter weather as much as this panda rolling around in his first snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: The FDA authorized booster shots for 12-to-15-year-olds, and coronavirus cases are spiking on Capitol Hill. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Forecasters say omicron peak could come this month</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest surge of coronavirus cases could peak as soon as this month while the highly contagious omicron variant speeds through the U.S. population.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The nation’s case count is already reaching record levels, as the omicron variant tears through the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Forecasting the future</div></h5></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“It’s spreading much faster than we ever expected,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at IHME.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>The caveat: Some health experts are quick to note the virus has proven itself to be unpredictable time and time again. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>An important indicator</div></h5></div></div>
<li>“The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalization?” Fauci said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”</li>
<div><p>Data on case counts and hospitalizations serve different purposes, some say. For state officials, infection rates are important to understand where the virus is spreading and the demographics of the populations most impacted. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Some governors are already sounding the alarm, as they ready for what's likely to be a brutal next few weeks as the country enters Year 3 of its pandemic response. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for 12-to-15-year-olds</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>On tap Wednesday: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers are expected to review the moves, with the agency director, Rochelle Walensky, expected to sign off as soon as that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Here's what else we're watching:</div></h4></div></div>
<li>More than 3,000 flights were canceled yesterday as airlines grappled with winter weather and staffing shortages tied to surging coronavirus cases, per our colleague Lori Aratani.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Coronavirus cases skyrocket on Capitol Hill</div></h4></div></div>
<div><ul><li>House and Senate offices should telework much as possible, Monahan wrote, and those on the Hill should upgrade their masks, using more protective KN95 or N95 masks instead of cloth or surgical masks.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h4><div>GOP senators blast the Biden administration for the nation’s testing shortage</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) are demanding answers from the Biden administration over the country’s testing crunch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>In the courts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Elizabeth Holmes found guilty on four counts in fraud case</div></h4></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Holmes was found guilty on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud against investors. The jury was deadlocked on three other counts related to defrauding investors.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Cuomo won’t face charges in nursing home investigation</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has closed its probe into the Cuomo administration’s handling of nursing home data, a spokesperson for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday, NBC reports.</p></div></div>
<p>Cuomo faced accusations that he downplayed the toll of the coronavirus on the state’s nursing homes by reportedly withholding data on nursing home residents who died of the virus while outside of the facilities, for instance in hospitals.</p>

<a>record numbers</a>, the issue is flaring up again. Once again, both sides are wrong.
<div><div><p>Instead of arguing over whether schools are “safe,” let’s agree that schools are essential and then work to reduce risk to get students back to in-person learning.</p></div></div>
<a>discouraging the use</a> of covid-19 tests for school kids. And
<a>rampant right-wing disinformation</a> has contributed to
<a>low vaccine uptake</a> among children.
<a>90 percent of school staff</a> are fully vaccinated, indoor masking is required and the city is
<a>recording</a> less than half the deaths than during previous peaks. The union is insisting on remote learning until a
<a>host of demands</a> are met, including testing of all students and teachers and a lower than 10 percent citywide test positivity rate.
<a>compiled dozens of studies</a> that show schools can be some of the safest places in terms of covid-19. Research from
<a>Missouri</a> have shown that even when community infection rates are high, there was minimal school-related transmission in districts that implemented protective measures.
<div><div><p>It’s wrong for politicians to stop the use of readily available mitigation measures such as masks. But it’s equally wrong to argue that unless every protection is in place, schools cannot remain open.</p></div></div>
<a>advocated for schools to be closed</a> out of concern for teachers, school staff and their families, and I
<a>fought for teachers to be prioritized for vaccines</a>.
<div><p>The Post's View: Hospitals are crushed once again. But there are glimmers of hope.</p></div>
<a>95 percent</a> of all infections in the United States, is
<a>considerably milder</a> than previous iterations. Moreover, high-quality masks protect the wearer, even if others around them aren’t consistently masking. A teacher who makes use of these protective measures is unlikely to contract the
<a>coronavirus</a> from the classroom and extremely unlikely to become seriously ill.
<a>dramatically widened</a>, especially in schools with high poverty rates. So many children and adolescents are suffering from depression, trauma and stress that the
<a>American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and other groups have declared a state of emergency for children’s mental health.
<div><div><p>And what does it say about our society’s values when much higher-risk settings such as bars and sports stadiums remain open while our children are left to suffer once again?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the rest of society is not locking down, then we shouldn’t shut down schools, either. Children and their families cannot keep paying the price for extremist positions on both sides.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<a>health officials</a> have also noted the growing evidence that omicron is less severe than delta. In South Africa, which first reported omicron, even though relatively
<a>few</a> have been vaccinated, people were less likely — 80 percent lower, according to
<a>one preprint study</a> posted in December 2021 — to be hospitalized for omicron than for other variants. In addition, the Biden administration has ordered

<p>The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a warning: If cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. However, areas with little testing probably will appear to have fewer cases regardless of how rampant the virus may be.</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average is the best way to view trends in new cases, because more than half of states don’t report new data every day. That is why certain days of the week show up as consistently higher or lower than others.</p>
<div><h3>Covid-related deaths in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average death rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>

<p>Health officials believe the virus has killed more people than state totals indicate, especially early in the pandemic before testing and effective treatments were widely available.</p>
<p>A rise in deaths usually follows a rise in new cases by about a month. For example, after the delta variant caused a surge of new cases beginning in July 2021, the death toll began to climb in August.</p>
<p>As with the new cases chart, occasional single-day anomalies reflect one-time adjustments by states. They are noted but not included in the seven-day averages.</p>
<div><h3>Hospitalizations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Reported covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Currently hospitalized</div><div> Filled ICU beds</div></div></div>
<p>A rise in hospitalizations tends to follow a rise in new cases by a couple of weeks.</p>

<div><h4>Doses of covid-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Reported doses administered per day</div></div><div>See more detailed vaccination statistics for each state in the Vaccine Tracker.</div></div>
<p>The vaccine rollout beginning in December 2020 was limited and chaotic, but free vaccines are now widely available and recommended for everyone age 5 and older. The CDC also recommends booster shots for many people.</p>
<p>Note: Fully vaccinated shows people who have completed vaccination, either through both doses of a two-dose vaccine, or a single dose of a one-dose vaccine.</p>

<div><h4>Tests reported per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Positive tests</div><div> Negative tests</div></div><p>Note: Data is preliminary. The most recent days are frequently revised upward.</p></div>
<p>Testing was slow to ramp up in 2020, but it has become more robust, so the rate of positive tests is another clue to the concentration of the coronavirus in an area.</p>

<div><div><p>His reception, however, was not what the world’s No. 1 player anticipated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Border authorities then canceled his visa.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<div><div><p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison was equally resolute, citing the imperative of enforcing the country’s strict coronavirus protocols without favor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australian Open officials had no immediate comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He did everything correctly,” the person said. “But the goal posts have been changed — for him.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>His announcement Tuesday that he had received an exemption to play made no mention of whether his opinion on the protocols had changed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tiley placed the onus on Djokovic to reveal the reason for his exemption.</p></div></div>
<a>Tiley said</a>, adding, “We’ve been through a very tough period over the past two years, and we would appreciate some answers to that.”
<div><div><p>Criticism of the exemption, with whispers of special treatment for the top player in Australia’s highest-profile international sports event, was swift, with skepticism giving way to indignant outrage.</p></div></div>

<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>

<a>coronavirus</a> vaccine booster, expanding protection to adolescents and teens as surging
<a> omicron infections</a> threaten to disrupt schools and workplaces across the country.
<b> </b>that echoed the strong language used by many panel members. “I encourage all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”
<a>omicron variant </a>is thought to be less virulent than delta but its high transmissibility has produced many infections, some of which have resulted in severe disease.

<p>Much of the debate Wednesday by CDC panel members centered on whether to give a full-throated endorsement to booster shots for adolescents by recommending that they <i>should</i> get them, as opposed to recommending they <i>may </i>get them.</p>
<div><div><p>Several panel members supported a strong recommendation for the shots because of the omicron surge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I believe in the vaccine, I believe that it has been safe, I believe that we can prevent serious infection,” said Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrics professor at Ohio State University.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I think we need to highlight that children are not okay,” said Kathy Poehling, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “Covid is overwhelming our hospitals and our children’s hospitals.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>But as more information emerges on the potential impact of omicron in children, parents’ attitudes toward vaccinating their teenagers and younger children may change, CDC official Sara Oliver said.</p></div></div>
<p>FDA officials have said the agency broadened access to boosters this week because real-world data and laboratory tests indicate the shots significantly strengthen protection, especially against the omicron variant, while posing minimal risk.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials cited data from Israel that found no new safety concerns when more than 6,000 youngsters ages 12 to 15 got a Pfizer booster five months after their second dose. There were no new cases of heart-related complications.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Aaron Rodgers had strong words Wednesday for a member of the Associated Press’s NFL MVP award voting panel who had called the Green Bay Packers quarterback a “jerk” and a “bad guy.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I think he’s a bum,” Rodgers said to reporters of Hub Arkush, a reporter for Westwood One and a Chicago Bears-focused writer, editor and analyst on other platforms. “I think he’s an absolute bum.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush made his comments Tuesday in an appearance on Chicago’s 670 the Score in which he was asked about having previously indicated he would not vote for Rodgers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush added that there were “no guidelines” issued to MVP voters.</p></div></div>
<a>fined by the NFL</a> for violating league
<a>making misleading statements</a> about vaccines and homeopathic remedies and
<a>lashed out at what he called a “woke mob”</a> as well as media members he said were “trying to shame and out and cancel all us unvaccinated people.”
<a>reaffirmed his vaccine skepticism</a> last month, returned to the lineup after the Packers lost that game to the Chiefs and has since guided his team to six wins in its past seven games. The Packers are 13-3 and have clinched
<a>the top seed in the NFC playoffs</a>.
<a>seeming ambivalence</a> last summer about
<a>playing for Green Bay</a> this season. Claiming that Rodgers’s public uncertainty then “ruined the entire offseason” for the Packers, Arkush said, “He tortured their fan base, and he’s already
<a>started doing it again</a>.”
<div><div><p>With Arkush’s comments having gained widespread notice and spurring <a>criticism</a>, he returned to Chicago’s airwaves Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I made a big mistake last night,” he <a>told</a> 670 the Score.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush explained that his regrets were not based on how Rodgers might perceive his comments but on having put the other 49 MVP voters in “an unfortunate position.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s just wrong,” he continued, “and I feel awful about it and wish it hadn’t happened.”</p></div></div>
