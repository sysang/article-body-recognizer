<p>The person on the other end had a very southern, sweet voice and she would realize that I wasn't who she was looking for, so she would hang up. I didn't even get as far as saying who I was at first, she would just say sorry and hang up.</p>
<p>I could tell she was really sweet, so after a few calls over the next week I finally said: "Hey, if you're going to keep calling me, why not tell me your name, where you're from and who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>I'll definitely be reaching out more for holidays and Christmas, because I can see how much it means to her. I understand Gladys appreciates our chats, and I always leave the conversation thinking: that was great.</p>

<p>My mom has told me that she first noticed I stuttered when I was around 4 years old and put me into speech therapy straight away. But the point where I myself became aware of my stutter was when I was around 9 or 10, in the fourth grade.</p>
<p>I started off playing defensive line, but in my sophomore year at Archer High School in Lawrenceville, Georgia, the offensive line coach there, Coach Brian Lane, pulled me to the offensive line, which is where I've been playing ever since.</p>
<p>I started speech therapy as soon as I got into elementary school and although I stopped in middle school, I started it again in high school and I've been in speech therapy ever since, including here at college.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to people who stutter and anyone with any kind of disability, is that you can still do whatever you want. Don't let anyone's words or the looks they may give you affect you and your confidence.</p>

<p>Flynn says that the subpoena filed against him by the panel looking into the insurrection at the Capitol is violating his free speech and his rights against self-incrimination.</p>
<p>"Without intervention by this Court, General Flynn faces the harm of being irreparably and illegally coerced to produce information and testimony in violation of the law and his constitutional rights," the lawsuit says.</p>
<a> become one of the more extreme voices</a> to have pushed the widely discredited claim that Trump lost the election due to widespread voter fraud,
<a>including advocating for martial law to overturn the results.</a>
<a>Flynn, who was pardoned by Trump </a>after pleading guilty to lying to the
<a>FBI</a> about his contacts with Russia amid the Mueller investigation, has cited fears of inadvertently incriminating himself despite previously stating he has nothing to hide with regards to the January 6 attack and would be willing to cooperate.
<a>Tucker Carlson</a> on November 12, Flynn said the January 6 investigation, which has seen a number of Trump allies subpoenaed, was an "assault on freedom of speech, our ability to peaceably protest [and] our desire to seek the truth."
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Flynn's home state of Florida, states in the run-up to January 6 that Flynn was a private citizen who "sincerely held concerns about the integrity" of the 2020 elections.</p>
<p>The House Select Committee has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has questioned why authorities have not captured the suspected January 5 pipe bomber in Washington D.C., while suggesting others who are not his supporters should be held accountable for the violence at the insurrection.</p>
<a>revious claims that real insurrection</a> did not occur at the Capitol on January 6, but on Election Day in November 2020 as he continued to push his false claims that the last election was rigged against him.
<a> despite substantial video evidence</a> tracking the suspect's movement that night.
<p>Trump responded by saying that the hundreds of people who have been arrested in connection to the <a>Capitol attack are being "treated very unfairly"</a> while suggesting that the "other side" are not facing similar scrutiny.</p>
<p>He and Owens then discussed a conspiracy theory that <a>FBI</a> informants helped encourage Trump supporters to attack the Capitol that day.</p>
<p>The former president also repeated a conspiracy theory that left-wing <a>Black Lives Matter</a> and antifa protesters were "antagonizing" the violence at the Capitol on January 6.</p>
<p>"This pipe bomber, who knows what it was, they never found him?</p>
<p>"But why aren't they finding this pipe bomber? And how come other people haven't been revealed? Because I think that there were more than, let's call them MAGA people."</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that the FBI is purposely avoided arresting the pipe bomb suspect.</p>
<p>D'Antuono suggested that one of the main reasons a suspect still has not been taken into custody is because they are being shielded by accomplices.</p>
<p>The suspect wore a face mask, glasses, a grey hooded sweatshirt, gloves, and black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo on the night he allegedly place the explosive devices around D.C.</p>
<p>The FBI are offering $100,000 to anyone who can provide information which can lead to the identification of the suspect.</p>

<p>This week, Republican Congressman Scott Perry (G-PA) became the first sitting lawmaker the committee requested information from, <a>although he has said</a> he would not co-operate.</p>
<p>Describing the committee as consisting of "highly partisan political hacks" Trump said the cause of the "protest" was in fact, "the rigged presidential election of 2020," as he reiterated false claims of election irregularities.</p>
<p>"I will be having a news conference on January 6th at Mar-a-Lago to discuss all of these points, and more," he said, without specifying what he meant by "more."</p>
<p>"Until then, remember, the insurrection took place on November 3rd," he said, "it was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged [2020] election that took place on January 6."</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Trump and Pelosi's office for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House will also commemorate the anniversary of the attack, but has not announced anything specific.</p>
<p>"It was a day when our nation's capital was under attack," White House press secretary <a>Jen Psaki</a> told reporters last week "there's no question you'll see us commemorate that day."</p>

<h4>In this daily series, Newsweek explores the steps that led to the January 6 Capitol Riot.</h4>
<p>On December 23, pro-Trump organizer Cindy Chafian sent a follow-up email about the planned January 6 event, saying that 15,000 participants were expected.</p>
<p>"A higher number that expected people [sic] have already made concerted plans to travel to the District of Columbia for the event," the Park Police said.</p>
<p>"The protests/rallies [are] expected to be similar to the previous Million MAGA March rallies in November and December 2020," the U.S. Capitol Police agreed in their December 23 "Special Assessment" (21-A-0468 V.2).</p>
<a>FBI</a> but seen by Newsweek. But there is still not an official estimate, nor have any of the Congressional committees or task forces offered a number. Nor is there a clear number of how many people actually entered the Capitol, or tried to get in.
<p>Getting the numbers right is essential. Did the assumption that there would be some 20,000 protestors in the District of Columbia that day stand in the way of competent contingency planning?</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a> was speaking on January 6. An additional 15,000 positioned themselves between the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, outside the restricted area, according to still-classified Secret Service data.
<a>Congress</a>, "I received reports that MPD and others estimated that between 10,000 and 30,000 people would be coming for the rallies or protests on January 6—a sizable, but not unprecedented number."
<a>Pentagon</a> for not taking swifter action—has an interest in being content with a low estimate, in not admitting that that 120,000 people were there to show solidarity with the president, believing that the election was indeed stolen.

<p>Former President Donald Trump asked the <a>Supreme Court</a> on Thursday to prevent releasing documents to the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack.</p>
<p>Trump requested the justices to pause a decision made by a lower court allowing the disclosure of White House records while they consider his position in the case.</p>
<p>"[Former] President Trump will suffer irreparable harm through the effective denial of a constitutional and statutory right to be fully heard on a serious disagreement between the former and incumbent President," Binnall added.</p>
<p>According to his lawyer, Trump stated that he was in negotiations with the White House but "abruptly stopped" them after a decision had been made to release the first tranche of documents requested.</p>
<p>Last week, <a>Roger Stone</a>, a former adviser to Trump and a Republican consultant, <a>pleaded the Fifth</a> Amendment for every question he was asked at a deposition with the January 6 panel.</p>
<a>Democrats</a>' long history of fabricating perjury charges on the basis of comments that are innocuous, immaterial or irrelevant," Stone

<p>Trump also wants to block the release of a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died during the riot and other documents related to efforts in overturning the election results and his claims of election fraud, <a>CNN</a> reported.</p>
<p>In November, the House select committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said that the panel is seeking to know details of the events that unfolded on January 6.</p>
<p>"The select committee is seeking information about the rallies and subsequent march to the Capitol that escalated into a violent mob attacking the Capitol and threatening our democracy," Thompson said.</p>
<p>"We need to know who organized, planned, paid for, and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organizers had with officials in the White House and <a>Congress</a>," he added.</p>

<p>Donald Trump entered the holiday season as fixated as ever on overturning the results of the election. "VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, IT IS A FACT!!!" he tweeted on December 24.</p>
<p>The night before, Trump flew to Florida to spend the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago home. Flying with him on Air Force One: Rudy Giuliani, the president's Number One cheerleader, who was spending Christmas with the Trumps.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at his golf club that Thursday, the president "received a warm welcome from members," according to <a>CNN</a>. Fellow golfers were excited that Trump wasn't giving up the fight.</p>
<p>Vice President <a>Mike Pence</a> was on Trump's mind, though. The two men were fundamentally different. Pence, deeply conservative and a conscientious holder of his office, was never close to or buddies with the showman.</p>
<a>Congress</a> certified the electoral votes that had already been counted. As president of the
<a>Senate</a>, Pence presided. But he didn't have to. Vice President Hubert Humphrey didn't preside, turning over the duties to the President Pro Tempore, the senior member.
<p>"Stay in the fight for election integrity. Stay in the fight to defend all we've done," Pence said. "Four more years!"</p>
<p>"Stop the steal!" the crowd chanted.</p>
<a>Republicans</a>. It wasn't just Trump's golf club. Take, for instance, the experience of Senator
<a>Mike Lee</a>, Republican of Utah, when he went back to Utah for Christmas.
<p>"Cancel culture" Trump tweeted, railing against <a>Twitter</a> for "going wild with their flags, trying hard to suppress even the truth. Just shows how dangerous they are, purposely stifling free speech. Very dangerous for our Country."</p>
<p>"This is how Communism starts," Trump raged.</p>
<p>Donald Trump's army was ready to go to war for their president, to prevent communism, to defend the nation. They sought a sense of patriotic duty, expressed in their quasi-military pretensions and even their dress.</p>
<p>"Who wants to go to dc?" Christopher Quaglin posted on <a>Facebook</a> on December 24, "I have an extra double twin bed available."</p>
<p>Benjamin Burlew spoke to a family member on a call that day as well, saying he planned to "storm the Capitol."</p>
<p>"That's my basement gun room," Quaglin captioned a photo. "I have been planning for this since fucking Bush left office and Obama came in"</p>

<p>The January 6 committee wants to speak with Representative Jim Jordan about his communication with former President <a>Donald Trump</a> on January 6, 2021, and a Democratic lawmaker urged him to offer up "everything" he knows.</p>
<p>"He doesn't care about democracy," Dean told Reid. "He doesn't care what happened on January the 6th and the lies that led up to it that he participated in."</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Jordan for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>

<p>The full message, however, contained a legal argument from former Department of Defense Inspector General Joseph Schmitz. It wasn't Jordan's own words, either, but a message he forwarded.</p>
<p>The committee has struggled to get the information it has requested from the people closest to Trump, and recently found former White House chief strategist <a>Steve Bannon</a> and Meadows in contempt of <a>Congress</a>.</p>

<p>Taylor Budowich, spokesman for former President Donald Trump, filed a lawsuit on Friday against the January 6 House Committee after it requested the disclosure of his financial records.</p>
<p>A subpoena was sent to J.P. Morgan requiring the bank to release Budowich's financial documents, <a>according to the lawsuit</a>, as the committee continues to investigate the January 6 Capitol riots.</p>
<p>The committee is seeking information concerning the source of funds used in planning the "Stop the Steal" rally on January 6, <a>Politico reported</a>. Budowich is also suing House Speaker <a>Nancy Pelosi</a> and J.P. Morgan Chase.</p>
<p>Budowich <a>said in a statement</a> on Friday that he read a letter from J.P. Morgan on Thursday notifying him that his banking records will be released in compliance with the subpoena unless he provided a "court-ordered stoppage."</p>
<p>The letter from the bank was dated Dec. 21, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>"To add to the absurdity neither the committee, nor JP Morgan Chase will provide me with a copy of the actual contents of the subpoena," Budowich said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit argued that the January 6 committee didn't provide Budowich a formal notice or enough time to respond to the subpoena as the court had closed for the Christmas weekend when he received the bank's notice letter.</p>
<p>"By circumventing my constitutionally-protected rights, this committee is proving only one thing: the constitution only applies if your political party is in charge," Budowich added.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also alleged that Budowich already provided the committee with the financial information that "could possibly be relevant" to its investigation.</p>
<p>Trump's spokesman said he had already provided "more than 1,700 pages of documents" and "roughly four hours of sworn testimony" to the committee,<a> including rally money</a> trail, according to Politico.</p>
<p>The House Select Committee has been receiving pushback from Trump and his supporters as it continues its probe and subpoenas. Meanwhile, some of his allies invoked the Fifth Amendment as they stood before the January 6 panel.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a>Trump asked the Supreme Court</a> to block the release of documents to the committee. He asked the justices to put a hold on a court decision that would allow disclosure of White House records.</p>

<p>Eight people were injured, including three bystanders who were hospitalized. Two Nashville police officers who had just arrived in the area after the RV broadcast warning messages also received minor injuries.</p>
<p>The message broadcast loudly was "This area must be evacuated now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now."</p>
<p>Nashville Mayor John Cooper signed an executive order declaring a state of civil emergency and enacting a 4:30 p.m. curfew within the downtown area.</p>
<p>K-9 teams searched around the area for bombs. Radiation monitors were brought in. Public transportation was suspended. Due to telecommunications outages, the FAA temporarily halted flights in and out of Nashville.</p>
<p>"Intentional bombing" said local NewsChannel 5.</p>
<p>"Some investigators are asking if there is a relationship between the Nashville bombing and the broader right-wing insurgent cause," terrorism analyst Laurie Mylroie <a>wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Bill Ryan, a retired detective and former member of the New York <a>Police</a> Department arson and explosions task force, told <a>Fox News</a> that the Nashville blast could be a "trial run" for a larger attack or "a standalone explosion."</p>
<p>The many threats to the telecommunications infrastructure, particularly 5G wireless technology, was the main hypothesis of FBI and homeland security analysts, given the conspiracy theories that had been voice connecting 5G to COVID.</p>
<p>Enormous resources were devoted to investigating the Nashville bombing, with over 250 FBI agents on the scene by the weekend—a reminder that, after the fact, the FBI and other domestic agencies were very good at their job.</p>
<p>Forensic tests of human remains recovered from the RV, as well as the VIN number of the mobile home, confirmed that Anthony Quinn Warner, 63, of Antioch, Tennessee, was the likely perpetrator. He had died in the explosion.</p>

<p>James Tate Grant, a North Carolina man charged with assaulting police officers during the January 6 Capitol riots, could be placed in pretrial detention after an assault rifle and ammunition were found in his car during a drunk driving arrest.</p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors on Thursday submitted a request for a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to revoke the pretrial release of 29-year-old Grant, who is awaiting trial over his documented involvement in the Capitol attack.</p>
<p>The rioter was arrested on December 7 by a police officer in Garner, North Carolina who was responding to a report of a suicide threat. Grant was found pulling out of a restaurant's parking area and appeared intoxicated.</p>
<p>The judge did not yet rule on the request. Newsweek has contacted Grant's attorney for comment.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Grant was found to have used a metal crowd control barrier to "forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, and interfere with" police.</p>
<p>Documents filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<a>FBI</a>) stated Grant's acts were captured in an <a>Instagram</a> video of the attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>The footage showed Grant and Ryan Samsel, a fellow rioter and co-defendant, leading a crowd of <a>Donald Trump</a> supporters past a first barricade towards the second. Grant was dressed in black, his face covered with a skull mask.</p>
<p>"The officers make a brief attempt to lift the barricade back up, but the rioters, including GRANT, overwhelm the officers and move forward towards the Capitol Building, forcing the officers to retreat from their position," the document read.</p>
<p>Subsequent footage—both from Capitol security cameras and rioters' social media videos—depicted Grant inside the Capitol. Screenshots of an apparent livestream, as well as a selfie taken by Grant himself, proved he also breached the Senate offices.</p>
<p>The Capitol attack and subsequent drunk driving incident were not Grant's only brushes with the law.</p>
<p>In September 2014, Grant was arrested twice: once for breaking or entering a motor vehicle, drug possession, and possession of stolen goods; and again the following day for breaking or entering a vehicle.</p>

<p>Police arrested Sibick in March after Fanone's police badge was found in his yard, according to the news station. He was originally ordered held without bond.</p>
<p>In October, Jackson allowed him to be released to home incarceration over concerns that being in jail could radicalize him further, WUSA reported.</p>

<h4>In this daily series, Newsweek explores the steps that led to the January 6 Capitol Riot.</h4>
<p>On December 27, the last Sunday of 2020, the news media struggled to offer any happy news in a year dominated by COVID and then by Donald Trump's post-election dissension.</p>
<p>COVID cases reached 80 million worldwide and over the weekend, the United States reached a grim indicator: 1 in 1,000 Americans had died in the pandemic. Los Angeles County alone was experiencing one COVID death every ten minutes.</p>
<p>"We are really at a very critical point," Fauci said.</p>
<a>FBI</a> assistant director Frank Figliuzzi
<a>CBS</a>' Face the Nation. "We've concentrated, post 9/11 on ... getting our hands around all the chemical companies, mass orders of precursors for known explosives," he said, calling on shop owners and companies to be even more vigilant.
<p>"[T]he notion of a copycat seeing what's happened in Nashville and trying to do this themselves is very real," he said.</p>
<a>ABC</a>'s This Week, "but it's just a stark reminder that it is extremely vulnerable and we're overdue for some pretty significant investments."
<a>NBC</a>'s Meet the Press, there was no talk of Nashville, or COVID: the entire show was devoted to
<a>Joe Biden</a> and what kind of president he would be. The closest the program got was in asking two governors about the difficult time and being targeted by COVID protestors. Gov.
<a>Mike Dewine</a> of Ohio said: "I think it's understandable that people are upset. It's nine months into this. People are tired of it, so I get it."
<p>Trump's "final days in office are shaping up to be the most volatile and unpredictable of a presidency defined by its volatility and unpredictability," said Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week.</p>
<a>Chris Christie</a> told ABC. "There may be some, some histrionics that go along with it, in the end I'm confident that the
<a>Congress</a> will confirm what the American people did on Election Day, which was to elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States."
<p>Not one of the dominant Sunday morning news shows mentioned the protests brewing or the likelihood of violence.</p>

<p>On December 28, House leaders met to discuss security for the upcoming January 6 Joint Session of Congress. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a member of the Congressional Democratic leadership, asked whether sufficient resources were being planned.</p>
<p>"There is some concern that individuals may display more aggressive and desperate behavior as they interpret 6 January as their final opportunity to act on their grievances," the Park Police said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police also received tips that social media postings from <a>Donald Trump</a> supporters were saying that protestors were going to be armed, and that people were organizing. To "stock the Capitol" on January 6.</p>
<p>The <a>FBI</a> reported, in an eGuardian report of suspicious activity, that individuals were planning to engage in civil disobedience such as blocking major transportation routes leading into the District.</p>
<a>Government Accounting Office</a> examined why the Joint Session of Congress was never designated an NSSE, and the explanations would be comic if they weren't quite so tragic. The
<li>No governor requested that the event be so designated, the standard procedure, even though the DC mayor is not a governor.</li>
<li>The designation of any special event requires "adequate time" in order for the Secret Service (the designated lead federal agency) to "effectively collaborate."</li>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police was the lead federal law enforcement agency and was responsible, not them.</li>
<li>Though another federal agency could have made a request for a NSSE designation, no such request was made.</li>
<li>Other 2020 pro-Trump rallies had not been designated.</li>
<li>The NSSE designation "is a lengthy process and not something achieved in only a few days or weeks."</li>
<li>Finally, homeland security said that public safety organizations could have adapted security postures "without the need to designate an event an NSSE."</li>
<p>Then came the various rejoinders.</p>
<li>The DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said they did not initiate a request because they did not think they had the authority to request an NSSE for an event on federal property.</li>
<li>The Secret Service said the Joint Session did not normally meet the criteria for an NSSE designation "because it was considered routine congressional business, rather than a special event."</li>
<li>The Park Police said the event was a "First Amendment demonstration."</li>
<li>The Park Police said the permit holders did not state that they anticipated that the crowd at the Ellipse would move to another location.</li>
<li>The Capitol police said they did not play any role in turning January 6 into an NSSE because they are part of the Legislative Branch and not the Executive and thought that DHS or another federal agency would initiate the request.</li>
<p>In other words: January 6, more important and threatening than any previous State of the Union address or political convention, was not "special," was not "national security," and indeed was not even an "event."</p>
<a>Mike Pence</a> and the two other presidential successors—
<a>Nancy Pelosi</a> and Charles Grassley.
<p>The Park Police was responsible for the Ellipse and the National Mall, not Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>And, of course, the Department of Homeland Security was responsible for everything, and nothing.</p>
<p>It was the worst of 9/11-like excuses. And yet Congressional inquiries a year later were still looking for a Donald Trump smoking gun rather than reforming the federal agencies that they actually have some control over.</p>

<h4>In this daily series, Newsweek explores the steps that led to the January 6 Capitol Riot.</h4>
<p>The COVID pandemic is "out of control," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Tuesday, December 29.</p>
<p>And if that weren't enough, the first known American case of a new, more contagious COVID variant, later known as Delta, was being reported in Colorado and California.</p>
<a>Pfizer</a> vaccine, which required special refrigeration.
<a>Joe Biden</a>, he said, would be "upfront about what the challenges are" and "transparent about where the bottlenecks are."
<p>"Put aside this nonsense of making masks be a political statement or not," Fauci said on <a>CNN</a>, promising that if they did, the curve would come down.</p>
<p>COVID flip-flops, capricious impositions like lockdowns, the destruction of small businesses, the mandatory mask mandates: all of them, Steve says, were and are a part of an "assault on liberty."</p>

<a>Department of Homeland Security</a> and the National Counterterrorism Center, issued an intelligence report—"Intelligence in Depth"—titled "Diverse DVE Landscape Probably Will Persist." DVE refers to domestic violent extremists.
<a>Donald Trump</a>. No mention was made of the impact of COVID. No mention was made of the two post-election protests that had already taken place in Washington DC, on
<a>December 12</a>, or any upcoming threats. In fact, there was no focus on the nation's capital at all.
<a>Pentagon</a> says that this includes supporting "the overthrow of the government" and "goals that are political, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature." That's a fairly broad spectrum.
<a>Proud Boys</a>, Oath Keepers, etc.—and imagining these groups are more powerful than they are, obscures the individuals and their actions that need to be detected and stopped.
<a>ISIS</a> and al Qaeda"—as the Bureau's number-one priority.
<p>According to Wray, the Bureau is "countering lone domestic violent extremists radicalized by personalized grievances ranging from racial and ethnic bias to anti-government, anti-authority sentiment to conspiracy theories."</p>
<p>That would be obvious to any observer. The FBI, in its formal intelligence reporting, seems to have missed the signs completely.</p>
<a>Police</a> and Metropolitan Police Department officials.
<a>Congress</a> how much "the threat" had changed 20 years after the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. "It was 9/11, after all," he said, "that turned the FBI into an agency focused on disrupting threats."
<p>But when a national threat and a catastrophic event loomed in late 2020, FBI bureaucrats not only didn't disrupt it, they didn't even see it coming.</p>

<div> U.S. <a>Wedding</a></div>
<p>A judge is allowing an accused Capitol rioter to serve as the best man at another accused Capitol rioter's wedding, where one of the guests could be a man who has so far evaded arrest for the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>During Wednesday's hearing, prosecutors noted that a third Capitol rioter could be present at the wedding. Jonathan Daniel Pollock, 21, was charged alongside Hutchinson and Doolin but has so far evaded arrest, making him a fugitive.</p>
<p>Hutchinson's attorney argued that his client isn't returning to Washington, D.C., which is a condition of his release, and that Pollock is unlikely to show up at the wedding, according to <a>NBC</a>'s Scott MacFarlane.</p>
<p>"As one of Mr. Doolin's best friends, Mr. Hutchinson is proud to be one of six groomsmen and a member of the wedding party. As such, he would be included in all the traditional events celebrating the wedding," the court filing said.</p>
<p>Complicating Doolin's wedding plans was a request from prosecutors to revoke his bond, thereby sending him to jail pending his trial. Officials found an AR-15 in Doolin's home in violation of the conditions of his release.</p>
<p>"I had no idea that rifle was in the house or on the property. I have everything to lose and nothing to gain," Doolin said. "I wouldn't be foolish enough to have a [gun] on the property.</p>
<p>Along with granting Hutchinson's request to attend Doolin's wedding, Nichols denied the government's motion, allowing Doolin to remain free on his personal recognizance.</p>
<p>Pollock is accused of charging at police officers with flag poles and charging a fence with Hutchinson, who helped remove the fence to give rioters access to the line of police officers, according to court documents.</p>
