<h1> Women are ditching their heels post-COVID and it’s dividing fashionistas</h1>

<p>Cindy Grosz feels like a liberated woman. </p>
<p>But she admits that things have changed for her since lockdown.</p>
<p>“Now, I really don’t feel as much pressure to wear heels,” said the 5-foot-2 former footwear addict. “I just can’t wear them anymore.”</p>
<p>Yet diehard heel defenders say that women like Grosz are tip-toeing into dangerous territory.</p>
<p>“Love that Mayim is wearing sensible shoes,” one Twitter user recently wrote of Bialik’s wardrobe.</p>
<p>Even shoe sellers can’t agree on whether pumps and stilettos — long mainstays of a chic woman’s wardrobe — will come back after COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The Natalie has been our strongest performing shoe throughout the pandemic, and it continues to be a best-seller this year, even as people are resuming some of their pre-pandemic activities,” she said.</p>
<p>Marisa Silber, buyer for <a>designer shoes at Saks Fifth Avenue</a>, is singing a different tune.</p>
<p>That was true for Carrie Pluchino, who routinely wore 4- to 6-inch heels every day — until the pandemic prompted a serious change-of-heart.</p>
<p>“I love fashion and I love shoes, so I was bummed because there was nowhere to go during the pandemic,” said Pluchino. </p>
<p>She’s so committed to comfort that for her upcoming December wedding, Pluchino bought a pair of white checkered Vans that she plans to wear for the reception, ditching her 3-inch pumps as soon as the ceremony is over. </p>
<p>“2019 Carrie would have tried to tough it out for the sake of fashion, but 2021 Carrie is saying, ‘But you can still look cute in sneakers.’ “</p>
<p>Staunch stiletto lovers have just a single word to say in response: yes.</p>
<p>Inna Plotkin, a personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman, agrees with Sharaf.</p>
<p>“And men love heels,” she continued. “[Christian] Louboutin once said, ‘I don’t make heels for women, I make heels for men.’ ”</p>

<h1> Christina Haack shows off incredible ocean view in new $10M mansion</h1>
<div> December 29, 2021 8:08am <div> Updated <div> December 29, 2021 2:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Christina Haack is ending the year with a divorce, a new engagement and a new ocean-view mansion.</p>
<p>And the reality star is wasting no time showing off her new life. </p>
<p>Haack, 38, recently gave fans a sneak peek of the view from her sprawling $10.5 million home in Dana Point, California.</p>
<p>The “Flip or Flop” co-host was seen walking outside during sunset to her expansive deck and infinity pool, as she showed her dog howling at sirens in the distance. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the television personality also celebrated Christmas in her new home with her family.</p>
<p><a>In another post</a>, the “Christina on the Coast” host posed in front of her Christmas tree with her fiancé, Josh Hall, and her three children: daughter Taylor, 11, and sons Brayden, six and Hudson, two.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night,” the caption read. </p>
<p>Before she was engaged to Hall, she bought the love nest, which was built in 2020 and spans over 6,000 square feet with five bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms.</p>
<p>Interior amenities include a coffered-ceiling office, a carpeted dual-level movie theater and a billiards room.</p>
<p>The quarter-acre lot overlooks the Pacific Ocean and offers a pool, hot tub, fire pit and outdoor seating and dining areas. The rooftop deck has a large fireplace and additional seating and dining areas.</p>
<p>The chef’s kitchen features granite counters, two islands, self-closing cabinets and drawers, a butler’s pantry and a windowed breakfast nook with peaked cathedral ceilings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the owner’s suite has a fireplace, a spa-like bathroom and a standalone tub, according to the listing.</p>
<p>Haack purchased the home after unloading the $5.35 million house she shared with her ex-husband, Ant Anstead. </p>
<p>The “Christina Family Trust” purchased the mansion on July 7, records show, just over two weeks after she <a>finalized her divorce</a> with the 42-year-old “Wheelers Dealers” British presenter. </p>

<h1> Experts recommend the 29 best face moisturizers for dry skin in 2022</h1>

<p>While people with oily skin have their own set of obstacles, those with dry skin have to pay special attention to their complexion — especially in the winter to avoid dry patches and flakiness. </p>
<p>One way to keep those issues at bay is with a good skincare routine and the proper products to kickstart your new regimen. </p>
<p>Keeping your skin in good shape should be a top priority. </p>
<p>“Hydrated skin allows the skin to attract and maintain its water content and prevents it from becoming dull, itchy, or inflamed,” Ramanadham added. </p>
<p>We have nearly 30 expert recommendations for those who struggle with dry, sensitive and acne-prone skin at a variety of different price points from brands like Cetaphil, La Roche-Posay, Simple, Elta MD, CeraVe, First Aid Beauty and many more. </p>

<h1> Morning habits doctors and psychologists wish you would do</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 11:00am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 11:00am </div> </div> </div>
<p>As many of us look to renew our commitments to leading a healthy lifestyle this January, updating your morning routine may be a good place to start. </p>
<p>Dr. Renita White, a board-certified OB/GYN, reiterates that there are so many aspects of the pandemic that have been hard on all of us but it has also been a time when self-care and wellness have been highlighted.</p>
<p>Below are 10 morning habits to try ASAP.</p>
<h3>1. Write something down for which you’re grateful.</h3>
<p>Other times, it can be something like nice weather, people or pets you love in your life, or a funny show you watched on TV. </p>
<p>“In addition, a randomized controlled trial found that those who listed out what they were grateful for 14 days had improved affect, subjective happiness and life satisfaction compared to the control group,” he adds.</p>
<p>Let 2022 be the year you finally start that regular meditation practice. </p>
<p>As White highlights, “even the American Heart Association advocates for meditation to improve health and decrease blood pressure.”</p>
<p>This tip comes from psychologist Elizabeth Lombardo.</p>
<h3>5. Get some natural light.</h3>
<p>Not all of us have outdoor space, but we do have windows.</p>
<h3>6. Do some exercise, even if it’s not a full workout.</h3>
<p>Can’t bring yourself to do that five-minute workout (you can!) or a Yoga with Adriene session on YouTube? Just stretch instead. </p>
<p>Check out YouTube for “stretching” and follow along with a video or simply set a timer for 10 minutes and do your own thing.</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Boyer of the Farr Institute walks around his neighborhood for around 15 minutes before breakfast most mornings. It’s probably a good idea for all of us who are able. </p>
<p>“Walking is also a form of exercise that gives me energy and helps improve my focus,” he says. </p>
<p>Walking in nature, in particular, may be especially beneficial (if you live in a city, a park or green space fits the bill). </p>
<h3>9. Do something you enjoy.</h3>
<p>Amy Robbins, a clinical psychologist and BIÂN Chicago’s director of mental health, likes to listen to music, a podcast or a book on Audible while getting ready in the morning. </p>
<h1> Insomnia in the time of COVID: Here’s how you can sleep through the night</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 11:33am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 11:33am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Chronic sleep problems have been associated with medical problems including diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure as well cognitive dysfunction and mood disturbances, the Journal <a><u>added</u></a>. </p>
<p>But before someone is diagnosed with insomnia, the CDC recommends ruling out medication side effects, substance abuse issues, depression, or other medical problems that can cause <a><u>it</u></a>. </p>
<p>Adults should try to get between seven and nine hours of sleep at night, according to sleep <a><u>experts</u></a>. </p>
<p>One of the main reasons many people have difficulty falling asleep is “anticipatory anxiety,” where a person wants to go to sleep, but starts worrying if they will actually get to sleep and can’t go to bed, he told Fox News. </p>
<p>It’s not easy to deal with this problem, Aoun admitted, “For example, try not to think about a white bear for the next 60 seconds. You can’t.” </p>
<p>Difficulty staying asleep and poor quality sleep, on the other hand, is often caused by anxiety, he said. </p>
<p>He suggests a strategy to help clear the mind before falling asleep and to improve the quality of sleep. </p>
<p>“If that fails, or in patients with history of trauma or PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], some medications can effectively improve this,” Aoun said. </p>
