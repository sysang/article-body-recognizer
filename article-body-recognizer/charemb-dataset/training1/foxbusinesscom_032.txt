<p>A more serious debate about whether the media needs to go easier on Biden is actually pretty troubling.</p>
<p>I’ve covered dozens of studies over coverage being declared positive, negative or neutral, and here’s the key fact: These studies can be useful as a rough gauge, but fail to account for tone and intensity.</p>
<p>Consider: A story that says "Joe Biden is sliding in the polls as he grapples with multiple crises and his agenda is stalled on <a>Capitol Hill</a>" would be scored negative.</p>
<p>And a story that says "Donald Trump is a racist, misogynist and psychopath who is determined to destroy this country" would also be scored negative.</p>
<p>But there’s obviously no comparison. The vast majority of even the toughest stories on the incumbent president might challenge his competence but not his character.</p>
<p><a>IT’S BIDEN’S WASHINGTON, BUT THE PRESS CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF TRUMP</a></p>
<p>Many of the stories on the former president — to this day — depict him as a fascist who would stop at nothing to install himself as a dictator.</p>
<a>used data</a> from an outfit called Fiscal Note to argue that Biden’s coverage for the last four months has been as bad as — and at times worse than — the coverage of Trump for the same four months last year.
<div> <div><p> Journalism is being undermined by a belief among some that reporters need to be activists, supporting either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>Data guru Nate Silver says many of the Biden stories are "totally random. Lots of stories about the stock market. Many have nothing to do with Biden at all (‘Haiti President Assassinated At Home, Wife Wounded’)."</p>
<p>But just for the sake of argument, let’s assume the analysis was accurate. This is Milbank’s conclusion:</p>
<p>"My colleagues in the media are serving as accessories to the murder of democracy."</p>
<p>Yep, Milbank pivots from saying the press is being too hard on Biden to the press is screwing America.</p>
<a>Covid</a>, election fraud, Jan. 6, etc.). If the media are equally tough on Biden and Trump, they are choosing the "wrong" side. Ergo, journalists must ease up on Biden.
<div> <div><p> President Biden is seen outside the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Friday, July 30, 2021. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>How is it that we haven’t learned this lesson? The solid reporting on Trump has certainly made clear what he did, but the overtly hostile hasn’t convinced anyone who doesn’t already hate the guy.</p>
<p>Ross Douthat, the New York Times conservative and no fan of Trump, <a>says</a> it is "this view of the press’s role that actually empowers demagogues, feeds polarization and makes crises in our system much more likely."</p>
<p>And if Biden’s coverage has turned pretty grim, says Douthat, "it’s turned grim for reasons that an objective and serious press corps would need to acknowledge in order to have any credibility at all."</p>

<p>Again, I don’t accept the notion that, for all of Biden’s missteps, the press has vilified him with Trump-like passion. But what the mainstream media have done has backfired big time.</p>

<h1>Showdown between Meadows, House captures DC’s dysfunctional culture</h1>
<h2>The showdown includes Nancy Pelosi, Donald Trump, Mark Meadows and more</h2>
<p>What a <a>Washington</a> classic: Everyone is suing or subpoenaing everyone else.</p>
<p>That’s what’s going on in the capital cesspool.</p>
<p>It’s a mirror of the paralysis that, with the notable exception of infrastructure, prevents our elected leaders from accomplishing much of anything.</p>
<p><a>WHY TARGETING TRUMP BY GOING EASY ON BIDEN IS INSANE FOR JOURNALISTS</a></p>
<p>But what makes the case of Mark Meadows fascinating is that he was cooperating with the House committee investigating <a>Jan. 6.</a> In fact, he’d turned over thousands of documents.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, he did an about-face … followed by a lawsuit.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a> furious? And, having walked back the account that Trump was diagnosed with
<a>Joe Biden</a>, perhaps he felt pressure to get back into Trump’s good graces?
<a>Nancy Pelosi</a> to replace them with two anti-Trump Republicans.
<p>Of course, with Bannon’s trial date set for next July, even criminal charges haven’t proven to be much of a deterrent.</p>

<p><a><u>SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES</u></a></p>
<p>The chairman, Bennie Thompson, and his vice chair Liz Cheney, fired back that the "flawed lawsuit won’t succeed at slowing down the select committee’s investigation or stopping us from getting the information we’re seeking."</p>
<p>Meadows told Fox that what he’s turned over shows "no one in the White House had any advance knowledge of anything that was going to happen on that particular day in terms of a breach of security on January 6th."</p>
<p>The horse is partly out of the barn. Meadows has already provided his texted response to a lawmaker who said the attempt to block Biden’s victory would be "highly controversial."</p>
<p>"I love it," Meadows replied.</p>
<div> <div><p> Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are seen in a Fox News photo illustration. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>He’s also surrendered a text in which he urged the president on Jan. 6 to make a public statement urging the mob that invaded the Capitol to go home.</p>
<p>Is Meadows worried about worse stuff emerging? He’s withholding about 1,000 texts that he appears to regard as personal.</p>

<h1>Biden tells Jimmy Fallon he doesn't follow poll numbers 'anymore' on first late-night appearance as president</h1>

<p>"Well, not anymore," Biden quipped during the remote <a>interview</a> from the <a>White House</a> after "<a>Tonight Show</a>" host Jimmy Fallon asked him how much he pays attention to fluctuating poll numbers. </p>
<p>"I’m joking," the president stressed as Fallon laughed hysterically and the audience clapped. "I was paying attention when they were in the mid-60s, but now that they’re in the 40s, I don't pay attention."</p>
<p>Fallon told the president he appreciated his honesty. </p>

<p>"They’re being told that Armageddon’s on the way," Biden said. "The truth is the economy’s grown more than it has any time in close to 60 years, the unemployment rate is down to 4.2% - it’s going to go lower, in my view."</p>
<p>He admitted that inflation is a concern but argued: "it’s going to come down." </p>

<p>"It’s a full plate but I think we can do it," he said. "I’m optimistic about the future, and I’m optimistic about this country."</p>
<p>"I thought it was amazing that you did that," Fallon said. </p>
<p>The president stressed the importance of a return to bipartisanship, which he said "extreme elements of the Republican Party" are abandoning. He also claimed former <a>President Trump</a> is "feeding" into partisanship. </p>
<p>Biden added that despite the current struggles, being an American is still more enviable than being a citizen of any other country. </p>

<p>President Joe Biden on Monday declared that an emergency exists in Tennessee and Illinois after the region was battered by a deadly storm system on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee requested federal emergency assistance for nine counties, seeking help with debris removal and emergency protective measures after touring storm damage. </p>
<p>The White House said in a statement that Biden’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, to coordinate all disaster relief efforts in the two states.</p>
<p>“FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. </p>
<p>Emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75% Federal funding, the statement read. -The Associated Press contributed to this report</p>

<p>Kirks’ boyfriend, Lannis Ward, tragically died in the storm. She credited an unidentified "superman" with saving her after the tornado passed. </p>

<p>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is asking President Biden to declare a state of emergency in nine counties that were hit hard by tornadoes on Friday night. </p>
<p>While Kentucky took the brunt of the storm, at least seven tornadoes hit the Volunteer State, killing four people and destroying dozens of buildings. </p>
<p>“Our emergency officials, first responders, and law enforcement brought hope where there was none in the aftermath of these storms,” Gov. Lee said. “Our effort now will be to bring as much relief as possible to these devastated communities.” </p>
<p> Biden already declared a state of emergency over the weekend in Kentucky, where at least 74 people were killed. The declaration allows FEMA to provide direct assistance and reimburse local authorities for recovery work. </p>

<div><time/><h2>Death toll rises to 74 in Kentucky, more than 100 still unaccounted for</h2></div>
<p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said Monday that the death toll from the tornadoes has risen to at least 74, and 109 people are still unaccounted for. </p>
<p> "We expect that this death toll will continue to grow," Beshear said. “With this amount of damage and rubble, it may be a week or even more before we have a final count on the number of lost lives."</p>
<p>Beshear also said that there are "way more people unaccounted for" than the current estimate of 109.</p>
<p>The 74 deaths marks a jump of 10 since the governor's press conference in the morning. Five of the people who died in the storm are still unidentified.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 homes were destroyed by the tornadoes. About 26,000 homes were without power and 10,000 homes and businesses didn't have water as of Monday afternoon, Kentucky Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett said.</p>
<div><time/><h2>McConnell: 'Kentucky has been devastated, but we have not been defeated’</h2></div>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that he will travel home later this week to survey the damage after dozens of tornadoes hit his home state. </p>
<p>"The tornadoes that hit Kentucky this past weekend were some of the most widespread, severe, and devastating in our state's history,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. "It’s still difficult to comprehend the vast scope of this storm.”</p>
<p>McConnell also thanked the Biden administration for their support after the president quickly declared a state of emergency over the weekend. </p>

<h1>US, Russia set to hold 'strategic security' talks in January</h1>
<h2>Putin demands the West block Ukraine admittance into NATO</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>Officials from Washington and the Kremlin will sit down for "strategic security" talks next month as tension over Russia's <a>military buildup</a> on the Ukrainian border continues to mount.</p>
<p>"The United States looks forward to engaging with Russia," a spokesperson for the National Security Council told Fox News Tuesday. "When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table, and we will put our concerns on the table. </p>
<p>"There will be areas where we can make progress, and areas where we will disagree. That’s what diplomacy is about," the spokesman added.</p>

<a>unfounded accusations</a> that
<a>some experts feared</a> would be used to legitimize a Ukrainian invasion.
<p>Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along its shared border with Ukraine, though Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday claimed he does not want confrontation with the former soviet state.</p>
<p>The Russian president instead demanded security guarantees from the West that Ukraine be denied access as a member nation of NATO – citing alleged <a>security threats</a> it could pose to Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its NATO allies have not said if Putin will be successful in securing his demands, but have made clear Russia will face severe economic repercussions should it violate Ukraine’s sovereignty. </p>

<p>The bilateral talks are scheduled for Jan. 10. They are a part of the previously agreed to Strategic Security Dialogue that Biden and Putin announced during their June summit in Geneva.</p>
<p>Biden and Putin are expected to address not only tensions over Ukraine but arms control and continued nuclear deterrence.</p>
<p>The Russian president will also meet with NATO leaders two days later on Jan. 12. </p>

<h1>Russia will strike Ukraine soon -- Putin is playing with Biden and NATO</h1>
<h2>There's a more than 50% chance that Putin will attack Ukraine in the coming weeks</h2>
<h4><a>Mike Pompeo urges US to put 'America first' as Russian aggression toward Ukraine continues: 'This is about power'</a></h4>
<p>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the bilateral tension, warning Vladimir Putin will continue to push the U.S. as a result of 'weak leadership.'</p>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>There’s a more than 50% chance that <a>Putin </a>will attack Ukraine in the coming weeks, regardless of the outcome of another round talks between Moscow and Washington planned for January 10 through 13.</p>
<p><a>RUSSIA WITHDRAWS 10,000 TROOPS FROM UKRAINIAN BORDER AHEAD OF PLANNED NEGOTIATIONS NEXT MONTH</a></p>
<p>The evidence Putin is about to act is overwhelming.</p>
<p><a>PUTIN BLAMES WEST FOR TENSION WITH UKRAINE, EXPERTS DIVIDED ON INVASION THREAT</a></p>
<p>In his recent statements, Putin outlined the Kremlin’s concerns about Ukraine hosting NATO offensive weapons systems if it becomes a member of the Alliance, an outcome Moscow views as an unacceptable threat to Russia’s security. </p>
<p>Putin also said last Tuesday that even if Russia’s requirements for security guarantees are met, Russia cannot trust U.S. assurances. </p>
<p>The Kremlin’s recently proposed U.S.-Russia treaty on security measures is full of un-meetable demands that intentionally violate the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy, which seeks to prevent Russia from emerging as a rival power in Eurasia. </p>
<p>Washington believes that post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine, have the right to develop as democracies, while Moscow views them as its security buffer and sphere of influence.</p>
<p>PUTIN WANTS US AND ALLIES TO GUARANTEE NATO WON'T EXPAND EAST</p>
<p>Putin is therefore building a case for taking action against Ukraine regardless of how the US responds to his demands. "We were lied to. Blatantly," Putin stated in his staged press conference with the Russian and foreign media. </p>
<p><a>A US-RUSSIA WAR OVER UKRAINE WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC</a></p>
<a>large scale high intensity conflict with Russia.</a> On the same day, Foreign Minister Lavrov accused the U.S. of trying to
<a>provoke a "tiny war" in Ukraine</a>, in order to later blame Russia.
<p>Regretfully, the Biden administration’s "experts," like Obama’s before them who fecklessly sought a "reset" with Russia, are likely to fall into Putin’s trap.</p>
