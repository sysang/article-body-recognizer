<h1> How to Treat Anxiety and Depression in People With Dementia </h1>
<h2> These conditions are common in dementia. Here are a few ways to deal with them. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>anxiety</a>, irritability, and agitation are some of the most common mood and behavior problems that individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and
<a>dementia</a> experience. In this final article of our
<a>three-part series</a>, we discuss medications that can help with these problems. If you or a loved one is living with dementia, speak to your doctor for more information.
<p>Depression and anxiety may be caused by psychological and biological factors.</p>
<p>There are few things as depressing and anxiety-provoking as being aware that one is losing one’s mind from Alzheimer’s or another neurodegenerative disease. Just worrying about dementia can cause depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Non-pharmacological <a>therapy</a> for depression and anxiety may be effective.</p>
<a>meditation</a>, and relaxation therapy are things that individuals can do for themselves to reduce their depression and anxiety. In fact, aerobic exercise may be as effective as many
<a>antidepressants</a> that are prescribed today.
<a>memory</a> loss and/or a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.
<p>Pharmacological therapy is also an option for depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Many antidepressants and anxiolytics can cause cognitive impairment. We try hard to stay away from those classes of medications. For example, we never prescribe a benzodiazepine for individuals who already have cognitive impairment at baseline.</p>
<a>sexual</a> dysfunction, along with many others. Note that this class of medications needs to be tapered down slowly if one wants to discontinue them.
<a>insomnia</a>, dizziness, anorexia, somnolence,
<p>Therapy may be most effective for irritability and agitation.</p>
<p>The first thing to say here is that we try not to use medications for irritability and agitation. We start by educating the family (or other caregivers) about the four Rs:</p>
<li>Reassure the individual that everything is alright.</li>
<li>Reconsider things from the individual’s point of view.</li>
<li>Redirect the individual to an activity that decreases the agitation.</li>
<li>Relax; the <a>caregiver</a> needs to relax when caring for the agitated individual, lest they escalate the situation with their own tone of voice and <a>body language</a>. </li>

<p>As the race to find a cure continues, I’d like to take the time to clarify some common misconceptions about Alzheimer’s disease and its parent term, dementia.</p>
<p>1. Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia, but they are not interchangeable.</p>
<a>Lewy body</a> dementia, secondary dementias, etc., as the extending branches. Nonetheless, Alzheimer’s is the most common type of dementia, accounting for
<a>60-80 percent</a> of all dementia diagnoses.
<p>2. Dementia is not just a “<a>memory</a> loss” disease.</p>
<a>American Psychological Association</a> made this very important distinction in its latest edition of the
<a>executive function</a>, complex
<a>attention</a>, perceptual-motor function, and social
<p>3. Cognitive decline doesn’t always lead to dementia.</p>
<a>mild cognitive impairment</a>, or dementia. Even a mild cognitive impairment diagnosis doesn’t ensure a future dementia diagnosis. According to a recent study performed by the Mayo Clinic, only
<a>29 percent</a> of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment progressed to dementia after five years.
<p>4. Not all types of dementia are progressive.</p>
<p>5. Lifestyle changes can help reduce the risk of dementia.</p>
<a>Studies</a> have shown that regular exercise, a routine nutritious diet, maintaining normal blood pressure, engaging in social contact, not
<a>depression</a> are just a few ways to help prevent or lower your risk of developing dementia.

<h1> Is It Normal Aging or Alzheimer's? </h1>
<h2> Ten early signs of Alzheimer's Disease. </h2>
<p> Posted August 26, 2018 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Do We Age? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist specialized in aging concerns</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<a>caretaker</a>, and planning for legal, financial, and end of life decisions.
<p>1. You start to have trouble using words in speaking or writing.</p>
<p> Normal aging means occasionally being unable to think of the right…, uhm, …word.</p>
<p>2. You have a hard time completing a routine task.</p>
<p>Examples: Forgetting how to get to the grocery store where you have shopped for years, or forgetting the rules of a favorite game</p>
<p> Normal aging might include asking a younger family member for the third time how to do Face-Time on the (!@#*) cell phone!</p>
<p>3. You have difficulty making a plan or working with numbers.</p>
<p>Examples: Trouble following a familiar recipe, repeated mistakes when balancing a checkbook, or losing track of monthly bills, “I can’t recall if I paid the bills this month.”</p>
<p> Normal aging involves making an occasional error, or missing a payment once in a while, such as when I really needed that new Michael Kors purse more than I needed to pay the cable TV bill.</p>
<p>4. You have memory loss that interferes with daily life.</p>
<p>Examples: Forgetting recently learned information, forgetting important dates or events, consistently forgetting appointments, relying on family members to remind you of things you used to remember on your own</p>
<p> Normal Aging involves sometimes forgetting names or appointments, but then being able to remember them later; such as “forgetting” to schedule that dreaded dental work.</p>
<p>5. You get confused about where you are, or what season it is, or lose track of the passage of time.</p>
<p>Examples: Wondering “Where am I? ” or “How did I get here?”</p>
<p> Normal aging might include briefly forgetting what day of the week it is, especially on a very busy day. (Actually, that happened to me during one of my <a>therapy</a> sessions a couple of days ago,… or was it yesterday?)</p>
<p>6. You experience changes in vision due to diminished ability to accurately interpret what is seen, including trouble with judging distance or seeing color or contrast.</p>
<p>Examples: not seeing the small grey cat <a>lying</a> on the grey rug and possibly tripping over her, being unable to distinguish the edges of steps due to changes in depth perception, or seeing the blue dish and the blue placemat as one object.</p>
<p>Normal aging may include having visual changes due to cataracts.</p>
<p>7. You frequently misplace things and can’t seem to retrace your steps, or you often put things in unusual places.</p>
<p>Examples: Leaving keys in the refrigerator, or a wallet next to the dogfood.</p>
<p> Normal aging does include misplacing things at times, but later being able to retrace your steps to find them. Eventually, you no doubt will find that banana you left in the back seat of your car 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>8. You have been using poor judgement, or making poor decisions. </p>
<p>Examples: Buying much more than you can ever use from that telemarketer, not showering and grooming routinely, or wearing a winter jacket on a hot day.</p>
<p> Normal aging may include making a bad decision once in a while, like that time last year when I ate the whole “kitchen sink ice cream sundae.”</p>
<p>9. You have been withdrawing from work, social activities, or hobbies.</p>
<p>Examples: Avoiding dinner with friends because you’re feeling self-conscious about your forgetfulness, or losing interest in your favorite sports team because you can’t keep track of how they’re doing anyway.</p>
<p> Normal aging may involve not wanting to go to that annual family picnic that you’ve attended for the last 85 years (enough already)!</p>
<p>Examples: Getting more frequently confused, <a>depressed</a>, fearful, suspicious or irritable.</p>

<h1> What Dementia, MCI, and Subjective Cognitive Decline Mean </h1>
<h2> Understand the terminology of memory disorders. </h2>
<h2>Dementia means problems with thinking and memory are impairing daily function</h2>
<p>When people have problems with their thinking and <a>memory</a> to the point that they can no longer function independently, they have <a>dementia</a>. People are diagnosed with dementia when three things are present:</p>
<li>Concern that there has been a prominent decline in thinking and memory by the individual, their family, or their doctor</li>
<li>Substantial impairment on tests of thinking and memory</li>
<li>The thinking and memory problems interfere with their everyday activities</li>
<p>Activities of daily living</p>
<p>Complex activities of daily living</p>
<ul><li>Performing housework</li> <li>Taking medications</li> <li>Preparing meals</li> <li>Shopping</li> <li>Paying bills and managing money</li> </ul>
<p>Basic activities of daily living</p>
<ul><li>Dressing and undressing</li> <li>Bathing</li> <li>Eating</li> <li>Using the toilet</li> <li>Controlling bowel and bladder</li> </ul>
<h2>Dementia can be caused by many different disorders</h2>
<a>migraines</a>, a blood clot, or a tumor. Just like a headache, some causes of dementia are relatively benign and easily treatable, whereas other causes are more serious and may have no treatment.
<h2>In mild cognitive impairment, there is a decline in memory or thinking, but the function is normal</h2>
<p>We use the term <a>mild cognitive impairment</a> when three things are present:</p>
<li>A decline in memory or thinking (or both) has been noticed by the individual, their family, or their doctor.</li>
<li>Impairment—typically mild—is present on tests of thinking and memory.</li>
<li>The daily function is essentially normal, although activities may require more effort.</li>
<p>Individuals with mild cognitive impairment don’t have dementia, because their function is normal.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>, thyroid disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections,
<a>medication</a> side effects, and medical problems.
<h2>Subjective cognitive decline may be a sign of a future memory disorder—but not always</h2>

<h2> The Science of Evolutionary Psychology </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some basic principles of evolutionary psychology? </h3> </div>
<a> theories on evolutionary psychology</a>, including why we engage in reciprocal
<a>altruism</a>, the nature of sex differences, and parent-offspring investment. Altruism among strangers, for example, can naturally develop because people cooperate with the expectation of receiving similar treatment from others.
<div> <h3> What is evolutionary behavior? </h3> </div>
<a>mindful</a> of danger in dark alleyways. This caution is innate and within our behavioral make-up. And our predetermined response to gravitate to that 800-calorie Cinnabon can wreak havoc, but our
<div> <h3> What is evolutionary mismatch? </h3> </div>
<p>Juggling our ancestral tendencies with the demands of <a>modern-day living</a> can be a struggle. This phenomenon is known as evolutionary mismatch—when we find ourselves in an environment inconsistent with our ancestral conditioning.</p>
<div> <h3> What is an example of evolutionary mismatch? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Concepts In Evolutionary Psychology </h2>
<a>competition</a> for mates has always been harsh. Everyone cherishes their closest kin because it's in one's best interest to preserve one's
<a>genes</a>. Humans also crave social interaction to encourage
<a>cooperation</a>, further increasing the chances for survival. Many of these behaviors are innate: How people react and interact with one another is spelled out in DNA.
<div> <h3> What is the fight-or-flight response? </h3> </div>
<a>flight or flight</a>, the brain releases stress
<a>hormones</a>, pushing the body into high alert. The heart rate rises, muscles tense, and thoughts race. While the modern-day human does not face the same threats as our ancestors did, the fight-or-flight response system remains intact.
<div> <h3> What triggers fight or flight? </h3> </div>
<a>stressful</a> event, like running late for a meeting. In people with
<a>anxiety</a>, the fight-or-flight response is more readily triggered, the brain sees certain situations as threatening, even when there's no actual present danger. In fact, there is a tendency for this response to move into overdrive in
<div> <h3> What is kin selection? </h3> </div>
<a>Kin selection</a> is the theory that our calculations about genetic relatedness to others (conscious or
<div> <h3> What is reproductive fitness? </h3> </div>
<a>attractiveness</a> are acting in ways that increase the odds of reproduction, and attempting to maximize reproductive fitness. 
<a>Reproductive fitness</a> also measures how well an organism is adapted to its environment.
<div> <h3> What is parental investment? </h3> </div>
<a>aggression</a> between males as they vie for females.
<h2> Human Nature, Explained </h2>
<div> <h3> Why are we naturally empathic? </h3> </div>
<a>developed empathy</a> and altruism, which allow us to commiserate with each other’s circumstances and act in ways that are not self-serving. What is better for the group as a whole, is better for a person as an individual.
<div> <h3> Why are we naturally drawn to our tribe? </h3> </div>
<a>keep us in line</a>—for example,
<a>shame</a> motivates us to atone for past transgressions, while pride pushes us to remain in the high regard of our peers. And as our social structures developed, so did our value systems and what we define as “right” and “wrong.”
<div> <h3> Why do people lie? </h3> </div>
<p>Trivers also suggested that <a>complex strategies of cheating</a>, detecting cheating, and the false accusation of cheating (itself a form of cheating) pushed the development of <a>intelligence</a> and helped increase the size of the human brain.</p>
<h2> Why Evolutionary Psychology Is Controversial </h2>
<a>sexual</a> behavior, for example, there is the notion that the field justifies people’s behaviors and actions. Our present-day traits and characteristics had
<a>survival value</a> for our ancestors, and these traits survived because the genes they are linked to were selected and now remain part of our genetic makeup. Shouting evolution made me do it seems so convenient.
<div> <h3> What is the naturalistic fallacy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the moralistic fallacy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do both conservatives and liberals criticize evolutionary psychology? </h3> </div>
<a>absolves people of responsibility</a>, while liberals on the left fear that accepting inherited differences hinders the goal of social equality.
<div> <h3> Why do feminists question evolutionary psychology? </h3> </div>
<a>equal opportunity</a> and equal pay, for example. They also feel that people can use evolutionary psychology to explain away misogyny, poverty, sexual misbehavior, among many areas.
<div> <h3> Can evolutionary psychology explain homosexuality? </h3> </div>
<a>homosexuality</a> is genetic. However, being gay doesn’t fit so neatly into the theory of natural selection. Why would

<h1> 9 Reasons Couples Can Look Like Siblings </h1>
<h2> Psychological research explains why couples often look like they are related. </h2>
<li>Many couples look similar to one another.</li>
<li>Reasons for this phenomenon may include in-group bias, implicit egotism, the familiarity effect, and sexual imprinting.</li>
<li>However, there are individual differences in attraction to self-resembling partners.</li>
<li>What's more, couples can grow to resemble each other over time through empathic mimicry or similarities in lifestyle.</li>
<p>But why is it that people tend to date those who look like themselves? Some explanations are obvious, but others are lesser-known. Below are 9 reasons that couples can sometimes look like siblings:</p>
<a> social network approval, perceptions of similarity, and perceived physical attractiveness</a>
<a>Whites, Black, Latinxs, and Asians</a>, but to different extents. In a
<a>study of heterosexual college students</a>, all four groups gave same-race members of the other sex higher
<a>attractiveness</a> ratings than did outgroup members, but Latinx and Asian Americans rated Whites of the other sex as more attractive.
<a>same-sex</a> daters, White men as well as White, Black, and Latinx women have a strong
<a>tendency to prefer dating only their own race</a>. Despite their relatively diverse upbringing, biracial individuals also show
<a>same-race preferences </a>in partners.
<div> <div> <div> <div>We are unknowingly attracted to those who look like us</div> <div>Source: HuyNgan / Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The morph that was the most attractive to participants contained 22 percent of their own faces. Importantly, this preference did not operate at a conscious level—participants did not recognize their own faces in the image. </p>
<a>attraction</a> to self-based morphs operates at an
<a>unconscious</a> level. Again,
<a>tendency to like familiar stimuli</a>. When we are exposed to a particular stimulus over and over, we will tend to like it more due to ease of processing. To our brains, easy means pleasant.
<div> <div> <div> <div>More attractive men and women are more likely to pair together, as are men and women who have similar facial features</div> <div>Source: tientoanmaimai10 / Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Researchers</a> sought to examine two forces of human mate selection—selection of “good
<a>genes</a>” (e.g., preference for the best) and “self-seeking like” (e.g., preference for self-resemblance).
<a>self-morphs are uniquely attractive</a>.
<p>5. <a>Sexual</a> imprinting</p>
<a>young children may learn what a desirable partner should look like through a process called sexual imprinting</a>—that is, parents may model for their children what their future partner should look like.
<p>6. Emotional closeness with parents</p>
<p>Importantly, not everyone prefers partners who look like themselves or their parents. Studies have found individual differences in these preferences.</p>
<p>7. Similar social judgments</p>
<a>perceived personality of faces predicted both facial resemblance and the likelihood that a pair was an actual couple</a>. The researchers suggest that couples may be similar in
<a>similar in their body mass index, weight, and height</a>. This resemblance in body type may result from
<a>preferences for those who are similar or from shared lifestyles</a> (in the case of weight).
<p>9. <a>Empathic</a> mimicry</p>
<a>collected images of spouses as newlyweds and 25 years later</a>. They found that spouses became more similar in looks over time, and that this increase in similarity predicted greater relationship quality.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Couples may grow to look alike through empathic mimicry (i.e., feeling similar emotions and making similar facial expressions)</div> <div>Source: OmarMedinaFilms / Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Yet research suggests that there is more than what meets the eye. Couples who look similar may also be similar in their personality, lifestyle, emotions, and facial expressions—and they may be happier together, too.</p>

<h2><a>The Maddening Inconsistency of Human Rationality</a></h2>
<p>We call ourselves Homo sapiens—wise human. We discovered the laws of nature, lengthened and enriched our lives. Yet we can be so boneheaded. What really is rationality?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Won’t or Can’t? Motivation and the Question of Free Will</a></h2> <p>How the brain’s motivational circuitry works, and the question of how much control we have over it. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>What Are “Mental Disorders,” and Are They Increasing in Youth?</a></h2>
<p>Defining mental disorders is slippery, contributing to rising rates of diagnosis and self-diagnosis. Young people are especially prone to psychiatric self-labeling.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Actually Is Evil? And What Makes People Carry Out Evil Acts?</a></h2> <p>The myth of “Pure Evil,” and the real reasons why people do “evil” things.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Should Mentally Ill Patients Have the Right to Euthanasia?</a></h2> <p>Canada will allow voluntary euthanasia for patients suffering from grievous and irremediable mental disorders. Is this decision dangerous or enlightened?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>From Fashion to Suicide: Why We Imitate Each Other</a></h2> <p>As social animals, we are highly suggestible. We see this in phenomena as diverse as placebo effects, social contagion, and, indeed, culture itself.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How Can So Many People Believe Such Weird Things?</a></h2> <p>You probably believe a few implausible things yourself. Most of us do. But it’s crucial that we all hone our scientific critical thinking skills.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is ADHD a Real Disorder or One End of a Normal Continuum?</a></h2> <p>The standard view of ADHD as one among many possible disorders may be wrong. It may be a common set of evolutionarily mismatched traits.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Where Does Morality Come From?</a></h2> <p>Despite popular belief that religion is the main source of morality, there is a large, well-established body of knowledge about the fully natural origins of the human moral sense.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Consciousness an Illusion?</a></h2> <p>The brain insists it has a nonphysical conscious essence. This may be because it evolved a simplified, abstracted model of its attention processes, with the details edited out.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Are We All Zombies? (Are Humans Truly Conscious?)</a></h2> <p>Consciousness is a user-illusion, blindly honed by biological evolution but layered with language and culture and deepened by the chemistry of emotion.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>How Consciousness Evolved as a Purely Physical Phenomenon</a></h2>
<p>The ability of nervous systems to form internal representations is fundamentally a physical process. This is key to understanding how consciousness works and how it evolved.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Evolutionary Origins of Consciousness</a></h2> <p>Consciousness is purely the product of a brain comprised of physical particles. So how come it feels like something—a subjective experience?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>What Actually Is Consciousness, and How Did It Evolve?</a></h2> <p>Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Consciousness is no exception—it seems nonphysical, but is very much a biological phenomenon.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>How Do We Know What Is Real?</a></h2> <p>Our sense of ‘Self’ is an illusion constructed by evolution, and our perceptions are like a form of virtual reality. So how can we really know what’s out there?</p> </div>
<h2><a>A Purely Physical Universe? “There Must Be Something More.”</a></h2>
<p>Science tells us the universe is fundamentally a random collection of matter and energy and we are just collections of particles. Where do purpose, meaning, and morality come from?</p>
