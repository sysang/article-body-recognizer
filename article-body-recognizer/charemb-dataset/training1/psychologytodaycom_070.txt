<p>To be diagnosed with SAD, an individual must meet criteria for major depression coinciding with specific seasons for at least two years. The individual must experience seasonal depressions much more frequently than any non-seasonal depressions.</p>
<a>psychiatric</a> disorder, most frequently a severe depressive disorder (55 percent) or
<a>alcohol abuse</a> (34 percent).
<p>Not everyone with SAD has the same symptoms, but, according to the <a>DSM-5</a>, symptoms commonly associated with the winter blues include the following:</p>
<li>Feelings of hopelessness and sadness</li>
<li>Thoughts of <a>suicide</a></li>
<li>Hypersomnia or a tendency to oversleep</li>
<li>A change in <a>appetite</a>, especially a craving for sweet or starchy foods</li>
<li>A heavy feeling in the arms or legs</li>
<li>A drop in energy level</li>
<li>Decreased physical activity</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Increased sensitivity to social rejection</li>
<li>Avoidance of social situations</li>
<p>Symptoms of summer SAD are:</p>
<ul><li>Poor appetite</li> <li>Weight loss</li> <li><a>Insomnia</a></li> <li>Agitation and <a>anxiety</a></li> </ul>
<a>depression</a>, such as feelings of
<a>guilt</a>, a loss of interest or pleasure in activities previously enjoyed, ongoing feelings of hopelessness or helplessness, or physical problems such as headaches and stomach aches.
<p>Seasonal affective disorder can be misdiagnosed as hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, or a viral infection such as mononucleosis.</p>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Treatment to alleviate the symptoms of SAD typically includes some combination of light <a>therapy</a>, vitamin D supplementation, <a>antidepressant</a> <a>medication</a>, and counseling.</p>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, skin that is sensitive to light, or medical conditions that make their eyes vulnerable to light damage may not be good candidates for light therapy.
<p>When light therapy does not improve symptoms within a few days, then medication and behavioral therapies such as CBT may be introduced. In some cases, light therapy can be used in combination with one or all of these therapies.</p>
<p>Self-care is an important part of treatment. For those with SAD, it is important to</p>
<li>Monitor mood and energy level</li>
<li>Take advantage of available sunlight</li>

<a>pregnancy</a> and childbirth, some new mothers experience the onset of a depressive episode. While mild

<li>Previous postpartum depression; one incidence may increase the risk of re-occurrence by up to 70 percent</li>
<li>Depression unrelated to <a>pregnancy</a>; a prior episode may increase the risk by 30 percent</li>

<p>While biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors influence the condition, the exact causes of postpartum depression are unknown.</p>
<p>Hormone levels change dramatically throughout pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. Researchers are examining a possible relationship between sudden shifts in hormone levels and postpartum depression.</p>
<a>hormones</a> and production drops dramatically after birth, returning to normal functioning over a period of months. Thyroid changes may contribute to the feelings of fatigue that newmothers commonly experience.
<p>Social and psychological factors can also contribute to the onset of a postpartum disorder.</p>
<p>The mother's changing role may feed feelings of inadequacy. </p>
<p>Weight gain during pregnancy can also affect <a>self-esteem</a> and increase the risk of depression, as can breatfeeding problems. .</p>
<p>Women who have their babies by cesarean birth are likely to feel more depressed and have lower self-esteem than women who had spontaneous vaginal deliveries.</p>
<p>Mothers with pre-term babies often become depressed. An early birth results in unexpected changes in routine and is an added stressor.</p>
<p>A baby with a birth defect makes adjustment even more difficult for parents.</p>
<p>The length of time the mother spends in the hospital may be related to her emotional well-being. There is evidence that early discharge increases the risk of developing depression.</p>
<p>The birth of a first child is a particularly stressful event for new mothers and seems to have a greater relationship to depression than do the birth of a second or third child.</p>
<p>Postpartum depression is treated much like other types of depression. The most common treatments for depression are <a>psychotherapy</a>, and participation in a support group, antidepressant <a>medication</a>, or a combination of those treatments.</p>
<p>The most commonly used medications to treat depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. </p>
<p>As is the case with other medications, <a>antidepressants</a> can find their way into breast milk. Women who breast-feed should talk to their doctors to determine the most suitable treatment.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Persistent depressive disorder, known as dysthymia or low-grade depression, is less severe than major depression but more chronic. It occurs twice as often in women as in men.</p>
<a>sleep</a>, low energy or fatigue, low
<a>anxiety</a> and substance use disorders.
<p>In a given 12-month period in the U.S., PDD is estimated to affect .5 percent of people. Like major depression, PDD occurs twice as often in women as in men.</p>
<ul><li>Poor <a>appetite</a> or overeating</li> <li>Sleep disturbances</li> <li>Low energy or fatigue</li> <li>Low <a>self-esteem</a></li> <li>Poor <a>concentration</a></li> <li>Feelings of hopelessness</li> </ul>
<p>In PDD, these symptoms are not directly a result of a general medical condition or the use of substances. In addition, they result in impaired functioning in work, social, or personal areas.</p>
<div> <h3> Is persistent depressive disorder less severe than major depression? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yes, persistent depressive disorder is less severe than major <a>depression</a>, but as its name suggests, the condition is chronic and can be long-lasting. It can linger without the help of a professional.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can persistent depressive disorder come and go? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, also known as dysthymia, consist of mild depressiveness that can last more than two years. The symptoms might disappear, and they might return, two months at a time. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Although its exact cause is unknown, persistent depressive disorder appears to have its roots in a combination of genetic, biochemical, environmental, and psychological factors. In addition, chronic stress and <a>trauma</a> can provoke PDD.</p>
<a>stressful</a> situation may trigger a depressive episode. Subsequent depressive episodes may occur with or without an obvious trigger. In old age, PDD is more likely to be the result of medical illness,
<a>bereavement</a>, and physical disability.
<div> <h3> Are dysthymia and cyclothymia similar? </h3> </div>
<p>Dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, is mild chronic depression. Cyclothymia is a mild case of <a>bipolar disorder</a>. A person with cyclothymia might be mildly depressed at one moment, then mildly <a>manic</a> at another moment.</p>
<a>dementia</a>, apathy, or irritability can disguise PDD. Open-ended questions are helpful: "How has your mood been recently?" This can help a physician begin to notice the signs of PDD.

<div> <h3> What is the prevalence of Tourette's disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Around three out of every 1,000 people in the United States have Tourette's disorder, and males are affected two to four times more often than females.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What additional factors are associated with the development of tics? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Studies have also shown that obstetrical complications, older paternal age, lower birth weight, and maternal <a>smoking</a> during <a>pregnancy</a> are associated with tic severity.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Although there is no cure for Tourette's disorder, the condition often improves as the individual matures. Although the disorder is generally lifelong and chronic, it is not a degenerative condition.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>, weight gain, and difficulties in thinking clearly may be more troublesome.
<a>insomnia</a> are common side effects associated with clonidine use. Fluphenazine and clonazepam may also be prescribed to help control tic symptoms.
<a>methylphenidate</a> and dextroamphetamine, usually prescribed for
<a>attention deficit</a>–hyperactivity disorders, have been reported to be effective without causing tics to become more severe. For obsessive-
<a>compulsive behaviors</a> that significantly disrupt daily functioning,
<a>fluoxetine</a>, clomipramine, sertraline, or paroxetine may be prescribed.
<p>Relaxation techniques and biofeedback may be useful in alleviating the stress that can lead to an increase in tic symptoms.</p>

<p>Most children shorten words and syllables as they’re learning to talk, but children with speech sound disorder continue this simplification process past the age when most children can produce words clearly, generally agreed to be age 7.</p>
<p>The <a>DSM-5</a> includes the following diagnostic criteria for speech sound disorder:</p>
<li>Persistent difficulty with the production of speech sounds that interferes with the intelligibility of one's speech or prevents verbal communication</li>
<li>Limitations on communication interfere with social participation or performance at school or work</li>
<li>The symptoms begin early in life and are not attributable to other medical or neurological conditions</li>
<p>Developmental experts believe that approximately half of a child’s speech is intelligible by age 2 and most speech intelligible by age 4.</p>
<p>According to the Child Mind Institute, other potential signs of a speech sound disorder include:</p>
<li>Leaving out sounds or substituting an incorrect sound for a correct one</li>

<a>Some practical advice for parents dealing with bedwetting</a> includes getting their child on a regular sleep schedule, rewarding the dry nights, and ignoring the bedwetting incidents as much as possible.

<p>For a diagnosis of encopresis, according to the <a>DSM-5</a>:</p>
<li>A child passes feces—involuntarily or on purpose—into clothing, on the floor, or in other inappropriate places.</li>
<li>This occurs at least once a month for more than three months.</li>
<li>The child is at least 4 years old (or at an equivalent level of development).</li>
<p>Encopresis can be further classified according to two subtypes: with constipation and overflow incontinence and without them.</p>
<p>With constipation and overflow incontinence:</p>
<ul><li>There is evidence of constipation.</li> <li>Leakage may or may not occur frequently.</li> <li>Episodes happen mostly during the day.</li> </ul>
<p>Without constipation and overflow incontinence:</p>
<ul><li>There is no evidence of constipation.</li> <li>Soiling is intermittent.</li> <li>Feces may be left in a prominent place.</li> <li>The behavior may coincide with the presence of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder.</li> </ul>
<a>anxiety</a> or other forms of psychopathology. Constipation can also result from dehydration or certain physiological dispositions related to defecation.
<p>When the passage of feces is intentional, the child may also have features of another disorder (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder) that involves socially unacceptable behavior more generally.</p>
<p>Painful defecation and some medications (such as anticonvulsants or cough suppressants) may contribute to the development of encopresis, according to the DSM-5. Inadequate toilet training and <a>stress</a> may also make encopresis more likely. </p>
<div> <h3> Can stress cause encopresis? </h3> </div>
<a>a second or "backup brain"</a> in the gut that can influence people’s moods and behavior. Known as the enteric
<a>nervous system</a> (ENS), this second brain processes information from throughout the body. As a result, anxiety,
<a>depression</a>, and other distressing emotions can contribute to or exacerbate physical conditions related to the gut and digestive processes, such as encopresis.
<div> <h3> What is the link between encopresis and depression? </h3> </div>
<a>self-esteem</a>. In the absence of constipation, a
<a>psychiatric</a> evaluation may help identify an underlying cause for the behavior.
<div> <h3> Can encopresis be intentional? </h3> </div>
<a>oppositional defiant disorder</a> (ODD). One sign is when a child’s feces are discovered in a prominent location, intended to be displayed. A trained therapist can help these children deal with encopresis and any related mental health issues.

<p>Signs and symptoms of dyslexia most often appear in childhood but can also occur in adults. Although everyone with dyslexia reads at lower-than-average levels for their age, symptoms vary from one person to another. The most common symptoms are:</p>
<li>Difficulties or delays in learning the alphabet, learning to speak, learning to read, or learning to spell</li>
<li>Difficulty distinguishing the order of letters in a word; individuals with dyslexia may, for example, reverse two letters in a word without realizing it</li>
<li>Misreading one letter for another; common examples include b for d, p for q, and u for n</li>
<li>Challenges with pronunciation, especially of longer words</li>
<li>Difficulty recognizing “sight words” like it, the, or and</li>
<li>Apparent struggles to distinguish the sound of one word from another</li>
<li>Difficulty recalling sequences of letters, numbers, or words</li>
<div> <h3> How common is dyslexia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Dyslexia is thought to be the most common of all the learning disabilities. Estimates of its prevalence range from as low as 5 percent of the population to as high as 17 percent, depending on the criteria used.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <h3> Is medication helpful for dyslexia? </h3> </div>
<a>medication</a> specifically recommended to treat dyslexia or that will help with its symptoms. However, children with comorbid mental health conditions, like
<a>depression</a> or ADHD, may benefit from medication; treating those conditions, in turn, may help them focus more effectively on reading and writing. 
<div> <h3> Do ADHD medications like Adderall or Ritalin help with dyslexia? </h3> </div>
<a>Adderall</a> or Ritalin can help manage ADHD symptoms, which may help a child focus better and be less distractible while reading. However, ADHD medications will not treat the underlying causes or symptoms of dyslexia.

<p>As cataloged by the <a>DSM-5</a>, the signs and symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder include:</p>
<li>Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally in verbal rages and or behaviorally in physical aggression toward people or property</li>
<li>The temper outbursts are inconsistent with the child's developmental level </li>
<li>Outbursts generally occur three or more times a week</li>
<li>Between temper outbursts, the child is irritable or angry most of the time</li>
<li>The symptoms have been present for at least 12 months, and the child has not had a period of longer than three consecutive months without symptoms</li>
<li>The symptoms manifest in at least two out of three of the child's usual settings—home, school, with peers—and are severe in at least one of them</li>
<li>The symptoms begin before age 10, and diagnosis is not made for the first time prior to age 6 or after age 18</li>
<li>The symptoms are not attributable to major depression, <a>mania</a>, <a>autism</a> spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or another mental health condition.</li>
<p>The symptoms of DMDD may overlap with those of <a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> and oppositional defiant disorder.</p>
