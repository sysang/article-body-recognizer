<div><h1>Remember cap-and-trade? It offers lessons for the Build Back Better Act, former congressman says</h1></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Maxine Joselow</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 8:16 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! If you live in the D.C. area, we hope you enjoyed the snowstorm yesterday, which some Twitter users were calling “snomicron.” ❄ </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Former congressman says demise of cap-and-trade bill offers lessons for Build Back Better</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waxman, who served as a lead author of the cap-and-trade bill when chairing the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is hoping BBB does not meet the same fate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We had difficulties which tended to be fatal,” Waxman told The Climate 202. “Build Back Better is having difficulties which I hope will not be fatal.”</p></div></div>
<a>biggest investment in clean energy</a> in the nation's history. But Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.)
<a>said in late December</a> that he could not support the bill, citing rising consumer prices, a growing federal debt and the arrival of the omicron variant of the
<a>released a campaign ad</a> in which he shouldered a rifle and shot a hole in a copy of the cap-and-trade legislation, saying, “I’ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill because it’s bad for West Virginia.”
<div><div><h5><div>Troubles with timing, filibuster</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waxman, who now runs a public relations and lobbying firm called Waxman Strategies, said he learned several lessons from his experience with cap-and-trade that Democrats could heed today. One was the importance of timing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is a myth going around that is often repeated that President Obama didn't care that much about the cap-and-trade bill. That wasn't true. His efforts were essential to get it through the House,” Waxman said.</p></div></div>
<a>targets a vote on changing the Senate rules</a> by Jan. 17 — and as the party stares down the midterm elections in November.
<div><div><p>Waxman said he enthusiastically supports changing the Senate rules requiring a 60-vote threshold, which would have ensured the passage of cap-and-trade in the chamber. </p></div></div>
<div><p>“Had they broken the filibuster in the Senate, they would have passed it in the Senate because they had a majority vote ready to go for it,” he said. “So the lesson is we shouldn't have a filibuster in the Senate.”</p></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The importance of executive action</div></h5></div></div>
<p>After Waxman-Markey fizzled out in the Senate, Obama sought to cut emissions in ways that did not require congressional approval. In 2015, he unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants.</p>
<div><div><p>If BBB flounders in the Senate, President Biden's ambitious emissions reduction goals will depend on Environmental Protection Agency regulations and executive action.</p></div></div>
<p>“[Biden] is trying to do everything he can right now with executive action. There are some things you can do, and I've recommended it to them,” Waxman said, although he declined to offer specifics on his suggestions to the White House.</p>
<div><div><p>Markey, who is now a senator, is not ready to give up on BBB.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We must get this done,” he added. “While the best time to act on climate was decades ago, the next best time is now.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Biden promised more coronavirus tests but the surge is now</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>Yesterday at 8:27 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome to The Health 202, where we can confidently say we wouldn't be as chipper as Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) sounded if we spent an unexpected 27 hours in a car.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Today, doctors are frustrated over a short supply of pills to treat covid-19, and the CDC doubles down on its isolation and quarantine guidance. But first: </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The administration is under fire for testing crunch</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Demand for coronavirus tests exploded as Americans returned from their holiday travel – but the Biden administration is still scrambling to make half-a-billion tests it promised quickly available.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I know this remains frustrating — believe me, it’s frustrating to me — but we’re making improvements,” Biden said in brief remarks yesterday before a meeting with his coronavirus advisers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>What needs to happen</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>One lingering question is how to ensure those who can’t afford to buy tests — and who lack Internet access — can get them. </p></div></div>
<li>“You can do that in a number of ways by prioritizing the Zip codes based on the social vulnerability index that CDC has,” said Andrew Sweet, managing director of covid-19 response and recovery at the Rockefeller Foundation.</li>
<li>Freeman, of NACCHO, said her group is pushing for local health departments to have access to the free tests to help distribute them to vulnerable populations, such as the homeless.</li>
<div><div><p>“If history is any indication, though, the portal’s launch could face some of the same technological stumbling blocks that have plagued similar projects in the past,” Cristiano writes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>How we got here</div></h5></div></div>
<li>Seeking to recast the pandemic fight, Biden announced a plan late last year to ship a half-billion tests to Americans’ homes, which people will be able to order through that federal website.</li>
<li>But public health experts have questioned why the administration hadn’t done more to avoid the testing shortfall seen during the holidays.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Doctors are frustrated over limited supply of antiviral pills</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden acknowledged the drugs’ scarcity in remarks yesterday, but said the government was doubling its order of Pfizer’s pill to 20 million treatment courses this year.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“Due to the complex chemistry … to make the pill, it takes months literally to make a pill,” he said. But he stressed the medication is “already saving lives.”</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Following confusion, the CDC doubles down on its isolation and quarantine guidelines</div></h4></div></div>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified the rationale behind its decision to shorten isolation and quarantine recommendations after coming under fire from public health experts who thought a negative test should be required.</p>
<div><div><p>David Paltiel, a health policy professor at Yale School of Public Health, told The Health 202 that even if testing after isolation is ideal, requiring testing would be unworkable given the national shortage in tests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here's what else you need to know:</p></div></div>
<li> A fourth coronavirus shot led to a fivefold jump in antibodies a week after the vaccine, according to The Post’s Steve Hendrix, who reports on preliminary results of a study made public by the Israeli government.</li>
<li>A CDC study reaffirmed that coronavirus vaccines are safe for pregnant women, finding no increase in preterm birth among vaccinated women.</li>
<li>Some GOP leaders are refusing to join public health officials in calling for people to get boosters, per The Post's Hannah Knowles and Lateshia Beachum.</li>
<li>Hospitals are filling up as coronavirus cases surge, but a smaller proportion of cases appear to be ending up in the ICU, The New York Times's Emily Anthes and Azeen Ghorayshi report.</li>
<li>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said he would sue the Biden administration to stop the military’s vaccination mandate from being enforced within his state’s National Guard, The Post’s Brittany Shammas reports.</li>

<div><h1>Sen. Manchin voiced his strongest support yet for Democrats' climate provisions. Will it be enough?</h1></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Maxine Joselow</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>Yesterday at 8:33 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Our sympathies go out to all of the motorists who were stranded on Interstate 95 in Virginia during the snowstorm, <a>including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)</a>. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Manchin voices support for the climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act</div></h4></div></div>
<a>statement</a> in which he asserted that BBB would “risk the reliability of our electric grid” and would spur the transition to clean energy “faster than technology or the markets allow.” 
<div><div><p>Jamal Raad, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action, told The Climate 202 that Manchin's comments on climate were “certainly encouraging.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Sinema isn't standing in the way</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before Manchin's comments, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), another moderate who has raised concerns about some aspects of BBB, has not complained about the climate language to him.</p></div></div>
<a>interview with the Arizona Republic</a> in September. Sinema told the publication that “we know that a changing climate costs Arizonans. And right now, we have the opportunity to pass smart policies to address it.”
<div><div><h5><div>‘Hell and high water’</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats on the call yesterday also cited recent climate disasters as proof of why passing the legislation cannot wait.</p></div></div>
<a>scientists said was fueled by extreme climate conditions</a>, while Schatz alluded to the rising sea levels that threaten Hawaii.
<div><div><p>“We're going to get this done, come hell or high water,” Schatz said. “Because right now we have both hell and high water.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A <a>recent Washington Post analysis</a> found that 1 in 3 Americans lived through a weather disaster last summer, including hurricanes, floods, heat waves and fires.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Durbin acknowledges delay</div></h5></div></div>
<p>Still, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) <a>said yesterday</a> that the Senate would pause work on BBB until Democrats have considered voting rights legislation, pushing a vote until the second half of January at the earliest.</p>
<div><p>“We are focused on voting rights, as we should be,” Durbin told reporters. “And I think the White House is joining us in that effort, and clearly we’ll return to Build Back Better as soon as that is done.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Raad of Evergreen Action said he felt “immense frustration” that BBB has been delayed repeatedly “and that it hasn't been moved along at the same speed as the bipartisan infrastructure bill.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That's a real concern,” he said, “because as anyone knows, the later you get into an election year, the harder it is to get anything done.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>Today at 8:13 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s according to an investigation by The Post detailing the attack. If you're on the Hill today, check out the series in print: it will be inserted into 2,700 copies of the newspaper delivered to Capitol Hill offices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Today, in health care news:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>‘Surprise’ medical bills are now illegal</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consumer alert: Patients can no longer get hit with pricey surprise medical bills — the beginning of a major consumer protection Congress passed back in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Spreading the word</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Providers are no longer allowed to send eye-popping bills to insured patients who inadvertently get care from an out-of-network provider. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s really going to be critical that the public’s aware of their rights,” said Jane Sheehan, the director of federal relations at Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.</p></div></div>
<li>Sheehan teased an upcoming public education campaign but declined to share details.</li>
<li>Before the law took effect, the federal health department conducted trainings about the ban with consumer advocates, unions, providers, legal aid organizations and more.</li>
<li>Groups, like the American Hospital Association, say they’ve discussed the ban extensively with their members and are holding office hours to answer questions on certain facets of the law.</li>
<div><ul><li>“Doctor offices are running businesses, and insurance companies are large regulated businesses, they both have pretty strong incentives not to run afoul of the law,” he said. </li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Looming</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though the law is in effect, the fight isn’t over. Major hospital, doctor and air ambulance lobbies sued the administration over its surprise billing rules late last year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The move is reminiscent of the fiery debate in Congress over how to resolve payment disputes between providers and insurers, as powerful health care giants poured millions into avoiding picking up the bulk of the tab. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“As an advocate, I think that that’s an unacceptable half measure,” said James Gelfand, an executive vice president of the ERISA Industry Committee, which represents large employers.</li></ul></div>

<p>Advisers weigh in: Earlier Wednesday, advisers to the CDC voted 13 to 1 to recommend a Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine booster for all teenagers. The vote came after the FDA cleared an additional dose for kids ages 12 to 15 on Monday. </p>
<div><div><h4><div>More fallout from the CDC’s isolation guidance</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The AMA's position: The massive doctor lobby pointed out that the CDC’s own rationale for the change notes that some 31 percent of people may remain contagious after the fifth day following a positive test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Walensky on Wednesday denied that testing shortages were a motivating factor in the CDC's decision to omit a testing requirement for leaving isolation.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Election misinformation helped fuel the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Now, climate misinformation threatens the planet.</h1></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Maxine Joselow</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>Today at 8:16 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>You can read the full investigation on The Post's website <a>here</a>. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Experts are warning of rampant climate misinformation online</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>One year after a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, experts are sounding the alarm about a new threat not only to democracy, but to the planet: The spread of misinformation about climate change online.</p></div>
<div><div><p>If 2021 was the year of misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, 2022 could be the year of misinformation about the climate crisis, according to experts who spoke to The Climate 202.</p></div></div>
<a>paper on climate misinformation</a>, agreed with that assessment. “It's completely predictable who will reject climate science: It's the same people who reject vaccines and who reject the reality of covid,” she said.
<a>misinformation about climate solutions is on the rise</a> and that
<a>climate misinformation can cancel out accurate information</a>.
<div><div><p>“I think there's a misconception that climate misinformation is not as dangerous as covid or election misinformation,” he said. “But it's an existential threat.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Twitter and Facebook's approaches</div></h5></div></div>
<a>rolled out a strategy</a> to combat climate disinformation. Under the strategy, which the company calls “pre-bunking,” users are steered toward reliable climate information with more context.
<a>tweeted</a> that the record-breaking wildfire in Colorado last week was caused by “natural” drought.
<a>Scientists have said</a> that the fire was intensified by climate change, which caused unnaturally warm and dry conditions for this time of year.

<div><div><p>Europe’s hottest summer on record would have been “almost impossible without human induced climate change,” according to a new analysis that predicts such heat could now occur every three years.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>after a summer of fire and floods that brought weather disasters up close for many around the world.
<div><div><p>The analysis estimates the likelihood of the blistering temperatures, running simulations to compare the climate today with how it would have been without human influence.</p></div></div>
<a>nearly 1 degree Celsius </a>(1.8 degree Fahrenheit) higher than that of 1991 to 2020 — will return every three years and could take place every year by the end of the century, the study found. Before the 1990s, the estimated frequency was
<b> </b>once every thousands of years.
<div><div><p>“We can be more confident than we’ve ever been about linking extreme weather events to climate change,” <a>climate scientist Peter Stott</a> said in a Met Office news release announcing the findings.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Floods, flames and heat: Images of this year’s extreme weather offer a stark backdrop for COP26 climate summit</p></div>
<a>recorded a temperature</a> of 119.8 degrees in August, a potential record for Europe that could beat the last one verified by the World Meteorological Organization in Greece in July 1977.
<div><div><p>The United Nations <a>estimates that as early as the 2030s, </a>the world could pass the goal of the 2015 Paris accord to limit warming to<b> </b>1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.</p></div></div>
<a>spurred hope and a measure of skepticism </a>from climate activists after other pledges that have fallen short in the past.

<a>vaccinated</a> but can’t — such as
<a>people who are allergic</a> to vaccine components or had severe allergic reactions after getting a first shot.
<div><p>What to do if your flight is delayed or canceled</p></div>
<div><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether your upcoming trip is absolutely necessary, says <a>LetsGetChecked</a> chief medical officer Robert Mordkin. Can you delay a month or at least a few weeks until the current surge <a>wanes?</a></p></div>
<div><div><p>If the trip can’t wait, consider driving to your destination. You will be better able to control your environment and social distance from other people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not traveling is choice number one. Traveling by car is choice number two,” says Katie Passaretti, medical director of infection prevention of health-care company <a>Atrium Health</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California at Irvine, agrees — to an extent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The best travel advice of 2021, from By The Way Concierge</p></div>
<div><div><p>Step one: Get a good <a>mask</a> and make sure it fits correctly. Madad suggests an N95, KN95 or KN94 mask for travelers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because everyone has a unique face shape, Noymer says you may need to purchase multiple mask options from different brands to find one that seals your nose and mouth the best.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The airline lost your luggage. Now what?</p></div>
<div><div><p>While traveling, refrain from taking off the mask in shared public spaces, Madad says. If you need to eat or drink something, she recommends finding a less crowded place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passaretti also recommends booking a <a>window seat</a>, where you will be farther from passengers walking up and down the aisles, and turning on the overhead air vent to improve the air flow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These tips are, of course, in addition to coronavirus-prevention basics such as cleaning your hands often and social distancing from people when possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, it may be worth having another conversation with your doctor about your vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mordkin recommends confirming with your physician that you are still not a candidate for coronavirus vaccination, as it remains the most effective defense against severe illness or death from a covid-19 infection.</p></div></div>
