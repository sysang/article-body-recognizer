<p>"When do you think <a>SpaceX</a> will land a human being on Mars?" host Lex Friedman asked Musk, the richest man in the world, worth an estimated $278 billion.</p>
<p>The South African-born tech mogul paused for over 10 seconds before finally answering, "best case is about five years, worst case 10 years."</p>
<p>Friedman followed up by inquiring about "the deterring factors ... from an engineering perspective" in terms of landing humans on the Red Planet.</p>
<p>"It's fundamentally engineering the vehicle," Musk replied. "I mean, Starship is the most complex and advanced rocket that's ever been made ... it's a lot. It's really next level."</p>
<p>"The fundamental optimization of Starship is minimizing the cost per ton per orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars," he added.</p>
<p>This past May, Starship completed its fifth high-altitude test flight, and a fly-by mission to the moon in 2023 is scheduled to be the first private lunar mission.</p>
<p>However, despite the recent advancements seen with the Starship, Musk maintained that the biggest hindrance continues to be the sheer cost of a six-month journey to Mars, as well as establishing a permanent outpost on the planet.</p>
<p>"There is a certain cost per ton to the surface of Mars where we can afford to establish a self-sustaining city, and above that we cannot afford to do it," Musk told Friedman.</p>
<p>"Right now you couldn't fly to Mars for a trillion dollars; no amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars. So we need to get that above, you know, to get that [to] something that is actually possible at all."</p>
<p>However, Musk also reiterated his belief that the window to land humans on Mars was finally open.</p>
<p>"That window of opportunity may be open for a long time, and I hope it is, but it also may be open for a short time. I think it is wise for us to act quickly while the window is open, just in case."</p>
<a>NASA</a>) landed a rover mission on the planet this past February, with an another mission planned for 2022.
<p>NASA continues to move around its timeline for a manned Mars mission, but the administration has previously stated that it hopes to land humans on the martian surface by the 2030s.</p>
<p>China's space program has also stated its intentions to reach Mars by 2033.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to SpaceX for comment.</p>

<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Enormous Asteroid Twice The Size of The Empire State Building To Pass Earth Next Week</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 12/29/21 at 4:51 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>An asteroid that could be twice as large as the height of the Empire State Building is set to pass Earth on Friday, January 7, 2022.</p>
<p>According to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), the asteroid—496860 (1999 XL136)—will pass our planet at a distance of around 8.3 million miles.</p>
<p>Earth's nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is three times as far away from our planet as the distance at which this asteroid will pass. Mars is located at an average of about 17 times this distance, around 140 million miles from Earth.</p>
<p>It will be traveling at a speed of around 37,500 miles per hour. That's around 30 times as fast as a jet fighter and around 18 times as fast as a bullet fired from a rifle.</p>
<p>The asteroid last made a close approach to Earth in April 2017 and it won't return to our cosmic neighborhood until July 2034.</p>
<p>The asteroid has a diameter of between 330 meters and 750 meters. This means that it could be as small as the Eiffel Tower, or could be double the size of the Empire State building.</p>
<p>The reason for this large difference in size estimates is a result of how astronomers calculate the sizes of asteroids.</p>
<h2>How Do Astronomers Measure Asteroids?</h2>
<p>To calculate the diameters of asteroids researchers use something called albedo, a measure of the visible light from <a>the sun</a> which reflects off the surface of the asteroid.</p>
<p>There can be a large uncertainty in size that arises from this technique because size isn't the only determining factor in how much light an asteroid reflects and the albedo depends highly on how reflective the surface of an asteroid is.</p>
<p>The other factors that majorly determine the albedo of an asteroid depends are the material from which it is composed, how that material exists at the object's surface, and also how <a>densely this m</a>atter is packed.</p>
<p>Albedo also hinges on the color of the asteroid. For example, a lighter "chalky" asteroid that has looser or dusty material at its surface could appear deceptively large to astronomers.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this, an asteroid with a charcoal-like surface will reflect less light. Thus, it could appear smaller to astronomers than it actually is.</p>
<p>This means that using this technique, from millions of miles away, a large dark asteroid can appear the same size as a small, light one.</p>
<p>Infrared light, and by extension heat, maybe a better indicator of size than reflected visible light as a<a> larger object </a>would appear brighter in infrared light, and this isn't affected by the amount of visible light it reflects.</p>
<p>According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, which operates CNEOS, the best way to determine asteroid size is a combination of observing the visual light it reflects and measuring its infrared signature.</p>

<header><div> U.S.</div><h1>America's Biggest Cities to Invest $450M More in Police Following 2020 Defund Movement</h1><div> By Jon Jackson <time>On 12/29/21 at 8:00 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Social justice movements swept through the U.S. in 2020, and calls for defunding police came along with them. Leaders of the country's largest cities listened, and police budgets were cut in many places.</p>
<p>A year later, however, those budgets have inched back up, and early indications are that 2022 could see even more funding for police departments across the country.</p>
<p>"Part of it is the crime wave and the fact that there were lots of people out there who were looking for protection," he added. "There were a lot of promises for the future...but not a lot of specifics about next week."</p>
<a>Black Lives Matter</a> protests in the wake of
<a>NYPD</a> to be around $10 billion.
<p>While the CBC noted a decrease in law enforcement costs in NYC from 2020 to 2021, it noted the city's adopted budget for the fiscal year 2022 is $10.4 billion, a spending increase of 4.7 percent from 2021.</p>
<p>Similarly, the country's second most populated city, Los Angeles, cut $150 million from its police department in 2020 only to give it a 3 percent increase (to equal $1.7 billion) in the city's current 2021-22 fiscal year budget.</p>
<p>Many people may have concluded that defunding the police, as least at this time, may not be feasible in their communities.</p>
<p>Kevin Robinson, a retired Phoenix assistant police chief and a professor at Arizona State University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, told Newsweek that "we have come as a society to rely on law enforcement for everything."</p>
<p>A Pew Research Center poll in October found 47 percent of adults said spending on policing in their area should be increased, compared to 31 percent who said the same in June 2020.</p>
<p>This sentiment was also shown recently in Minneapolis, the city where George Floyd was killed. In November, a proposal to replace the city's police department with a Department of Public Safety was voted down.</p>
<p>Skogan explained how difficult it is to reduce police budgets even if the public supported such measures. "Contractual matters about who can be laid off" plays a big part in any efforts to reduce department ranks.</p>
<p>"Around the country, the real problem for many police departments is not having too many officers; it's not having enough. It's hard to hire, and it's hard to retain," Skogan added.</p>
<p>The pandemic also dealt a heavy and costly blow to police departments.</p>
<p>Another key factor to consider is that changes to law enforcement often also require a large increase in police budgets.</p>
<p>"Police reform is expensive," Skogan explained. "You got to spend money on training, and when they're training, they're not on the field. So, you got to have more officers."</p>
<p>Skogan also noted the money necessary to institute increased monitoring of police conduct. He said, "The real cost to a body camera is about $2,000 a cam a year. That's not cheap. Reform costs money, and that's the reality."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden has led tributes to former <a>Senate</a> Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has passed away at the age of 82 following a four-year battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Biden joined other <a>Democrats</a> including the current Senate Majority Leader <a>Chuck Schumer</a> in <a>offering their condolences on Reid's death</a> and praising the former Democratic senator from Nevada.</p>
<p>"A son of Searchlight, Nevada, Harry never forgot his humble roots," Biden said. "A boxer, he never gave up a fight. A great American, he looked at challenges and believed it was within our capacity to do good—to do right."</p>
<p>"May God bless Harry Reid, a dear friend and a giant of our history," the president wrote.</p>
<p>Schumer said in a statement shared to Twitter: "Harry Reid was one of the most amazing individuals I've ever met. He was tough-as-nails strong, but caring and compassionate and always went out of his way quietly to help people who needed help."</p>
<p>"He was a boxer who came from humble origins, but <a>he never forgot where he came from</a> and used those boxing instincts to fearlessly fight those who were hurting the poor and the middle class," Schumer went on.</p>
<p>"He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends," the senator said. "He's gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day."</p>
<p>House Speaker <a>Nancy Pelosi</a> said that "America lost a titan of public service."</p>
<p>"Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people," Pelosi tweeted.</p>
<p>Former President <a>Barack Obama</a>, who worked closely with Reid during his time in office, shared a letter he had written to Reid at the behest of the late senator's wife, Landra Reid, toward the end of his life.</p>
<p>"Enjoy your family, and know that you are loved by a lot of people, including me. The world is better cause of what you've done. Not bad for a skinny, poor kid from Searchlight."</p>
<a>Kamala Harris</a>. "Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid always fought for working families and the poor. Leader Reid was kind, generous, and always to the point. Landra and the entire Reid family are in our thoughts."
<p>Representative <a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> tweeted: "Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment, Harry Reid would reach out. It was like he knew.</p>
<p>"His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it. Thank you, Senator Reid. Wishing peace and strength to his family."</p>
<a>Alex Padilla</a> (D-CA). "Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was a fighter for the American people, who stood up for working families everywhere. Angela and I send our condolences to his wife Landra Reid and entire Reid family."
<p>Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) tweeted: "I feel so lucky to have served under Harry Reid, and so sad he's gone."</p>
<p>"By midnight, Reid had succeeded," Murphy wrote. "He got the votes. The lesson I learned—there's nothing like having Harry Reid in your corner."</p>

<p>The death of John Madden at the age of 85 on December 28 has shocked the football world, with tributes flooding in from fans and close friends of the <a>NFL</a> legend.</p>
<p>The NFL announced the news with a statement which read: "Earlier today we received the sad news that the great John Madden died unexpectedly this morning. He was 85.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the entire NFL family, we extend our condolences to Virginia, Mike, Joe and their families," said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>
<p>The statement continued: "We all know him as the Hall of Fame coach of the Oakland Raiders and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather.</p>
<p>A tidal wave of tributes to the Hall of Famer have been flowing in on <a>Twitter</a> from broadcasters, former and current players as well as fans with a number of accounts tweeting out the message "RIP John Madden."</p>

<p>He wrote: "I love how many people are telling me 'I wasn't much of football fan, but I loved listening to John Madden on KCBSradio.'</p>

<p>Sports journalist Richard Graves offered a similar sentiment and highlighted the impact Madden had on him.</p>
<p>He wrote: "Truly sad news to wake up to this morning. A larger-than-life character.</p>
<p>"The voice of the NFL for me, as a kid growing up and the name on the video game that opened my eyes to the sport. There will only ever be one. RIP John Madden."</p>
<p>The Oakland Raiders also released a statement following the announcement of Madden's death and detailed his impact on the team and football overall.</p>
<p>The statement read: "The Raiders Family is deeply saddened by the passing of the legendary John Madden.</p>

<p>"In 2006, Madden was presented for enshrinement to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by Al Davis, who opened his speech by calling Madden, 'A brilliant coach. A loyal and trusted friend. A raider.'</p>
<p>"The thoughts and prayers of the Raider Nation are with Virginia, Joseph, Michael and the entire Madden family at this time."</p>

<p>Judges have generally been lenient on Capitol rioters who plead guilty in 2021, a Newsweek analysis of sentencing found. Only about one-third of the people who accepted responsibility for misdemeanor charges received prison sentences.</p>
<p>Paul Hodgkins, who was photographed on the Senate floor, was the only defendant so far to plead guilty to a felony and receive a jail sentence that was less than a year. He received eight months.</p>
<a>Department of Justice</a> data reviewed by Newsweek.
<p>Most misdemeanor defendants received probation and four sentences were a year or less. Two defendants were sentenced to 18 months of probation and 32 received either two or three years.</p>
<p>"Unlike state courts, misdemeanor prosecutions are uncommon in federal courts, but the U.S. Attorney's Office had to separate out the worst rioters when prosecuting hundreds of criminal defendants," Rahmani said.</p>
<p>In October, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan sentenced Mazzocco to 45 days in jail because if he walked away with "probation and a slap on the wrist," she believed it wouldn't "deter anyone" from attempting another attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>"The country is watching," she said. "To see what the consequences are for something that has not ever happened in this country before, for actions and crimes that undermine the rule of law and our democracy."</p>
