<div><h1>Of course Donald Trump bears primary blame for Jan. 6</h1></div>
<h2>Why do so many try to argue that he doesn’t?</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Philip Bump</div></div>National correspondent </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:45 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>WiFi password</a> for press was “SeeYouJan6!”) So they came by the thousands. The White House was
<a>involved in planning</a> a series of events that day, most obviously the rally at the Ellipse — during which Trump encouraged attendees to march to the Capitol as he again made false claims about the election being stolen.
<i>No</i> blame. Not just “Trump was not the only factor,” but “Trump was
<div><div><p>How? How can Americans believe that Trump is not culpable for what occurred, given how obvious that culpability is?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I would argue there are three reasons.</p></div></div>
<a>a three-part series</a> centered on alleging that government actors made it happen. Yahoo News’s Jon Ward
<a>looked closely</a> at the series, finding — unsurprisingly — that Carlson does not make his purported case. This is
<a>not a new development</a> for one of Carlson’s claims.
<p><b>Rationalization.</b> It has also been the case since shortly after the riot that some Trump supporters have sought to rationalize what occurred by comparing it to violence and vandalism that emerged after some protests during the summer of 2020.</p>
<a>not a great comparison</a> for several reasons, including that the scale of that violence was often wildly overstated in the conservative media (
<a>some did</a>) as much as that this rationalization was applied after the fact to diversify culpability.
<b>Delusion.</b> Less understandable is simple delusion. This overlaps with misinformation, certainly, but involves simple rejection of the obvious facts at hand. Such as that the riot was caused by antifa, a claim that emerged hours after the riot, was
<a>re-rationalized</a>. Deluded assessments of what occurred on that day are myriad and, in all cases, driven not by observed fact but desired outcome.
<div><div><p>None of us is perfectly clear-eyed about anything. But on some things, objective reality is not particularly obscured.</p></div></div>
<p>If Trump had held a news conference on Nov. 7, 2020, and announced that he recognized Biden’s win, there is no riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. It is fundamentally Donald Trump’s fault, and there is no rational way to dispute that point.</p>

<div><h1>Lawmakers howl about gerrymandering — that their side isn’t doing it enough</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</div></div>
<div><div><p>To be clear, politicians have gerrymandered the heck out of these maps for partisan gain for decades; they just generally at least pretended it was done with actual constituents and fairness in mind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a growing number of cases, they’re dropping that pretense and acknowledging this practice for what it is — or what they think it should be: about protecting their own power.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How redistricting is shaping the 2022 U.S. House map</p></div>
<a>responded angrily</a> to Georgia Republicans who added some blue territory to her extremely conservative northwest Georgia district (she’s still completely safe) and tried to add another GOP-leaning district to the state’s map.
<div><div><p>Greene added that the maps “should have fortified GOP districts for the long term instead” and called it “a losing strategy that leads into the slow slide of Georgia turning blue.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Got that? She says the map-drawers “chose to play politics” but then just as quickly says they should have adopted the specific version of playing politics that she preferred — for the good of the party.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To be clear, Trump took 57 percent of the vote in Missouri in 2020 and 56 percent in 2016. A map in which the GOP was favored in five of eight districts would give the GOP 62.5 percent of the state’s congressional seats.</p></div></div>
<a>gets to draw more than twice as many districts</a>.)
<a>used an expletive</a> to describe state Democrats’ decision to remove some Democrats from her Las Vegas-based district — the safest in the state — to make two swing districts more favorable to the party.
<div><div><p>Again, the reasoning wasn’t that this wasn’t fair — it was that it was bad politics.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said losing Democratic voters in her district “would have been worth it” if the party got two safe districts, but it didn’t.</p></div></div>
<p>New York is another state in which Democrats have some power to redraw their district lines. And in an interview with the New York Times in August, new governor Kathy Hochul (D) signaled <a>she would use the process to benefit her party</a>:</p>
<blockquote><div><b>Do you plan to use your influence to help Democrats expand the House majority through the redistricting process?</b></div><div>Yes. I am also the leader of the New York State Democratic Party. I embrace that.</div></blockquote>
<a>cut a deal a decade ago</a> to accept the then-GOP-controlled state Senate’s gerrymandered maps in exchange for Republicans supporting an anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative. (The measure passed but this week
<a>failed to deliver on the promises of nonpartisanship</a>.)
<div><div><p>A victim of that process? Then-Rep. Hochul, who lost her House district after one term when it was drawn to be more conservative.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Good morning. Today marks one year since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Four people in the crowd died, 150 officers were injured, and in the weeks after the riot, five police officers who served at the Capitol died. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Two programming notes: The Post is inserting copies of our investigative series “The Attack: Before, During and After” into 2,700 copies of the print newspaper that are delivered daily to offices on Capitol Hill. </p></div>

<div><div><h3><div>The campaign</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>On the anniversary of Jan. 6, Republican candidates are embracing the ‘Big Lie’</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Republicans have a set of not just Republican officials, but a whole ecosystem of networks to make sure that everyone passionately believes that they are being threatened.” the Democratic operative added. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>No end in sight</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Top Democrats now routinely warn that democracy is under assault in ways that would've been unthinkable a few years ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But some progressives see a disparity in the importance the two parties are placing on the issue of protecting our democracy. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We thought on Jan. 20 of 2021 that we'd successfully removed the cancer from our democracy, but what we've discovered this past year is that it's metastasized and spread,” Bassin added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Voting rights</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Senate Democrats are stalled in their efforts to roll back new restrictions on voting rights in a slew of states, plans that are likely to benefit Republican candidates and officeholders.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have rebuffed talk of updating the ECA while they're mounting a push to pass two broader voting rights and campaign-finance bills. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Sen. Chuck Schumer reiterates opposition to ECA reform instead of voting rights legislation</div></h4></div></div>

<div><div><p>He wrote that there was probably some fraud and illegal votes cast, but concluded, “Was it anywhere near enough to change the result, no.”</p></div></div>
<p>Moreno is emblematic of the modern Republican Party, echoing former president Donald Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen — a position that has become the unofficial litmus test for good standing within the GOP.</p>
<div><div><p>At least five candidates for the U.S. House were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riots, including Jason Riddle of New Hampshire, whom federal prosecutors have accused of chugging wine inside the building that day.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“There is always going to be pressure on the RNC to try to do more than it has,” Riemer said in a recent interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump has been frustrated that some in the GOP, particularly prominent Republicans in the Senate, have not been willing to echo his claims — and that an overwhelming majority of the body voted to certify the election.</p></div></div>
<p>According to a <a>Washington Post-University of Maryland poll</a> in December, 58 percent of Republicans think Biden’s election was not legitimate, and 62 percent think there is solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.</p>
<div><div><p>Moreno said “the door was flung open” to fraud and abuse during 2020 and he, like Trump, is still trying to answer one key question: “How much actual fraud was there?”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Trump and his allies, too, began rewriting the narrative almost immediately.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Nonetheless, the former president struck a defiant note, saying in the statement that protesters descended on Washington last Jan. 6 to fight “the fraud of the 2020 Presidential Election.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This was, indeed, the Crime of the Century,” he wrote.</p></div></div>

<p>LONDON — After 16 years of defying the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, while becoming the world’s most prominent underground theater troupe, the Belarus Free Theater announced Monday that its 16-person ensemble would be going into exile.</p>
<div><div><p>Like Olympic sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who defected during the Tokyo Games in August, the theater company members hope to base themselves in Poland and have applied for humanitarian visas.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But the directors said Monday that things had become too dangerous for the performers to stay in Belarus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We had to do an emergency exit,” said Natalia Kaliada, 47, who founded the troupe with her husband, Nicolai Khalezin, 57.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>MONETTE, Ark. — The tornado that destroyed the Monette Manor nursing home originated somewhere near Cash, Ark., a rural area just west of Jonesboro, area residents say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From there, it pogoed its way northeast, leaving behind piles of shattered homes, metal granaries and tree branches along Highway 18.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chad and Meghan Holland spent the early afternoon clearing out broken glass, water-damaged furniture and other debris from the two-story wood-paneled home they bought just over a year ago — their first house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They had remodeled the kitchen and a bathroom and made other improvements, with plans to settle in the tiny town for the long term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Should we move our dining room chair off of our neighbor’s lawn?” Meghan Holland asked, referring to the bits of furniture that had flown out of their home Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Just leave it,” Chad Holland said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A block away, Agustín Diaz and his family were working to shore up a portion of their home’s roof that had caved in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Diaz, who recently emigrated from Mexico, said their life in Monette had been happy, with decent jobs at nearby farms. Now, their future seems uncertain.</p></div></div>

<p>The group announced plans in November to establish a climate disaster fund, hoping to raise $1 billion over the next decade to serve people who are made food-insecure by emergencies related to climate change. It seeded the fund with $50 million.</p>

<div><div><p>Ferguson said he hopes the eight unaccounted for will be reached.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Nearly a century before several tornadoes tore through parts of the Midwest and the Tennessee River Valley this weekend, the deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history ripped across almost the same region, causing unmatched devastation.</p></div>
<p>The Tri-State Tornado was remarkable because its path of destruction was continuous for 219 miles as it traveled between 60 and 73 mph over 3½ hours. In 40 minutes, the tornado devastated five towns and killed 541 people in southern Illinois.</p>

<div><div><p>As the emergency response to the deadly tornado outbreak neared the end of its second day, Kentucky officials on Sunday evening were still struggling to assess the extent of the devastation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Scores more were injured, Beshear said, and well over 1,000 homes were destroyed across the state.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Nothing that was standing in the direct line of this tornado is still standing,” he said, adding later: “I don’t think we’ll have seen damage at this scale, ever.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beshear praised the work of first responders, including the more than 300 National Guard members who have been deployed in Kentucky, “going door-to-door.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Though many of these communities don’t have doors,” he added. “They’re going rubble-to-rubble, searching.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>Garris Street was one of the hardest-hit areas in town. On that block of wood-paneled homes, Patricia Austin, 71, and family members carried water-damaged family photos and other lost items from her house, whose roof had been torn off.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Austin was chatting over fresh coffee Friday evening, when the tornado barreled through.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If it hadn’t been for her, I would have been in my house,” Austin said about her neighbor. “She basically saved my life.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Austin appreciated her luck, but she was still heavy with grief over the loss of her co-worker and friend at the Dollar General.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>June Pennington, an assistant manager at the store, died while shielding another worker when a wall collapsed on them. The other worker had both his legs broken, said Austin, who worked as a cashier there.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>MAYFIELD, Ky. — Pastor Wes Fowler was at home Friday night when a colleague called and suggested that their families weather the approaching storm together in the basement of First Baptist Church in downtown Mayfield, Ky.</p></div></div>
<p>A tunnel runs beneath the church grounds, connecting two sides of the facility. News alerts said the storm would pass through Mayfield around 9:27 p.m. Around 9:20 p.m., the two families, with five children between them, entered the tunnel.</p>
<p>“Then pretty much in a few seconds everything just changed,” said Fowler, 45, on Sunday. “The sound changed. It became a roar. Then even the ceiling tiles in the tunnel started violently shaking and going up and down.”</p>
<div><div><p>The tunnel was pitch-black. Debris poured in, and a cloud of dust pervaded the tunnel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fowler said he and his colleague, the church’s youth pastor, pushed their families against a wall and positioned themselves on top to protect them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My wife would tell you in those moments we weren’t sure if we were going to make it,” said Fowler, crying as he recounted the ordeal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other religious leaders, including pastor Duane Fields, shared similar stories of families seeking shelter at church. Fields said two families turned to Emmanuel Baptist Church as the storm moved in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t help but cry when I talk about it,” Fields said. “Our community won’t never be the same.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would think it’ll take Mayfield 10 years to rebuild. It looks devastating,” he said. “But I do think we’re going to rebuild and get through this.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Crick, 43, served parts of McClean and Muhlenberg counties after taking office in the 45th District bench in 2011.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Crick was an elder at the Sacramento Cumberland Baptist Church and taught Sunday school there, said Brantley, who is married to the church’s pastor, Kevin Brantley.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was an honorary uncle to all the kids in the church,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She described Crick as an approachable man who loved politics and the University of Kentucky Wildcats men’s basketball team.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sacramento, four miles northwest of Bremen, was largely spared by the storm, though the town was left without power. The church held Sunday services with torches and candles lighting the sanctuary to mourn Crick.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Bags are searched and people can be fined if they don’t wear masks outside. Supermarket ­orders are allowed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>To be fair, there have been some lapses, including an incident in October that local media called a “rave,” when a couple of dozen people turned up the music and danced and partied, mostly without masks or social distancing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then there were two men pushing a third fellow around in a trash can, none of them with masks. They made similar headlines and received similar fines.</p></div></div>
<p>Based in Moscow, I missed my father’s funeral last year. At the time, about 18,000 Australians were trying to get home. When my mother became seriously ill in March, I needed to fly home. But by then, 41,000 Australians wanted to do the same.</p>

<p>The Darwin facility, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison hailed as “the best-run quarantine facility for covid anywhere in the world,” has not had cases leak into the community, as has happened with hotel quarantine in other states.</p>

<p>“Allah yerhamo,” they say. “God have mercy on him.” One man leans down: “You should be happy you are the father of a martyr. He will be your companion to heaven.”</p>
<p>Abu Saif nods without speaking.</p>
<p>“When I was his age, I thought I would someday live in a free country,” he says as the well-wisher moves off to join the murmuring crowd. “Then I thought, my son will live to see it.”</p>
<p>“I am 60 years old, and I have seen this my whole life,” he continues. “Now they have killed my own son. Even now, I know nothing will change.”</p>
<p>For people being kicked out of their houses, the settlers are in a fine mood.</p>
<p>Neighbors chat as they load hampers into hatchbacks. Children play. Men with knit yarmulkes and automatic rifles burst into song: “Am Yisrael chai — the people of Israel live!”</p>
<p>“Politicians don’t control this world. God does,” says Eli Shapira as he pauses from loading his white Nissan.</p>
<p>“It’s not only hard to imagine making a continuous state here; it’s even hard to make a continuous <i>city</i>,” Akal says, wiping his hands. “They are taking our sovereignty bit by bit.”</p>
<p>Back atop the hill, Israeli soldiers stand guard around the perimeter as the Jewish families pack up. The shouts of Palestinian protesters float up from below. Smoke from their burning tires scents the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at the highest point of the hilltop, a crane rumbles. Slowly, it lifts a huge Star of David crafted of welded steel into the air. Men scramble to cement it firmly into the limestone.</p>
<p>From Akal’s village, it can’t be missed.</p>
<p>“They know me, but still they put me through this, while the Jews just pass through,” says Hazalin, 40, wiry and bronzed from a lifetime of outdoor work.</p>
<p>Hazalin is one of 40,000 West Bank Palestinians who turn to Israeli settlements for a paycheck. Another 140,000 cross the Green Line into Israel every day for work. That’s about one-fifth of all Palestinian workers in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Many of the passing panel vans bring fruit, milk and yogurt from Israel to shops in Jewish settlements and Palestinian villages. Palestinian shoppers spend their Israeli wages on Israeli goods their own market is not producing.</p>
<p>Before he even fully stops, young boys swarm the tractor, climb into the trailer and pitch the stems and leaves down to dozens of milling goats.</p>
<p>From the opposite side, a 24-year-old Palestinian gas station attendant named Alaa Judeh enters the plaza, which Muslims revere as their Noble Sanctuary, determined to stop him.</p>
<p>But with hard-liners increasingly driving the debate, the space for compromise has noticeably shrunk.</p>
<p>As Raz approaches the outdoor staircase leading to the plaza, an Israeli police officer instructs him: Jews must not pray here — no prayer books or prayer shawls, no swaying as many devout Jews do when they pray.</p>
<p>On this day, social media had been buzzing with news that a group of Israelis would defy the prayer ban.</p>
<p>Inside, he places a reverent hand on the boulder where it is said the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Judeh inhales the musty incense aroma. Now he is ready, if necessary, to confront the Israelis wandering around the plaza.</p>
<p>Raz and his group pause in the shade of an olive tree. He begins reciting prayers, clearly if not loudly. An Israeli security officer looks at him, then looks away. After a few minutes, officers ask the group to keep moving.</p>
<p>Judeh stands at a distance, outside al-Aqsa Mosque, alert for provocations. He cannot tell if Raz’s group is praying. If they are, it is quietly.</p>
<p>But he knows that they will be back. And so will he.</p>
<p>On the night that Nizar Banat was beaten to death, it was so still you could hear trucks passing in the distance on Route 60.</p>
<p>His death has been widely blamed on the Palestinian Authority, which was established after the Oslo accords with Israel more than 25 years ago, and further inflamed the anger many Palestinians feel toward their leaders.</p>
<p>While Nizar had been sheltering in the Hebron house, he was working on a new video. This one would have highlighted examples of corruption that are much discussed over hookah pipes in Palestinian cafes but not often aired on social media.</p>
<p>“Nizar understood the public mood,” his brother Gassan says. “That is why they did what they did to him.”</p>
<p>Nizar’s younger cousins, Mohammed and Hussein Banat, had been lying next to him, chatting with him late into the night. They often stayed with Nizar to keep him company — and safe.</p>
<p>“We hadn’t been asleep long,” Mohammed recalls.</p>
<p>Immediately, more than a dozen more men came through the door and crowded around the beds, beating Nizar with bars, pistols and a bat, Hussein said.</p>
<p>“It would have been so easy to arrest him but that is not what they came for,” Mohammed says.</p>
<p>They stripped Nizar of his shirt and flipped him onto his stomach, cuffing his arms behind. Three more men entered, each wearing the vest of the Palestinian Preventive Security Force (PSF), an intelligence unit.</p>
<p>The men pulled Nizar to his feet, propped his back against a concrete column and began slamming his head into it. “Ten or 12 times they did it,” Hussein recalls, his eyes distant.</p>
<p>“They have opened a huge gap between themselves and the people,” says Gassan, locking the door to the house.” Now the people see it as Nizar did — a gang led by gangsters.”</p>
<p>South of Hebron, the Negev Desert spreads wide and dry as Route 60 winds to another military checkpoint.</p>
<p>Palestinian day laborers amass at this southern exit from the West Bank, waiting for rides into Israel. Israeli soldiers wave through most cars with Israeli plates, stop those with Palestinian ones.</p>
<p>“What they don’t understand is that they shouldn’t be afraid,” he says. “It’s just regular life.”</p>
<p>So if there’s no pressing dispute to be settled, what need is there for a solution — much less a two-state solution that would require substantial sacrifices by Israel?</p>
<p>After decades of stalemate, the status quo has been woven into the fabric of daily life.</p>
<p>Even the periodic flare-ups of violence do little to raise any sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Daniel Mamo, sipping cappuccino and listening to music on headphones outside Aroma Cafe, recalls the May air war with Hamas, when rockets fired from Gaza flew over faster than he could keep track. But when the sirens sounded, he didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“I, many times, was sitting in a cafe and didn’t move,” he says with a shrug. “And there were others all around me.”</p>
<p>Mamo, a 45-year-old immigrant from Ethiopia, thinks he has an outsider’s perspective, a bit different than that of most Israelis. And what he sees is that “we have all gotten used to despair.”</p>
<p>“At this point, the country does not allow itself to even aspire to anything different,” he says.</p>
<p>And, with a smile, he puts his headphones back on.</p>

<p>As countries compete to get vaccine doses, anger is rising in Europe that doses are flowing faster to some other parts of the world. <a>The European Union has threatened legal action</a> after AstraZeneca and Pfizer announced delivery delays.</p>
<div><p>Israel, which some European officials have noted paid a premium for its doses and gets its supply from a Pfizer factory in Belgium, says it remains on track to expand vaccine eligibility in the coming weeks to everyone age 30 and up.</p></div>
<p>“Presumably we paid more than the E.U., but we paid according to market value,” Edelstein said in an interview. “When Europeans were negotiating a deal for half a billion doses, we were negotiating for several million doses.”</p>
<div><p>“If we show that we are able to control the disease and that Israel will be able to go to near-normal life faster than any other country, that will be a marvelous commercial for Pfizer to sell all over the world,” Lahad said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment on its contract with Israel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Israel was among the first recipients of the Pfizer vaccine in early December. And the flow has continued steadily, with Pfizer flying in 400,000 to 700,000 doses every week, according to Israeli media.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Edelstein said Israel is considered a good test case because of its meticulously digitized, decades-spanning trove of data, gathered from a mandatory universal health-care system involving four not-for-profit HMOs.</p></div></div>
<p>The Ministry of Health has now opened vaccinations for citizens over the age of 35 and for those 16 to 18, a group that has recently exhibited soaring infection rates and that in coming months will prepare for high school matriculation exams.</p>
<div><div><p>Health-care administrators announced Monday that the vaccine may be even more effective than the 95 percent level found during trials.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> in the week after receiving their second shot. Among the positive cases, none exhibited severe symptoms.
<div><div><p>But Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science found that a single dose of Pfizer’s vaccine was significantly less effective than had been indicated by the company’s clinical study.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Speaking to the Davos World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could be a “world laboratory for herd immunity.”</p></div></div>
<p>Privacy worries aside, many Israelis seem to view a deal that hastens a return to normalcy as worth it, <a>especially as they trudge through their third national lockdown</a> and confront a surge of more than 8,000 new confirmed cases each day.</p>

<div><h1>The top 10 non-Biden Democrats for president in 2024, ranked</h1></div>

<div><div><p>Having written plenty about people’s decisions on whether to run for office over the years, I’ve landed on a couple rules for parsing their answers:</p></div></div>
<li>When someone says something in the present tense — i.e., “I’m not running” — there is often a reason for that. It might be strictly true in that moment, but that doesn’t mean it will hold later on.</li>
<li>If you’re going to run for reelection, you generally just say that. Saying “I plan to” or adding some qualifiers suggests that eventuality is in doubt.</li>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s running, I expect to support him and help him get reelected,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) <a>told the New York Times recently</a>. “I’m sticking with that story.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Added North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D): “I fully expect him to seek reelection, and I will support him.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Expectation.” “Planning to.” “I’m sticking with that story.” “Fully expect.” These are a lot of words, when “will run” would suffice.</p></div></div>
<a>prefer to have someone not named Biden on the ballot in 2024</a> — which is highly unusual. And as that Times story and others (including
