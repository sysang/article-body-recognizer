<h2>Robert S. Palmer watched and cheered rioters, then joined front of mob and hurled a fire extinguisher, plank and long pole at police</h2>

<div><div><p>Palmer said, “I’m really, really ashamed of what I did.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that while in jail he saw footage of himself on an MSNBC news program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was horrified, absolutely devastated to see myself on there,” Palmer said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a letter to the judge last month, he wrote, “I realize that we, meaning Trump supporters, were lied to by those that at the time had great power, meaning the sitting president as well as those acting on his behalf.”</p></div>
<div><p>About 50 minutes later, Palmer made his way down to the heart of the battle, prosecutors said, holding a wooden plank and then throwing it at officers. It landed atop a riot shield. Palmer was not accused of directly injuring anyone.</p></div>
<div><p>Police union says 140 officers injured in Capitol riot</p></div>
<div><div><p>The rubber bullet knocked Palmer down, but he soon was back up again, and lying about why he was shot, the government said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Palmer later gave media interviews portraying himself as a victim and that he had done nothing wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chutkan asked him about his online post last month, seeking to raise money for his defense, in which he said he was acting in self-defense.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When you threw the fire extinguisher and the pole,” the judge asked, “were you acting in self-defense?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No, ma’am, I was not,” Palmer replied.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later, Palmer said: “The officers were so brave to stand there and take the stuff they did. I’m just very ashamed to be a part of that. … It was a lie. It should never have happened.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chutkan said, “I don’t know if your remorse now is genuine or not. It sounds like it is. Your actions after your plea undercut that argument.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Brian Levin, who runs the Center for the Study of Hate Extremism at California State University, said that in the right circumstances, even those with weak attachment to extremist views can turn violent.</p></div></div>

<p>Sibick had never been to a Trump rally before Jan. 6, according to his defense attorney Stephen Brennwald, who said at a recent hearing that “there is nothing in his life before this that would indicate a propensity for violence.”</p>
<div><div><p>“He’s just not that person," Brennwald added.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>He later said he only decided to attend Trump’s rally that morning. He had never been to a protest before.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I wasn’t with anyone; I didn’t have any battle gear,” Reeder said in an interview with FBI agents. “The only thing in my backpack was two protein bars.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The judge, calling his account “disingenuous” and “prevaricating,” sentenced Reeder to three months in jail.</p></div></div>

<div><p>U.S. cites domestic terrorism threat in seeking seeks prison term for Hodgkins</p></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. prosecutors sought an 18-month prison term for Hodgkins, citing the need to deter domestic terrorism. Hodgkins asked for probation or house arrest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hodgkins attorney Patrick N. Leduc answered by blasting the government’s terrorism claim and warning that a harsh sentence would further divide the nation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Leduc urged Moss to heed the words in President Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address and show grace that each side of the partisan divide would claim for itself and deny the other.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Calling the Capitol breach “domestic terrorism” is “offensive and gaslighting the country, and it needs to stop. . . . It was a protest that became a riot, period, full stop,” Leduc said.</p></div></div>
<p>The lawyer attempted to liken the Jan. 6 riot to violence that marred some racial-justice protests in 2020 in Minneapolis and Portland, Ore. He also invoked the First Amendment, arguing to the judge, “We need to be very careful.”</p>
<div><div><p>Authorities have said that rioting over six hours that day contributed to five deaths, injured nearly 140 police officers, terrorized lawmakers and staffers and caused $1.5 million in damage.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About 20 people have pleaded guilty. One <a>defendant facing a misdemeanor count has been sentenced to probation,</a> and one other was sentenced to time served of six months in prison.</p></div></div>
<div><p>FBI director says domestic terrorism ‘metastasizing’ throughout U.S. as cases soar</p></div>
<div><div><p>Moss acknowledged struggling over how to weigh the violence of the overall attack and the defendant’s lesser individual role, but he knocked down Leduc’s selective invocation of the 16th president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lincoln, in his Gettysburg Address, said the Union engaged in civil war to ensure that government of, by and for the people “did not perish from the earth,” Moss noted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If we allow people to storm the U.S. Capitol when they don’t like what the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are doing, what are we doing to preserve democracy in our country?” Moss asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview afterward, Leduc called Moss “a brilliant jurist” and said his decision was “very Solomon-like.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How can I quibble?” Leduc asked.</p></div></div>

<div><p>What we know about the Capitol riot suspects</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The only way to handle this is to plead a lot of them out,” said Tom Firestone, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York who has prosecuted organized-crime cases with dozens, but not hundreds, of defendants.</p></div></div>
<div><p>DOJ seeks to build large conspiracy case against Oath Keepers for Jan. 6 riot</p></div>
<p>Some of the longest sentences among the group, experts said, are likely to be in cases of rioters accused of assaulting police. The Post analysis shows 75 defendants are charged with 88 counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, so far.</p>
<div><div><p>Many of those who were photographed inside the Capitol but were not seen attacking police, stealing property or damaging the historic building are charged only with misdemeanors.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A majority of the people arrested for Capitol riot had a history of financial trouble</p></div>
<div><div><p>Defendants who take their cases to trial typically lose their sentence reduction for accepting responsibility. A judge sets the final range and sentence.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Body-cam footage shows Capitol rioter celebrating as D.C. cop is beaten and Tasered: ‘I got one!’</p></div>
<div><p><span>Justice Dept. prepares to engage in plea talks with many Capitol riot defendants</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Also off the table, people familiar with discussions say, are deferred plea agreements, a type of pretrial diversion program in which prosecutors agree to drop charges if a defendant commits no offenses over a certain period.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Flowers said prosecutors “know this is all ‘lights, camera, action.’ Two-thirds of these people are not going to jail.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But other defendants who might initially face jail time may be able to find a way to a probationary sentence.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Engulfed in the crush of rioters storming the Capitol, D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith sent his wife a text that spoke to the futility and fears of his mission.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The text confirmed the frightening images Erin Smith was watching on live stream from the couple’s home in Virginia: The Capitol had been overrun.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Six minutes after Smith sent that text, a Capitol Police officer inside the building shot and killed a woman as she climbed through a smashed window next to the House chamber.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On his way to the District, Smith shot himself in the head.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How D.C. police made a stand against Capitol mob</p></div>
<div><div><p>Police found him in his cherished Ford Mustang, which had rolled over and down an embankment along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, near a scenic overlook on the Potomac River.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was the second police officer who had been at the riot to take his own life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>'Service and sacrifices'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For days, Smith’s wife in Virginia and his family in Illinois grieved privately.</p></div></div>
<p>Contee named three officers. One was Brian D. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer who collapsed after engaging rioters and later died. Another was <a>Howard Liebengood</a>, 51, a Capitol officer who took his own life three days after the riot.</p>
<div><div><p>The third was Smith.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Howard Liebengood had been guarding the U.S. Capitol since 2005</p></div>
<div><p>“I think that officers are suffering from this,” said Violanti, who studies suicides by police officers. “There’s a feeling of a huge lack of support, not only from the public but from administrations.”</p></div>
<div><p>Officer Brian Sicknick recalled as a hero who died defending the Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p><a>About 850 D.C. police officers — nearly a quarter of the force — responded to the Capitol riot</a>, and 65 were injured in hours of hand-to-hand combat. More than 70 Capitol Police officers were hurt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officers were struck with poles, dragged down stairs and sprayed with bear spray. One suffered a heart attack.<b/>Another lost a finger, D.C. police said<a>.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Contee knew the emotional toll would be devastating. One officer, he recalled, had told him the siege was scarier than two tours as a soldier in Iraq.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Self-styled militia members planned on storming the U.S. Capitol days in advance of Jan. 6 attack, court documents say</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We wanted to get to the most people in the least amount of time,” Contee said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Smith’s family attorney said the officer did not attend any counseling sessions while he was on sick leave. He also said no one from the department contacted Smith about attending.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>An unbearable return</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Smith, a car enthusiast who grew up in Illinois, moved to the D.C. area 12 years ago after graduating from college with a degree in sociology, having spotted openings on the D.C. police force.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He spent his career in the 2nd District, his latest beat roughly 40 square blocks east of the White House.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He met Erin, who works for an executive search firm, several years ago on the Internet; they shared a love for cars, a topic that dominated their initial conversations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They married in 2019 and settled in Virginia.</p></div></div>
<p>He took careful care of his prized black 2015 Mustang and his Rottweiler-lab mix, which predated Erin. “We always joked,” she said, “it was the car, the dog and me.” Feb. 2 would have been their second anniversary.</p>
<div><div><p>But he mostly shielded his wife from the intimate and sometimes scary parts of his job.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There were events that I’m sure happened that bothered him,” Erin said, but he didn’t want her to worry.</p></div></div>
<div><p>When Trump and others were silent after the Capitol breach, D.C.’s mayor stepped up</p></div>
<div><p>At 9 p.m., he told two supervisors he was in pain from being hit by the pole, and he was sent to the Police Fire Clinic in Northeast Washington, run by a contractor and the first step for nearly every officer injured on the job.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He checked in at the clinic at 10:15 p.m., according to records shared by his family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On his police injury form, he wrote: “Hit with flying object in face shield and helmet.” He added that he “began feeling pain in my neck and face.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He checked out 1:31 a.m. on Jan. 7, his status listed as “sick,” though no diagnosis is noted. Erin does not know if he told the staff about any emotional issues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He told me it was chaos,” she said of the clinic. “There were so many people there.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The chief described care given to officers as “adequate” but noted, “We can always do better.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Timeline: How law enforcement and government officials failed to head off the Capitol attack</p></div>
<div><div><p>Erin has questions about her husband’s care at the Police Fire Clinic. She said he told her he was seen for only about 10 minutes when he returned Jan. 14 and was approved to return to work the following day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Erin is convinced the trauma of Jan. 6 made the thought of returning to policing unbearable for him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If he didn’t go to work that day,” Erin said, “he would still be alive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>'Silent injuries'</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Raskin’s son was buried</a> after taking his own life on New Year’s Eve.
<div><div><p>But classifying Smith and Liebengood’s deaths as “in the line of duty” could be difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts caution that suicide is not typically due to a singular event, even a traumatic one, and precise reasons are generally rooted in a wide variety of factors that are often never fully understood.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the interview, Contee sidestepped whether he would support such a request for Smith. A spokeswoman for Capitol Police did not return a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The attorney for Smith’s family, David P. Weber, has enlisted the help of two members of Congress from Virginia, where the two officers lived. A representative for Sen. Tim Kaine (D) said he supports the family’s efforts.</p></div>
<p>Rep. Don Beyer (D), who represents the district where Smith lived, said the officer died “pretty much as a direct result” of the riot. “We need to recognize that his death also was tragic, and his actions also were heroic.”</p>
<div><div><p>She believes her husband also deserves a place among the heroes who battled at the Capitol that day.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Capitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after he confronted rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection, the District’s chief medical examiner has ruled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the days after the riot, police and a Justice Department official attributed Sicknick’s death to his efforts to contain the riot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But exactly what caused Sicknick’s death has remained unclear for more than 14 weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Efforts to reach Sicknick’s family on Monday were not successful, and Capitol Police said in a statement that the family had asked for privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Officer Brian D. Sicknick recalled for his ‘shared humanity’</p></div>
<b/>which prosecutors could argue contributed to the strokes. But he said that “any defense attorney . . . would use the medical examiner’s conclusions as clear-cut evidence of reasonable doubt.”
<div><div><p>In early February, Sicknick, who grew up in South River, N.J., was honored at the U.S. Capitol. His remains were interred at Arlington National Cemetery.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His death is being investigated by D.C. police, who handle all deaths in the District; the Capitol Police; and the FBI.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Capitol Police said in a statement soon after the riot that Sicknick “was injured while physically engaging with protesters.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Geldart said Diaz “felt he was able to make this call in good conscience.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In March, two men — Julian Elie Khater, 32, of Pennsylvania, and George Pierre Tanios, 39, of West Virginia — were accused of assaulting Sicknick with chemical spray during the riot.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At the time of the arrests, the autopsy had not been completed. Tanios’s attorney, Beth Gross with the federal public defender service, declined to comment on the ruling. Attorneys for Khater on Monday did not respond to inquiries.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Arrest papers allege that Khater and Tanios were at the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol at 2:14 p.m. on Jan. 6, where Sicknick and other officers were standing behind metal bicycle racks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Give me that bear s---,” Khater said to Tanios on a recorded video, according to court documents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About nine minutes later, those documents say, after Khater said he had been sprayed with something, Khater is seen on video discharging a canister of a toxic substance into the face of Sicknick and two other officers.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Two arrested in assault on police officer Brian D. Sicknick, who died after Jan. 6 Capitol riot</p></div>
<div><p>In a statement after Sicknick died, his family said, “Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember.” The family said at that time that the “direct causes” of his injuries were unknown.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Sicknick grew up in a New Jersey borough south of New Brunswick, the youngest of three brothers. He is survived his siblings, Ken and Craig, his parents Charles and Gladys Sicknick, and his companion of 11 years, Sandra Garza.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), paid tribute to Sicknick on the Senate floor on Jan. 19, saying the officer understood “that wearing that uniform, wearing that badge, that you had a sacred duty to protect this sacred space.”</p></div>
<p>Sicknick joined the New Jersey Air National Guard in 1997 and had been assigned to the 108th Air Refueling Wing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. The Guard said he deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1999 and to Kyrgyzstan in 2003.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Spencer S. Hsu</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 6, 2021 at 2:17 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>A federal judge has warned that the lead felony charge leveled by the government against Capitol riot defendants could be unconstitutionally vague, potentially putting convictions at risk of being overturned on appeal.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hundreds of people stormed the Capitol. Most won’t face hefty prison terms, legal experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Unless we can tell the public where that line is, there’s a problem,” Moss said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>University of Michigan law professor Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor, called the argument raised by Moss “creative . . . but one that is not likely to prevail.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump’s election fraud claims propelled them to the Capitol on Jan. 6. His ongoing comments are keeping them in jail.</p></div>
<a>Three Percenters </a>groups accused of
<a>conspiring </a>and preparing in advance for violence. Others who face the charge include scores of individuals not accused of violence or destruction but of some of the most egregious conduct — such as occupying the Senate chamber,
<a>sitting in the vice president’s chair</a> and
<a>targeting government officials</a>.
<a>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a> after a corporate fraud crisis wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value, including the early 2000s collapse of
<a>Enron </a>Corp. and accounting giant
<div><div><p>Moss said he thought it “a little odd” that Congress truly meant to adopt a sweeping anti-obstruction statute in Sarbanes-Oxley “without mentioning a word of it in any of the debate.”</p></div></div>
<a>overturned the conviction of former national security adviser John Poindexter</a> for “corruptly obstructing” a congressional inquiry into the
<a>Iran-contra affair</a>, finding the statute did not clearly encompass simply lying to Congress.
<div><div><p>“This may be an issue in which both parties and the government have an interest in resolving sooner rather than later,” given the number of Jan. 6 cases, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In court, Justice Department appellate-section attorney James I. Pearce acknowledged that “it is a difficult question” and “a complicated thing.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Capitol riot defendants facing jail have regrets. Judges aren’t buying it.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We certainly don’t want to spend a lot of time and prosecutorial energy and resources prosecuting cases only to find [our] view of the statute . . . is not the [court’s],” Pearce said.</p></div></div>
<a>“Where is Mike Pence? We’re going to hang Mike Pence,”</a> all qualify as historically unique acts of wrongful obstruction, Pearce said.
<div><p>“This particular type of conduct I’m not aware of having been prosecuted under this statute before,” Pearce said. “But I also think what we saw on January 6th was unprecedented in scope and violence.”</p></div>
<div><div><div>THE CAPITOL RIOT</div><div><div>HAND CURATED</div></div></div></div>
<header><div><div>Legal Issues</div></div><div><h1>D.C. judges express frustration about possible leniency in Capitol riot cases</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Weiner</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 26, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal judges in Washington are questioning whether rioters who have admitted to storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 in support of President Donald Trump are being treated too leniently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judges have also pressured defendants to explain why they were in the building that day and express contrition, even if their plea agreements do not require such admissions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The friction comes from the minor role each individual played in the day’s overall horror. More than 570 people have been charged in what the Justice Department has called the largest investigation in U.S. history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell has suggested more people should face the felony charge of obstructing the official certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“They seem to feel like there is a level of severity here that the government sometimes hasn’t accounted for in their charging decisions,” said Greg Hunter, a defense attorney involved in several Capitol riot cases.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department declined to comment for this report.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Judge asks why Capitol rioters are paying just $1.5 million for attack</p></div>
<a>warned</a> that the Justice Department needs to better explain its rationale for using that charge.
<div><div><p>Judges have stepped in, trying to force defendants to explain their actions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Was your purpose in entering the Capitol building . . . to protest against Congress certifying the electoral college vote?” Howell asked one defendant last week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After a long pause, Leonard Gruppo replied that he was “there to support the president.”</p></div></div>
<a>has said</a> that footage of rioters inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 resembled “a normal tourist visit.”
<div><div><p>Gruppo replied, “No, ma’am.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She did not accept his plea until he agreed that he was in the building “as part of a demonstration in support of President Trump.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In another hearing, she called the charge a “puzzle” because “demonstrating is typically about something.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors have said the people offered these deals are getting credit for admitting guilt quickly and agreeing to cooperate with the government in the sprawling investigation.</p></div></div>
<a>had just seen evidence</a> he assaulted police.
<div><div><p>Judge Thomas Hogan said he knew “the government was trying” but questioned why new video was only found that day by <a>online sleuths</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have to make sure we have everything we need to have,” he cautioned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One recent plea to the same charge was nearly derailed when Boyd Camper of Montana refused to sign a document that said he “knew that he did not have permission to enter the building.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was incredulous, asking his lawyer, “Despite that he sees people pushing police down and the barricades down?”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Not patriots, not political prisoners — judges confront riot defendants</p></div>
<div><p>Remorse and responsibility are explored in more depth at sentencing hearings, which usually take place several months after a plea. Some judges have dropped the issue of culpability, saying they will take it up again down the road.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It may not be necessary” today, Judge Amy Berman Jackson told one defendant who struggled to explain why he was inside the Capitol, “but may be important at the time of your sentence.”</p></div></div>
<a>expressed acute regret</a> for her actions, saying that while she did not personally commit violence she now realized she had contributed to a “savage display” that was “disgraceful to our country.”
<div><div><p>Yet a few days later, the same woman <a>told Fox News</a> that “where I was at . . . people were very polite,” and that she only walked in to help an elderly demonstrator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Noting that interview, at a subsequent plea hearing Hogan questioned whether prosecutors were “getting true acceptance of responsibility.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“What’s the plan?” one had asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve got an officer down!” another had shouted.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>in November after almost 21 years on the force, and will officially leave the agency in mid-January. “I look at officers’ faces, and they’ve changed. They’ve lost weight and they don’t know why.”

<div><div><p>Luchette had considered looking for a new job before Jan. 6. By July, he had found one.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>a sharp increase over the previous year.
<div><p>At the same time, the number of threats being made against members of Congress or the Capitol soared to about 9,600 in 2021 from less than 4,000 in 2017, <a>Chief Thomas Manger told The Post </a>in an interview published Monday. </p></div>
<div><div><p>On a typical day, <a>the 290-acre Capitol complex is a veritable city</a> unto itself, spread out over multiple blocks, with its own subway system, an array of cafeterias and a workforce approaching 30,000 people.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> having kept many employees at home. Yet, no matter where they were as the insurrection unfolded, Capitol employees could not help but feel violated as they saw rioters invade and vandalize their workplace.
<div><div><p>Another former House staffer, a Democrat who quit months after Jan. 6, said the toll of that day grew as time passed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Douglas, a cancer survivor, had taken a medical leave at the start of the pandemic. Although he was not working on Jan. 6, he said the insurrection was another signal that he should not return.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The dangers, the risks were not helpful,” he said. “I did not need that in my life.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Douglas, who was then president of AFSCME union Local 626, which represents hundreds of laborers and custodians, said few blue-collar workers could afford to quit after the attack, even if they wanted to leave.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hours after the riot ended, some were back at work, repairing doors, removing broken furniture and cleaning up cigarette butts, shattered glass and other trash left behind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘An ever-present fear’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the insurrection, heavily armed platoons of National Guard troops and 10-foot-high fencing surrounded the campus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few months later, a motorist rammed his car into <a>two Capitol Police officers, killing one</a> and injuring the other.</p></div></div>
<a>he had a bomb</a>. That his claim turned out to be false did not ease the anxiety engulfing the Capitol.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Are you okay?’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The events of that day and the ensuing weeks of distress altered her plan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I take a shower, I hear the radio,” she said. “The calls were terrible.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For 22 consecutive days beginning on Jan. 6, Breiterman worked around-the-clock, staying in a D.C. hotel where the department put her up with other officers whose grueling schedules kept them away from their families.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All the while, Breiterman said, officers seldom talked about what had transpired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Are you okay?” she recalled asking a fellow officer whose vacant stare alarmed her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No,” the officer replied. “I’m not.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Anything could happen’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>When he left the Capitol complex late on Jan. 6, Jabir McKnight, then the communications director for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), arranged for a friend to pick up him and a co-worker in a car.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At another time, McKnight might have called an Uber. But in the hours after the insurrection, he wondered if his driver could have been part of the mob at the Capitol, some of whom carried Confederate flags and shouted racial epithets.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The way they were navigating the building was among the most frightening parts of the experience,” he said. “Were you let in? Did you have prior understanding?”</p></div></div>
<a>kidnap Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a>.
<p>McKnight began to reevaluate his purpose and how he could be “part of positive change in a way that is most authentic for me.” He also was concerned about his safety at work, where he now felt like “anything could happen.”</p>
<div><p>“It wasn’t a one-day event,” he said of Jan. 6, recalling the weeks of round-the-clock news coverage, mounting security and fear of new attacks. “I wasn’t comfortable. We were all uncomfortable.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>By the end of February, McKnight had taken a new job at an IT consulting firm.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others such as Gabby Richards were already<b> </b>exhausted by the tumult of Trump’s presidency, his tweets, the debates over his border policy, impeachment, the Mueller report and the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The what-ifs associated with that day are terrifying in the same vein as what happened,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It felt like something bad had happened, and I didn’t want to be there anymore,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats were not the only ones who felt anguish.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A former Republican staffer who was at the Capitol complex on the day of the riot said it was difficult for aides within her caucus to cope with what had occurred as many GOP leaders began downplaying the attack’s severity.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“These were the very people we were supposed to be working on behalf of,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘We’re gonna kill you!’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Months after the insurrection, Jay Rupert has grown accustomed to recurring dreams of the mob storming into his office inside the Capitol, above the entrance to the East Front, where he had locked himself in with a cluster of journalists.</p></div>
<p>In actuality, the rioters had screamed, “We’re gonna get you!” and “We’re gonna kill you!” as they banged on the door. But no one had made it inside, except for in his dream, where he is prepared to fight.</p>
<div><div><p>“I want to bash them in the face,” said Rupert, 49, deputy director of the House Periodical Press Gallery. “I can only do it in my dream.”</p></div></div>
<p>Another House employee, a friend he’s known for more than two decades, was shaken enough by Jan. 6 to leave. But Rupert said that the mob had only made him more committed to the Capitol, where he has worked in various capacities for 25 years.</p>
<div><div><p>“I came to that defiant conclusion that night,” he said. “You’re not going to stop me from doing what I do.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The constant reminders of that day — the ubiquitous video footage, the unrelenting news coverage — have made the past year daunting.</p></div></div>
<p>When he walks downstairs from his office to the area inside the entrance of the East Front, he often thinks about what he saw that day as the mob assembled outside — “the faces in the windows,” their expressions twisted with rage.</p>
<div><div><p>When that happens, he said, it will be impossible to know if someone who had been part of the mob is “in my hallway taking a tour.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What if they sneak a knife in, he wonders. What if they find his office?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The thought, he said, “makes my head want to explode.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest</p></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, the alliance dispatched about 2,500 peacekeepers to Kazakhstan, the group’s secretary general, Stanislav Zas, told the Russian state new agency RIA. The report did not give a breakdown on nationalities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The stakes are especially high for Russia, effectively the leader of the alliance, as its presence risks alienating a public that is demanding a change in Kazakhstan’s regime but has yet to show any anti-Russian sentiment.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Kazakhstan will test Russia’s actual capabilities. It will be both distracting and sobering.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were been multiple reports of gunfire around the city throughout the day, and on Thursday evening Almaty police reported that additional “terrorists” were killed outside the Almalinksy district police station.</p></div></div>
<p>At least eight law enforcement officers have been killed, according to the Interior Ministry. More than 1,000 people have been injured in the protests, the Health Ministry said Thursday, 400 of whom have been hospitalized, with 62 in intensive care.</p>

<p> An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a prosecutor who spoke at the hearing. It was Assistant U.S. Attorney Jamie Carter, not Assistant U.S. Attorney Mitra Jafary-Hariri. The article has been corrected. </p>
<div><div><p>“It seems like a bit of a disconnect,” Howell said — “muddled” and “almost schizophrenic.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The parading charge carries a sentence of at most six months, with no supervised release.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Probation should not be the norm,” Howell said, but added that Griffith should not be punished more than others who engaged in similar conduct. Instead, she put him on probation for 36 months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other federal judges in D.C. have ignored probationary recommendations from prosecutors and imposed jail time in riot cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, Griffith told the judge his behavior was “truly disgraceful.”</p></div></div>
<p>“I am ashamed of the way I acted,” he said. At the time of the break-in, he said, he thought it was a “minor inconvenience” for police, but he now understood they were “crippled by fear and wildly outnumbered.”</p>
<div><div><p>The goal, he said, is “to make the victims whole.” Howell shot back that “it doesn’t even come close.”</p></div></div>
<p>It is unclear legally whether a judge can impose a sentence of jail time followed by probation for a petty offense such as parading. Prosecutors argued Howell could, while Griffith’s attorney maintained she had to choose one or the other.</p>
<div><div><p>The law is clear that a person can serve a mix of probation and intermittent jail time, prosecutors said. But Howell said it did not seem wise to have defendants going in and out of the prison system during an ongoing pandemic.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Former Va. priest responsible for protecting children charged with child sexual abuse</h1></div>
<h2>Terry Specht, 68, of Donegal, Pa., was indicted last week by a grand jury in Fairfax County with two felony counts related to sexual abuse of a child under 13</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Weiner</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 28, 2021|Updated December 28, 2021 at 3:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A retired priest who for years oversaw the safety of children in Arlington’s diocese is charged with sexually abusing a child.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Specht “maintains his innocence,” Fairfax public defender Dawn Butorac said. “He’s a retired priest, being put through this 21 years after the alleged event.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Virginia attorney general began investigating in 2019 when the alleged victim called a hotline set up for that purpose; that same year, the archdiocese said it had received an allegation and reported it to law enforcement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The diocese has turned over “all information available to us about the allegations,” Catholic Diocese of Arlington spokeswoman Amber Roseboom said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The case is one of three church abuse investigations being pursued by Attorney General Mark R. Herring’s office.</p></div></div>
<a>sexually abusing a teenage boy in the late 1990s</a>, when he was a parochial vicar at
<a>St. Mary of Sorrows Church in Fairfax</a>. He has previously denied the allegations from the 1990s.
<a>permanently removed</a> his right to act as a priest.
<div><div><p>“The Diocese of Arlington has a zero-tolerance policy for abuse and continues to be fully committed to training our clergy, staff and volunteers to identify and report suspected instances of abuse,” Roseboom said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A trial is scheduled for October 2022.</p></div></div>
