<h1> How Everyone Can Become Resilient </h1>
<h2> Cultivate the characteristics shared by resilient people. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Resilience? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>attention</a> to people who are models of resilience. For example, we love to tell stories about individuals with debilitating injuries or chronic illnesses who overcome their pain to succeed personally and professionally.
<p>Below are characteristics that resilient people have. In my practice, I’ve noticed that resilient people possess a particular set of traits. Cultivating these in yourself can help you be more resilient. </p>
<p>Characteristics of Resilient People: </p>
<a>goals</a> in spite of mistakes or setbacks.
<a>gut feelings</a>. Individuals with good intuition are more resilient because their intuition becomes the tool they use effectively when other resources are not available. Intuition is developed by observing
<a>the environment</a>, actively listening to others, and thoughtfully processing information instead of making a quick decision.
<a>anxiety</a> paralyze them. Becoming tolerant of uncertainty requires learning to sit with anxiety and discomfort when we don’t know the outcome of a situation.
<a>gratitude</a>. Being grateful means acknowledging the small steps in the journey, and appreciating life for its value, even when it doesn’t go the way we want.
<a>this study suggests</a> that psychological resilience increases “physical well-being via more effective coping,” while
<a>this research concludes</a> that resilience leads to a longer life. The optimist in me wants to believe that—by cultivating these traits—resilience is possible for everyone.
<a> <p>Carla Shuman, Ph.D., is the owner and director of Mindful Solutions, LLC in Arlington, Virginia, a private practice that provides comprehensive mental health services with a mission to promote resilience.</p> </a>

<h1> How Memories of Events in Your Past May Affect Perception </h1>
<h2> New research suggest our episodic memories may help train our perceptual system. </h2>
<li>It is well-known that to be able to categorize an item (e.g., a car), we need recognition memory of the item. </li>
<li>New research indicates that our perceptual capacities may also depend on recollections of our individual past experiences.</li>
<li>Recollections of our individual past experiences may improve our perceptual capacities by fine-tuning categories in our recognition memory.</li>
<li>These new findings are surprising, as many studies have shown that recollections of our individual past experiences often are highly unreliable.</li>

<h3>Recognition Memory and Memory Templates</h3>
<a>discrimination</a> also appear to depend on a type of long-term memory known as episodic memory.
<p>Psychologist Endel Tulving (1972) compared episodic remembering to mental time travel, allowing you to be a "fly on the wall" in the life of your younger self and "re-experience" episodes from your past.</p>
<h3>Injuries to Memory Areas in the Brain Can Compromise Perception</h3>
<h3>New Research of the Effects of Episodic Memory on Perception</h3>
<p>The data showed that the more times the computer simulation had replayed information encoded in episodic memory, the better the system performed on visual discrimination tasks.</p>

<h1>Living with Emotional Intensity</h1>
<p>From healing to thriving, the misfit’s way. </p>
<div> <h2>Finding Inner Peace During Your Family Reunion</h2> <p>Even after years of breaking free from home, minutes into a reunion can have us regressing back into feeling and behaving like a vulnerable child or a raging teenager again.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Our Fear of Intimacy</a></h2> <p>It may seem paradoxical at first glance, but the answer to healing from defensive non-attachment is actually to affirm our autonomy and resilience. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h2><a>Our Quest for Love—What Do We Really Want From Our Partner?</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can't help but act out of unrealistic demands and projections. When our partner disappoints us, the situation provides valuable information. </p>
<div> <h2><a>Are Your Loved Ones "Out of Sight, Out of Mind"? </a></h2> <p>Although the push-pull behaviors in our current relationships seem to be triggered by our partner, they are actually a result of old fears we carry from our childhood.</p> </div>

<p>By and large, these men fall into one of two categories: (a) men who are out of touch with their inner emotional worlds, and (b) men who are being judged according to a double standard and are therefore quite rightly angry about it.</p>

<h2><a>I Didn’t Find My Passion Until I Was 50 Years Old</a></h2>
<p>It took me a half-century to figure out what I was truly passionate about and then commit to it. In the meantime, I just did work that was interesting enough and that was fine.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Do the Results of That Study Really Apply to You?</a></h2> <p>Scientific research is great at telling us how people typically behave. But the results don’t tell us how everyone behaves, or how we should behave.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Single: Do You Let People Know How You Really Feel About It?</a></h2> <p>If we don’t own up to our love of being single, we contribute to the myth that no one really wants to be single.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Moms with Husbands: More Chores, Less Sleep than Single Moms</a></h2>
<p>A study of 23,088 mothers found that married mothers tend to get less sleep, spend less time on leisure, and do more housework than single mothers. Time spent on childcare was the same.</p>

<div> <div> <h2><a>19 Ways to Show You Care About Your Friends</a></h2> <p>Think of all the ways we acknowledge, include, honor, and celebrate romantic partners. Let’s do the same for our friends and everyone else’s. </p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Saying No When Everyone Wants and Expects You to Say Yes</a></h2>
<p>The "Affirmative No" is "the refusal to pursue a course of action that, on serious reflection, you discover is not right for you." It can be the most important act of your life.</p>
<div> <h2><a>How the Pandemic Created a Cohort of Secure Single People</a></h2> <p>They didn’t want to stay single. Then the pandemic happened, and they discovered something they may never have realized otherwise: Single life suited them.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Why the Longing to Couple Can Feel Natural When It Isn’t</a></h2>
<p>Research on the pressure to "couple up" in 4 nations suggests that the forces can be powerful and pervasive, but not fully appreciated as we try to make sense of our own longings.</p>
<h2><a>What Needs to Change Now That So Many People Live Alone</a></h2>
<p>The number of people living alone has been surging. But the practical and psychological changes that should accompany this demographic juggernaut are instead lagging behind. </p>
<h2><a>Not Getting Enough Time Alone Can Be a Problem</a></h2>
<p>Not getting enough quality time with other people can be a problem. Loneliness hurts. But not getting enough time to ourselves can also be bad for our psychological health. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>It's Not Just Love: Some Stay Married for the Health Insurance</a></h2> <p>Couples that might divorce sometimes stay together when one person is dependent on the other for health insurance.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>What Is the Opposite of Loneliness?</a></h2> <p>A viral essay gave a people-centered definition of the opposite of loneliness. But the opposite of loneliness can also have nothing whatsoever to do with being with other people.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Coupling Is No Longer Compulsory</a></h2> <p>Heterosexuality, sexuality, romantic attraction, and coupling can seem compulsory. But those cultural mandates are being challenged.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <h2><a>Singles Experience More Prejudice and Some Think That’s OK</a></h2> <p>People who see single people as more of a coherent group may be less inclined to think it is acceptable to be prejudiced against them. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Singles Invest More in Friends, Enjoy Payoffs in Self-Esteem</a></h2> <p>Single people invest more in their friends and then enjoy even closer friendships and higher self-esteem. It is different for people with romantic partners.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Is It Normal to Be Single?</a></h2> <p>What do people mean when they ask if it's normal to be single? If they seem invested in hearing that the answer is no, what is the psychology behind that? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Is There Anything Good About Loneliness?</a></h2> <p>Loneliness can be an intensely painful experience. Yet, as is true for depression, we may be wrong to think about it only in negative ways. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Single People Least Likely to Get the Help They Need</a></h2> <p>When single people in the U.S. need help most urgently, they may be less likely to get it if they are not seniors and don’t have kids.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Staying Single, Not Having Kids: What You Want to Know</a></h2>
<p>People who were once in society’s shadows aren’t so invisible anymore. They include people who stay single, who don’t have kids, who like being alone, and don’t obsess about sex.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why So Many Happy Couples Live Singly</a></h2> <p>Solitude matters to people who love being single, but people in committed couples can crave it, too.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Singlism, a Word I Coined, Is in the Dictionary</a></h2> <p>The word singlism has just been added to the Cambridge Dictionary. Here’s the history and meaning of the term and why the injustice that it names matters. </p> </div>
<h2><a>Half of Men in the U.S. Who Marry for First Time Are Over 30</a></h2>
<p>The increasing age at which people first marry is changing mindsets and skillsets, in ways that may benefit those who do eventually marry and those who stay single.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Couples With Supportive Friends, Kin May Be More Likely to Divorce</a></h2> <p>New research suggests that married people who have emotionally supportive friends and family are more likely to divorce. How should we think about that?</p> </div>
<h2><a>Old and Alone: Even Professionals Do Not Understand This</a></h2>
<p>Old people often enjoy the time they spend alone. Their caregivers, and students training to be gerontologists, don’t always understand that, a new study shows.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Tales from the Crypt: Living Single 40 Years Ago</a></h2> <p>Imagine banks openly denying credit to highly qualified women, solely because they're single. For Joan DelFattore, that's not imagination. It's memory.</p> </div> </div>

<h1> The Psychology of Parasocial Relationships </h1>
<h2> People often feel they're in a deep relationship with a total stranger. But why? </h2>
<li>Social cognition is the mechanism that allows someone to model another person's consciousness.</li>
<li>Research suggests that when a person is deprived of close relationships, this modeling process intensifies and is turned inward.</li>
<li>This leads some to develop parasocial relationships: in-depth feelings of connection with people they may hardly know, such as celebrities.</li>
<p>This is part 3 of a multi-part series on the neuromarketing of <a>loneliness</a>. Part 1 examines the <a>Psychology and Business of Loneliness</a>, while Part 2 explores <a>The Rising Loneliness Economy</a>.</p>
<p>As humans, we have at least two unescapable tendencies when it comes to social interactions: We can’t help being judgmental, and we can’t help trying to figure out what the other person is thinking. </p>
<a>cognition</a>. At the end of the day, it comes down to creating an internal model of another person’s mind.

<p>What are parasocial relationships and why do they develop? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Loneliness on Social Cognition</h3>
<p>While celebrities are common objects of parasocial love, these relationships can develop with everyday people as well. And it's here where we see social cognition taken to a deeper level. </p>
<p>Donald Kaufman: I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want.</p>
<p>Charlie Kaufman: But she thought you were pathetic.</p>
<p>Donald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago. </p>
<a>friendship</a> and know where they stand with the other. But with parasocial relationships, it's all one-sided. And strictly speaking, from the standpoint of social cognition, Donald is right: “You are what you love, not what loves you."

<a>romantic relationships</a> with photobooths. We’ll return to the concept of loving inanimate objects shortly. But in describing her experience with human relationships, she distills the idea of one-sided love perfectly.
<h3>How the Psychology of Loneliness Impacts Parasocial Relationships</h3>
<a>self-esteem</a> might use their parasocial relationships to see themselves more positively, much like people with high self-esteem do with their ‘real’ social relationships.

<p>A parasocial relationship is safe. Your favorite celebrity cannot reach out of a magazine article to reject you. This has changed somewhat as social media has developed, but that’s still rare.”</p>
<p>All told, loneliness may drive us to connect with other people in a more “one-sided” way than we otherwise would. It's social cognition turned up and turned inward. </p>
<p>It turns out, that these feelings can also be directed at non-humans. In part 4, we explore the <a>psychology behind attachment to robots and inanimate objects</a>. </p>

<h1> Power Struggles in Love? </h1>
<h2> They're about value, not power. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>body language</a>, and facial expressions.
<p>In addition to the fact that they’re triggered by loss of value, not power, power struggles bring escalating pain in love relationships due to the following:</p>
<ul><li>No one falls in loves to feel more powerful. </li> <li>Condemning emotions—<a>anger</a>, resentment, contempt—feel different from how they look.</li> <li>Principles of emotional interaction. </li> </ul>
<p>I’m quite certain that few people who read this post fell in love with <a>fantasies</a> of power:</p>
<blockquote> <p>"I'm going to make this sucker do whatever I want!"</p> </blockquote>
<a>fear</a>, always resentment, but never value. You cannot criticize, stonewall, nag, manipulate, coerce, or threaten someone into genuinely valuing you. And you cannot feel valuable while exerting power over loved ones.
<p>Couples in power struggles act as if they can change the negative impressions partners have of them by:</p>
<ul><li>Arguing. </li> <li>Contradicting. </li> <li>“Reasoning."</li> <li>Ridiculing.</li> <li>Devaluing.</li> </ul>
<p>All the above worsen the negative impressions held by partners, who feel betrayed when there is no compassion in their loved one's behavior.</p>
<p>The foundation of empowered love relationships lies not in exerting power but in creating value, through interest, compassion, and care. That is the only way to change the negative impressions partners have of each other.</p>
<a>cooperation</a> and mutuality of giving we are likely to experience.

<h1> 3 Evidence-Based Lessons for Living a Good Life </h1>
<h2> Studies point the way to a good life, even if you got off to a rough start. </h2>
<li>Cultivate social relationships for a happier, healthier, longer life.</li>
<li>If you had a tough <a>childhood</a> and you struggle with low <a>self-esteem</a>, <a>intimacy</a>, <a>shame</a>, and/or <a>anxiety</a>, consider exploring <a>mindfulness</a>-based methods of cultivating self-compassion and self-acceptance.</li>
<li>One key to success in life is finding the right fit for who you are, in love, work, and other domains. You don’t have to heal all your old wounds and "fix" all your imperfections to live a happy and meaningful life. </li>
