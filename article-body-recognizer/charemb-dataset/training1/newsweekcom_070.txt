<h1>How the Real Estate Industry Can Better Support the American Dream</h1>
<h2>Owning property is not just about knowing you will never be at the behest of a landlord.</h2>
<div> Johnny Hanna , <a>CEO and Co-Founder of Homie. Prior to Homie, Johnny was President and Co-Founder of Entrata.</a> <time> On 12/7/21 at 3:54 PM EST </time></div>
<div> Experts <a>Real estate</a></div>
<p>The American Dream is in a stranglehold. Homeownership is no longer a common goal for many U.S. citizens, and this hasn't happened by chance. The real estate system needs to evolve, and it needs to happen now.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, most Americans seemed to understand the value of homeownership without prompting or hesitation. It was a traditional rite of passage and a mark of financial maturity.</p>
<p>Then something changed. While it's fair to say this shift may be related to newer generations being less fixated on staying in one place, it is far more likely that prospective homeowners simply face barriers their parents and grandparents didn't.</p>
<h3>The True Value of Homeownership</h3>
<p>Owning property is not just about knowing you will never be at the behest of a landlord. In addition to security and that feeling of home, owning property is also the key to unlocking wealth — even generational wealth.</p>
<p>On average, homeowners have a <a>net worth that is 40 times</a> greater than renters. Owning a home gives you access to creating, building and growing personal equity, so why aren't more people enjoying this wealth?</p>
<h3>A Self-Imposed Industry Barrier</h3>
<a>up to four times higher</a> than those in Australia and the United Kingdom. While this may benefit the individual agent, the additional cost increases the overall price of the house and is a contributor to the rapid appreciation in housing costs.
<p>Technology <a>has changed the way</a> real estate agents sell. They are able to reach far more people than ever before through the internet and social media. Viewing properties is also far easier with digital walkthroughs.</p>
<a>three in five Americans (61%)</a> agree that the COVID-19 pandemic has put more financial strain on the home buying process.
<a>74% of Americans</a> polled said they would like to see alternatives to the traditional agent sales system.
<p>Here are some common-sense solutions that should be widely considered.</p>
<p>1. Fixed commission fees: Some companies are starting to put a portion of these commissions back in their clients' pockets by charging sellers a flat fee, regardless of the price of the home.</p>

<div> Experts <a>Investing</a></div>
<p>For many investors near retirement age — or anyone concerned about protecting their wealth — the economic impact of COVID-19 echoed losses from the Great Recession.</p>
<p>In 2008, investors with traditional portfolios and 401(k)s — assets many thought were shielded from massive market corrections — <a>watched as their retirement funds plummeted by 20% or more</a>.</p>
<h3>What are Alternative Investments?</h3>
<p>With significant <a>tax incentives</a>, many investors turn to energy assets to take advantage of inflation hedges and seek quick returns from an investment in an upcoming energy project.</p>
<p>Among real estate and commodities, private equity remains the alternative investment with the highest risk and highest rate of return.</p>

<div> Experts <a>Health Care</a></div>
<p>Not really. The argument now is that technology allows for an ever greater connection—a connection that is constant and consistent. As a team from Deloitte put it in <a>a February 2020 post</a> on the website Modern Healthcare:</p>
<p>There are ample indications that she is on the money. The Deloitte team noted that well before the pandemic — all the way back in 2016, in fact — spending in the virtual health market was expected to mushroom to $3.5 billion by 2022.</p>
<a>seven in 10 Americans</a> grew leery of visits to doctors' offices and embraced virtual care. Such visits accounted for
<a>70 %</a> of appointments in the early months of the crisis (up from 8% previously). That's a promising development indeed, as patients had long before discovered that while
<a>virtual appointments</a> were shorter, they made possible greater interaction with physicians, as well as
<a>more direct involvement</a> on the part of consumers in their own care.
<p>That same report indicates that there will be a shortfall of between 37,800 and 124,000 doctors by that same year. In other words, there will almost certainly be more people suffering from chronic conditions and fewer people to care for them.</p>
<a>achieving the latter aim</a> by being user-friendly for patients and providers, by actively engaging all parties and by offering evidence-based insights.
