<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysian floods death toll rises to 46 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The death toll from Malaysia's <a>worst floods in years</a> rose to 46 on Saturday (Dec 25), with five people still missing, officials said, as work crews continued a massive clean-up on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Days of torrential rain caused rivers to overflow last weekend, swamping cities, cutting off major roads, and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.</p>
<p>Selangor - Malaysia's most densely populated and wealthiest state, encircling the capital Kuala Lumpur - has been one of the worst-hit areas.</p>
<p>Many in its flood-hit state capital Shah Alam were left stranded in their homes with barely any food for days, before being evacuated on boats in a chaotic rescue operation.</p>
<p>Inspector General of Police Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani said that the death toll rose to 46 people as more bodies were recovered, with the majority of the fatalities in Selangor and Pahang states.</p>
<p>"There are still five people missing. We hope they will be found soon," he told a press conference.</p>
<p>He said that 54,532 people were still in more than 300 evacuation centres across seven states, and 68 roads remained closed due to flooding.</p>
<p>Work crews used backhoes and lorries to remove items strewn across the streets outside people's homes, Acryl Sani said as he called for caution because some rivers remained swollen.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim had earlier urged the government to hold a public inquiry following the widely criticised flood response.</p>
<p>Poor coordination between government agencies and the delayed deployment of the military "turned the response to the natural disaster into a human, governance disaster", he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has admitted that there were <a>"weaknesses"</a>, but pledged improvements in future.</p>
<p>Malaysia is hit by floods annually during the monsoon season, from November to February, but those at the weekend were the worst since 2014.</p>
<p>Global warming has been linked to worsening floods. Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, <a>climate change</a> increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Heavy rains displace thousands in northeast Brazil </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SALVADOR: More than 11,000 people have been displaced in the Brazilian state of Bahia due to flooding, with authorities scrambling Saturday (Dec 25) to provide relief to residents without alternate housing.</p>
<p>The heavy rains have killed 17 people since November, including the latest death on Thursday, the state's civil protection agency said.</p>
<p>A total of 4,185 people were seeking shelter, according to data released by the agency on Friday, after the rains struck 19 cities particularly hard, including Guaratinga, Itororo and Coaraci in the state's south.</p>
<p>The agency reported that a total of 11,260 people had been forced to flee their homes.</p>
<p>The Bahia and federal governments mounted a joint operation on Saturday, in collaboration with other states, to mobilise personnel, aircraft and equipment, as well as provide relief to residents in the flooded areas.</p>
<p>"We are fully mobilised, taking all measures to ensure the necessary support to the victims of the heavy rains that hit Bahia this Christmas," the state's governor, Rui Costa, said in a video message.</p>
<p>Flooding and traffic blocks were reported on 17 roads, with some caused by landslides and rockslides, the state's infrastructure secretary reported.</p>
<p>December rainfall in Bahia's capital Salvador totalled 250mm through Friday, a figure five times the historic average, city officials said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Asia stocks, oil struggle as Omicron worries weigh </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Asian stock markets were generally weaker with US crude in holiday-thinned trading on Monday (Dec 27), as uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant weighed on investor sentiment.</p>
<p>US airlines have <a>cancelled or delayed thousands of flights</a> over the past three days due to COVID-19-related staff shortages, while several cruise ships had to cancel stops after <a>outbreaks on board</a>.</p>
<p>In Asia, China reported its highest daily rise in local COVID-19 cases in 21 months over the weekend as infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, the country's latest COVID-19 hot spot.</p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei lost 0.20 per cent while South Korea's Kospi fell 0.11 per cent.</p>
<p>Mainland Chinese shares, though, were mixed, with Shanghai's benchmark sliding 0.37 per cent but an index of blue chips edged 0.05 per cent higher.</p>
<p>Australia, Hong Kong and Britain are among markets closed Monday for holidays.</p>
<p>"There is concern over the widening spread of the Omicron variant, which is overall making people cautious about taking stocks higher" in Japan, said a market participant at a Japanese securities firm.</p>
<p>Emini futures point to a 0.1 per cent rise for the SP 500 when it reopens.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange markets, the US dollar continued to languish near the bottom of its range of the past month against a basket of major peers, after hitting a 16-month high in November as Federal Reserve policymakers turned more hawkish.</p>
<p>The dollar index was about flat at 96.116, towards the bottom of the range from 95.544 to the 16-month peak at 96.938 reached on Nov 24.</p>
<p>In the crude market, US West Texas Intermediate futures fell 59 cents to US$73.20 a barrel. The contract did not trade on Friday because of the US market holiday.</p>
<p>Brent crude though rose 26 cents to US$76.40 a barrel, rebounding from Friday's 71 cent decline.</p>

<h1> How exactly does poor sleep affect your health? What’s the sweet spot for a good night’s rest? </h1>
<div> <p>Besides increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes, sleep deprivation muddies clear thinking, dampens one’s sex drive, and impacts the way you eat. All reasons to aim for six to eight hours of shut-eye.</p> </div>
<p>Sleep – both its quantity and its quality – is one of the most frequently discussed health topics. How often have you told a friend or relative, “I’m exhausted, I was up half the night"?</p>
<p>Remote work gave many people more hours in the day for personal use, but at the same time turned the workday into a 24/7 endeavour, with emails, texts and Zoom calls occurring at odd and often unpredictable times.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>POOR SLEEP TAKES A TOLL ON MIND AND BODY</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Even those who sleep soundly but for fewer than the commonly recommended seven or eight hours a night may not be as medically well off with short sleep cycles as they think.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>THERE IS A SLEEP SWEET SPOT</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <section> <blockquote> For optimal health, there seems to be a sweet spot of six to eight hours of nightly sleep. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Sleep deprivation was a factor in some of the biggest environmental disasters in recent decades, including the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, the 1986 nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl and the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>HOW WE SLEEP MAY IMPACT HOW WE EAT</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>FOSTERING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Experts offer a variety of tips for getting a better night’s sleep. Among them:</p>
<p>– Avoid all sources of caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, as well as a big heavy meal close to bedtime.</p>
<p>– Practice good sleep hygiene. Go to bed and get up at about the same time each day.</p>
<p>– Do not use alcohol to help you unwind. Try a warm bath or meditation.</p>
<p>– Reading before bed is great, as long as it’s not on a computer or tablet that emits sleep-inhibiting light.</p>
<p>– If outside light impedes sleep, install light-blocking shades or curtains or use a sleep mask. If noise is a problem, use earplugs or a white-noise machine.</p>
<p>– Consider cognitive behavioural therapy, which challenges underlying thoughts or behaviours that may be keeping you up at night.</p>

<h1> The enduring power of dreaming big </h1>
<div> <p>After 20 years inspiring dreams around the region, Porsche Asia Pacific has captured the spirit of pursuing one’s passions with a new partnership with a local NGO and a new short film.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Brand Studio </a> </div> </div>
<div><div> <h6> Brought to you by </h6> </div> </div>
<p>“So I decided to build it myself.”</p>
<p>The result of acting on that dream was 1948’s Porsche 356 Roadster No.1, an enduring icon that embodied Ferry’s vision of what the perfect sports car should be. </p>
<p>The results of these efforts are already coming in:53 per cent of all Porsche cars sold across the region in the third quarter of 2021 were either full electric or plug-in hybrids. </p>
<p>One of Porsche’s strengths is its ability to reinvent itself while staying true to its sportscar roots. Indeed, perhaps it’s this unshakeable core that gives the brand the freedom to explore true innovation. </p>
<p>But every great adventure has its moments of crisis, and although Porsche has been able to dream big, it too has stayed true to its core tenet of pioneering spirit whilst staring down the path to potential oblivion.</p>
<p>To commemorate its 20th anniversary in the Asia-Pacific region, Porsche recently released an inspiring short film. It traces the growth of two young individuals who pursue their dreams not by following the herd, but by blazing their own path.</p>
<p>Their story celebrates the power of dreams and salutes the determination of dreamers. It pays homage to the company’s founders and the dreams that have led Porsche in the past, including many that would have seemed far-fetched at the time. </p>
<p>An SUV with the performance and handling of a sportscar? Porsche did it with the Cayenne. A practical, fast-charging electric sportscar? Porsche pulled it off with the Taycan.</p>
<p>Who knows what other dreams out there are about to turn into reality, but here’s to dreaming big, aiming high and hitting new heights for the future.</p>
<p>Find out more about how far the power of your dreams can really take you. </p>

<h1> Squid Game in a village, Myeong-dong blues: A first-timer’s visit to South Korea via VTL </h1>
<div> <p>The land of K-pop, K-drama and kimchi beckons with the opening of the vaccinated travel lane – and CNA Lifestyle's Khoo Bee Khim gets her first taste of South Korea.</p> <p>In partnership with Korea Tourism Organization.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>If I had to choose one Squid Game challenge easy enough to save my life, it would be the one with dalgona candy. Patience and precision would be my motto. Licking, my killer move.</p>
<p>FIRST TIME IN KOREA FOR FIVE DAYS</p>
<p>My visit to the Korean Folk Village was part of a whirlwind five-day tour hosted by the Korea Tourism Organization. </p>
<p>True enough, the discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant in late November caused a tightening of borders in many countries.</p>
<p>Then, it announced the need to show vaccine passes at a range of venues, including restaurants and cafes, while private gatherings were reduced to six in the greater Seoul area, and eight outside of it.</p>
<p>Even the loud thumps from underneath the plane as the landing gear retracted and the whooshing noise as the plane took off sounded oddly nostalgic.</p>
<p>But what reminded us that these weren't ordinary times were the Korean Air flight attendants in PPEs and masks, masked passengers, and the longer-than-usual immigration checks that took our group more than two hours to clear. </p>
<p>EVERYTHING WAS FAIR GAME</p>
<p>Another place where we had some hands-on experience with tradition was at Sumi Village in Yangpyeong, where we got to make jjinppang or steamed bun. </p>
<p>Before heading into Seoul itself, we had a little tour of Incheon, which many Singaporeans regard as just an airport city for transiting through. </p>
<p>Right next to the art complex is the Open Port Area or Gaehangjang. Our hosts must have heard how adverse Singaporeans are to exercise on vacation for they arranged for these pimped-up, Victorian-styled electric carts to drive us around. </p>
<p>As our mini convoy of carts trundled down the historical, narrow streets, we saw a mishmash of European, Japanese, Chinese and Korean building styles – reminders of the area’s historical connections to the rest of the world since the 1890s.</p>
<p>One of the things I was asked by colleagues and friends to check out was the famous Myeong-dong shopping district. Was it really dead quiet as we’ve seen in YouTube videos? </p>
<p>It was past 8pm on a weekday when we arrived at Myeong-dong. The area did seem like it had taken a hit during the pandemic. Yes, it was a weekday but we didn’t expect to see just a lone busker playing his guitar. </p>
<h2> ESSENTIAL APPS FOR GETTING AROUND </h2>
<p>These free apps can help you to get around South Korea more independently. Others are essential for you to download:</p>
<p>Quarantine-Report Self-Check: This app appears to work only if you download it using South Korea’s network. You need it to update your temperature and health status daily. </p>
<p>KakaoTalk: It's the preferred messaging app in South Korea. You can also use it to hire private cars. </p>
<p>Naver: This will help you to navigate as Google Map doesn’t work well here. The downside is, it often requires the addresses to be in Korean. </p>
<p>Subway Korea: It's the equivalent of our MRT app that shows you the stations and lines. </p>
<p>Google Translate: Useful when you're trying to figure out the street signs and names to get to your PCR centre.</p>
<p>Seoul isn’t short on mall experiences and the newest kid on the big city block is The Hyundai Seoul, a modern retail space with plenty of room to navigate (great for social distancing) and the most whimsical aesthetics.</p>
<p>That area was just minutes away from Cafe Onion, which was located in an industrial area that wouldn’t look out of place in, say, Defu Industrial Park.</p>
<p>RICE AND EVERYTHING NICE</p>
<p>Over at our first dinner at Pinetree Seafood Kitchen, also in Incheon, I had sungnyung, a Korean after-meal digestive created by pouring water or tea over the scorched rice layer sticking to the bottom and sides of the rice pot.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's a case of the grass is greener on the other side, or in this instance, the fried chicken is crispier on this side of the DMZ. But eating and drinking felt more convivial and freer.</p>
<p>A visit to the hospital while abroad, in ordinary times, would spell trouble. But in this pandemic that we're still grappling with, such a trip is mandatory for a pre-flight PCR test. </p>
<p>The flight home was a bit of a deja vu, from the check-in process at Incheon International Airport (which also took a while) to landing at Changi Airport (another PCR test, of course). </p>
<p>But no matter. I was able to hop into a taxi and go home right after the swabbing. Then, with an email alert the next morning declaring me COVID-19 negative, my first South Korea experience was done and dusted.</p>
<p>Let’s hope the next time I’m back, things will be better – a busier Myeong-dong and a chance to finally ace that dalgona candy challenge. </p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle was in South Korea at the invitation of Korea Tourism Organization.</p>

<h1> Singapore to South Korea via VTL: A guide on what to do before and during your trip </h1>
<div> <p>What documents should you print out? When do you schedule the PCR tests? And what can you expect when you arrive? CNA Lifestyle answers your travel questions.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>If you have been itching to travel to South Korea, you may already be making plans to take advantage of the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme that started on Nov 15. </p>
<p>But how are things different from pre-pandemic days when you only need to step up to the check-in counter with just your boarding pass and passport? </p>
<p>What documents do you have to prepare? How many PCR or polymerase chain reaction tests do you have to undergo both in Singapore and South Korea? </p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle's Khoo Bee Khim, who is currently in Seoul, answers some questions you may have about the situation in South Korea.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>DO I HAVE TO FLY WITH SPECIFIC AIRLINES?</p> <p>Yes, you do. The VTL scheme only applies to Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PREPARE BEFORE LEAVING SINGAPORE?</p>
<p>Here's a check list. Do print out at least two copies of each document (except your passport) and save a soft copy of each document onto your handphone.</p>
<p>1. Passport: Ensure it has at least six months validity.</p>
<p>2. Korea Electronic Travel Authorisation (K-ETA): Apply online here at least 24 hours prior to departure (pay 10,000 won, which is around S$11.50). You don't have to fill in any other immigration card at the airport.</p>
<p>3. Vaccination certificate: You must upload your document and notarise it here.</p>
<p>4. Travel insurance policy: Minimum coverage of 30 million won (about S$34,000).</p>
<p>5. Negative pre-departure PCR test result: To be obtained within 72 hours before departure time. You'll also need to have it notarised.</p>
<p>6. Book on-arrival PCR test at Incheon International Airport: You have to make an online reservation for your PCR test at Incheon International Airport before travelling. It costs about 135,000 won to 180,000 won (S$150 to S$200). </p>
<p>7. Book on-arrival PCR test at Changi Airport: This is for when you return to Singapore. You can book it here.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE STEPS AFTER ARRIVING AT INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT?</p>
<p>It helps to make the process more hassle-free if you have the necessary documents (see above) on hand. We found it useful to keep all the documents in a folder and carry it with you onto the plane. </p>
<p>It also helps to keep your hands as free as possible (stash away your travel pillow, handphone, et cetera) as you’ll be taking out various documents at various check points. </p>
<p>CAN THOSE WHO HAVE RECOVERED FROM COVID-19 TRAVEL TO SOUTH KOREA? WHAT IF MY PCR RESULT IS STILL POSITIVE?</p>
<p>You cannot travel if you have recovered from a COVID-19 infection and still test positive for the PCR test. You also cannot travel if you have only received one single dose of COVID-19 vaccine but have recovered from a COVID-19 infection. </p>
<p>HOW MANY PCR TESTS ARE NEEDED IN SOUTH KOREA? HOW MUCH DO THEY COST?</p>
<p>First PCR test: Upon arrival at Incheon International Airport.</p>
<p>Second PCR test: 48 hours before your flight home.</p>
<p>The result will be ready in eight to 24 hours and you'll have to return to the hospital/clinic to pick up the physical copy. For notification, leave behind a local contact number. You can't use the hotel number; we recommend getting a SIM card.</p>
<p>WHERE CAN I GET A LIST OF CLINICS IN SOUTH KOREA FOR THE PCR TESTS?</p>
<p>You can find the list here.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN I DO IN SOUTH KOREA WHILE WAITING FOR THE PCR TEST RESULT TO BE READY?</p>
<p>After taking your on-arrival PCR test in South Korea, you can proceed to your accommodation via taxi, private vehicle, designated bus or train to isolate and wait for the results.</p>
<p>To be certain, check with your hotel or accommodation before travelling if you can check in while waiting for your PCR results.</p>
<p>Do note that you’re not allowed to take a domestic flight until you have received a negative result for the on-arrival PCR test.</p>
<p>DO I HAVE TO QUARANTINE IN SOUTH KOREA?</p>
<p>You don’t have to if you’re fully vaccinated in Singapore with a WHO Emergency Use Listing COVID-19 vaccine for at least two weeks before arriving in Korea. </p>
<p>Children below age six who are unvaccinated, are exempted from quarantine as well. However, unvaccinated children at age six and above will be subjected to quarantine for 10 days.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS TO TAKE NOTE OF?</p>
<p>Social gatherings are allowed in groups of 10 in the metropolitan areas and up to 12 in non-metropolitan areas in South Korea. However, the guidelines may change so it is best to check here for updates.</p>
<p>WHAT DO I NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF BEFORE BOARDING THE PLANE BACK TO SINGAPORE?</p>
<p>In addition to the same documents you entered South Korea with, check that you also have your negative PCR test result. You'll have two test results if you've stayed longer than eight days.</p>
<p>You'll have to declare your health status electronically via this ICA link as well. </p>
<p>WHAT HAPPENS AT CHANGI AIRPORT?</p>
<p>You'll still have to clear the immigration checkpoint as usual. Once again, make sure you have all your documents with you, including the PCR test result from South Korea.</p>
<p>Join the queue and wait to be attended to by the staff from the Raffles Medical Group. Your throat and both nostrils will be swabbed. </p>
<p>The result will be emailed to you in one to 12 hours. In the meantime, you should head straight home and not venture elsewhere. If you have queries, email airborder [at] rafflesmedical.com.</p>
<p>CAN MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS PICK ME UP AT CHANGI AIRPORT?</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can take a taxi or private hire car to head home. However, you are not allowed to take public transportation such as the bus and MRT.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Truffle-flavoured chips inspired by Korean dumplings and bak kwa made with tempeh are among the 10 finalists of this year's Asia's Great Snack Challenge.</p>
<p>The competition, organised by Enterprise Singapore, offers start-ups and budding entrepreneurs a platform to take innovative snacks to market within three months, said the agency on Monday (Dec 13).</p>
<p>And for the first time, their creations will be available to the public on online grocer RedMart and at food court Food Folks @ Lau Pa Sat for one month from Jan 3.</p>
<p>Inventors of healthy snacks dominated the finalist selection, including eggless "salted egg" kale chips by vegan restaurant Afterglow, seeded sourdough crackers by Ardens Bake and tortilla chips by vegan brand Un-Possible Kitchen.</p>
<p>Others folded nourishing ingredients into treats where they are usually not found, such as granola bites containing Traditional Chinese Medicine ingredients and cookies made with fibre-rich okara, a by-product of soy milk and tofu.</p>
<p>Fried chilli snack Eat My La Jiao, wholegrain puffed rice snack Wok Puffs and "MAShrooms" - mala-flavoured oyster mushroom snacks - rounded out the list.</p>
<p>The finalists were selected from 127 participants, in a process that incorporated online public voting and a testing and pitching session.</p>
<p>They underwent a three-month incubation programme and were matched to corporate mentors Haidilao Hotpot, Mr Bean, Tong Garden, Polar and Uncle Saba's Poppadoms, said Enterprise Singapore.</p>
<p>Mentors like Sreenivas Saba, the co-founder of Uncle Saba's Poppadoms, gave "invaluable insights" on snack production, said one finalist.</p>
<p>"He also offered to do a test batch for us at his manufacturing facility, which we are eternally grateful for," said Un-Possible Kitchen co-founder Eunice Yvette Ng.</p>
<p>The grand finals of Asia's Great Snack Challenge will take place on Thursday. Finalists will pitch their snacks to a panel of judges comprising Enterprise Singapore representatives, food industry leaders and food critic Wong Ah Yoke.</p>
<p>The top two winners will receive a cash prize of S$10,000 and chances to commercialise their products after the competition.</p>

<p>SEOUL: South Korea announced on Friday (Dec 3) that people visiting restaurants and cinemas and other public spaces will have to show vaccine passes, amid a <a>surge in COVID-19 infections</a> and six confirmed cases of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The government also re-imposed limits on private gatherings, which had been recently relaxed, as the country posted record numbers of new cases this week.</p>
<p>Desperate to fend off the Omicron variant, authorities <a>halted quarantine exemptions</a> on Thursday for fully vaccinated inbound travellers and made a 10-day quarantine mandatory.</p>
<p>While people have been required to show their vaccine passes at high-risk venues such as gyms, saunas and bars, it is the first time that the requirement has been extended to restaurants and cafes.</p>
<p>The limit on private gatherings was cut to six people in the greater Seoul area, and eight outside, from the current limit of 10 in Seoul and 12 outside, Kwon said.</p>
<p>KDCA reported 4,944 COVID-19 cases for Thursday, a slight decline from record-high 5,266 cases on Wednesday. It has reported a total of 462,555 infections, with 3,739 deaths overall.</p>
<p>South Korea has fully vaccinated 91.6 per cent of its adult population aged 18 and older, however, the booster dose uptake remains at 8.1 per cent.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Travellers using the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) from Singapore to South Korea will not have to undergo quarantine, the South Korean Embassy in Singapore said on its website on Thursday (Dec 2).</p>
<p>This comes a day after South Korea announced it would <a>impose a 10-day quarantine</a> on all travellers from Friday - regardless of vaccination status - due to concerns over the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"VTL travel arrangement would proceed without change at the moment," the embassy said in a notice, adding that any changes to the policy will be put up on its website.</p>
<p>"Given that the COVID-19 situation remains volatile, we advise all travellers to check our website regularly for the latest border control measures prior to travel," it added.</p>
<p>Travellers on the VTL to South Korea have to be fully vaccinated and must have remained in Singapore for the past 14 days. They are exempted from quarantine if they test negative for COVID-19 at Incheon Airport in Seoul.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated children aged six and above can enter Korea but will have to quarantine for 10 days, the notice added. Those below six are exempted from quarantine.</p>
<p>Singapore's VTL with South Korea was <a>launched on Nov 15</a>.</p>
<p>There was some uncertainty earlier on whether South Korea's new quarantine rules would apply to VTL travellers from Singapore.</p>
<p>In response to CNA's queries on Thursday afternoon, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said it was awaiting more information from South Korean authorities.</p>
<p>Eligible travellers from South Korea can continue to enter Singapore under the VTL subject to COVID-19 tests, he added.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Singapore Embassy in Seoul said in a Facebook post at about 2.25pm that it was checking with South Korean authorities on how the quarantine would affect VTL travellers from Singapore.</p>
<p>In an update on Thursday evening, Singapore Airlines noted that South Korean authorities have confirmed that eligible travellers may enter the country quarantine free under the VTL arrangement with Singapore if they meet the entry requirements.</p>
<p>"Customers are advised to ensure that they meet all of the latest entry requirements before their flights, given the dynamic COVID-19 situation," said SIA in response to CNA's queries.</p>
<p>South Korea reported its <a>first five cases</a> of the Omicron variant on Wednesday. COVID-19 cases have also spiked since distancing curbs were relaxed last month.</p>
