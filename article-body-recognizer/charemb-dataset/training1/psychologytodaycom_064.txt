<h2><a>Do We Live By the Ethics We Teach Our Children?</a></h2>
<p>Giving our word may be the most valuable thing we have to give someone. When our word cannot be trusted, it can create a level of anxiety and suspicion that can last for years.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Kids Need to Learn How to Fail to Ultimately Succeed</a></h2> <p>Adults often applaud everything their child does. While praising effort is good, acting as if it should always lead to extraordinary results can hinder their futures.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>How Spending Quality Time Can Really Strengthen Families</a></h2> <p>What do the Super Bowl and family dinners have in common? They are both shared experiences that help create family connections, now and for the future.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Shame Can Stick to Children Like Glue</a></h2> <p>Children start off with the joy of freely expressing themselves. Adults need to be aware of the power of their words and the dangers of criticizing them instead of supporting them.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Giving Kids the Gift of Lasting Confidence</a></h2>
<p>When parents criticize free-spirited behavior by children, the child may perceive that they are not accepted for who they are. This can inadvertently damage their self-confidence.</p>
<h2><a>Children Can Pick Up on the Tension in Our Households</a></h2>
<p>Unresolved feelings of resentment can be felt throughout a home. By working through problems to resolve issues, we can help to model healthier behavior for our children.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why We Can’t Be Friends With Our Kids</a></h2> <p>We all want our kids to like us and feel close to us. However, there is one clear reason why we cannot truly be friends with our children.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Angry Outbursts Can Be Emotionally Scarring to Children</a></h2>
<p>Children can be quite literal. When we say things we don't mean out of anger, children often believe us. That's why it's so important to be responsible with our language.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Are Morals Ethics Still Valuable for Children to Learn?</a></h2> <p>When we teach our children ethics and morality, are we helping them to live better lives, or are we potentially hindering their chances of success in our society?</p> </div>
<h2><a>Who’s in Charge of Your Child’s Success? </a></h2>
<p>Many parents today manage their child's activities, everything from homework to chores. What if the child was able to take over the responsibility of managing those activities?</p>
<div> <h2><a>Fun Moments for Children Can Create a Lifetime of Memories</a></h2> <p>Making activities fun for children can help create positive memories and strong family bonds. A little creativity can even turn into new family traditions.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Are Our Children Learning That Winning Is All That Matters?</a></h2>
<p>Are children getting the message that fairness and morality are less important than winning at all costs? Could this lead to a belief that ethics have become an antiquated concept?</p>
<div> <h2><a>Helping Adolescents Think Beyond the Headlines</a></h2> <p>Today, more than ever, adolescents need to develop critical-thinking skills, so they do not rely only on headlines and sound bites to shape their views of the world.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Bored Kids Are At-Risk Kids</a></h2> <p>Finding interests of their own can help children become happier and feel more fulfilled. It can develop self-identity and also help reduce dangerous behaviors.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>When Your Teen Stops Liking You</a></h2> <p>When your happy child turns into an unhappy teenager, a number of changes can occur. One of the most difficult is when they treat you like you no longer matter in their life.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>How Our Worries and Stress Can Negatively Affect Children</a></h2>
<p>Adults often try to shield children from stress in the family, but children can pick up on these emotions and become overwhelmed. Talking with them can help reduce their anxiety.</p>
<h2><a>How Racism and Other Forms of Prejudice Can Infect Children</a></h2>
<p>Racism and other prejudices can easily be absorbed by children. Adults who make derogatory comments based on someone's race or gender can negatively affect a child's belief system.</p>

<h2> <a>Teens Often Play "Divide and Conquer" to Get What They Want</a> </h2>
<p> Teenagers often argue with parents to get their way. They also may attempt to pit one parent against the other. It's important that parents stay united in dealing with their teens. </p>
<h2> <a>Don’t Stay Together for the Kids</a> </h2>
<p> Staying together for the children is not nearly as important as staying together for yourselves. The stronger you are as a couple, the better home you will provide for your kids. </p>

<h1> Helping Your Child Develop into a Caring Human Being </h1>
<h2> Compassion doesn’t speak to what we accomplish; it speaks to who we are. </h2>
<li>Developing into a compassionate person can help a child be more emotionally open and connected to others.</li>
<li>Compassion for others can help a child throughout their lives in both personal and professional situations.</li>
<li>When parents model compassionate behaviors, they help children internalize the importance of caring for others.</li>
<p>This week, my wife was at the dog park with a friend when a large dog ran up beside her and knocked her to the ground. The fall broke her leg.</p>
<h3>The Value of Compassion</h3>
<h3>Modeling Compassionate Behaviors</h3>
<p>Ultimately, we can’t fully control the level of compassion our children will have in life. We can’t magically make them into compassionate, caring adults. </p>

<h1> Ways to Manage Pandemic Agitation </h1>
<h2> What we need is self-agency during all this uncertainty. </h2>
<li>Many people are releasing their agitation from the ongoing pandemic at the customer service industry.</li>
<li>Science now understands that trauma can get stuck in our bodies, and physical movement helps release pent-up emotions.</li>
<li>With consistent physical discharge of accumulated stress, annoyances don't have to turn into angry outbursts.</li>
<p>An article in The New York Times described an increase in outbursts in the customer service industry. They labeled it “the great chorus of American consumer outrage, 2021 style.”</p>
<a>motivation</a> that many are feeling these days.
<a>grief</a> and hope side by side. And, in this case, we can toggle between rage and languishing. Given that we’re entering year three of the pandemic, it’s not surprising that our
<a>nervous system</a> explodes when the slightest nuisance bumps up against our beleaguered morale.
<p>Things that were once minor annoyances—getting kicked out of an account after too many failed login attempts or a package being delayed by supply chain problems—have become symbolic of our lack of control and uncertainty fatigue.</p>
<p>What we all need is more self-agency. And the best place to find it? Not by trying to control someone else or control our thoughts. It’s found in the present-moment reality of our body.</p>
<a>trauma</a> can get stuck in our bodies. Sometimes no amount of analyzing—planning ahead, goal setting, or cognitive re-framing—can set it free. In fact, all that overthinking can cause people more
<a>anxiety</a>. Emotions live in the body and can get lodged in the body if we don’t regularly have ways to move them through us safely.
<a>stress</a>, that next annoyance doesn’t have to turn into World War Three. Armed with a more regulated nervous system and a toolbox of ways in which movement is your medicine, a request to speak to the manager just might be a pleasant experience.

<h1> Why Anxiety Can Be Good for Us: The Parable of the Hamster </h1>
<h2> Sometimes anxiety helps us in ways we don't expect. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Instead of looking at emotions as having a positive or negative valence, it can be helpful to notice whether they are activating or deactivating.</li>
<li>Both positive and negative emotions can be activating in positive ways, such as by stimulating our creativity.</li>
<li>Anxiety is an activating emotion that we can leverage to cope with deactivating emotions like sadness, which can block motivation.</li>
<a>anger</a>, joy, and anxiety, increase our energy levels and motivate us to do something. Deactivating emotions, like sadness,
<a>depression</a>, relaxation, and serenity, do the opposite.
<h3>How do we know that emotions work this way?</h3>
<p>In other words, it isn’t whether moods are positive or negative that influences creativity; it’s whether they’re activating or deactivating—whether our moods move us.</p>

<h1> The Growing Need for Collective Palliative Care </h1>
<h2> The survival of our species may be at stake. </h2>
<li>Climate change is threatening our survival as a species. Can we talk about it?</li>
<li>The next 10 years are critical in making good decisions and taking positive action to protect the Earth.</li>
<li>Learning how to have palliative care conversations can help us support patients and professionals grappling with this uncertainty.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The world is in our hands.</div> <div>Source: ugaldew/FreeImages</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It's where we go from here that shocked me even more. If we do absolutely nothing, the consequences of this will be completely catastrophic and make it unlikely for human and other mammal life to be sustainable.</p>
<p>The report concluded that the next 10 years are absolutely pivotal.</p>
<h3>The most difficult conversation</h3>
<p>Then the young mother developed a small lump in her breast. It was removed through surgery, followed by radiation. Everything went well, and life was back to normal.</p>
<a>cutting</a>-edge alternative treatment they could find, but nothing worked.
<p>"How do you feel today?" I asked her. "How do you see your current situation with your breast cancer and your illness? Where do you see yourself and the progress made in this process?"</p>
<p>She deliberated. "I feel struck by the findings from the radiologist. I don't really know what it means, but it frightens me."</p>
<p>"How do you feel in your body?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"A lot of pain all over. I was hoping that the chemo was going to reduce this by now."</p>
<p>"How confident do you feel that the cancer will disappear?"</p>
<p>"Well, I know the chances are not great when it's spreading to this degree."</p>
<p>"I can understand that this must be overwhelming..." I said.</p>
<p>Just with those words, she broke down and began to sob uncontrollably.</p>
<p>In fact, after a few months, she did die. Her husband and two young children had to pass through that pain and make adjustments to carry on with their lives without her. I still see the children as my patients.</p>
<h3>A mental health crisis</h3>
<a>recent study</a> reports that almost 25 percent of people who do not die develop symptoms of "long COVID," which means that they have lung damage and do not properly recover their health.
<a>attention</a>: a huge global mental health crisis, such that doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychotherapists are flooded like never before. It is frequently difficult for new patients to get an appointment.
<p>According to a recent report in <a>The Lancet</a>, the pandemic has caused an estimated 53 million new cases of major depressive disorder and 75 million new cases of <a>anxiety</a>. </p>
<a>depression</a> and anxiety: It could be
<a>sexual</a> activity, or worry about finances. Many people have spent much more time alone, left to be with themselves, to reflect and think.
<h3>We may be needing collective palliative care.</h3>
<p>Collectively, we are not yet fully in a palliative care conversation. We are looking at a critically ill patient—humanity—who now needs intensive care and may or may not make it.</p>
<a>leader</a> who would help people with these big questions. These days, as many people are faced with global uncertainty about our collective future, they look to health care providers for support with the massive anxiety these questions generate.
<p>I don't have the answer to how to deal with these situations, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<h1> How to Integrate Remote Employees Through Virtual Mentoring </h1>
<h2> Best practices for on-the-job learning and intra- and inter-team collaboration. </h2>
<li>While 25-35% of workers want a fully remote schedule, that can create a challenge for collaboration, mentoring, and integration of new employees.</li>
<li>To rectify challenges with remote work, senior and junior staff can be paired up and co-work regularly.</li>
<li>The digital co-working experience replicates the benefit of a shared cubicle space, where junior team members can ask questions.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: LinkedIn Sales Solutions/ Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>collaboration</a>? These are key issues that have recurrently been highlighted by organizations seeking to develop effective strategies for returning to the office and establishing permanent future work arrangements.
<h3>Why Do Leaders Fail to Adapt to the Future of Work?</h3>
<p>One of these judgment errors is called functional fixedness. When we have a certain perception of appropriate practices and processes, we tend to disregard other more appropriate alternatives.</p>
<p>That’s why leaders failed to address strategically the problems arising with the abrupt transition to telework. Instead, they adapted their existing ways of interacting in “office culture” to remote work.</p>
<p>Another cognitive <a>bias</a>, which is related to functional fixedness, is called the not-invented-here syndrome. It’s a <a>leader</a>’s antipathy towards adopting practices not invented within their organization, no matter how useful.</p>
<a>innovation</a> and collaboration, retention of top talent, and the creation of flexible company culture.
<h3>Remote Training Through Digital Co-Working</h3>
<a>bonding</a>. It helps junior team members get on-the-job learning and integrates them into the team while helping all team members address questions while feeling more connected to fellow team members.
<h3>Virtual Mentoring for Cultural Integration and Intra- and Inter-Team Collaboration</h3>
<p>Make sure to have one senior staff member from the junior colleague’s immediate team. That will help provide insights on team culture and help them with on-the-job training of their daily tasks. </p>
<p>Also include two from outside the team. These two mentors will be needed to resolve one of the biggest challenges for company culture for remote/hybrid workers: the decrease in cross-functional connections across staff. </p>

<li>The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on mental health, including sleep.</li>
<li>People are hardwired to be on high alert under the threat of a viral vector.</li>
<li>Even in the midst of catastrophe, sleep has restorative power that enables people to thrive. </li>
<li>There are many ways to improve sleep, including figuring out one's own natural body rhythms.</li>
<a>unique ways</a> to doze off, monkey brains are
<a>restored</a> by a good night’s rest and
<a>whales dream</a>. Like our mammalian relatives, humans have a biologically driven need for sleep, which means our brains are highly motivated to help us drift off. But during the
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic, that biological drive has come up against significant environmental and societal challenges that have led to sleepless nights for many people.
<h3>The unprecedented scale of this crisis has affected every single one of us</h3>
<a>40 percent</a> of Americans have reported symptoms of
<a>depression</a> during the pandemic, which is up significantly from 2019. While sleep can
<a>help</a> regulate our mental health, good sleep can be difficult to achieve, even in the best of times. During the pandemic, it’s become even harder. In an
<a>August 2021 survey</a> of over 2,000 Americans half of respondents said their sleep has been disrupted during the pandemic. These disruptions have created a vicious cycle of poor sleep at night and worsening mental health during the day.
<a>stress</a> are just a few ways in which the virus has triggered our brain to be on high alert. Unfortunately, for many of us, our brains remain there.
<h3>Sleep hasn’t let us down</h3>
<a>circadian rhythms</a> require pattern and regularity.
<a>attention</a>, learning, accessing
<a>memory</a>, and performing tasks.
<a>One study</a> found that COVID-19 is associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and
<a>insomnia</a> — and that people who are confined, live alone, or live with five or more people are at higher risk for insomnia.
<a>Of the 13 countries</a> studied, the United States had the highest rates of insomnia symptoms (59.8 percent) and probable insomnia disorder (31.4 percent).
<a>Another study</a> found that dream recall frequency — the ability to remember what you dreamed — increased during the pandemic. That recall was associated with nightmares, sleep maintenance issues, and even

<h1>Concussion Is Brain Injury</h1>
<p>Restoring your life after brain injury</p>
<p><a>Shireen Jeejeebhoy</a></p>
<div> <h2>Learned Helplessness, Brain Injury, and the Pandemic</h2> <p>There’s a long-term cost of learned helplessness. How do we change our circuits in the face of brain injury or a pandemic to a state that expects control over trauma?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Facing the Full Catastrophe of Brain Injury</a></h2> <p>I stretched my hand out for a touch of my golden pre-brain injury productivity, and it grasped mist.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How Brain Injury Recovery Can Shatter You</a></h2> <p>As you recover from brain injury, you may witness your core self evaporate. Such was the place I entered five years after a car crash, before I found salvation.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Is Forgiveness?</a></h2> <p>Trauma healers demand forgiveness: Let go because you'll feel better. Forget, tolerate, or don’t have anything more to do with them. But is that forgiveness?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Do People Use Their Power of Physical Health?</a></h2> <p>Why do people with healthy bodies use their power to abandon injured others?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>We Need a New Way to Live in Pandemics</a></h2>
<p>Is America an advanced society compared to a century ago? If so why can’t the nation figure out an effective way to talk to the public and stop viral transmission between people?</p>
<div> <h2><a>Evidence-Based Medicine Can Fail People With Brain Injury</a></h2> <p>The pandemic exposed the fallacy of evidence-based medicine. Yet doctors still rely on it for brain injury care instead of the evolving science of regeneration.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Setbacks Are Not Permanent, but the Change They Bring Is</a></h2> <p>Neither the hoped-for return to health nor setbacks are permanent. But neither do they circle us back to the normal we’re used to.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Does Faith Serve a Purpose After Brain Injury?</a></h2> <p>Inviting patients into discussions of their faith and weaving it into their medical care and prescriptions improves their functioning and sense of well-being.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Why Should Health Care Professionals Use Neurostimulation?</a></h2> <p>Why are neurostimulation techniques not adopted widely, given how effective they are? I believe it comes down to trust, anxiety, and being overburdened.</p> </div>
<h2><a>'I'm So Over It!': Brain Injury Provides Insight Into COVID Fatigue</a></h2>
<p>We feel stuck in COVID fatigue. That's what they're calling the feeling of being in the middle of a marathon with no end. That's how brain injury feels, too. But with a difference.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Time Is Relative</a></h2> <p>Age changes our perception of time probably because childhood is learning from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Is Mental Work the Same as Exercise?</a></h2> <p>Increasing mental work while not decreasing physical exercise commensurately was a really bad idea after brain injury. This lesson no one taught me.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Adjusting Holidays to the Pandemic</a></h2> <p>We cannot expect holidays to remain rigidly the same in pandemic years. Those who see opportunity in disaster chatter excitedly about planning a unique Christmas.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Does the Traditional Definition of Success Work?</a></h2> <p>Is the unattainable definition of success of earning an income depressing you into immobility? Try refocusing to lift you up off the couch into being quietly pleased.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>What Is the Significant Lesson From the Book of Job?</a></h2> <p>Every commentator I’ve read, every theologian I’ve seen over the years, has agreed that God puts Job in his place. Is this the book's significant lesson?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Improvement Always Good?</a></h2> <p>By allowing brain injury to fester, brain injury specialists create a new diminished norm in a person; thus they create resistance to improvement, for improvement is change.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Should the Gospel of Mary Be in the New Testament?</a></h2> <p>Mary of Magdala was rendered voiceless, like women continue to be today.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Racism and Brain Injury</a></h2> <p>How much does subconscious racism factor into dismissing my concussion advocacy?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Rise of Social Atrophy</a></h2> <p>Dr. Alice Chen presents four pillars of staying socially healthy during this time of separation. And I add a fifth to include all who struggled before and continue to suffer.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Finding an Alternative to In-Person Brain Biofeedback</a></h2>
<p>The trend towards individualized medicine means that the single-subject study is both proof of concept and an individual treatment plan for virtual brain injury care.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Pondering Good Friday's Message in the Time of COVID-19</a></h2> <p>An unimagined future and the hope it can bring.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Stressed in the Age of COVID-19</a></h2>
<p>I prepared mentally. I stocked up. I felt fairly confident I’d weather the coming contagion. I was wrong, and I didn't expect the flashbacks nor the new targets of the word "selfish."</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sleep Solutions for COVID-19 Pandemic Nights</a></h2> <p>What I've learnt from treating my brain-injury sleep problems.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>COVID-19 Welcomes the World to Brain Injury-Type Isolation</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to the world of isolation. You are joining people with chronic illnesses like chronic fatigue and debilitating injuries like brain injury in our isolated routines.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The How of Loving Detachment</a></h2> <p>After brain injury, it's critical to disengage from people who have low self-reflective functioning and mess with your mind. Loving detachment is a method for doing that.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Rising Up After Brain Injury</a></h2> <p>Resurrection, like one rising from the corpse of the old life, is an immortal motif in Western thinking. But it’s difficult to rise up when denied health care and grieving.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Grief on Extraordinary Grief</a></h2> <p>How can we begin to cope with the crushing weight of grief on top of extraordinary brain injury grief? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Cranioelectrical Stimulation for Concussion and PTSD</a></h2>
<p>It's easier for clients or patients to adopt at-home use of cranioelectrical stimulation when their health care provider introduces them to it during their therapy sessions.</p>
<div> <h2><a>A Learnt Response After Brain Injury</a></h2> <p>I woke up happy. No more tears. No more difficult emerging memories. No more processing. My emotions had switched off after brain injury; treatment had turned them back on. Why?</p> </div>

<h1> Learned Helplessness, Brain Injury, and the Pandemic </h1>
<h2> Learned helplessness is a default state that undermines brain injury recovery. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: rebcenter-moscow/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Seligman and Maier in 1967</a> came up with the term to describe a passive state in the face of shock. They hypothesized that when organisms experience no control, they learn nothing they do will escape them from
<p><a>Seligman wrote in 1972</a>:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“Dramatic successes in medicine have come more frequently from prevention than from treatment, and I would hazard a guess that inoculation and immunization have saved many more lives than cure.”</p> </blockquote>
<a>Maier and Seligman’s updated understanding of learned helplessness in 2016</a> explains why I could resist for over a decade. They explored the
<a>motivation</a> and continual anxiety.
<p>Maier and Seligman note that the circuit “provides an expectational function, in the sense that it changes or biases how organism[s] respond in the future as a consequence of the events that occur in the present.”</p>
<a>variable pandemic measures</a>,
<a>calls for making COVID-19 endemic</a> remind me of learned helplessness, similar to how health-care professionals demanded that I accept brain injury as permanent. Polio and the worldwide drive to eradicate it provides a good contrast.
<blockquote> <p>“There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented…success will mean that no child will ever again suffer the terrible effects of lifelong polio-paralysis.” (<a>World Health Organization</a>)</p> </blockquote>
<p>In 1988, with 350,000 cases, <a>the World Health Assembly adopted the polio eradication resolution</a> because 0.5% of children developed permanent paralysis and 5 to 10% of those died—that is, 0.05% of all cases.</p>
<p>“Doctors have been estimating one-quarter to one-third of <a>COVID-19</a> patients become long haulers, as many patients call themselves. Now, four studies published since February confirm that range.” <a>(UC Davis Health</a>)</p>
<a>COVID-19’s enormous economic cost</a>.
<a>isolation</a>, dependence, and suffering, but also the economic cost of having us, and perhaps our caregivers, too, leave the workforce permanently.

<li>Apologizing is an important part of repairing and maintaining relationships. </li>
<li>Research finds few differences between prompted and spontaneous apologies, and that making amends may be more effective than any type of apology.</li>
<li>Parents can help their children learn these skills by modeling them, prompting their kids in the moment, and having open conversations.</li>
<a>Research</a> finds that children report that receiving apologies helps to repair their trust and increases positive emotions.
<a>Recent research</a> also finds that children are more
<a>forgiving</a> of other children who apologize and are more likely to
<a>rate the transgressor as nicer</a> than children who did not receive an apology,
<a>Research</a> suggests that both types of apologies seem to repair the relationship but neither make the victim feel better. While
<a>Research</a> also suggests that asking your child to apologize is not linked with increased
