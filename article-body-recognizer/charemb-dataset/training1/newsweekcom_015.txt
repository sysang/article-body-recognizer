<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday that the U.S. should look at implementing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for people traveling on domestic flights, even though President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s administration has been hesitant to do so in the past.</p>
<p>He suggested the mandate would provide more protection on flights and might help increase COVID-19 vaccination numbers in the country.</p>
<p>White House press secretary <a>Jen Psaki</a> told <a>MSNBC</a>: "We know that masking can be, is, very effective on airplanes." She added that putting in new restrictions might cause further implications or create flight delays.</p>
<p>The two officials also said science advisers have not made a formal recommendation to Biden on whether to implement a vaccine mandate for domestic travels.</p>
<p>Biden has not answered questions on whether or not he plans to implement the vaccine mandate for domestic air travel.</p>
<p>The U.S. currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the U.S. be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, though citizens and permanent residents only need to show proof of a negative test taken within a day of boarding.</p>
<p>Federal rules don't require people traveling by air within the U.S. to show a negative test. Hawaii requires travelers to test or show proof of vaccination to avoid a mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>Biden told reporters that the subject regarding the vaccine mandate was discussed on a call with the nation's governors Monday morning.</p>
<p>"We would do it, though, if the health impact was overwhelming. So we rely always on the advice of our health and medical experts. That isn't a step at this point that they had determined we need to take," Psaki said.</p>
<p>"When you make vaccination a requirement, that's another incentive to get more people vaccinated," Fauci told MSNBC. "If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that's something that seriously should be considered."</p>
<p>Those vaccination requirements have been mired in legal wrangling, with the <a>Supreme Court</a> set to hear arguments on January 7 in cases seeking to overturn them.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </p>
<div> U.S. Donald Trump Jr <a>Anthony Fauci</a> <a>Flights</a></div>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., the son of former President Donald Trump, has called infectious-diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci a "tyrant" for supporting vaccine mandates on U.S. flights.</p>
<a>require domestic air travelers to be vaccinated </a>against COVID-19.
<p>"When you make vaccination a requirement, that's another incentive to get more people vaccinated," Fauci said during a Monday morning appearance on the <a>MSNBC</a> news program Morning Joe.</p>
<p>He added that increasing vaccinations seems especially important now amid a new spike in COVID-related hospitalizations. "Anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome," Fauci said.</p>
<p>During the interview, Fauci didn't say whether he had actually suggested the idea to Biden.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on <a>Twitter</a>, Trump Jr. criticized Fauci.</p>
<p>In a Monday evening <a>CNN</a> interview, Fauci explained, "It's on the table, and we consider it, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen."</p>
<p>Fauci doesn't independently set national policies on COVID-19. He is part of a team that makes suggestions for the president's administration to consider.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. has long criticized Fauci for recommending COVID-19 reduction measures that some conservatives see as unnecessary, power-hungry and infringing upon personal freedoms.</p>
<p>In July, Trump Jr. said that Fauci is <a>"better at pitching baseballs than he is at science."</a> He said that Fauci is merely a "bureaucrat" and said members of the press who suggest otherwise are being deceptive.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. made his remarks during the "America UnCancelled" event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).</p>
<p>In mid-June, <a>Trump Jr. said of Fauci</a>, "This guy's not a scientist, he's a bureaucrat in a lab coat—nothing more, nothing less. He's incompetent. He was in government because he probably couldn't have made it in the private sector."</p>
<p>Trump Jr. made the comments during an interview on the podcast The Truth with Lisa Boothe.</p>
<p>In early June, critics accused <a>Trump</a> Jr. of issuing violent threats against <a>Fauci</a> after he <a>shared a meme about Fauci's hypothetical murder</a>. The meme suggested that Fauci's eventual death might be misrepresented as a suicide.</p>
<p>The meme raised concern especially since Fauci's high profile during the pandemic <a>caused him to attract violent threats</a>. Fauci has required additional security for his personal safety since the pandemic began.</p>
<a>questioned or fired</a> over his emails. Other Republican legislators and media figures have demanded
<a>Fauci's firing</a> because the NIAID funded research at the
<a>Wuhan Institute of Virology</a> (WIV). The WIV has been accused of causing the pandemic through an accidental leak.
<p>The United States reported a record-breaking new average of 265,000 COVID-19 cases per day, though hospitalizations have gone down by about half since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the previous record was a rate of 250,000 cases per day in mid-January.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported about 60,000 Americans who are currently hospitalized with the virus, which is down by approximately 50 percent since January.</p>
<p>Some also believe the decline in hospitalizations could show the Omicron variant is less severe than past strains. Others believe that both factors played a role.</p>
<p>Bob Bednarczyk, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University, said health experts are keeping a close eye on hospitalization rates as a way of examining how effective the vaccines are.</p>
<p>"If we're able to weather this surge with hopefully minimal disruptions to the overall health care system, that is a place where vaccines are really showing their worth," Bednarczyk said.</p>
<p>Dr. <a>Anthony Fauci</a>, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert, said Wednesday that there is no need to cancel small home gatherings among vaccinated and boosted family and friends.</p>
<p>But "if your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person New Year's Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we not do that," Fauci said.</p>
<p>The number of Americans now in the hospital with COVID-19 is running at around 60,000, though hospitalizations sometimes lag behind case numbers.</p>
<p>COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have climbed over the past two weeks from an average of 1,200 per day to around 1,500.</p>
<p>Several European countries, including France, Greece, Britain and Spain, also reported record case counts this week, prompting a ban on music at New Year's celebrations in Greece and a renewed push to encourage vaccination by French authorities.</p>

<p>Thousands of Christmas Day flights have been canceled as surging cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant impacted plane crews and other workers.</p>
<p>In the U.S., United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have canceled or delayed hundreds of flights, with Omicron cases among flight crews being cited as a main reason behind the decision.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day at the time of writing, United has cancelled 238 flights, Delta 282, <a>American Airlines</a> 88, and JetBlue 120. Spirit and Southwest are faring better with only 8 and 1 cancellation respectively, but all have experienced delays.</p>
<p>There have been 2,460 flight cancelations and 3,583 delays across the world on Christmas Day, according to FlightAware at the time of writing.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to Newsweek, a United Airlines spokesperson said: The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation.</p>
<p>"We're flying an average of 4K flights a day this holiday season, and these cancel represent a small portion of those flights."</p>
<p>According to data collected by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>), Omicron has quickly overtaken Delta to become the dominant COVID-19 strain.</p>
<p>As of the latest data from December 18, an estimated 73.2 percent of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are of the Omicron variant. In total since the pandemic began the U.S. has logged 51.5 million COVID cases, and suffered 809,000 deaths.</p>
<p>University of Texas at Austin researchers said in a recent study that the "milder Omicron surge" <a>is likely to peak in mid-January</a>.</p>
<p>Amid the surge in cases, the CDC continues to recommend wearing a mask in public indoor settings or high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p>The surge in cases led many Americans to take tests to see whether they had been infected, in a bid to stop spreading the virus among their family.</p>
<p>In New York City, where the variant has rapidly spread, people were seen waiting in long lines in order to get tested as a precaution before traveling to see their family over the festive season.</p>
<p>Brianna Sultan and her daughter Ava, 8, spent part of Christmas Eve in one of the long lines in order to get tested following reports of an infection at school.</p>
<p>Speaking to AP after waiting two hours in line, Sultan said: "It's a terrible way to be spending Christmas Eve. It's terrible that we can't see our families because this COVID strain is coming back up again."</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines for comment.</p>

<h2><a>One-Way Fare From Kabul to Islamabad Now $1500, Taliban Demanding Price Cut</a></h2>
<div>Pakistan International Airlines spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said "the situation on the ground is not conducive for international flight operations."</div>
<p>A statue of the Virgin Mary that graced the grounds outside the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast Washington, D.C., was beloved by worshippers for its beauty—until vandals struck.</p>
<p>In a pattern of violence usually experienced only by synagogues—for which property desecration has been a fact of life for decades—churches are now being hit.</p>
<p>For the attack to happen just days before the Feast of the Immaculate Conception was "disconcerting," said Aaron Weldon, program specialist on the Committee for Religious Liberty at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).</p>
<p>"Our offices are right across the street from the National Shrine," he said. "The person would have had to enter a gate to get to the statue. There's video of it, and the guy came with a hammer and was hitting the face and hands."</p>
<p>In other words, this was no drive-by vandalism. It was aimed at Catholics.</p>
<a>FBI</a>, according to the National Catholic Register. This was about the same amount as anti-Muslim vandalism (31 cases) but minuscule compared with antisemitic vandalism (684 cases).
<p>Reasons for the vandalism are varied, but at root is a rising animus against religion or, as the Reverend Thomas Reese suggests, a frustration with how Catholic officials have behaved in recent decades.</p>
<p>"What we have here is not so much anti-Catholicism as anti-clericalism. They don't hate Catholics; they hate the bishops. Note that little or none of this hatred is aimed at the Catholic president or the pope," Reese said.</p>
<p>Even if vandals were upset with <a>Pope Francis</a>, the Vatican is thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>"After the bishops spent millions of dollars fighting gay marriage and after they fire gay teachers at Catholic schools, it is no surprise gays are not happy with them," Reese said.</p>
<p>Weldon was not expecting an uptick in damage to churches over the Christmas holiday, mainly because vandals, like everyone else, hate to be out in bad weather.</p>
<p>But as incidents increased throughout 2021, some have wondered why the mainstream media haven't jumped on the story.</p>
<p>Weldon said the USCCB has been encouraging churches to apply for building security grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) so they can install monitoring systems that would deter more vandalism.</p>
<p>The problem is, if anything, worse overseas. Although the world was jolted by the 2019 fire that engulfed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, what went under-reported were dozens of similar incidents across France.</p>
<p>In 2018, the average was two attacks per day on French churches, according to LibertePolitique.com, a French site.</p>
<p>"How to explain this silence? Why don't Christians enjoy the same media coverage, the same political support, the same national outrage?" the essay asked.</p>
<p>Things haven't improved with the coronavirus pandemic either. This spring, the Catholic News Agency reported that one religious building was being burned, destroyed or desecrated every two weeks in France.</p>
<p>Lifeway's research of fatal church shootings overall shows a tendency toward red states, with the greatest amount being in Texas (four) and Georgia (three), and a range from New York state to Wisconsin to Kentucky to Idaho.</p>
<p>Although some U.S. mosques have been attacked with graffiti and arson, the numbers aren't as high, and there have not been fatalities, unlike what New Zealand has seen. In the spring of 2019, 51 Muslims died in an attack at a Christchurch mosque.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this past spring, during the conflict in the Gaza Strip, the Council on American-Islamic Relations documented a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes, including vandalism and an attempted stabbing.</p>
