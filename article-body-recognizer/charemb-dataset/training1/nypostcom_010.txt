<h2>The best lip balm with hyaluronic acid: Biossance Squalene+ Rose Vegan Lip Balm, $14</h2>
<a>Squalene+ Rose Vegan Lip Balm</a>. With a nourishing feel and subtle plumping effect, it’s a lovely option to refresh your puckers.
<h2>The best jumbo lip balm: <a>Drunk Elephant Lippe Balm</a>, $18</h2>
<a>Lippe Balm</a> was unscented. But, when I applied it, I knew what the hype was all about — its obtuse size fully covered my lips in one swipe and it’s the cutest size we’ve ever seen.
<p>Plus, with a name like Drunk Elephant, it adds a bit of flair to any stocking stuffer.</p>
<h2>The best flavor options: Fresh Sugar Advanced Therapy Treatment Lip Balm, $26</h2>
<p>This edit would be incomplete without Fresh’s <a>Sugar Advanced Therapy Treatment Lip Balm</a>. Popular in holiday sets nationwide, it truly is worth the hype for flavorful nourishment that’s well worth the price.</p>
<h2>The best two-in-one lip balm primer: <a>Glow Recipe Glow Lip Pop Lip Balm</a>, $22</h2>
<a>Glow Lip Pop Lip Balm</a> isn’t just fabulous for its watermelon and blueberry scents. It cured my chapped lips in minutes and served as a lightweight, smooth primer to apply before lipstick. If you want fruity, it’s fruity quality.
<h2>The best for sensitive lips: First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Lip Therapy, $12 </h2>
<a>Ultra Repair Lip Therapy</a> is the only balm on this list with a buttery texture. If you’re blessed with dry or chronically dry skin — I unfortunately was — then this is the balm you need. No questions asked.
<h2>The best refreshing lip balm: <a>Lancôme L’Absolu Mademoiselle Lip Balm</a>, $26</h2>
<a>L’Absolu Mademoiselle Lip Balm</a> clad in sleek, shiny packaging, but it has a surprising cooling effect that works wonders on chapped lips. Hence, its wonderful shade in ‘Ice Cold Pink.’ And, it gives your lips a hint of color.
<h2>The best versatile lip balm: Too Faced Peach Bloom Color Blossoming Lip Cheek Tint, $25</h2>
<p>If you love fruity balms, Too Faced’s <a>Peach Bloom Color Blossoming Lip Cheek Tint</a> is an all-around fabulous product. It was revitalizing and even doubles as a cheek flush.</p>
<p>For a personal favorite, the ‘Strawberry Glow’ flavor is immaculate. </p>
<h2>The best with a subtle shimmer: <a>RMS Beauty Hydrating Tinted Daily Lip Balm</a>, $20</h2>
<a>Hydrating Tinted Daily Lip Balm</a> is the subtle sparkle it leaves behind — a rare find for a lip balm. And, if you’re not into shine too much, the shade ‘
<a>Simply Cocoa</a>‘ leaves your lips hydrated without a trace.
<h2>The thickest lip balm: Belif Aqua Bomb Overnight Lip Mask, $20</h2>
<a>Overnight Lip Mask</a> — and I was far from disappointed. With a soothing texture, it’s a good investment with colder days ahead.
<h2>The best for long-lasting hydration: <a>Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte’s Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir</a>, $40</h2>
<p>Charlotte’s <a>Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir</a> was like getting a facial on my lips. Infused with hyaluronic acid, aloe vera and plant extracts, it’s an all-natural product that’ll give your lips a refresh in the colder months.</p>
<h2>The best ingredient mix: Kiehl’s Since 1851 Buttermask Intense Repair Lip Treatment, $26</h2>
<h2>The best drugstore try: <a>Burt’s Bee’s Beeswax Lip Balm Variety Pack</a>, $9.57</h2>
<p>Truth be told, I didn’t find <a>Burt’s Bee’s lip balms</a> terribly hydrating, but it is a good solution that’s affordable and a drugstore offering with some subtle flavor. Its strawberry flavor is a personal favorite.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from amazon</a> </div> </div>
<h2>The creamiest lip balm: Lano Coconutter Lanostick, $16.95</h2>
<p>Upon applying, I was automatically taken to a tropical island. The <a>Lano Coconutter Lanostick</a> is the most indulgent feel on your lips, too, thanks to its unmatched creaminess. And, you’ll have a hint of summer even in the cold.</p>

<h1> From Rent the Runway to Armoire, we tried 4 clothing rental brands</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> October 1, 2021 1:14pm Updated </div>
<p>If you have a full closet yet somehow have nothing to wear, join the club. </p>
<p>Or more specifically, a clothing rental club, as that seemed to be the solution to my shopping addiction without breaking the bank or making my closet even more full than it already is. </p>
<h2>Best clothing rental service for designer items: </h2>
<h3><a>Rent the Runway</a>, use code RTRNYPOST21 for 3 months of the 8-item plan for $99/month (originally $149/month)</h3>
<p>If you’ve heard of clothing rental, chances are Rent the Runway is the first one you found. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 4</div> </div> </div>
<li>A huge selection spanning almost every type of clothing, including formal, semi-formal, casual, athleisure, maternity and accessories. </li>
<li>Perfect for those who love designers of all tiers, from the actual runway to more mid-tier brands. </li>
<li>Insanely fast shipping and pre-paid return labels. Also, clothing comes on hangers and in garment bags for super easy use and returning. </li>
<li>Depending on your plan, an option for a free “do-over” if you ordered something that didn’t fit. </li>
<li>Super large user base who leave detailed reviews with photos, making ordering for yourself even easier when trying unfamiliar brands. </li>
<li>Not for those in a rush, hate scrolling or those who don’t know what they want, as you will need to spend time browsing for your items. </li>
<li>A lot of the items only go up to a large or an XL, and sizes tend to sell out quickly. </li>
<h2>Best clothing rental service for speed and efficiency: </h2>
<h3><a>Armoire</a>, use code NYPOST21 for 3 months of Armoire’s Unlimited Plan at $179/month (originally $249/month) </h3>
<p>Sometimes you have the right clothes, but no clue how to style them into a killer outfit. </p>
<p>A huge factor of Armoire that I loved was their speed, as in addition to how quick their stylists work, their shipping and delivery was also super fast, shipping out one day later and arriving at my home after two more business days. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 3</div> </div> </div>
<li>The stylists are on-call and ready to help you not only pick items but style them and create personalized closets.</li>
<li>Size inclusive, with offerings for extended sizing for many items. </li>
<li>Perfect for the working woman, more conservative options, mid-tier designer items.</li>
<li>Returning is easy with prepaid labels and a reusable shipping envelope. </li>
<li>You cannot view all the items in the inventory at once, and must click around your curated closet, on their other feeds or ask for a new stylist-made selection. </li>
<li>Not for top-tier designers nor is it for the latest youthful trends. </li>
<h2>Best clothing rental service for mid- and plus-sized women</h2>
<h3><a>Gwynnie Bee</a>, starting at $49 for one item at a time</h3>
<p>Personally, I love online shopping sites that allow me to see both straight and extended sizes, plus, seeing the clothes on full-figured models helped me not only pick my own outfits but boosted my confidence in the site. </p>
<li>Sizes range from a 0 to a 32 on the site, so there are options for almost every body type. </li>
<li>Perfect for back-to-work and a more conservative wardrobe, with longer dresses, sweaters, pants, skirts and more. </li>
<li>Unlimited returns and rentals during the month, with easy pre-paid mailing. </li>
<li>With the standard plan, you cannot pick which of your saved items will be sent to you and in what order. Not for someone who is planning an outfit for a specific event. </li>
<li>Many conservative items, but not much for date night, going out or showing more skin. </li>
<h2>Best clothing service for personal styling</h2>
<h3><a>Nordstrom Trunk Club</a>, $25 styling fee, applied to what you choose to purchase</h3>
<p>If you love clothes but hate returning them after your rental period is over, maybe a personal styling service is the best for you. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 2</div> </div> </div>
<li>A $25 styling fee for an expert personal stylist to curate your boxes is very reasonable. </li>
<li>The items are all super high quality and tailored to your measurements and style from your quiz. </li>
<li>Your notes to the stylist can be super specific, such as if you have an event coming up or certain items you’ve been searching for. </li>
<li>You have the option to customize your box after the stylist curates it, making sure you get items you actually want, as well as changing sizes and colors. </li>
<li>You can also choose your price range, starting at just $50 to $100, to make sure their picks are in your budget. </li>
<li>Don’t be confused: this is NOT a rental service, as you will have to actually purchase the clothes if you want to wear them outside of the house. </li>
<li>Sometimes the curated box isn’t your style, and neither are the suggested replacements, meaning you will have to cancel that Trunk and start over. </li>

<h1> Where to buy at-home COVID test kits while they’re in stock</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 8:40pm Updated </div>
<p>Just when we thought the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to wind down, the Omicron variant made its debut and the contagious virus is spreading more quickly than ever before.</p>
<p>With the recent outbreak of Omicron, urgent care and testing centers <a>have long lines that sometimes last for hours</a>, making people turn to at-home testing options.</p>
<a>CDC</a>, COVID-19 self-tests — also known as at-home tests or over-the-counter (OTC) tests — are one of many risk-reduction measures, along with 
<a>masking</a> and physical distancing, that 
<a>protects you and others</a> from the spread of COVID-19.
<p>The problem? They’re always out of stock. Ahead, get all the info on how to use at-home COVID tests, how accurate they are and where you can buy them online. </p>
<h2>How to use at-home COVID tests</h2>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Open the box and follow the instructions included with the self-test to collect your own nasal or saliva specimen. (If you don’t collect the specimens as directed, your test results may be incorrect.)</li>
<li>Perform the steps in the order that they are listed. Some manufacturers may also provide quick reference guides or instructional videos. </li>
<li>Collect either a nasal specimen or saliva specimen, depending on the self-test being used. </li>
<li>Next, wait to see what result comes back. Generally, this takes 15 minutes. </li>
<h2>Accuracy of at-home COVID tests</h2>
<p>Invalid test results are rare but can occur. Chief Infection Control Officer <a>Roy Chemaly, M.D.</a> at the University of Texas MD Cancer Center <a>said</a> that “the tests are only accurate 80% of the time, and sometimes less.” </p>
<p>Sometimes invalid results or an error can show on the test device. Invalid results or an error can occur for many reasons — your specimen may not have been collected correctly, or the test may have malfunctioned.</p>
<p>Due to the current infection rate of the coronavirus being so high, many professionals suggest retesting with a PCR test if you have symptoms and test negative using an at-home antigen test as it could be a false negative. </p>
<h2>Where to buy at-home COVID tests</h2>
<p>Note: these tests go in and out of stock by the minute so make sure to check back regularly if none are available at this given time. </p>

<h1> ‘Wonder Lofts’ get $120M recapitalization</h1>
<div> March 11, 2018 11:34pm <div> Updated <div> March 12, 2018 11:46am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A 5-year-old plan to carve luxury apartments out of the old Wonder Bread factory in Hoboken, NJ, has finally lured big backers to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Parkwood Development Corp., which cooked up the “Wonder Lofts” project in 2012 only to face delays, has brought in Angelo Gordon Co. and Prism Capital Partners for a $120 million recapitalization.</p>
<p>The five buildings on Clinton Street that churned out loaves of white bread in the 1960s will soon be converted into 89 luxury units.</p>
<p>Along with an ownership stake, Prism will be responsible for overseeing construction and completion. Demolition is nearly done and approvals are in place for the project.</p>
<h1> Frank Sinatra’s historic homes: From NYC to Palm Desert</h1>
<div> May 18, 2021 8:23am Updated </div>
<p>America’s most famous crooner is known for his melody about “New York, New York,” but only one of Frank Sinatra’s six properties was in the Big Apple.</p>
<p>In fact, Sinatra started out in Hoboken, NJ, across the river, and the first house he owned was in suburban Hasbrouck Heights nearby.</p>
<p>But soon, Sinatra began commissioning custom homes in California — apparently, he wanted them “My way.” </p>
<p>All told, Sinatra owned at least six homes during his 82-year life and rented numerous others — almost all of them in California or New Jersey — plus his penthouse in Manhattan.</p>
<h2>“My way” at Twin Palms</h2>
<p>Palm Springs, California | $150,000</p>
<p>Sinatra and his first wife Nancy Barbato commissioned Twin Palms in 1947 for $150,000 — which is about $1.9 million today, <a>according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. </p>
<p>The four-bedroom, seven-bathroom home has a piano-shaped swimming pool flanked by two palm trees, giving the Palm Springs, California, home its name, <a>according to the home’s rental website</a>.</p>
<p>During Sinatra’s residency, he used a flag pole to raise a Jack Daniels flag, signaling to neighbors and friends they should come over for a party, according to the website. </p>
<p>Appropriately, Sinatra was buried with a bottle of his favorite Jack Daniels and a pack of dimes “to call his friends” when he died, <a>The Post reported</a>. </p>
<p>He built the 4,500-square-foot home with Nancy, from whom he split in 1951 <a>following public rumors of infidelity</a>. But the home bears more permanent remembrances of his second wife, Ava Gardner, whom he married in 1951. </p>
<a>with actress Lana Turner at home</a>, and one chipped sink was damaged by a Champagne bottle during one of the couple’s infamous rows, according to the site.
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 2</div> </div> </div>
<p>Sinatra sold the home in April 1953, around the time he and Gardner split.</p>
<p>The house designed by architect E. Stewart Williams has its original sound and recording system, but the kitchen has been restored with modern amenities. </p>
<p>Today, the home is available for rent as a short-term rental or an event venue. </p>
<h2>“The house I live in” </h2>
<p>Rancho Mirage, California | $4.3 million</p>
<p>After leaving Twin Palms in 1953, Sinatra moved to this private compound in 1954, which was considered his primary residence until 1995, when his declining health caused his family to sell the estate for $4.3 million, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p>He called the main house “The house I live in,” after his 1945 Oscar-winning film. Sinatra purchased two adjoining lots, creating a 2 ½-acre estate.</p>
<p>The home was designed by William F. Cody in 1952 for Austin H. Peterson, who never moved in. Sinatra commissioned Cody to complete an expansion and remodel for his own tastes, the Desert Sun reported.</p>
<p>The one-story house with clapboard siding had two bedrooms when he purchased it, but by the end of his residence had expanded to 18 bedrooms and 23 bathrooms.</p>
<p>It underwent significant renovations when his fourth wife Barbara Marx moved in and “wage[d] a gentle war on orange,” Sinatra’s favorite color, <a>according to a 1998 feature by Architectural Digest</a>.</p>
<p>The estate next to the Tamarisk Country Club gave Sinatra easy access to his golfing hobby, and his model trains got their own house on the property. The compound even had a home theater, according to Architectural Digest. </p>
<p>Since purchasing several lots on Wonder Palms Road, the street has been renamed to Frank Sinatra Drive in his honor. The property last sold for $4.6 million in 1996, according to Realtor.com. </p>
<h2>A rental just like Twin Palms: Farralone</h2>
<p>Chatsworth, California | $7.5 million to $12 million</p>
<p>It looks like Sinatra has a “type” — this mid-century modern house bears a striking resemblance to his “Twin Palms” estate.</p>
<p>Sinatra leased an 8,200-square-foot ranch house in Los Angeles in the late ’50s and early ’60s from Chase Manhattan Bank heiress Dora Hutchinson, according to the LA Times. </p>
<p>Known interchangeably as Farralone or Byrdview House, the seven-bed, seven-bath, two-half-bath home was designed in 1949 by Washington’s Kennedy Center architect William Pereira. It has 16-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. </p>
<p>An L-shaped trellis couches a swimming pool, and a smaller dipping pool sits near the guest house, which at one time housed Marilyn Monroe, <a>according to Architectural Digest</a>. </p>
<p>The home was <a>listed for sale</a> four times since 2011 asking between $12 million and $7.5 million but has not sold. </p>
<p>Since Sinatra, it has also served as <a>a set for AMC’s “Mad Men”</a> and the 2006 film “Dreamgirls.” </p>
<h2>A pair of penthouses in New York, New York</h2>
<p>Manhattan | $5 million + $150,000/month</p>
<p>Sinatra bought a 3,200-square-foot penthouse at 530 E. 72nd St. in Manhattan in 1961, <a>where he was known to sleep until 1:30 p.m</a>.</p>
<p>Overlooking the East River and <a>near his favorite clubs</a>, the home had 18-foot ceilings and 2,000-square-feet of outdoor balcony space where Sammy Davis Jr. would throw Champagne glasses onto FDR Drive, according to legend. </p>
<p>He lived there with his third wife, Mia Farrow, beginning in 1966, but they divorced <a>when she would not quit “Rosemary’s Baby” to be in his film “The Detective,”</a> and he sold the apartment in 1972.</p>
<p>The penthouse has since been completely renovated with four bedrooms, six bathrooms, a putting green and a replica of the floating glass staircase in Midtown’s Apple Store,<a> according to Top Ten Real Estate Deals</a>. </p>
<p>It most recently sold for $5 million in a bidding war in 2015, <a>The Post reported</a>. </p>
<p>Later in his life, Sinatra moved into a penthouse at the Waldorf Astoria with his fourth wife Barbara, who liked to dine at Le Cirque — <a>though Sinatra could only be persuaded to eat in his car outside</a>. </p>
<p>The penthouse was most recently rented for $150,000 a month, <a>The Post reported</a>.</p>
<p>Near Palm Desert, California | $4.25 million</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 3</div> </div> </div>
<p>Sinatra commissioned the compound during his short marriage to Mia Farrow in 1967 as a guys’ group getaway in the Coachella Valley. </p>
<p>He named it “Villa Maggio” after his 1953 “From Here to Eternity” character, Angelo Maggio.</p>
<p>Located in the desert, this nine-bedroom, 13-bathroom compound served as a gambling lodge. </p>
<p>Spanning 6,428-square-feet of living space, the estate has a resort-style pool, a lighted tennis court, a helipad and parking for 24 cars. The lodge has expansive mountain views.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 2</div> </div> </div>
<p>It has been on and off the market for 15 years, now asking $4.25 million but unable to secure a buyer due to its remote location, The Post reported. </p>
<h2>Retirement beach house</h2>
<p>Malibu, California | $9.5 million</p>
<p>Sinatra and his fourth wife, Barbara Marx, commissioned this seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom Malibu beach house in 1990. They renewed their vows at the beach house in 1996. </p>
<p>The 5,824-square-foot home has an indoor-outdoor bar, a patio with ocean views, a private terrace, a steam room and a hair salon, Page Six reported. </p>
<p>The home was purchased in March 2020 for $9.5 million by <a>a then-pregnant Mindy Kaling</a>, who is best known for her role writing, producing and acting in “The Office.” </p>
<h2>Suburban paradise in “Warm Valley”</h2>
<p>Bergen County, NJ | $714,300</p>
<p>One of Sinatra’s first homes was a Cape Cod-style house in suburban Hasbrouck Heights — though he was already famous enough that police had to break up crowds at the house, <a>according to a 1998 Baltimore Sun feature</a>. </p>
<a>his teenage sweetheart and first wife Nancy</a> and his then-1-year-old daughter Nancy. He purchased it in 1941, the year it was built, and sold it in 1944, the year they had their second daughter, Tina.
<p>It was last sold for $300,000 in 1999 and is estimated to be worth $714,300 today, <a>according to Realtor.com</a>. </p>
<p>Sunset Court, Brigantine (near Atlantic City) | $3.3 million</p>
<p>The home built by architect Robert Johnson in 1988 was listed for $5.2 million in 2015, including the piano Sinatra used during his stay. The price has since been reduced to $3.3 million. </p>
<p>On other occasions when he performed in Atlantic City, Sinatra stayed at the Golden Nugget hotel, where his “Chairman’s Suite” had golden toilets, The Post reported. </p>
<p>Sinatra famously grew up in Hoboken. His family moved several times, but his parents became homeowners when they purchased this four-floor townhouse for $13,400 in 1932, according to a 1988 article in the Jersey Journal. </p>
<a>about $250,000 today</a> — since then, and in part because of its ties with Sinatra, Hoboken has become exponentially more expensive. Today, the home is worth about $1.85 million,
<a>according to Realtor.com</a>.

<h1> The dirt-cheap NYC apartment where Harper Lee would hide out</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> February 21, 2016 5:45am </div>
<p>Harper Lee had something rarer than a best-seller — a dirt-cheap apartment in New York City.</p>
<p>The reclusive author of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” who died in her native Monroeville, Ala., Friday at age 89, had maintained an Upper East Side apartment and renewed the lease only a few months ago.</p>
<p>Lee signed on for two more years for her one-bedroom at 433 E. 82nd St., even though she hadn’t occupied it since suffering a stroke in 2007.</p>
<p>“She’s up to date on her rent,” said property manager Steven Austern, who lives in the building.</p>
<p>He said the rent was less than $1,000 a month.</p>
<p>With Lee living elsewhere, Austern had a legal right to terminate the lease — and collect a higher rent from a new tenant — but he said he couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>“She was a personal friend of mine,” he said.</p>
<p>Lee was also friendly with other tenants in the building.</p>
<p>“She was a very Southern and hospitable type of person,” one neighbor said.</p>
<p>Lee would finish the New York Times Magazine crossword puzzle by 9 a.m. every Sunday and leave it on a table in the building lobby.</p>
<p>“There was never an empty box,” the neighbor recalled.</p>
<p>She was a big Mets fan but couldn’t watch games on TV because she never had one, he said.</p>
<p>A label by the buzzer outside the five-story brick building reads “Lee — H,” but some occupants had no idea who that was.</p>
<p>“Her radiator leaked earlier this year and made a hole in our ceiling. That’s how we found out she lived there,” said Caroline Holden, who lives in a basement apartment.</p>
<p>Holden went on to proudly report to friends that the Pulitzer-winning author ruined her ceiling.</p>
<p>The building’s super, Carlos Nieves, revealed that Lee made him promise not to tell any details of her life after she died.</p>
<p>Lee’s apartment, 1E, looks out over an overgrown courtyard.</p>
<p>She had moved to Manhattan in 1949 and worked as an airline reservation agent. She wrote in her spare time until two friends gave her enough money to devote herself full-time to her craft.</p>
<p>She maintained a cold-water flat on York Avenue and 82nd Street until the building was demolished in 1967. She then moved across 82nd to the current place.</p>
<p>Lee would split her time between Manhattan and Monroeville, where she died in her sleep Friday at an assisted-living facility.</p>
<p>She was a regular at Ottomanelli Bros. butcher shop on York Avenue, visiting twice a day, first at 7:30 a.m. for a cup of black coffee and a raisin scone, said co-owner Nicolas “Uncle Nic” Ottomanelli.</p>
<p>She would go back in the late afternoon for a chicken, a lamb chop “trimmed real neat” or the first cut of Delmonico steak.</p>
<p>Recalled Ottomanelli, “She used to come in and say, ‘Remember, my knives aren’t sharp, so the steak has to be tender!’ ”</p>
<h1> ‘Mockingbird’ is still relevant 60 years later on Broadway</h1>
<div> December 14, 2018 10:52am </div>
<p>Bartlett Sher, the ace behind the Tony-winning “The King and I” revival and “Oslo,” directs strong performances, especially from Keenan-Bolger, whose Scout lights up the stage with warmth.</p>
<p>Then again, we don’t need music: “To Kill a Mockingbird” already sings its own sad song.</p>
<h1> Why this ‘Mockingbird’ star won’t make films with famous hubby</h1>
<div> January 24, 2019 4:23pm <div> Updated <div> January 24, 2019 8:26pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“Snakes on a Plane”? Please! LaTanya Richardson Jackson can’t understand what anyone sees in her husband’s silliest movie.</p>
<p>As far as Sorkin’s concerned, it’s Jackson who’s the gift.</p>
<p>“She’s phenomenal,” the playwright tells The Post. “Her power, her sense of humor and the way she can go toe-to-toe” with Jeff Daniels, the Atticus Finch to her Calpurnia, the Finches’ housekeeper.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember crying during ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’ but I cried during ‘Night,’ ” she says. “It changed my life in terms of how I really saw justice.”</p>
<p>Her first impression of the future “Pulp Fiction” star? “He was a big boy with a big Afro and tiny glasses,” she recalls. “He looked like Linc on ‘The Mod Squad’!”</p>
<p>Even so, says Jackson, who sports a diamond as big as her knuckle (“He’s a good guy,” she says of the husband who gave it to her), staying home wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>“I’m looking at him reading his scripts, and I’m changing diapers,” she says. “But it was OK, ’cause I made the choice . . . I wasn’t taking less. I took different!”</p>
<p>By the early ’90s, though, she was back, appearing in dozens of TV shows and films, including 2003’s “The Fighting Temptations,” which featured a pre-Queen Bey Beyoncé.</p>
<p>“No biggie,” she says with a shrug. “I’ve known him so long, we’re family. His kids say I push him around like his mother, anyway!”</p>
<p>One thing she’s determined not to do is make another film with her husband. They were in just one movie together, 2006’s “Freedomland,” and LaTanya had the temerity to suggest an idea for a shot.</p>
<p>For the record, her “absolute favorite” Samuel L. Jackson film is “Pulp Fiction,” followed closely by “Django Unchained.”</p>
<p>Those who’ve seen “Mockingbird” are saying the same thing about her.</p>

<h1> Alabama town that inspired ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ elects first black mayor</h1>
<div> September 2, 2020 4:33pm </div>
<p>The Alabama town that inspired Harper Lee’s classic novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” recently made history once again by electing its first black mayor.</p>
<p>Charles Andrews, 65, defeated incumbent Sandy Smith in Monroeville’s August 25 election, and is set to take office on November 2, CNN reported.</p>
<p>“Thank you Monroeville,” Andrews said in a video posted to Facebook Sunday. “I am honored and humbled by your confidence and trust in me to represent you as this town’s first African American mayor.”</p>
<p>“Today, as I stand on the threshold of history, the shoulders of our parents and our foreparents, we are one people, one town and one team, all inclusive,” he said in the speech.</p>
<p>And in 2011, former President Barack Obama appointed him as US Marshal in Mobile, the outlet reported.</p>
<p>Andrews told AL.com he remembers his first trip to see the 1962 “To Kill a Mockingbird” film starring Gregory Peck. He was with his mother in a segregated theater.</p>
<p>“It didn’t strike me that we were sitting in the black section of the theater,” said Andrews, now 65. “Being a child at the time, and being the first time going to the movies, I was kind of awe-struck.”</p>
<p>While the city has a long history of racial injustices, Andrews said he believes “Monroeville, over the years, has grown past that.”</p>

<h1> Where did Artie Lange go when he disappeared amid battle for sobriety?</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> July 22, 2021 11:43am <div> Updated <div> July 22, 2021 1:16pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Two years have passed since comedian Artie Lange was released from jail after violating probation for cocaine and heroin possession. </p>
<p>For more than a year, Howard Stern’s former sidekick has remained mainly off the grid, which left many fans <a>fearing the worst</a> and wondering: Where did he go? </p>
<p>The Post can now reveal that Lange, 53, is doing well as he continues in an intensive New Jersey drug court program — and he hasn’t forgotten about his loyal supporters.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Michael Robbins of West Orange, New Jersey, told The Post that Lange has been sober for the past 2½ years and continues to live at his home in Hoboken. </p>
<p>“He is working on completing his drug court program and resuming his career,” Robbins said. “Artie is grateful for the continued support of his friends and, of course, his fans.”</p>
<p>“His mom suffers from severe cataracts. She’s legally blind, so she had to move in with Artie,” the source told The Post. </p>
<p>“Also, she can cook for him and make sure he eats properly. [You know], Italian mothers,” the insider quipped. </p>
<p>Fans have been wondering where the former “Crashing” star went after taking a social media hiatus since mid-November 2020, following a nearly eight-month break prior to that. </p>
<p>But the insider explained that <a>staying sober for </a>Lange has been a full-time job. </p>
<p>“People have to understand … He was doing $1,800 worth of cocaine and heroin a day for several years — that’s got to do something to you mentally once you stop doing it,” the source told The Post. </p>
<p>In March 2020, a little over a year after leaving prison, Lange assured fans he was determined to stay on the right track this time, despite years and years of <a>struggles with addiction. </a></p>
<a>March 13, 2020, tweet</a>. 
<p>Lange <a>spent nearly two months in prison</a> starting in May 2019 before heading into an intensive, seven-month drug court program in Hudson County, which he admitted was what saved his life. </p>
<p>Lange credited his mom for helping him stay sober. </p>
<p>His legal woes stemmed from an initial 2017 arrest for cocaine and heroin possession, although he has struggled with <a>drug addiction</a> for years.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Stern gave a rare interview with the New York Times Magazine in which he admitted he <a>loves his one-time sidekick</a> but reached a point where he had to let him go.</p>
<p>“What’s happening with Artie makes me very sad. We’ve lost touch, and that’s my doing,” Stern said. “I got my fingers crossed for the guy. And it wasn’t a clean break.</p>
<p>In Lange’s most recent interview with radio and podcast host Nick Di Paolo in November 2020, Lange <a>revealed some of the things</a> he has done to stay sober. </p>

<h1> Cuomo makes baseball NY’s official sport but basketball fans cry foul</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo swung for the fences Friday, signing into law a measure making baseball New York’s official sport — but Big Apple sports fans say he really missed a layup. </p>
<p>The governor went to bat for the national pastime over other more popular and accessible city sports like basketball, noting that New York state is home to the baseball Hall of Fame in upstate Cooperstown.</p>
<p>Cuomo noted the legislation was proposed by a Cooperstown Elementary School fourth-grade class.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s release boasted that New York is “home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown where Abner Doubleday is said to have created the sport.”</p>
<p>Some New Yorkers on Friday said basketball is way more popular than baseball in New York.</p>
<p>“I think that New York could be the best basketball state. You don’t really hear of so many baseball players coming out of New York. You hear more about basketball players coming out.” </p>
<p>Smush Parker, a former Los Angeles Lakers basketball player who officiates hoops games at West 4th, said basketball definitely rules in New York City. But he said baseball may be the top sport outside the Big Apple.</p>
<p>Niko Triantafillou, a native New Yorker and Chelsea resident, likes baseball but doesn’t think it should be the sport of New York because it “just doesn’t really match with New Yorkers’ personality.”</p>
<p>“It’s the national pastime, but it is a little out of character for New York State, because New Yorkers like to get things done in a fast manner.”</p>
<p>The language in the law itself does not claim New York as the birthplace of baseball.</p>
<p>A Hoboken historian accused Cuomo of throwing a wild pitch by claiming New York as the birthplace of baseball.</p>
<p>“That’s a crock,” Bob Foster, director of the Hoboken Historical Museum, told The Post.</p>
<p>“The Cooperstown Hall of Fame is a great place. But to say that Abner Doubleday started baseball earlier in New York is fictitious,” Foster said.</p>
<p>Hoboken has long claimed that teams from New York and Brooklyn — then a separate city — first played the new sport at the city’s Elysian Fields in 1845.</p>
<p>Other documents claim baseball was first played in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1791.</p>
<p>Other New Yorkers said many city residents are passionate baseball fans, and that America’s pastime should be the state’s official sport.</p>
<p>“Yankees and Mets fans are very, what would say, rabid. They’re real dedicated, I’d say, more so than Knicks and Nets [fans],” said Jocelyn, a 64-year-old Upper West Side resident.</p>
<p>As the state’s official sport, baseball joins a list of other New York State symbols which includes milk as the state beverage, apple as the state fruit, the snapping turtle as the state reptile and yogurt as the state snack.</p>

<p>The most expensive townhouse in Hoboken history has hit the market for $7 million, The Post has learned. </p>
<p>Made up of six bedrooms and seven baths, the New Jersey home boasts four floors, with an additional cellar and rooftop. </p>
<p>Located on Hoboken’s coveted Hudson Street, the historically protected red-brick home has been completely restored with modern finishes, according to the listing. </p>
<p>The residence dates back to 1897 and was gut renovated in 2017 while retaining the 10-foot-four-inch-high 18th century Argentinian double entrance doors. </p>
<p>Eleven rooms in total, the property comes with two living rooms, a study, two dens, an office, a library, playroom and a media room. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 3</div> </div> </div>
<p>Currently owned by Matt and Diana Thomas, a day trader and recruiter, they initially purchased the home in 2016 for $2.9 million. </p>
<p>Noteworthy features include an elevator that serves all five levels of the home, a carriage house with a stand-alone loft apartment that comes with a separate entry on Court Street, and a private garage with room for two cars. </p>
<p>A Control4 smart home system has also been installed. It includes six exterior cameras, a video entry and intercom, automated shades and lighting controls. </p>
<p>Considered Hoboken’s premier location, this townhouse is a short distance from the PATH Train and NY Waterway ferry to Manhattan. </p>
<p>The listing is represented by Peter Cossio of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
