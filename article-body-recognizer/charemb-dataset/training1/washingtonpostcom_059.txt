<p>The 20-year-old University of Colorado at Boulder student had watched on social media as climate activists demonstrated outside the White House to demand that President Biden declare a national climate emergency. She wanted to be there, too.</p>

<div><div><p>For nine years, unhoused people and their advocates have gathered in the District on or around the longest night of the year to commemorate those who died while homeless.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those who died — listed in a program mostly by age, not name, to preserve anonymity — were as young as 23 and as old as 77.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Deaths among D.C.’s homeless jumped this year, including 23 who died of the coronavirus</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to work faster and smarter and harder to make sure our neighbors have the resources necessary to maintain housing,” Black said. “It is so terrible how we have to do this every year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C.’s official tally of deaths among unhoused people often exceeds the informal count kept by advocates. City officials, who have provided death statistics in the past, did not do so this year despite requests.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>outside with preexisting medical conditions.
<div><div><p>“I think they would have lived a lot longer had they never been out on the street,” Turner said. “Those conditions only worsen. … You can’t medically turn back the hands of time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re seeing tremendous loss of life prematurely,” Watts said. “We view homelessness not just as a housing crisis but as a public health and moral crisis.”</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> cases reaching record highs, nearly all attendees were masked. The vigil commenced hours after Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) reinstated the city’s indoor mask mandate to combat the new omicron variant of the coronavirus.
<div><div><p>Speaking<b> </b>in front of a coffin — a reminder of those who died in 2021 — Mike Coleman, who was homeless in the District for about 25 years before finding a home in 2011, waved a list of those who had died.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Next year, my name might be on this list,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jesse Rabinowitz, senior manager for policy and advocacy at the outreach organization Miriam’s Kitchen, said 2021 had been a year of “ups and downs” as the District sent mixed messages to its unhoused residents.</p></div>
<a>on affordable housing through 2022</a>. However, the pledge came as local authorities
<a>cleared long-established tent communities</a> at New Jersey Avenue and O Street NW and near Union Station, where one resident was injured by a bulldozer during the removal.
<div><p>D.C.’s ‘Skid Row-type thing’: Homeless encampments grow amid pandemic</p></div>
<div><div><p>The D.C. Council, meanwhile, is scheduled to vote Tuesday on emergency legislation sponsored by Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) <a>to halt encampment clearances</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brian Carome, CEO of the outreach organization Street Sense, said the pandemic has left empty office space downtown that must be turned into housing, <a>as Bowser recently proposed.</a></p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s imperative that we take advantage of the opportunity this provides to convert at least some of that empty space into housing,” he wrote in an email. “Doing so would most certainly save lives.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Freedom Plaza, Coleman recognized a nearby hotel. He had panhandled in front of the building for many years, he said, and “almost died” there many times of drug and alcohol abuse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He got off the street<b> </b>by “getting involved,” he said. As temperatures plunged below 40 degrees, he was here to continue the fight.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>When she moved from Ohio to Virginia to fulfill a lifelong dream of working with horses, Andy Jane Armstrong didn’t think her future would depend on a cable-run ferry line established in the late 1700s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Skeptical that she can afford a home in Maryland, Armstrong is considering a career change that would eliminate the lengthy commute.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s definitely an adjustment,” she said. “I’m doing what I’ve grown up wanting to do my whole life.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>White’s Ferry started shuttling passengers across the Potomac River in the 1700s. It closed in 2020.</p></div>
<p>A $200,000 study co-sponsored by Montgomery and Loudoun counties from October <a>found </a>that up to around 800 cars used the ferry daily, which cost $8 round-trip for vehicles. By 2040, according to the study, demand for trips could exceed 2,300.</p>

<div><p>With new owner, beloved White’s Ferry has a chance of reopening</p></div>

<div><div><p>“I had no idea how difficult Peter Brown and his partners would be to negotiate with,” Kuhn said. “He’s a very experienced businessperson.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Devlin said her brother is a “passive shareholder” — but the size of his stake is irrelevant,<b> </b>because the farm’s owners want “to keep it in the family.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>“I got rid of a headache, but I’m still involved as much as I can,” he said in an interview. “It was in the family for 75 years. … I hated to close it, but it just made no sense to go to work.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We are neutral on who is operating the ferry, but we are focused on the fact that reopening it is a key to our transportation efforts,” she said. “The legal hurdles are really all on the Virginia side.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In the meantime, commuters such as Armstrong will continue to seek out alternative ways to cross the river. She’s not optimistic after months of failed negotiations, but she continues to hope for a breakthrough.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>D.C. region races to restore power, dig out icy roads a day after big snowstorm</h1></div>

<div><div><p>Authorities scrambled to restore power and clear icy roads amid school closings and delays Tuesday as the D.C. region dug out from the first major winter snowstorm of the season and its largest since 2019.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Almost 24 hours after the snow stopped falling, roads remained treacherous throughout the area, with many streets in the District unplowed and some commuters stranded overnight in their vehicles on Interstate 95 south of the city.</p></div>
<b> </b>South of the District, the storm dumped as much as 12 to 16 inches in the area around Fredericksburg and in parts of southern Maryland. An additional one to three inches of accumulation was expected Thursday night.

<div><div><p>A 23-year-old Maryland man has been charged with purchasing and distributing fake coronavirus vaccine cards to enrich himself, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The man, Amar Salim Shabazz, was allegedly not shy about his scheme, either.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I SELL PROOF OF VACCINATION CARDS,” he commented under an Instagram post about bars and restaurants requiring guests to show proof of vaccination cards, the criminal complaint said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his private messages on the app, prosecutors alleged, he told another individual, “I’m gonna be rich.”</p></div></div>

<h1>A Christmas gift: Stories of a return to something familiar</h1>

<div><div><h3><div>Save the date</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>By the time Dylan Isenberg got down on one knee, five years had passed since he asked his manager at a D.C. sports bar to put him on more shifts with the pretty new hostess.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Five years since he and Molly Sadowsky spent evenings talking on the red couch on his porch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Five years since that fateful night at the Wonderland Ballroom when feelings spilled out and a relationship began.</p></div></div>
<p>Dylan and Molly were in no rush to get married. But when the time came, they knew what they wanted: the rooftop venue they had fallen for, bright pink bougainvillea flowers and their terrier mix, Olive, carrying their rings down the aisle.</p>
<div><div><p>They set a date: May 23, 2020. Then the world stopped.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emails flew back and forth with their vendors, some of whom pressed them to move forward with their 180-guest ceremony and reception. But Molly and Dylan knew they needed to wait.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What do you want me to do — say, like, ‘Do you take this man?’” the bureaucrat asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For such a momentous occasion, it felt all wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the months that followed provided little relief, and the couple eventually realized they would have to postpone the wedding yet again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It felt,” Molly said, “like a thing that might never happen.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A sadness washed over them, and then a wave of guilt. So many people were enduring worse, they reminded themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, they were tired of waiting. So on July 4 in Philadelphia’s Love Park, as their newly vaccinated families watched, Molly and Dylan signed the paperwork. They were legally wed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They hope finally to hold their formal event next May. The details don’t matter much anymore, as long as they’re together and surrounded by their loved ones.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On that late spring morning, Dylan will wake up and get ready for one of the most important days of his life. Before he walks out the door, he’ll don the light gray suit that he has waited so long to wear.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>When the U.S.-Mexico border shut down except for essential travel to prevent the spread of the <a>coronavirus</a>, Silvia was unable to see her mother — or her brothers, cousins, nieces and nephews.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She struggled with what she called “problemas de tristeza” — problems with sadness. Her mother felt the same way. It was like that for 20 months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, on Nov. 8, the Biden administration reopened the border.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Gracias a Dios,” Silvia whispered at the news. And then she called her mom.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Days later, Silvia drove up to the bridge that connects El Paso and Ciudad Juárez and waited for Yolanda to cross. Then she saw her mother’s car.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Her mother looked much thinner than Silvia remembered. Paler. Her blood pressure was higher, and her diabetes had worsened.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Silvia knew she had changed, too. She had gained weight over the months she spent cooped up inside, hiding from the virus. She had also developed high blood pressure and was diagnosed with arthritis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And this year, Silvia said, she will decorate the Christmas tree.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>That wish to facilitate communal grief is what drew him to the business, first as a teenager, when the sharpest dresser and most elegant man at his family’s LeDroit Park church was a funeral director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Tall and distinguished,” recalled Payne, now 50. “The coolest dude in the world.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His attraction to the business deepened in the early 1990s when his closest friend, Kevin Sayles, then 22, was fatally shot.</p></div></div>
<p>In his grief, Payne found purpose and perhaps distraction in attending to the needs of Sayles’s family. Then, a month later, Payne’s uncle Rodney died after a long illness, and again he felt himself drawn to help arrange the funeral.</p>
<div><div><p>Another person’s end, he found, became for him a kind of beginning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Always, there are so many details to handle, beginning with the first call, as when the woman phoned about her mother in Shenandoah Valley.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The phone rang again at 4 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Precious Memories Funeral Home,” he answered, reaching for his pen.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>The snowman-o-meter</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>A projector greeted the second-grade class with a question: “On a scale of snowman, how are you feeling today?” The children were supposed to choose one of nine pictures of snowmen with different facial expressions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From a stool at the back of the room, Thomas Gallo’s hand shot up. He squirmed to the edge of his seat, staring at his teacher through his thick-rimmed blue glasses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His teacher, Ali Stone, missed Thomas during guided reading sessions and lessons on capitalization and punctuation. “Tommy, Tommy,” she would say into the mic. “Are you there?” Silence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I couldn’t understand all the time. I just didn’t want to say it out loud,” he said. “I was kind of embarrassed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, on an ordinary school day in December, Thomas’s answer to the snowman question was clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I feel number four,” he said, pointing at the snowman with arms thrust in the air and a wide grin on its face. “Because, well, I just feel excited.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>When his old employer said they were cutting back on Santas because of the pandemic, he found a new gig across the country, leaving Punta Gorda, Fla., for the first time in two years and arriving at a resort in the D.C. suburbs.</p></div>
