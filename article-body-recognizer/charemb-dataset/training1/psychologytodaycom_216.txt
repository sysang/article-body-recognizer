<h1> The Secret to Improving Your Relationship </h1>
<h2> Knowing how your partner’s brain works is key to relationship happiness. </h2>
<li> Individuals are "wired" differently in the realms of extraversion, emotionality, and effortful control.</li>
<li>Such differences lead people to experience the world in different ways, which can lead to relationship tension.</li>
<li>Partners should try to understand where each other fall on these three key dimensions to be able to manage mismatches more effectively.</li>
<a>parenting</a>, understanding how your partner is wired can help you navigate your relationship with them. Mismatches between spouses on The Big Three (and other dimensions) are often at the root of problems that couples experience.
<p>So what are The Big Three? The Big Three (also called The Three E’s) are <a>Extraversion</a>, Emotionality, and Effortful Control.</p>
<p>Emotionality refers to how we experience and deal with <a>fear</a>, frustration, or distress. Some of us have brains that are more prone to these experiences. We are more likely to worry and to be concerned about a variety of things. </p>
<li>Are you someone who gets energy from being in the company of others?</li>
<li>Do you enjoy large parties and meeting new people?</li>
<li>Are you someone who is talkative and full of energy?</li>
<li>Are you someone who is outgoing and social?</li>
<ul><li>Are you someone who gets nervous easily?</li> <li>Do you worry a lot?</li> <li>Are you someone who easily gets down or feels blue?</li> <li>Do you get very frustrated or upset when things don’t go as planned?</li> </ul>
<li>Are you good at making a plan and following through?</li>
<li>Do you think about things carefully before you do them?</li>
<li>Do you have a tendency to do crazy things when you are in a really good or a really bad mood?</li>
<li>Do you enjoy taking risks?</li>
<p>Here’s why this matters: When spouses are mismatched on The Big Three, it can lead to tension. These tensions play out in the miniscule day-to-day routine, so you probably aren’t consciously aware of the underlying cause.</p>

<h1> 5 Ways to Keep Alcohol Use in Check During Stressful Times </h1>
<h2> How not to let a fun pastime or intended stress-reducer get out of control. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Stress? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome stress</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Worried About Alcohol Use During the Pandemic?</a>” a friend jokingly messaged me: “I only worry when my alcohol supply is running low! But seriously, got any tips for keeping alcohol in check?”
<p>Here are five ways to help you avoid falling into harmful patterns of alcohol use during these challenging times.</p>
<p>1. Take stock of your drinking.</p>
<p>I’m frequently asked, “How much is too much?” As a general rule of thumb, high-risk drinking (i.e. levels of alcohol use that could start harming your body) is considered: </p>
<ul><li>for women, 4 or more drinks on any given day, or 8 or more drinks per week</li> <li>for men, 5 or more drinks on any given day, or 15 or more drinks per week </li> </ul>
<p>2. Know what to look for.</p>
<a>personal factors</a>, general health and other medical conditions, and whether an individual is taking other
<a>medications</a>. For that reason, you want to keep an eye on whether your drinking is causing you problems.
<p>Indicators of problems include:</p>
<li>drinking more than you intended</li>
<li>having trouble <a>cutting</a> down on your drinking</li>
<li>getting into situations while drinking that could get you hurt (e.g., having unsafe <a>sex</a>, driving)</li>
<li>having to drink a lot more to get the same effect (developing tolerance)</li>
<li>continuing to drink even though it is making you <a>depressed</a> or <a>anxious</a>, or leading to other health problems or blackouts</li>
<li>spending a lot of time drinking, or recovering from the effects of alcohol</li>
<li>continuing to drink even though it is causing problems with your family or friends</li>
<li>interfering with your responsibilities, at home, school, or work</li>
<li>giving up other activities because of your drinking</li>
<li>craving alcohol when you aren’t drinking</li>
<li>having trouble <a>sleeping</a>, restlessness, nausea, sweating, or other physical symptoms when you stop drinking</li>
<p>Even in the best of times, alcohol can be habit-forming. You have a drink when you get home from work; you have a glass of wine with dinner. Over time, our brain gets into a routine and we fall into a pattern. </p>
<p>4. Have an accountability partner.</p>
<a>envy</a> you), but many of us are lower on
<a>self-control</a>. Having an accountability partner is a proven way to help you stick to your commitments, whether that is taking a break from alcohol for a defined period of time, or simply setting some rules around your drinking.

<a>accountability partner</a> could be a spouse, friend, or anyone else that you can inform of your intentions and who will check in with you to make sure you’re sticking to them.
<p>5. Change your routine. </p>
<a>exercise</a> is a great way to stay healthy and has beneficial effects on well-being! Or if you find yourself craving a special mid-afternoon drink, find a non-
<a>alcoholic</a> version that you can substitute instead: I’m partial to flavored Pellegrino in a fancy glass. Find what works for you; the key is to substitute a new activity to take the place of drinking.
<a>National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a> website has great resources to find an
<a>alcohol treatment provider</a>; the
<a>Psychology Today therapist directory</a> is also a good resource. The majority of people who meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder
<a>never seek help</a>. Don’t wait until your drinking is hurting your life before you

<p>Four-year-old Ava was building a fairy garden with her friends at preschool when the pandemic hit. Now she’s stuck at home coloring by herself, with two working parents who are juggling Zoom meetings and entertaining a small child. </p>
<h3>Keeping children cooped up at home is certainly hard on parents, but is it also having a long-term effect on children’s development?</h3>

<h1> How to Navigate Differences of Opinion in Your Relationship </h1>
<h2> Three steps to take when you and your partner disagree. </h2>
<li>Disagreements on the best way to handle things will arise in relationships, but science-based strategies for navigating such disagreements exist.</li>
<li>By using "I" statements, listening, and cultivating empathy, partners can try to understand each other's perspective.</li>
<li>Reframing a problem as an issue both partners will navigate together avoids the feeling of being pitted against one another.</li>
<a>Extraversion</a>, Emotionality, and Effortful Control can give you a window into understanding a hidden cause of relationship challenges. When you and your partner are mismatched on your natural tendencies, it can lead to friction.
<p>So what do you do when you realize you and your partner have different ways of approaching things? Here are three steps to bridge the divide. </p>
<h3>1. Approach with curiosity.</h3>
<a>bonding</a> time with the kiddos. Now imagine their surprise (and frustration) when you come home and are all worked up about the toys. Admittedly, that might not be purely hypothetical. It’s played out in our house in various forms many times.
<a>empathy</a> builds connection to other people, which is good for our health and well-being, in addition to our relationships!
<h3>3. Get on the same team. </h3>
<p>Too often when we have differences with our significant other, we approach our partner as the adversary. "I want to do it this way, and they are making it difficult! Why won’t they just see it my way?" The reality is that they can’t. </p>

<h1> What’s Your Child’s Unique Nature? </h1>
<h2> Take the quiz to figure out what parenting styles will work best for your child. </h2>
<li>Where your child falls across the Three E’s has a big impact on their behavior—and how they respond to your parenting! </li>
<li>Extraversion in children is related to their natural tendencies toward positive affect, activity level, and exploratory behavior.</li>
<li>Emotionality refers to children’s natural tendencies toward distress, fear, and frustration.</li>
<li>Effortful control refers to how well children can regulate their emotions and behavior.</li>
<a>parenting</a> strategies to be most effective for your particular unique child. This can help you help your child to reach their potential and to avoid possible pitfalls!
<p>There are three big, genetically-influenced temperamental dimensions on which children differ. I call them The Big Three or The Three E’s: <a>Extraversion</a> (Ex), Emotionality (Em), and Effortful Control (Ef). </p>
<p>Children who are low in extraversion are more involved in their own internal worlds of ideas, emotions, and play. Low Ex children enjoy quiet time alone. They don’t need a constant flurry of activities, adventures, or other people.</p>
<p>Where your child falls across the Three E’s has a big impact on their behavior—and how they respond to your parenting! </p>
<p>Here are some questions to help you assess where your child falls across The Big Three. </p>
<h3>Extraversion: The “Ex” Factor</h3>
<p>Does your child like adventuresome games or activities (High Ex), or does your child prefer quieter activities, like reading, over more high-energy ones (Low Ex)?</p>

<h1> How to Curb Defiant Behavior in Children </h1>
<h2> Three simple steps to reduce temper tantrums and talking back. </h2>
<li>Counterintuitively, focusing on positive behavior, rather than behavior that needs improvement, is more effective at increasing good behavior.</li>
<li>Using rewards, rather than consequences, is more effective at reducing defiant behavior.</li>
<li>Problem-solving with your child to find a solution together is the most effective way to address challenging behavior.</li>
<li>These techniques work with children of all ages; joint problem-solving is effective from age three onward.</li>
<p>1. Focus on the positive.</p>
<a>sibling</a> didn’t squabble in the car.”
<p>2. Be generous with rewards, and use consequences sparingly.</p>
<p>Very often, we parents get the ratio of rewards and consequences wrong. We’re focused on our children’s challenging behaviors and how to fix them. It’s understandable: those are the pieces that most drive us crazy! </p>
<a>Here’s a cheat sheet to get you started</a>.)
<p> 3. Problem-solve with your child.</p>
<a>extraversion</a>), or completing tasks that are
<a>boring</a> (particularly for Low Ef children, who are low in effortful control).

<h1> How to Improve Self-Control in Children </h1>
<h2> A proven strategy that's rooted in brain science. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Self-Control? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to help with self-control</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Self-control is related to two areas of the brain: the limbic system (“hot” brain) and the prefrontal cortex (“cool” brain).</li>
<li>Some kids are naturally lower on self-control because they have "hot-brain" biases, based on the genes they were born with.</li>
<li>"When-then" plans take advantage of brain science to wire new connections and help children overcome self-control struggles.</li>
<a>self-regulation</a> are at the top of many parents’ lists of things-our-kids-do-that-drive-us-crazy.
<p>To understand our children’s self-control or lack thereof, we need to start by understanding where it comes from. </p>
<a>attention</a> to the here and now and aren’t as good at thinking through consequences.
<p>The good news is that the children who are the most genetically prone to having challenges with self-control are also the ones who show the most improvement with self-control strategies.</p>
<h3>Self-control and when-then plans</h3>
<p>One way to get around this developmental gap is When-then plans. When-then plans help eliminate the need for the cool brain to guide our kids to a better course of action by eliminating the need for thought altogether. </p>

<h1> On Junk Food and Junk Sex </h1>
<h2> Is sex outside home similar to eating outside home? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>"Great food is like great sex. The more you have the more you want." —Gael Greene</p>
<p>Sex and food are connected in many ways. Are they also similar in terms of <a>morality</a>? Is having sex outside your house as moral and acceptable as eating out?</p>
<p>“My hot lover feeds me with superb chocolate and green tea after sex; I always want the sex to be over fast.” —A married woman</p>
<a>sexual</a> desire. Other foods are perceived to be erotic because of their shape and texture—e.g., bananas, asparagus, and avocado. Other foods, like whipped cream and chocolate spread, are sometimes part of a sexual game.
<p>Sex, eating and morality</p>
<p>“Sex is no more a moral issue than eating a good meal.” —Catherine Hakim</p>
<p>“I love you more than coffee, but please don't make me prove it.” —Elizabeth Evans</p>
<p>Junk sex and healthy <a>romantic relationships</a></p>
<p>“Junk sex is like junk food—not bad enough to avoid, but definitely not good enough to make a steady diet of.” —The Urban Dictionary</p>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>What to Do When Partners Want Different Amounts of Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>10 Reasons Why Some Couples Stop Having Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>Consider the following common claims about both junk food and junk sex:</p>
<li>a. Junk food and junk sex both have little long-term value for <a>nutrition</a> or for romantic love—they provide instant satisfaction.</li>
<li>b. Junk food is high in fat, sugar, salt, and calories; junk sex is high in superficial, egoistic desires.</li>
<li>c. Many foods and sexual activities are healthy or junk depending on their “ingredients” and on the way in which they are prepared.</li>
<li>d. Consuming or engaging in a limited amount of junk food or junk sex is generally safe when integrated into a well-balanced diet or relationship.</li>
<li>e. Junk food and junk sex can easily become addictive.</li>
<p>Love is important in forming a valuable marital framework. However, there are various types of loving relationships, and exclusive sexual intensity is not essential for all forms of marital frameworks.</p>
<p>Julia Child once said that "people who love to eat are always the best people." I would say that people who love junk sex (and food) will never be satisfied—they will always be hungry for their next superficial sexual (and edible) encounter.</p>

<h2> The comparative concern in open romantic relationships. </h2>

<p>“I love you more than coffee, but please don't make me prove it.” —Elizabeth Evans</p>
<a>jealousy</a>, less poisonous in open
<a>romantic relationships</a>? The importance of the comparative concern is illustrated by the story of the man who was upset because he had no shoes—until he met a man who had no feet. One person’s ceiling is another person’s floor.
<p>Comparison in romantic relationships</p>
<p>“Last time I tried to make love to my wife nothing was happening, so I said to her, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t think of anybody either?’” —Rodney Dangerfield</p>
<p>Comparison in open relationships</p>
<p>“She says it’s really not very flattering to her that the women who fall in love with her husband are so uncommonly second-rate.” —W. Somerset Maugham, The Painted Veil</p>
<a>polyamorous</a> husband (cited in Carmi Sade-Saadon, 2020).
<li>“When you sleep with me, do you think about her?” —Anat asking her partner, Yoav, about his additional partner.</li>
<li>“He may be more handsome than me, wiser or even better in bed than me. But no one is more Itamar than me! What is most important is that I am the most Itamar.” —Itamar to his partner, Chen, on her primary partner.</li>
<a>marriage</a>, then why choose someone who occupies the same territory? Take someone different.” —Omer, the husband of Daphna
<a>happiness</a> with another lover. Indeed, differences between the spouse and the lover reduce the value of comparison and protect
<a>self-esteem</a>, where compersion is consequently more likely to emerge. Thus, if the lover differs from the spouse in features such as age, appearance, temperament, or occupation, compersion is more likely to occur in both partners.

<p>There are people who fall in love quickly, easily, and frequently. Does this way of falling in love promote an enduring, profound love?</p>
<p>Loving and being in love</p>
<a>optimism</a>.” –Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love
<p>Chemistry and compatibility</p>
<a>assertive</a> in pleasing their new partner. It appears to me that ‘slow to love’ is equivalent to ‘slow in bed.’” –Leah
<a>attraction</a> associated with increased cerebral activities. Compatibility refers to a more comprehensive and longer-lasting set of behaviors.
<a>Mark Manson</a> discerns four central types of relationships: low chemistry—low compatibility; low chemistry—high compatibility; high chemistry—low compatibility; high chemistry—high compatibility. The best and most long-lasting
<a>romantic relationship</a> is that of profound love, consisting of high chemistry and compatibility.
<p>Serial lovers and falling in love quickly</p>
<p>“When I love, I do it without counting. I give myself entirely. And each time, it is the grand love of my life.” –Brigitte Bardot</p>
<p>Here are several viewpoints from women about their experience of falling in love quickly.</p>
<p>“I’ve asked my new lover to replace the couch and mattress in his apartment. I am pretty sure many other women have been there before my time. He smiled and said OK.” –Rebecca</p>
<p>“I do not fall in love quickly. I do respond very quickly to the courting of men who seem ‘worthy’ to me and usually <a>flirt</a> back with them.” –Limor</p>

<p>“I am happy for people who remain in love with the same partner for a long time. Would I want to be in love with the same man all my life? The answer is 'no.' I really need more than one love in my whole life.” –Marianne</p>
<p>“When I was young, I fell in love many times, mainly with hot men, as this was at the top of my list. As we get older, the intellect becomes more important, and immediate cases of infatuation disappear.” –Hanna</p>

<h1> Should Couples Really Share Their Sexual Histories? </h1>
<h2> The value of romantic curiosity and self-disclosure. </h2>
<p>“I never talk about the past unless they ask... even then I say, ‘Are you sure you want my past to be your present?’" —Julia</p>
<p>“One who is too curious in observing the labor of bees, will often be stung for his curiosity.” —Alexander Pope</p>
<p>“Ignorance is bliss.” —Thomas Gray</p>
<p>Self-disclosure is important in romantic relationships, but should it include one’s sexual history? Does it promote the healthy endurance of romantic relationships? These issues are disputable.</p>
<a>happiness</a>: Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden because they ate from the Tree of Knowledge.
<p>Do you tell your new partner about your exes?</p>
<p>Here are some women's answers to the question of whether to tell their current partner about their exes.</p>
<p>“I can say that this pushes men to envy and comparison while making them restless. Hence, it is a very bad idea. Of course, everything depends on the specific man and his level of <a>self-esteem</a>.” —Lylah</p>
<p>“Do not say anything. Zero. The beginning of a relationship should be with a clean slate. My previous sexual experiences should not impact the current one.” —Eva</p>
<p>“After 20 years of <a>marriage</a>, I told my husband about my ex. He was extremely upset and our relationship has become hostile, on the verge of <a>divorce</a>.” —Marian </p>
<p>What should not be discussed?</p>
<p>“My ex would have a really bad habit of telling me all the men she'd slept with, penis sizes, intimate details like that and it would really piss me off.” —John</p>
<p>It is perhaps obvious that we should not tell our partners everything, especially not at the beginning of the relationship. <a>Tracey Cox</a> suggests eight things you should never tell your partner:</p>
<li>How good your ex was in bed</li>
<li>How sexually good you were with other lovers</li>
<li>Past behavior that doesn't reflect who you are now</li>
<li>Giving exact numbers of sexual partners</li>
<li>Favorably referencing the same ex more than once</li>
<li>Playful boasting designed to make one’s partner <a>jealous</a></li>
<li>Any reference to penis size</li>
<li>“I've never had a problem having an <a>orgasm</a> before.”</li>
<p>If people still want to provide information about their sexual past, it is preferable to give vague and open-ended information.</p>
<p>The importance of self-disclosure</p>
<p>“Most men do not like to hear details about the sexual adventures of their female partner with other men, especially when such details dwarf them.” —Lucy</p>
<p>“My second husband asked me whether my first husband’s c*ck was bigger than his. I did not want to lie and said, ‘Yes, very much so.’” —Rebecca</p>
<p>“It is more important to tell him how many men you’ve slept with after meeting him.” —Harold</p>
<p>There is no golden rule determining what and when to tell your current partner about past sexual partners—it depends on the nature and development of the bond. Generally, not revealing anything is problematic and sharing all details is worse.</p>
<p>Describing past experiences should not result in comparing or evaluating one’s present partner, but rather create positive learning that enhances the existing relationship. This is possible if done with great moderation and sensitivity.</p>
