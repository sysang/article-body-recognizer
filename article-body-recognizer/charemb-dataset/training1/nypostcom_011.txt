<p>Where’s Shrek when you need him?</p>
<p>A faux-Medieval castle — complete with trap doors, a dungeon and a secret underground grotto featuring a jacuzzi — could be yours for $2.3 million.</p>
<p>Entering the fortress requires visitors to traverse two gates, two watchtowers, a moat, a drawbridge and, last but not least, an actual portcullis.</p>
<p>The kingly residence was built not during the Middle Ages in Europe — but in 1990, in suburban Detroit.</p>
<p>A local businessman began construction on the castle for himself and his two children in the mid-1980s. Although he sold it in 2015, he lived in the castle through 2019.</p>
<p>Spanning almost 10,800 square feet, the castle features a total of 26 rooms with custom finishes and hidden surprises. </p>
<p>“Even the door hinges are very Victorian-style and there are details around the home that are undoubtedly castle-like and timeless,” he continued. “It was custom-designed to be a 15th-century-style English castle.”</p>
<p>Made up of five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, the castle is situated on more than six acres land.</p>
<p>Still, it will take a special someone with a truly unrelenting thirst for adventure to want this place. First listed in September, the property has yet to find a buyer. </p>
<p>“The frame is built with 60 tons of steel and construction took over 6 years utilizing artisans from all over the world. The castle is 60 feet tall, or taller than a 4 story building,” the listing states. </p>
<p>What’s more, the primary suite features a custom-made bed that was assembled in the room itself and therefore impossible to remove. </p>
<p>The full bar comes with 12-foot ceilings and unique details in the walls. </p>
<p>“They plastered over [a stone wall] and then put some straw in it in the same style they would have done 500 years ago, when they would essentially do mud walls with straw as a bonding agent,” Kuligowski explained. </p>
<p>The castle is the largest home in the upscale gated community. </p>
<p>“This is the biggest lot, but also the first lot that was developed, so it’s in the very back of a neighborhood,” he clarified. “There are homes with different architectural styles but mostly Colonials.”</p>
<p>In describing the ideal buyer, Kuligowski said: “Someone that grew up loving fairy-tales or stories would really fit this house.”</p>

<h1> Bronx tower owners hit with $3B class-action lawsuit over fire that killed 17 people</h1>

<div> January 11, 2022 4:07pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 7:56pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Another plaintiff, Jessika Valdez, 38, told The Post that her door to her 18th-floor apartment “never closed on its own” during the 15 years she’s lived there.</p>
<p>“We always had to pull it closed,” she said.</p>
<p>“If you’re renting to me, it’s OK if you don’t have an emotional tie to me, but you have to protect your investment. I’m your investment.”</p>
<p>The defendants named in the Bronx Supreme Court suit include the building’s joint-venture owner, Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, and its three member companies, Lich Investment Group, Belveron Partners, and Camber Property Group.</p>
<p>The other defendants are former building owners Cammeby’s International Group and the company’s founder, real-estate tycoon Rubin Schron of Brooklyn, who sold the property in 2019.</p>
<p>The class-action suit supplanted another court filing by Reyes and Martinez earlier in the day.</p>
<p>It seeks $1 billion each for everyone who joins the planned class-action case. </p>
<p>It also says that the city, de Blasio and La Rocca “have known of this condition for many, many years now and certainly since December 28, 2017,” when 13 people were killed in a fire at 2363 Prospect Ave. in The Bronx.</p>
<p>“At that time, [de Blasio] promised to ensure that the building department inspectors inspected all buildings for these issues,” Vilensky wrote.</p>
<p>“Yet it is obvious that said Department Building [sic] and politicians only give ‘lip service’ to safety issues and are responsible for the resulting injuries and deaths.”</p>
<p>The notice includes a copy of a Monday report by The Post about how the building <a>racked up more than two dozen violations and complaints</a> since 2014, one year after Schron got nearly $25 million in state loans for repairs and upgrades.</p>
<p>“When I heard about what happened on Sunday, my blood boiled because this was a preventable accident and a preventable fire. By that, I mean the fire spreading,” Vilensky told The Post.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC said, “We are devastated by this terrible tragedy and are cooperating fully with the Fire Department and other agencies as they continue to investigate.”</p>
<p>The city’s Law Department also issued a statement that said, “This was a horrific tragedy and too many lives were lost. There is an active investigation into this tragic incident. We’ll review the claim.”</p>
<p>Cammeby’s and Schron didn’t immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<h1> Manhattan rents hit highest-ever December record as supply plummets</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 13, 2022 3:24pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 3:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The average cost of Manhattan apartment rentals surged to the highest ever for a December, with landlords demanding double-digit rent increases amid sharply dwindling supply.</p>
<p>Median rents for doorman buildings – a proxy for luxury apartments, was $4,298, an annual increase of nearly 23%. By comparison, non-doorman buildings saw rents increase about 8% to $2,695.</p>
<p>Studio apartment units saw the biggest jump, with the median rental price jumping 22% to $2,550 for December.</p>
<p>Apartments located in downtown Manhattan were most expensive, with a median price that rose 28% to $4,095 for the month.</p>
<p>The numbers marked a stark contrast compared to December 2020, when surging COVID-19 caseloads stoked concern of a mass exodus from New York City. The vacancy rate dropped to just 1.7%, down from nearly 11% one year earlier.</p>
<p>“What started as a trickle earlier last year has become like a geyser of demand,” Douglas Elliman rental broker Janna Raskopf told CNBC. “I’ve been doing this for 14 years and it’s absolutely unprecedented.”</p>
<p>Listing inventory plunged 81% year-over-year in December, with less than 4,800 apartments listed as available for rent.</p>
<p>The lack of available inventory appeared to impact the number of new leases, which fell nearly 40% to just 3,345 for the month. A surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant also likely affected the numbers.</p>
<a>told Bloomberg</a>. “Omicron is in the mix for sure, just slowing down activity too.”

<h1> Kanye West reportedly buys $57.3M Malibu escape amid divorce</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> September 20, 2021 2:12pm <div> Updated <div> September 20, 2021 4:24pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Ye said yes — but social media is saying no.</p>
<p>Billionaire rapper Kanye West appears to have dropped $57.25 million on a box-like Malibu house as he navigates his divorce from Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>And although the 3,665-square-foot, concrete-heavy house is designed by award-winning starchitect Tadao Ando, it wasn’t impressing the social media masses when Dirt.com broke the news Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Kanye living in a parking garage,” one wrote on <a>Zillow Gone Wild’s Instagram page</a> Monday morning.</p>
<p>“He loves the abandoned clinic look,” wrote another commenter, while a third added, “Looks like a high-end bunker for a cult leader.” </p>
<p>The Post was not able to independently confirm reports that the rapper is the buyer, and representatives for West did not return our requests for comment. </p>
<p>However, Shore Drive Holdings — which is registered to the same address as Kanye’s <a>clothing line Yeezy</a> — is the recorded buyer. Other companies are also registered to the same suite in the Regus co-working building. </p>
<p>The property was rumored to be worth $75 million originally, and despite the discount it’s still a record-breaking sale. During the pandemic, the most expensive recorded sale on that stretch was $11.7 million, which took place this July. </p>
<p>The three-story house on Puerco Beach was built on a 0.13-acre beachfront in 2013. It has a large, glass pivot door facing the beach, a garage, four bedrooms and five bathrooms, city records show. </p>
<p>The home was previously owned by <a>Ashley Olsen’s onetime boyfriend Richard Sachs</a>. Before him, the property was owned by <a>voice actor Edie Boddicker</a> and her husband, <a>composer Michael Boddicker</a>, records show.</p>
<a>whose net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion</a>, also owns
<a>his childhood Chicago home</a>. Pre-breakup,
<a> he and Kardashian owned a compound in LA in the Hidden Hills neighborhood</a>. She
<a>will reportedly get it in the divorce</a>.
<p>West and Kardashian have four children — North, 8, Saint, 5, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 2. They <a>filed for divorce</a> in February after his presidential bid and cheating rumors. </p>
<a>legally change his name to Ye.</a> He also briefly
<a>co-parenting with Kardash</a>
<a>recording his latest album, “Donda</a>,” during which time he
<a>stayed in a bedroom inside Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a>.
<p>Late last month, West and Kardashian were rumored to be “<a>working on rebuilding</a>” their relationship, Page Six reported. </p>
<p>The Malibu transaction was off-market, so no real estate brokers were listed. </p>
<p>The architecture firm of Tadao Ando could not be reached for comment. The co-developer, WHY, and subcontractor, Morley Builders, did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment. </p>

<h1> Kim Kardashian pays Kanye West $23M to keep Hidden Hills home amid divorce</h1>
<div> October 19, 2021 2:40pm <div> Updated <div> October 19, 2021 2:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This father stretched out his hand for an epic payday. </p>
<p>Kim Kardashian paid Kanye West a whopping $23 million for the Hidden Hills, California, home she purchased with her estranged husband in 2014, and is now officially the sole owner.</p>
<p>Los Angeles records confirm that Kardashian, 40, paid $20 million for the property, and $3 million for the furniture, art and other contents.</p>
<p>The former couple had purchased the property for $20 million at the time, before gutting and rebuilding it from the ground up, which took over six years.</p>
<p>West, 44, spearheaded the entire design of the home which focused on minimalism and purity.</p>
<p>The official court ruling comes after the rapper put his first of two Wyoming ranches up for sale Oct. 11.</p>
<p>The Skims founder confirmed that West’s move to the <a>nearly-4,000 acre </a>ranch, including <a>the second ranch</a> he purchased in Greybull, contributed to their split.</p>
<p>Kardashian <a>filed for divorce in February</a> after nearly seven years of marriage.</p>
<p>“Kim got Kanye to go up there [Wyoming] so they could live separate lives and quietly get things sorted out to separate and divorce. She’s done,” a source told Page Six. </p>
<p>The two share joint legal and physical custody of their four children: daughters North, 8, and Chicago, 3, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, 2.</p>
<h1> Kanye West to tear down $4.5M home across street from Kim Kardashian</h1>

<div> December 29, 2021 6:07pm <div> Updated <div> December 29, 2021 9:21pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Somehow, we just couldn’t picture Ye living in this modest abode. </p>
<p>After shelling out more than $4.5 million for a drab house across the street from Kim Kardashian, Kanye West has plans to drop even more money to tear it down and build a brand new home precisely to his liking, according to a report from People. </p>
<p>“Kanye’s new house is a teardown. He only bought it for the location,” a source told the outlet. “It’s near Kim and the kids. He has a vision for the house and plans on starting construction ASAP.” </p>
<p>The move comes after West, 44, shelled out a whopping $57.3 million for a luxury <a>modern home in Malibu.</a> And while it’s only a 30 minute drive, it was still too far for Kanye. </p>
<p>A separate source told The Post, the “Donda” rapper needed better and quicker access to his kids. </p>
<p>“It’s just simple logistics so that he is close to his children and has access to them at the drop of a hat,” the insider said.</p>
<p>Made up of five bedrooms and four bathrooms, this is the first time the house has gone up for sale in 67 years, since the former owners purchased property when it was newly built at the time, in 1955. </p>
<p>West paid an additional $421,000 over the seller’s asking price in order to bag the property. </p>
<p>The current house spans more than 3,600 square feet. But there is no telling how much bigger West could build the new house, which is situated on more than an acre of land that also held an equestrian ranch. </p>
<p>Interior features of the current home are a bit outdated, with shaggy beige carpets, vintage wood paneling and wooden cabinets. </p>
<p>The front lawn was recently replaced with a drought-resistant AstroTurf. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, West is listing one of two of his <a>Wyoming ranches for $11 million, </a>which remains on the market today. </p>
<p>Melissa and Jason Improta of Compass held the listing; Tomer Fridman of Compass repped the buyer.</p>

<h1> Inside Kanye West’s new $4.5M home right across from Kim Kardashian</h1>
<div> December 27, 2021 12:30pm <div> Updated <div> December 27, 2021 3:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Two months after Kim Kardashian officially transferred the marital home fully under her name, Kanye West bought a single-story house directly across the street, The Post can confirm.</p>
<p>And apparently, he wanted the modest five-bedroom, four-bathroom house so desperately that he paid $4.5 million — $421,000 over the seller’s asking price.</p>
<p>It also happens to be good timing for the rapper, as the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house in Hidden Hills hit the market for the first time in 67 years on Dec. 1 for $4.079 million, according to the listing.</p>
<p>West, 44, closed on the home on Dec. 20 under the LLC, Spruce Blue Trust, records show.</p>
<p>And although the “Donda” singer has expressed his interest to “get his family back together,” a source told The Post, this house transaction was more for the former couple’s kids.</p>
<p>But it looks like the home will be in need of some upgrades, as it appears to be a far cry from what the Kardashian-West clan are used to.</p>
<p>The unassuming home spans over 3,600 square feet and is situated on over an acre of land with an equestrian ranch on the property.</p>
<p>The property has shaggy beige carpets with vintage wood paneling and cabinets throughout the home.</p>
<p>The same owners lived in the home ever since the property, which has been well maintained, was built in 1955.</p>
<p>The front lawn was recently replaced with a drought-resistant AstroTurf and the existing kitchen was remodeled in 2005 and includes an island.</p>
<p>The move also comes after West <a>listed one of two of his beloved Wyoming ranches</a> for $11 million. The ranch remains on sale.</p>
<p>In September, West also <a>bought a luxurious modern Malibu estate</a> for a colossal $57.3 million.</p>
<p><a>Melissa and Jason Improta </a>of Compass held the listing; <a>Tomer Fridman</a> of Compass repped the buyer.</p>
<p><a>The Dirt</a> was the first to report on the transaction.</p>

<h1> Donald Trump’s tattle-tale niece Mary buys decadent $7M NYC condo</h1>

<p>Mary, Mary, quite condo-trary.</p>
<p>Mary Trump, the niece of former President Donald Trump who published a tell-all book on the Trump family in 2020, is finally getting into the luxury real estate game herself. </p>
<p>She‘s purchased a downtown New York City home, as reported in Friday’s Wall Street Journal — one that, unsurprisingly, isn’t located inside a Trump building.</p>
<a>on copies during its first week on sale, shell</a>ed out $7 million for a luxe spread at the glassy Renzo Piano-designed 565 Broome in Soho.
<p>That building, at 565 Broome St., stands just two blocks shy of The Dominick hotel on Spring Street, a property formerly known as the Trump Soho, which Turmp sold in late 2017.</p>
<p>The Journal notes the roughly 2,250-square-foot unit asked $7.8 million, and that Trump bought it from the developer. Marc Palermo, of Douglas Elliman, marketed the spread.</p>
<p>Shared amenities include a 55-foot heated lap pool, an interior landscaped lounge and automated parking for purchase.</p>
<p>“The only fraud committed there was Mary Trump recording one of her relatives and she’s really discredited herself,” then-White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a 2020 briefing.</p>

<div> January 14, 2022 4:14pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 7:54pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>After power couple Kelly Dodd and Rick Leventhal were axed from their network TV jobs last June, the real work began.</p>
<p>Dodd, a former “Real Housewives of Orange County” star, was let go from her gig on the reality show the same week Leventhal left his 24-year career at Fox News.</p>
<p>But the free time gave them space to pursue an unexpected venture: In November, a year after they got married, the couple bought a modest house and plan on flipping it into a boutique hotel.</p>
<p>Dodd and Leventhal dropped $715,000 on a three-bedroom, three-bathroom Palm Desert fixer-upper, records show.</p>
<p>“I like something that is really ugly in the beginning and then you can make it beautiful,” Dodd, 46, told The Post.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the project could lead them back to reality TV. Several producers have already approached the couple about being the stars of a home-improvement show, The Post can report.</p>
<p>“We already have producers reaching out to us wanting to do home-renovation types of shows,” Dodd revealed. “But we are exploring our options and seeing what the best deal is for us.” </p>
<p>Leventhal, 61, told The Post the transaction was done in an all-cash deal this past November. </p>
<p>They made the purchase after plans of another project fell through.</p>
<p>“We bought a nearly 2.5-acre lot last spring at the Polo Estates in La Quinta and hired an architect to draw up plans for a nearly 7,000-square-foot home we planned to use and rent out,” Leventhal explained. </p>
<p>“Our goal is to build a portfolio of homes,” Leventhal added. “I’ve always wanted to get into the house-flipping business, and I used to work in construction when I was 19 years old.” </p>
<p>The Palm Desert home is situated close to the upscale El Paseo Shopping District, and boasts panoramic views of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains. It is also a 45-minute drive from the celeb-favorite Joshua Tree National Park area.</p>
<p>Initially built in 1950, the mid-century home will need a lot of updates to get it up and running. But Dodd and Leventhal tell The Post they’re up for the challenge after a tumultuous year. </p>
<p>“I really love holding on to properties,” Dodd said. “A lot of my friends have houses in the desert and they’re making like $400,000 to $500,000 a year just on rentals.” </p>
<p>“There is a lot of upside in being in the desert. So this going to be our next full-time project, gut-renovating houses. It’s really a passion of Rick and I.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they are also renting out his Westhampton home that currently runs at $4,200 per month.</p>
<p>“We make really good money on the Hamptons house,” Dodd told The Post. “We are renting that out year-round, summers and winters.” </p>
<p>Dodd explained how their next move after the Palm Desert project was to rebuild the Hamptons home. </p>
<p>And when they’re not fixing houses, they are recording their podcasts and filming their growing YouTube show, <a>“Rich Kelly UNMASKED.” </a></p>
<p>“The best part about it for me is that I get to work with Kelly, and she is so much fun and entertaining and just unpredictable,” he added. “It makes it just an absolute pleasure. A fast change from what I am used to.”</p>
<p>Dodd divulged that overcoming hardship in the past year taught her a very valuable lesson. </p>
<p>“When one door closes, another opens,” she said. “So I just want people to know that you don’t have to stop, you can continue to pursue your dreams.” </p>

<p>Considering how we can easily swipe through hundreds of dating app profiles in a single evening, it goes without saying that there’s a LOT of pressure on people to stand out from the crowd with a strong opening line.</p>
<p>But while resorting to cliches probably isn’t going to increase your chances of bagging a date, you know what’s worse? BODY-SHAMING a person you’ve literally never met.</p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking: surely no one would ever think that approach would be successful?</p>
<p>Well unfortunately for TikTok user Em, this is the exact scenario she found herself in when she matched with a guy last April.</p>
<p>In a viral video that’s racked up over 3.7 million views, Em shared the downright grim (not to mention bizarre) conversation starter the bloke resorted to.</p>
<p>He wrote: “Hey baby. Put down that cupcake and sprint to my house.”</p>
<p>Understandably, Em was initially perplexed and asked what he meant.</p>
<p>He continued: “You look like you hide cupcakes in your bedside table.”</p>
<p>Quizzing him further, she added: “The f*** is that supposed to mean lmao.”</p>
<p>“It means you’re slightly obese,” he savaged replied.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the conversation stopped there and Em said they were among the grossest messages she ever received on the app.</p>
<p>That said, she DID get the last laugh after her video amassed over 600k “likes”.</p>
<p>She captioned the clip: “Thanks Mikey.”</p>
<p>“THE WAY MY JAW JUST KEPT DROPPING,” one stunned viewer replied. “ARE STRAIGHT MEN DOING OK?!?”</p>
<p>Another joked: “Mikey has never felt a woman’s touch in his life…”</p>
<p>“The only thing men have is the audacity,” a third replied.</p>

<h1> ‘Birds Aren’t Real’ founder throws up in live, viral TV interview</h1>
<div> January 7, 2022 1:19pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 3:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>His puke was as fake as his conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The founder of Birds Aren’t Real — a parody movement that suggests birds are actually government-planted drones spying on us all — horrifyingly threw up during a live interview on a Chicago news show on Thursday. </p>
<p>However, just like the conspiracy theory he dreamed up, it was all just a stunt to punk the press.</p>
<p>Peter McIndoe, 23, was chatting about his absurd creation with WGN-TV in Chicago when, less than a minute into the interview, he puked after taking a big swig of a creamy mystery beverage.</p>
<p>“I’m nervous — I’m sorry,” he said mid-meltdown before the livestream cut away.</p>
<p>But it was later revealed to be a stunt, and he was just regurgitating the milk in his mug to troll the news station.</p>
<p>Prior to his now-viral — albeit fake — vomit, Memphis-based McIndoe explained the group’s motives, saying that Gen Z “aiming for change” is what the Birds Aren’t Real movement is “all about.”</p>
<a>their own sub-Reddit</a>, which has amassed 420,000 members since its creation in 2017.
<p>After the incident, McIndoe <a>tweeted the clip</a> from the Birds Aren’t Real official Twitter account, apologizing to the group and calling it the “most embarrassing moment” of his life.</p>
<p>But don’t be fooled: He was simply married to the bit, driving the satire home.</p>
<p>The interview came after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission tweeted “Birds are real” on Jan. 5, along with a slew of humorous bird memes to promote reporting unsafe products to the department.</p>
<p>The tweet prompted another deadpan response from McIndoe.</p>
<a>he posted in response</a>. “Do not listen to the propagandists. Do not let them into your brain. All this tweet does is show the world that we are winning.”
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first time McIndoe has gained media attention for his satirical hilarity.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a>he appeared on a Tennessee news channel</a> to promote a billboard the group commissioned in the area. He claimed the government committed a “genocide” of birds and replaced them with spying drones.</p>
<p>“We do not find this to be a humorous issue,” he said at the time, despite the account’s satirical nature.</p>
<p>In a December interview with the <a>New York Times</a>, McIndoe dropped the act for a moment and said the movement was created to fight lunacy with lunacy.</p>
<h1> Heidi Fleiss vows to fly out of her Nevada coop after parrot shot: Report</h1>

<div> January 9, 2022 12:07am <div> Updated <div> January 9, 2022 12:07am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Infamous Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has vowed to leave her Nevada home after someone shot one of her parrots, according to a report.</p>
<p>Fleiss, known for the prostitution ring she once ran in Los Angeles, claims someone injured one of her macaws with a shot from a pellet gun right before Christmas, and she is now offering $5,000 for information helping arrest the culprit.</p>
<p>The former madam, who counted Charlie Sheen as a client and once served 20 months in federal prison for tax evasion, has lived in Pahrump, about an hour west of Las Vegas, for 15 years. </p>
<p>The bird, named Chuey, is five years old, Fleiss told the Pahrump Valley Times, adding she kept the pellet a vet removed from her bird’s leg as evidence.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows they’re my birds and they really enjoy them,” Fleiss told the outlet. “When [the bird] came home in the late afternoon, she fell and that’s when I noticed there was something wrong with her leg.”</p>
<p>She vowed revenge on the fowl fiend who injured her pet.</p>
<p>So now she’s flocking to Missouri, where Fleiss, 56, bought a 50-acre forest for herself and her feathered friends. </p>
<h1> Rare owl spotted several times in Washington, DC since early January</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 2:39pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 2:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Now that’s something you don’t see every day.</p>
<p>A rare owl has been spotted several times over the past week in Washington, D.C. The bird has been spotted perched at some of the city’s popular monuments.</p>
<p>At one point, the owl was spotted atop a bronze eagle at the top of a flag pole, which resulted in some very patriotic photos.</p>
<p>The snowy owl is native to areas much further north. It can usually be spotted in Canada or the Arctic tundra. The birds are known to migrate south during the winter, however, they typically stay close to the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time one of these birds has been spotted this far south, however. Snowy owl sightings have been reported in North Carolina and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Since the birds normally live near the arctic, for example, they aren’t used to avoiding cars or other vehicles piloted by humans.</p>

<h1> Mysterious mummy found in tomb in Peru with hands covering its face</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> November 30, 2021 12:32pm <div> Updated <div> November 30, 2021 12:32pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A mummy, fully bound in ropes and with its hands covering its face, has been discovered in an underground tomb in Peru.</p>
<p>Archaeologists from the National University of San Marcos found the mummy in good condition in Cajamarquilla, a significant site 15.5 miles inland from the coastal city and capital Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>The mummy is estimated to be between 800 and 1200 years old.</p>
<p>Although the mummy’s striking pose – bound by ropes and in the foetal position – appears chilling at first sight, researchers believe it is a southern Peruvian funeral custom.</p>
<p>The tomb also contained ceramics, vegetable remains and stone tools.</p>
<p>Several marine molluscs were also discovered outside the tomb.</p>
<p>“After the body is placed in the tomb, there are constant events and activities,” Mr. Van Dalen Luna said.</p>
<p>“That is to say, their descendants keep coming back over many years and placing food and offerings there, including molluscs.”</p>
<p>The mummy, thought to be a male, likely predated the Inca civilization, which dominated the southern part of South America 500 years ago.</p>
<p>“The discovery of this resident sheds a new light on interactions and relationships in pre-Hispanic times,” one of the archaeologists who led the excavation, Pieter Van Dalen Luna said.</p>
<p>It’s thought the man was aged about 25 to 30 years old and was likely an important person in contemporary society.</p>
<p>The findings indicate the area was likely multiethnic and would have been occupied by settlers from the coast and the mountains, according to information released by the university.</p>
<p>Archaeologist Yomira Huamán Santillán told CNN the discovery came as a surprise as the team was not searching for a mummy.</p>
<p>“The whole team was really happy because we didn’t think this was going to happen,” Huamán told CNN.</p>
<p>“We didn’t expect to make such an important discovery.”</p>

<h1> People literally work themselves to death in world’s most remote city</h1>
<div> December 22, 2021 12:43pm <div> Updated <div> December 22, 2021 12:43pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A mining settlement 16,000ft up a mountain is the world’s most remote city where locals work themselves to death.</p>
<p>La Rinconada in the Peruvian Andes is home to around 50,000 people whose life expectancy is reportedly just 30 to 35-years-old.</p>
<p>Living in freezing conditions surrounded by garbage and filth, the drinking sources are contaminated by poisonous mercury used to clean the gold found in the mines.</p>
<p>Dubbed the ‘Devil’s Paradise’, residents reportedly suffer from lung diseases and respiratory infections which impact the nervous system causing memory loss, deformities, paralysis and eventually death.</p>
<p>Now, the settlers and others in La Rinconada say the gold supply is running out in the area.</p>
<p>“It’s not like it used to be. That’s why so many ugly things happen,” one said.</p>
<p>Miners have been shot dead in the tunnels, young women are trafficked into brothels and physical fights are common.</p>
<p>When police or other authorities come to town to try to enforce the law or restrict mining, they have been threatened by miners with the dynamite used to blast open the tunnels.</p>
<p>The women join the protests too – some say the men force them to.</p>
<p>Now there is less gold in the mountain, the men drink a lot more, said Eva Chura, one of the women who extracts the gold from the rubble.</p>
<p>She adds: “They spend more time in the bars than working.”</p>
<p>To extract gold from the rocks the men and women use mercury, a toxin which they rinse with melted ice from the glacier.</p>
<p>The water flows down the mountain into pools, puddles and rivers.</p>
<p>“These same waters carry heavy metals directly to Lake Titicaca.”</p>
<p>Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, a vital source of drinking water and fish for the surrounding population.</p>
<p>Waste from gold-processing adds to pollution by run-off from surrounding cities and untreated sewage. In 2012 a German non-profit, the Global Nature Fund, named it the world’s most threatened lake of the year.</p>
<p>The fragments of gold these people produce have, at least in the past, made their way into supply chains of firms including phone makers and jewellers.</p>
<p>In 2018 a Swiss refinery that had been taking the metal for years stopped after Peruvian prosecutors alleged the company that collected it was a front for organized crime.</p>
<p>Eva came 12 years ago from her hometown of Chupa in the Puno region to La Rinconada.</p>
<p>Five of her eight children live with her in her corrugated zinc home.</p>
<p>The eldest is 13-year-old Natalie. Eva is still breastfeeding the youngest, a boy called Alizon, and takes the baby with her when she goes scavenging.</p>
<p>It takes Eva an hour to reach the site where the women work. When they get there, they always sit down and chew coca leaves, light two cigarettes “for the saints” and drink a little anise for luck.</p>
<h2>Surrounded by garbage </h2>
<p>“Sometimes there’s gold, other times no. At the moment it’s very low,” she said.</p>
<p>The men of La Rinconada bar all women from the mines dug beneath the rock.</p>
<p>They say the female spirit of the mine, which is located below a glacier called La Bella Durmiente, or ‘The Sleeping Beauty’, would be jealous and angry if women were to try to steal her riches.</p>
<p>So instead, the female workers take turns to scramble up onto piles of black scree that the men have dumped.</p>
<p>Teetering high above the ground, they stoop and flip over the rocks, their keen eyes scanning the lumps for a glimmer of gold.</p>
<p>Anything promising they pocket and take back to process and sell to black-market dealers whose stalls line La Rinconada’s main street.</p>
<p>“In a week sometimes I can get one gram or two grams of gold,” Eva said.</p>
<h2>Polluted and dangerous </h2>
<p>Black market prices vary but on the London market that would fetch $50 or $100. “If I’m lucky it can sometimes be 20 grams, but that’s down to luck.”</p>
<p>The quantities each woman collects are tiny, but thousands of them are looking – some estimates say there are more than 15,000 “gold pickers” in Peru.</p>
<p>No-one collects garbage in La Rinconada. Women and men alike risk their lives and subsist in squalor in the mountain’s thin frigid air.</p>
<p>Life is hard, Eva says, but she is better off gold-picking.</p>
<p>“It is very sad to live with garbage and dirt, washing in the cold, with water from the mountain. But you tell yourself to get over it. The children give you strength and courage to work.”</p>

<p>Amazon scam emails that could cost you thousands have skyrocketed by 500 percent since last year — so how can you look out for them?</p>
<p>The online retailing giant’s popularity has made it a prime target for fraudsters and internet cons trying to take advantage of unsuspecting customers.</p>
<p>As Amazon’s security improves, so does the sophistication of the scammers — but there are some red flags that can help you spot them.</p>
<p>The latest scheme involves an official-looking email from “Amazon” being sent out to customers of fake receipts or shipping confirmations for an order that you never placed.</p>
<p>Users may then click on the link to find out more about their supposed order — making you believe you have to update your account details.</p>
<p>A similar trick notifies users there is a “problem” with your Amazon account or payment method — again tricking victims into resubmitting their personal information to try to fix the issue.</p>
<p>But innocently calling the “helpline” or clicking on the link is actually part of the plan to fool you into handing over your personal details.</p>
<p>So, if you’re doubting the suspicious-looking email you just received, these three simple checks can help you determine its authenticity.</p>
<p>Looking out for suspicious language or grammatical and spelling errors is an easy way to see if the message is legit, as a genuine Amazon inquiry would not have any.</p>
<p>If the email asks you to “click here” to verify your details or payment method, don’t.</p>
<p>Amazon will never ask users to take these actions via email and this will likely be a scam.</p>
<p>And finally, checking the sender’s full email address to ensure it is from a verified Amazon account is a foolproof way to confirm or deny your doubts.</p>
<p>In the US, any email address that does not end with “@amazon.com” is fake.</p>
<p>It is always best to access your Amazon account yourself to make checks from there, rather than clicking on phony links.</p>
<p>According to a warning by the Federal Trade Commission, reports of Amazon scams have increased by 500 percent since June 2020.</p>
<p>And if you’re still not sure, why not get in touch with Amazon directly by email or phone to confirm whether they have tried to contact you.</p>
<p>Alex Hamerstone, director with the security consulting firm TrustedSec, told Reader’s Digest: “An Amazon email scam can look exactly like a real Amazon email, or can be poorly crafted, and everything in between.</p>
<p>“But the core scams are usually pretty similar, as are the risks, the ways to prevent them, and the recommended response.</p>
<p>“The goal of those is to get you to think you need to update your account information, and usually give the scammer your credit card or bank information.”</p>
<p>Being hoodwinked by the ploy could see you lose thousands in cash — or even more — as email scams can often target multiple accounts at once.</p>
<p>Clicking on the link could install a virus or other harmful software on your computer and therefore breach further security barriers on your device.</p>
<p>“These scams are all targeting your money,” says Chris Pierson, CEO of cybersecurity company BlackCloak.</p>
<p>“The cybercriminals want either access to your account and the ability to purchase items or access to your credit card — both of which can cause you financial harm.”</p>
<p>If you do fall victim to Amazon scammers, log into your account, change the password and turn on dual-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Selecting the option to sign out of your account on all devices will hopefully leave the trickster unable to access your data.</p>

<h1> Your earbuds are gross — here’s how to clean them the right way</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 2:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 2:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>It’s a bit stomach-turning when you think about the germs, viruses, grime, and other crud covering our devices. </p>
<p>Dust can do a surprising amount of damage to your TV. Particles find their way into every crack and crevice and stay there unless you do something about it.</p>
<p>Your TV is probably clear of nasty germs, but your phone is another story. Think about everything you touch in a day and all the times you grab your phone.</p>
<p>And then there are your earbuds. Unless you clean them regularly, crud builds up in a way that would be embarrassing if anyone else saw it. Here’s how to get rid of it. </p>
<h2>Wiping away the crud </h2>
<p>Compared to other gadgets, earbuds rack up an extraordinary amount of nastiness. They collect dirt and skin particles, earwax, grease, and sweat. They’re like portable Petri dishes for our biological debris. Yuck. </p>
<p>Luckily, it’s not hard to wipe it all away. First, grab a microfiber cloth. I like this 6-pack from <a><u>EliteTechGear</u></a>, which you can get for less than $10. </p>
<p>Lightly dampen it and wipe down the cord and body of each earbud. You can use these steps for your earbuds’ charging case, too, but avoid anything wet on the speaker area of your headphones. </p>
<p>If you prefer cleaning wipes as I do, grab a big affordable pack, so you never run out. I always order <a><u>Care Touch’s box of 210 wipes</u></a>. Again, avoid the speaker. </p>
<p>Pro tip: If you have white corded headphones covered in dirt and scuffs, use a pencil eraser to buff the dark streaks away. </p>
<a><u>Blu Tack</u></a>, the reusable adhesive putty used to hang up posters, as a safer option. Sculpt it into a ball and press it into your earbud speakers. When you pull it away, it should have picked up all the junk inside your buds.
<h2>Here’s what you need to avoid </h2>
<p>Whatever you do, don’t run water over your earbuds. Sure, you can use a slightly damp cloth or cleansing wipe — but make sure you soak up that moisture with a dry, soft, and lint-free cloth when you’re done. </p>
<p>Avoid metal or wire brushes. You’ll also want to skip chemical detergents. Plain water should be more than enough for the cord and body of your headphones or earbuds. </p>
<p>Of course, make sure to be super careful when you wipe — no rough tugging or harsh pulling over the mesh speakers. Avoid any cleaners here. </p>
<p>And once you’re done, be sure to dry your earbuds with a clean, soft cloth. Don’t charge them until you’re 100% sure they are moisture-free. </p>
<h1> Hemp-based merchants say Facebook’s ‘unfair’ ad bans hurt small businesses</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>“Every ad was rejected,” griped Goose, whose company is called Let There Be Hemp. “We’re very confused as to why they would reject them given that hemp was legal.” </p>
<p>Goose says the baffling ban has hurt his ability to find customers and grow his business.</p>
<p>“Our biggest issue right now is our ability to get our name out there,” Goose said.</p>
<p>Goose’s predicament underscores just how crucial Facebook ads are for American small businesses. A whopping 66 percent of small businesses in the US use Facebook for advertising, while 41 percent use Instagram, according to one 2021 survey.</p>
<p>“Facebook ads are important for a business like this because we don’t have major budgets,” Goose said. “Facebook allows you to really target efficiently, geographically and based off of likes and interests.” </p>
<p>But the Facebook-forced rebranding as “plant-based” rather than “hemp-based” makes it difficult to stand out against their competitors, according to husband-and-wife founders Kirsten and Karl Sutaria. </p>
<p>And similarly to Goose’s predicament, the Sutarias’ attempts to appeal to Facebook have not helped.</p>
<p>“I’ve spoken to people there and it’s just not a priority,” Kirsten Sutaria said. </p>
<p>Despite their frustration with Facebook, the duo says that redesigning their packaging was the right choice because the site is such a valuable marketing tool. </p>
<p>“It’s just the two of us, so to reach a few thousand people for $50 is huge,” Kirsten Sutaria said. </p>
<p>While the Sutarias and Goose don’t use CBD in their products, other small businesses that use the weed-related product have also griped about Meta’s ad policies. </p>
<p>In 2019, a CBD entrepreneur <a>sued</a> Facebook in New York federal court over its advertising ban, claiming that the company “wrongfully censored” ads for an online conference about the substance. The suit was later dismissed. </p>

<h1> Digital detox: Thirteen simple hacks to break up with your phone</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 5:57pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 5:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Never mind Veganuary and Dry January . . . it’s time for a digital detox.</p>
<p>We are more addicted to our phones than ever, new figures show, spending an average of four hours a day staring at their screens.</p>
<p>That is up a third since 2019.</p>
<p>As well as “tech neck” and repetitive strain injury, research suggests digital overload can increase anxiety, damage eyesight and make us more susceptible to cyber-crime.</p>
<p>But there are ways to reduce your dependency.</p>
<p>Kate Jackson shares some simple advice to help you hang up on your handset for a while . . .</p>
<h2>Make it less attractive</h2>
<p>By switching the display mode to “greyscale”, you effectively switch from color to an old-fashioned black-and-white one.</p>
<p>The drab icons will be less enticing and notifications that are usually red will lose their urgency.</p>
<p>On iPhones, go to “Accessibility Settings/Display” and “Text Size/Colour Filters”.</p>
<p>A study at the University of North Dakota in the US found students spent 40 minutes less on their phones after making the change.</p>
<p>Try moving social media apps off the homescreen to another page.</p>
<p>Psychotherapist Hilda Burke, author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says: “When something is very accessible to us we can find ourselves clicking on something without even thinking about it.”</p>
<p>How often would you use Facebook or Instagram if you had to key in your details very time?</p>
<p>Deleting social media details from your history will make them less appealing.</p>
<p>The decluttering guru urges us to keep only those items that bring us joy and toss the rest. Do the same on your phone with the apps that make you happy.</p>
<h2>Kick it out of bed…</h2>
<p>Ban phones from the bedroom. Use an old-fashioned alarm clock.</p>
<h2>…or out of reach</h2>
<p>Bill Stirling is founder of Tech-Break, a tool to keep gadgets locked away for a set amount of time.</p>
<h2>Have a trial separation</h2>
<p>Like a bad relationship, some time apart can help you reassess.</p>
<p>Catherine Price, author of How To Break Up With Your Phone, recommends a trial separation of 24 hours. You will realise how many times you normally reach for your phone — and remember how you can enjoy yourself without it.</p>
<h2>Set mental ‘speed bump’</h2>
