<div><div><p>The petitions are expected to be consolidated before a single appeals court as soon as next week, when a special judicial panel will randomly designate one appeals court to handle them together.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department has asked the 5th Circuit to hold off on any further action before the lottery takes place.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Biden administration estimates the rules will save more than 6,500 lives and prevent more than 250,000 hospitalizations over a six-month period.
<div><div><p>David Vladeck, an occupational law expert at Georgetown Law School, said OSHA was well within its power to issue the rules. But how the agency will fare in court is another question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has a strong case, Vladeck said, because the point of the specific act it invoked is “to ensure that workers are safe in the workplace.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s going to be controversial because it’s covid,” he said. <b/>“Not because OSHA has somehow overextended its jurisdiction.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Large survey explores factions between Democratic and Republican parties</p></div>
<b/>emergency rules related to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides. But Vladeck said that
<b/>the vaccinate-or-test standard was on more solid legal ground, based on the unique circumstances of the pandemic that so far has killed more than 750,000 people in the United States.
<div><div><p>In the other emergency cases, “there was no proof of the kind that exists here,” he said. “There is a public health emergency that needs an immediate response.”</p></div></div>
<p>David Michaels, who headed OSHA under President Barack Obama, said opponents of the requirements are portraying them inaccurately, ignoring the option for those who don’t want to get vaccinated to wear masks and get tested regularly.</p>
<div><div><p>Brandon Trosclair, the former political candidate in Louisiana whose businesses also sued the federal government, is quoted on the site as saying the mandate forces workers to get a vaccine or be fired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re trying to pretend that this is a vaccination mandate, to make people angry,” Michaels said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Liberty Justice Center, which represents Trosclair, said: “The federal government is telling businesses to impose vaccines or testing on their employees. That is a mandate.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Death threats, online abuse, police protection: New reality for school board members</p></div>
<a>the Supreme Court has three times refused to stop vaccination requirements:</a> in Indiana, New York and Maine. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, rejected a request from Indiana University students. Justice Sonia Sotomayor,
<div><p>But the legal questions about the administration’s new rules will center on different questions than those cases. They will involve the scope of OSHA’s regulatory power and whether the rules are consistent with its authority.</p></div>
<p>In some ways, Biden’s policy is more lenient than those imposed by some private companies and states. Many state regulations that apply to health-care workers, for instance, do not give unvaccinated employees the option of frequent testing.</p>
<div><div><p>“Not all of these claims are the same and not all of these mandates are the same,” said Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern University law professor who specializes in public health law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She noted that for decades, states have required certain vaccines for children to attend school and pointed to the <a>1905 Supreme Court decision</a> upholding state authority to enforce vaccination laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, Parmet said, the current Supreme Court majority is “far more skeptical of regulatory power, public health protection and especially when it implicates religious liberty claims.”</p></div></div>

<b>Krystalline, Roswell, N.M.</b>
<a>vaccinated</a> but can’t — such as
<a>people who are allergic</a> to vaccine components or had severe allergic reactions after getting a first shot.
<div><p>What to do if your flight is delayed or canceled</p></div>
<div><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether your upcoming trip is absolutely necessary, says <a>LetsGetChecked</a> chief medical officer Robert Mordkin. Can you delay a month or at least a few weeks until the current surge <a>wanes?</a></p></div>
<div><div><p>If the trip can’t wait, consider driving to your destination. You will be better able to control your environment and social distance from other people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not traveling is choice number one. Traveling by car is choice number two,” says Katie Passaretti, medical director of infection prevention of health-care company <a>Atrium Health</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California at Irvine, agrees — to an extent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The best travel advice of 2021, from By The Way Concierge</p></div>
<div><div><p>Step one: Get a good <a>mask</a> and make sure it fits correctly. Madad suggests an N95, KN95 or KN94 mask for travelers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because everyone has a unique face shape, Noymer says you may need to purchase multiple mask options from different brands to find one that seals your nose and mouth the best.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The airline lost your luggage. Now what?</p></div>
<div><div><p>While traveling, refrain from taking off the mask in shared public spaces, Madad says. If you need to eat or drink something, she recommends finding a less crowded place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passaretti also recommends booking a <a>window seat</a>, where you will be farther from passengers walking up and down the aisles, and turning on the overhead air vent to improve the air flow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These tips are, of course, in addition to coronavirus-prevention basics such as cleaning your hands often and social distancing from people when possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, it may be worth having another conversation with your doctor about your vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mordkin recommends confirming with your physician that you are still not a candidate for coronavirus vaccination, as it remains the most effective defense against severe illness or death from a covid-19 infection.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Former Biden advisers call for ‘new’ covid strategy</h1></div>
<h2>They suggest an approach based on a ‘new normal of life with covid,’ rather than continuing efforts to eradicate the virus</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dan Diamond</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 3:03 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 4:20 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Six former health advisers to President Biden’s transition team released a series of journal articles on Thursday calling for a “new normal” in the nation’s approach to fighting the coronavirus and other viral threats.</p>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>
<b> </b>comes amid experts’ growing realization that neither vaccinations nor infections appear to confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus. Some also express frustration the White House has squandered opportunities to contain the virus
<div><p>Omicron outbreak inducing whiplash for many Americans</p></div>
<div><p>“Two years into the pandemic, the U.S. is still heavily reliant on data from Israel and the U.K. for assessing the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines and rate of vaccine breakthrough infections,” they write.</p></div>
<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>
<p>In interviews, the advisers said that Biden officials faced considerable challenges in trying to both execute a pandemic strategy and plan for the future, adding that their recommendations were meant to complement the administration’s efforts.</p>

<div><div><p>The ruling by the Ohio-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit was quickly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is likely to have the final say over the rules set to take effect Jan. 4.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department had asked the court to clear the way for the policy designed to protect workers at large private businesses from the virus that has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Under the Labor Department rules, employers with more than 100 workers must require staff to get vaccinated or face weekly testing and mandatory masking. There are exceptions for employees who do not work on-site or with others.</p></div>
<div><p>Legal battle over Biden’s vax-or-test mandate for businesses is just beginning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Friday’s 2-1 ruling backs the Biden administration’s authority to issue the emergency workplace directive through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Louisiana-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said the Labor Department exceeded its authority and ordered OSHA to not take any further steps to implement or enforce the rules.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>OSHA invoked a rarely used power to issue the policy, which is expected to cover 84 million workers. The Biden administration estimates the rules would save thousands of lives and keep people out of inundated hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement Friday, the Justice Department said it was pleased that the 6th Circuit is "allowing OSHA to implement common-sense, science-based measures to keep workers safe and healthy during a deadly pandemic.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>States challenging the policy told the court that the case is one of “exceptional importance” that will “affect the personal health decisions of tens of millions of Americans, coast to coast.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden administration asks Supreme Court to allow vaccine mandate for health-care workers</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the majority of the 6th Circuit panel said the cost of delaying the vaccination policy is potentially high and would harm the public interest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The dissenting judge, Joan Larsen, said OSHA had exceeded its authority to regulate employers’ conduct and should have considered less sweeping alternatives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the ruling Friday night, lawyers for the challengers quickly asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the vaccination policy once again.</p></div></div>
<a>the Supreme Court told challenging states</a> to respond to the administration’s petition by Dec. 30, which would not leave the court much time for a decision.

<header><div><h1>The rental-car shortage is easing — but could return with the holidays </h1></div><h2>Experts say the shortage may not normalize until 2023</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 4, 2021 at 5:30 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Knight knew the rental-car situation had gotten out of hand earlier this year; searching for vehicles, he found “sky-high” prices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His initial optimism that “rental cars have normalized again; this is good” turned into “oh, maybe not.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why your next rental car might cost more than a plane ticket</p></div>
<a>car-rental apocalypse</a>,” experts say the situation is less dire. But that doesn’t mean the rental-car experience is back to normal — or that the holidays won’t bring their own mini apocalypse.
<div><div><p>“Things actually are better than they were,” said Chris Woronka, a leisure analyst at Deutsche Bank who follows rental-car companies. “But that’s a pretty low bar.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said rental-car companies have added to their fleets after selling hundreds of thousands of vehicles when people stopped traveling in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We probably have gotten better at perhaps responding to the demand with the supply of vehicles we have,” Scott said. “But I would by no means say that the challenges are past us.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tales from the ‘car-rental apocalypse’: How travelers are coping</p></div>
<div><div><p>Fewer markets are reporting shortages or complete sellouts of rental cars, he said. And prices are less severe than earlier this summer, though still higher than before the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Travel app Hopper says the national average for a car rental is $99 a day, up from $83 a day in early September — but a break from $110 a day in July.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re expecting these prices to increase going into the holiday season,” Hopper spokeswoman Lindsay Schwimer said.</p></div></div>
<a>contributor</a> — a dearth of new cars due to a worldwide shortage of semiconductors — is getting worse. At the same time, the labor shortage that has affected much of the travel industry has not spared car-rental companies.
<div><div><p>Woronka said he wouldn’t even expect rental-car inventory to be fully available by next summer, saying it could be until 2023 when the situation is normalized.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The newest must-have for road trips: A Venmo pitch on the window</p></div>
<div><div><p>Enterprise Holdings spokeswoman Lisa Martini said in a statement that the company, which includes the Enterprise, National and Alamo brands, is seeing increased demand all over the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What that means for holiday travelers, Martini said: Reserve a vehicle as early as possible and be flexible with travel dates and pickup locations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Woronka said there is no penalty to booking a vehicle for the holidays — or even peak travel times in 2022 — now.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If the price is more than you want and you make that reservation and for some reason the price goes down, you can always rebook at a lower price,” he said.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Airbnb is taking a closer look at fees after a social media backlash</h1></div><h2>Users complain the platform has become so laden with charges that hotels are sometimes cheaper</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 25, 2021 at 3:33 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Many users pointed out that the vacation rental platform, which was seen as a cheap alternative to hotels when it launched in 2008, had become so laden with extra charges that hotels sometimes seem like a better option.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> one Twitter user who included a screenshot of a $99 listing that would total $413.95 for two nights with fees and taxes included. That tweet was liked nearly 212,000 times and generated thousands of comments.
<div><div><p>The resulting outcry was enough to merit a <a>response</a> from Airbnb, which offered a defense of its pricing transparency, an explanation about how fees are set and a promise to review the issue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nate Blecharczyk, one of the company’s co-founders, said in an interview this week that the cleaning fees had always been part of the experience. The social media reaction, he said, was new.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In response to that, we’re definitely going to take a second look at this issue in partnership with our hosts,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>process</a> for hosts to follow.
<div><p>‘Our QuarBNB’: How short-term rentals are being used for self-quarantines during the coronavirus outbreak</p></div>
<div><p>“We also know that guests really want a clean property,” Blecharczyk said. “We definitely don’t want to compromise the quality of the cleaning by constraining what hosts can be reimbursed for here.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Worldwide, according to the company, 45 percent of listings don’t charge a cleaning fee, and for those that do, the cost on average is less than 10 percent of the total reservation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Service fees, which are set by Airbnb, and occupancy taxes, set by local governments, also add to the total — but the company noted that those and cleaning fees are always visible before it’s time to pay.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A team will undertake a review of Airbnb fees and make recommendations “with the objective of making pricing even more transparent and easy for hosts and guests to navigate,” the company said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Airbnb can survive the pandemic. But can Airbnb hosts?</p></div>
<a>updates</a> meant to make it easier to use the site and become a host. Changes include adding more tools for flexible searches, making cancellation policies more clear and doubling the number of customer support agents this summer.
<div><div><p>Airbnb says it continues to expect an “unprecedented” recovery as people have more flexibility to work remotely, travel when they want to and stay in places longer.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Airbnb to make more listings pet-friendly in latest updates </h1></div><h2>A protection plan to safeguard hosts from pet damage is part of a slew of changes</h2></header>

<div><div><p>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says the pandemic has “completely changed” travel, and the platform is adjusting accordingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Tuesday, the company announced more than 50 updates to the platform, including the launch of AirCover, an insurance plan to better protect hosts from damage.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chesky says the changes come in the midst of the “travel revolution” ushered in by the pandemic.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>With more employers allowing staff to work remotely, even as offices reopen, “people can travel longer,” Chesky says. “We’re seeing 20 percent of our business are now stays for a month or longer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chesky says one of the most significant outcomes from the shift to longer stays is the increase of guests wanting to travel with pets.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In “42 percent of searches on Airbnb, the guest either has a flexible date or a flexible destination, meaning they’re open-minded,” Chesky says. “This is a complete paradigm shift.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chesky says guests and hosts can expect more feature releases next year. In the meantime, he plans on taking vacation in December or January to escape the cold.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>How tea became part of Australia’s travel culture</h1></div><h2>Today, roadside stands offer travelers a free ‘cuppa,' but the country’s relationship with tea goes back thousands of years</h2></header>

<div><div><p>These sites, named Driver Reviver, are manned by volunteers from community organizations, serving up free tea, biscuits and conversations to those driving long distances.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A cup of tea is a very important part of the Australian road trip,” says Allan McCormac, the national director of Driver Reviver. “It always was, and it always will be.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>I finally made it home to Australia. Thousands of others remain blocked by pandemic travel rules.</p></div>
<div><p>But while Australia’s climate makes it well suited for growing tea, logistical and structural issues plague the growth of the sector, says David Lyons, founding director of the <a>Australian Tea Cultural Society</a> (AUSTCS).</p></div>
<div><p>He would like to see the industry filled with Australian-grown Camellia sinensis, the plant whose leaves are cultivated for tea, and the creation of a two-tiered system of quality that enables the crop to meet all levels of demand.</p></div>
<a> Allan Maruff</a> — a botanist and physician — visited the area and found the lost tea plants. He took clippings home to Innisfail in Queensland, and he started what would become the Nerada tea plantations.

<div><div><p>In the 1950s, Lyons says, “Australia was one of the top consumers of tea.” There were times when tea was rationed to keep up with demand. Pots of loose-leaf tea in establishments were commonplace.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A team from AUSTCS is working on an app that will enable travelers to geolocate venues serving “proper tea” across the country. The ideal, Lyons says, is to change the perception of tea and meet growing consumer demand.</p></div>

<h1>Vacationer-in-chief: A history of presidential getaways</h1>
<div>From ice cream on Martha’s Vineyard to hauling brush on Western ranches, even presidents need to unplug. Some have had a unique way of doing it. </div>
<div> <div> By Ryan Bacic </div> <div>July 2, 2021</div> </div>
<p>The Fourth of July may mark the peak of the U.S. summer travel season, but the president, as usual, will be staying home.</p>
<p>Vacations change, it turns out, when you become commander in chief.</p>
<a>Jeffrey Engel</a>, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. “They can’t unplug like you and I unplug.”

<div> <div>The first family needs to appear as relatable, and certainly vacations are relatable to many Americans.</div> <div>Colleen Shogan, director of the David M. Rubenstein Center for White House History</div> </div>
<p> <i>[Trump finally went to Camp David. It’s no Mar-a-Lago.]</i> </p>
<p>But vacations can have a political angle, too.</p>
<p>“The first family needs to appear as relatable, and certainly vacations are relatable to many Americans,” Shogan said.</p>
<a>reported</a> in August 1995, as their first Wyoming trip ended. “They have presented themselves as a supremely normal family.”

<p>Presidential vacations also naturally shifted as train networks sprawled and air travel standardized. And with lengthier trips have come ritual criticism over costs to taxpayers.</p>
<p>It all leaves us a long way from the days of Abraham Lincoln, for whom a summer vacation meant riding a horse four miles north, to meet his family at the government-owned <a>Soldiers’ Home</a> in Northwest D.C.</p>
<p>“He would stay there overnight, and then he would get on a horse and ride to the White House” to work, Shogan recounted.</p>
<p>Important changes of scenery, indeed. Here are some presidents’ favorites.</p>

<p>When Franklin D. Roosevelt needed a vacation in 1942 but feared German U-boat attacks, he had to ditch his presidential yacht.</p>
<p>He found it in the woods of Maryland, at a vacation site for federal employees and their families that he affectionately named Shangri-La. A decade later, Dwight D. Eisenhower soberly renamed it Camp David.</p>

<p>Hence why most of us will never get to visit.</p>

<a>broke norms</a>, Shogan said: Typically wealthy, presidents have often vacationed at their own posh properties. And they have often vacationed in Florida.
<p> <i>[<a>Trump says he doesn’t take vacations. They couldn’t top Teddy Roosevelt’s, anyway.</a>]</i> </p>
<a>at least 50 times</a> as president to his Winter White House in Key Biscayne, which was installed with a helipad and came with a private beach. Truman’s

<p>“Today,” Bacle conceded, “it’d be a little bit of a different story.”</p>
<p>The Little White House itself, though, is close to the same, thanks to a restoration effort that’s made it “over 90 percent accurate” to its Truman-era furnishings, according to Bacle.</p>
<p>Presidents “have a standing invitation to come whenever they want,” Bacle said. “And if they do come, then, you know, we get everybody out of there.”</p>

<p>In the summer at his Texas ranch, Lyndon B. Johnson’s odd little car would be full of guests and headed straight for the lake. The brakes, the president would shout, weren’t working.</p>
<p>Official meetings were held, albeit in lawn chairs. “The ranch was really his homestead,” Shogan said of Johnson. Born on the site in 1908, he was buried there in 1973.</p>

<p>The same image didn’t hurt Johnson, either, nor Ronald Reagan — who, Shogan said, relaxed at his Southern California “Rancho del Cielo” by cutting wood, hauling materials around in a Jeep and constructing a fence.</p>

<p>When a president is on Martha’s Vineyard, “the buzz is islandwide,” said A. Bowdoin Van Riper, the research librarian at the Martha’s Vineyard Museum.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely a ‘Wow, do you s’pose we’ll see the president when we’re out having dinner, or when we go to the fireworks or whatever?’” Van Riper said.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of opportunities. While Ulysses S. Grant visited the Vineyard briefly in 1874, Van Riper said, Clinton and Obama vacationed there nearly every summer of their presidencies. And when they were there, they were influencers.</p>
<p>One appeal of the island for presidents is its easily secured “natural perimeter,” Shogan noted.</p>
