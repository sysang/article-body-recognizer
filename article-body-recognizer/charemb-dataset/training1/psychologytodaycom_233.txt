<h1> 4 Ways to Help the Helpers </h1>
<h2> In times of crisis, we need the helpers, but what if they are all burned out? </h2>
<li>Frontline workers are experiencing alarming levels of compassion fatigue and burnout, particularly exacerbated by the pandemic.</li>
<li>It is incumbent on everyone to do their part to help the helpers by acknowledging, appreciating, and supporting their efforts.</li>
<li>Mindfulness and meditation can help healthcare workers and other helpers alleviate burnout and emotional exhaustion.</li>

<a>empathy</a>, compassion, prosocial behavior, or altruism. Interestingly, some research has found that your own past experiences of adversity and suffering can lead you to higher levels of
<a>active efforts</a> to help others. Acting compassionately can provide meaning and sense of purpose. But it is also a big task to take on others’ pain and a heavy burden to experience others’
<a>traumatic</a> events vicariously.
<h3>Helping Others Can Take a Toll</h3>
<a>mental health professionals</a>, are facing the risk of experiencing high levels of
<a>burnout</a>. Mental health symptoms such as
<a>insomnia</a>, and overall distress are widespread. We are pandemic-fatigued and unthinkably stressed. The World Health Organization and others have identified the dangers of a
<a>global mental health crisis</a> that has only become exacerbated by the pandemic. As a society, we have to prioritize the well-being of those people who take care of our most vulnerable members.
<h3>We All Need to Do Our Part to Help the Helpers</h3>
<p>It is incumbent upon all of us to take action and to help the helpers. Here are four simple ways to start:</p>
<a>supported</a> and cared for plays a fundamental role in preventing burnout. Even better,
<a>being kind</a> increases your own
<a>happiness</a>. Perform a small random act of kindness for a helper, such as paying for their coffee, taking care of an errand for them, or surprising them with flowers.
<a>Feeling appreciated</a> by the community acts to buffer the negative effects of all the
<a>Mindfulness and meditation</a> can play a role in reducing burnout and emotional exhaustion for healthcare professionals. Accessing and having time to engage in
<a>mindfulness</a> is impacted by workplace cultures, resources, and loved ones’ support and encouragement.

<h1> The Power of Self-Managed, Familiar Places </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Uncertain times call for a dose of the familiar. </h2>
<p>As 2022 starts with continued pandemic-related uncertainties swirling about, we need to embrace the familiar whenever we can and make sure people feel that they can, at least to some extent, self-manage the places where they are.</p>
<p>Predictable is positive (for our minds and often our pocketbooks), particularly in times of general uncertainty.</p>
<p>Even in the most predictable of times, we favor the familiar in the physical worlds that surround us.</p>
<p>Being around and experiencing familiar things generally makes us comfortable and boosts our mood. We prefer to look at art we find familiar, for example. </p>
<p>A bonus from being in a familiar sort of environment: When the world around us is relatively familiar, odds are we’ll be in a more trusting mood. </p>
<p>Controlled and familiar places can support a wonderful future, even if our now is uncertain.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Save Daylight Saving Time</a></h2> <p>Sunlight, even feebly radiating from the low winter horizon, helps to keep us emotionally healthy. Why do we mess with it in November?</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <h2><a>Uncovering the Mystery of Tachysensia </a></h2> <p>Symptoms of tachysensia are frightening and most common in children and adolescents, who either outgrow the syndrome completely or experience it far less frequently.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Does a Young Child Have Temporal Awareness?</a></h2> <p>The young child is slow to develop an awareness of time as experiences get pigeonholed in hippocampus cells to be orderly recorded as the past.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> Your Daily Dose of Awe: Accessing Real Resilience </h1>
<h2> Practical tips for cultivating awe. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Resilience? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Experiencing awe is good for you and there's (lots of) research backing that up.</li>
<li>Awe is not luxury, you have access to it on daily basis.</li>
<li>Awe can be experienced in a variety of ways: in nature, VR/videos/images, music and art, religion and spirituality, accomplishments, and more. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Awe.</div> <div>Source: Jeff Thompson, PhD, 2022.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>stressful</a> is an understatement. Universally we are experiencing stressors at work and home, as well as overall moments of
<a>fear</a> yet at the same time, it is impacting each of us in different and unique ways.
<a>resilience</a> practices to look after ourselves and there is one in particular that despite its potential to have a significant impact, it might catch you off guard. It is experiencing the powerful emotion of awe.
<p>With the resilience we already have in us, it tells us that there is no single tool or practice that maintains and enhances our resilience. Instead, we have to utilize a variety of techniques at our disposal.</p>
<p>This is where awe fits in. Creating moments to experience awe is exactly one of the many research-backed resilience practices we can all use to help us look after our mental health.</p>
<p><a>Dr. Golnaz Tabibnia</a>, a research scientist at the University of California – Irvine, a resilience researcher, explains the connection between resilience and awe:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“Experiencing awe increases well-being and has been associated with improved stress-related symptoms and immune function."</p> </blockquote>
<p>Experiencing awe gives us the opportunity to experience positive thoughts and feelings. Awe experiences can include feelings of wonder, joy, and astonishment while in certain circumstances it can also involve fear.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear – if we are bound to experiences of stressful moments in our lives, it is only fair we also make time for positive moments. This is called having a balance and this is a hardcore element to mental health and resilience.</p>
<p><a>Dr. Jennifer Stellar</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, explains awe in simple, everyday language:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“Awe is an emotion that we feel in response to something or someone that is extraordinary and challenges the way you think about the world.”</p> </blockquote>
<a>enhancing meaning and purpose in life</a>,
<a>Dr. Michelle Shiota</a>, an associate professor at (Arizona State University, explained during a
<a>2021 resilience symposium</a> for first responders dedicated solely on awe:
<div> <h2>Resilience Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>A Battle of Two Resiliences</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>5 Ways to Communicate as a Transformative, Resilient Leader</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Elicitors of awe are varied but generally it can be with nature, related to space and the universe, connected to <a>spirituality</a> and faith, in music and the arts, interactions with others, and through achievements (ours and others).</p>
<p>Experiencing awe does not have to be a direct experience either. It can be elicited through non-direct means including reading a story, watching a video, looking at an image, and with <a>virtual reality</a>.</p>
<p><a>Dr. Kirk Schneider</a> cautions us to avoid looking for awe but instead being open to experiencing it:</p>
<p>“If you “look” for awe, you’re probably not going to find it. On the other hand, if you can be open to awe… then you are in more of a position to be grasped by it and savor its intensity.”</p>
<p><a>Dr. Rick Hanson</a> refers to this as having “agency” – doing what you can. More pointedly, he describes this as “being the hammer, not the nail.”</p>
<p>Make the time for awe and don’t wait for the perfect day to do it, make today the right day to start.</p>

<h1> How to Manage Your Emotional Reactions </h1>
<h2> 3 steps for creating positive mental habits. </h2>
<li>Emotional reactions are based on mental habits you can change if you want to, believe you can, and can commit to the steps.</li>
<li>Even when you know a new mental habit will relieve your stress, you must consistently override your protective brain while forming the new habit.</li>
<li>Start with small steps so you can see your progress and celebrate your successes.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: bezzznika/Depositphotos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Emotions are reactions to the signals blaring in our bodies, not the events happening outside of our minds.</p>
<p>They long for peace of mind while wanting to believe that other people’s behaviors disturb their peace. Taking responsibility for their emotional reactions feels like hard work.</p>
<p>Do you want to stay stuck in the cycle of reacting, or are you willing to do the hard but rewarding work of mastering your reactions?</p>
<h3>What makes regulating emotional reactions difficult</h3>
<a>anger</a> as the result of actions by “stupid, ill-informed people.” This pattern of thinking was created to protect our
<a>self-concept</a>. The brain’s habit of blaming keeps us from feeling wrong, unsure, or vulnerable.
<a>creativity</a>, and can lead to
<a>depression</a> or to outbursts spewing contempt.
<p>Noam Shpancer, Ph.D., said, “…Emotions, like thoughts, are mind events, not world events.”<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Emotions aren’t sparked by what you experience in the moment. They are set off by how your brain interprets events based on your past experiences.</p>
<p>You don’t react to what is. You react to what you think has occurred based on what you experienced or learned in the past.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein said, “Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”</p>
<p>Emotional reactivity is learned behavior, meaning you can learn new ways of thinking and reacting if you choose to. You can put your <a>imagination</a> to good use.</p>
<h3>Breaking the cycle of your emotional reactions</h3>
<p>Every time you repeat how you react to people, situations, and events, you ingrain a pattern that becomes a mental habit. The older the habit, the more rigid it is, and the longer your disciplined practice must be to change it.</p>
<p>Step two is to know why you want to manage your emotions. It is not enough to say, “I want to be a better person.” You must know what outcome is important to you that will drive your <a>motivation</a> even when you have setbacks.</p>
<h3>Creating new habits of emotional reactions</h3>
<p>Remind yourself every morning to practice your step until you see consistent progress. Remind yourself every evening you can succeed so that your brain will support you even when you are doubtful.</p>
<p>Write about your victories in a journal. Talk about them with others who support your growth.</p>
<p>Don’t be impatient. You are chipping away at well-established routines.</p>
<p>Do you want to be a victim to your emotional responses or the master of your reactions? You can be the master if you commit to creating a new mental habit over time. You will believe it when you see it.</p>

<a>anxious</a> and worried over certain events, existing or anticipated.
<a>hormones</a>. Such hormones include several cortisone-like compounds called glucocorticoids, and the most prominent one in humans is cortisol.
<a>memory</a> ability is enhanced. Another useful thing cortisol does is to reduce the release of cellular chemicals that cause inflammation.
<a>depression</a>. Memory ability is impaired. Brain degeneration and
<a>cognitive decline</a> accelerate. Many neurons are actually killed. What I want to stress here is that chronic high levels of cortisone change the
<a>neural</a> circuitry that regulates its release. In other words, the brain learns a new way of functioning when constantly bathed in high levels of cortisone.
