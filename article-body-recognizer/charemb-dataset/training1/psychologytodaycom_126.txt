<h1> The Mind-Hack I Used to Help My Father Lose Weight </h1>
<h2> Have you ever taken a bet to change your behavior? </h2>
<p>When my family immigrated to the United States in 1981, my father weighed 185 pounds. He came chasing the American dream but got more than he expected.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Dad and me soon after coming to America.</div> <div>Source: Nir Eyal</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Along with a new, more prosperous life for his family, he also acquired some bad habits.</p>
<p>For one, he took up smoking because, as he sheepishly admits, “that’s what business people here did back then.” And to ward off the boredom of long car rides between sales calls, he began eating American-made junk food.</p>
<p>Today in his late 60s, my father still struggles to control his weight with no success — that is, until recently.</p>
<a>diet</a> pills, nor is he drinking any miracle shakes. He’s not enrolled in any groups like Weight Watchers that can charge hundreds of dollars. In fact, the solution he’s using isn’t costing him a dime.
<a>goal-setting</a>, but my father mentioned, “I wish I could finally get rid of these extra pounds.”
<p>As he said this, his hand went to his belly, squeezing a roll of fat through his shirt as his face grimaced regretfully. I could see he was disappointed in himself.</p>
<p>“How did you <a>quit smoking</a>?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I took a bet,” he said. I was intrigued.</p>
<p>He continued, “A friend said there was no way I could give up smoking for a year. He put $100 on the line, and we shook on it. That was it. I never picked it up again.”</p>
<p>This gave me an idea. “What if we did the same for your diet?”</p>
<p>“I know you love sweets,” I said. “I know you also love carbs. But do you agree there’s nothing good about eating sugar and all those processed carbohydrates other than how good they taste?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he agreed. “I wish I’d never eat them again.”</p>
<p>“Great!” I said. “How would you like to free yourself from the pull of fattening food just like you cut the desire to smoke?”</p>
<p>“OK,” he confirmed, but this time his response was more hesitant, anticipating what I would say next.</p>
<p>“I bet you $25,000 to never eat refined carbohydrates again.” Of course, I didn’t want his money. What I wanted was to get his <a>attention</a>, and I needed a dollar amount that would hurt.</p>
<p>His face turned pale as I stuck out my hand to seal the deal.</p>
<p>“Never?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You know sugar and refined carbs are hurting your body, right?” I asked, and he agreed. “Well then, let’s kill this bad habit for good.”</p>
<p>“If you successfully give up these things you say you want to stop eating, you win and keep your money. This bet will help you do something you’ve wanted to do for years.”</p>
<p>“But no sweets ever again?” he wondered.</p>
<p>“OK, you get to eat whatever you want one day a year — on your birthday.”</p>
<p>He was speechless. Then, my father rose from the easy chair, steadied himself, and shook my hand. The deal was done.</p>

<h1> Would You Take a Bet That Would Change Your Life? </h1>
<h2> The wager technique is incredibly effective, if you're willing to use it. </h2>
<p> Posted August 17, 2021 </p>
<li>The wager technique is an effective way to change certain habits by providing a consequence for doing or not doing a particular behavior.</li>
<li>The threat of losing money can encourage certain behaviors while deterring others. </li>
<li>Limitations of the wager technique include that few people are willing to take the bet and that the program does not accommodate failure.</li>
<a>part 2 </a>of this three-part series, the technique involves a wager. A study published in the
<a>New England Journal of Medicine</a> showed that when people put money down, they were much more likely to accomplish their goals. In this case, people who risked $150 of their own money to win a $650 bonus prize were dramatically more likely to
<a>quit smoking</a> than those who used traditional smoking cessation methods. Surprisingly, this group also beat out those who were offered an $800 reward with no deposit for staying smoke-free.
<h3>Less Attractive but More Effective</h3>
<p>This technique clearly isn’t for everyone. In fact, when I think about how I could apply this method to my own life, I cringe. There is irony in the fact that I’m scared to use a method I know to be so effective.</p>
<a>Nudge</a> author Cass Sunstein wrote, “Only 13.7% of the participants assigned to the deposit program chose to enroll in it, whereas 90.0% of those assigned to the reward program chose to enroll.”
<p>There’s clearly a lost opportunity here, but why did so few people take the bet?</p>
<p>You would expect the larger reward to have provided more <a>motivation</a> — clearly, it didn’t. Chalk it up as another demonstration of one of the many quirks of the human psyche.</p>
<a>confidence</a> in their ability to kick their habit. Perhaps people motivated to quit smoking were scared to put down the deposit because they somehow knew they would have to do the hard work of quitting? My
<a>intuition</a> tells me this is more likely the case but further research needs to be done.
<h3>When It Doesn’t Work</h3>
<p>While this technique can prove effective, there are also many faults to this method. First, the most obvious weakness is that so few people are actually willing to take such a wager.</p>
<a>phenomenon of reactance</a> — our tendency to reject threats to our autonomy. People generally don’t like being told what to do and taking the bet can feel restrictive.
<p>However, giving people the freedom to choose has been shown to increase compliance. Perhaps offering a limited number of “cheat passes” may disarm reactance by reminding participants that quitting is still their choice.</p>
<a>body-focused repetitive behaviors </a>are not good candidates for using this technique.
<a>behavior modification</a> program must accommodate those who, for one reason or another, can’t stick with the program.
<p>While the wager method is more effective at stopping certain behaviors for certain people, it is not a perfect program. This technique is yet another tool for healthful behavior modification that works under the right circumstances.</p>
<h3>Here’s the Gist:</h3>
<li>The wager technique provides a consequence for doing or not doing a particular behavior.</li>
<li>The threat of losing money can encourage certain behaviors while deterring others.</li>
<li>While effective at changing certain behaviors, the wager technique has several limitations, including:</li>
<li>Few people are willing to take the bet</li>
<li>The technique is not appropriate for changing behaviors with triggers that cannot be avoided. For example, nail-biting would not be a good behavior to attempt to change using this technique.</li>
<li>The program does not accommodate failure.</li>
<p>Did I miss any other benefits or deficiencies to this method? What ideas do you have for how to increase participation or accommodate for failure?</p>

<h1> What to Do About Vaping Now That Teens Are Back to School </h1>
<h2> Schools and parents turn to tech to help kids quit. </h2>
<li>The COVID pandemic has led to reduced overall prevalence of teen vaping, but a remaining population of teens who are highly addicted to nicotine.</li>
<li>There’s an opportunity now to focus on providing teens with the tools, information, and support they need to reduce or quit vaping.</li>
<li>Technology-based interventions that have been helping teens quit smoking may be applied to help teens to quit vaping as well.</li>
<li>Adding a social component to tech-based quit vaping interventions may add benefit for teens.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The pandemic limited teens' access to vaping in social situations</div> <div>Source: Hopelab, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey</a>, nearly 20% of high school students and nearly 5% of middle-schoolers reported past month
<a>e-cigarette</a> use. The pandemic brought teens inside, which limited social contact and exchange in numerous detrimental ways; but it also limited teens’ access to vaping in social situations which is the most common context for starting use.
<a>Restricted pandemic conditions</a> afforded an opportunity for some young people to cut down or quit vaping, and for others frequency increased, likely reflecting the strong addictive potential of vaping. What we have now is a
<a>reduced overall prevalence</a> of teen vaping, which is great, but a remaining population of teens who are highly addicted to nicotine.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Teens want to quit now</div> <div>Source: Hopelab, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>want to quit</a> now. Young people have repeatedly cited health as one of the main
<a>reasons they want to quit</a>, and the
<a>perceived risk</a> of vaping went up during the pandemic. This moment, before the inertia and routines of school life take hold, presents a critical opportunity for teens to quit or reduce their vaping. And schools can help.
<a>quit smoking</a> may be applied to help teens to quit vaping as well. For example, in a
<a>randomized clinical trial</a> of the text message-based program,
<a>reported</a> that social tools have been “very important” for staying connected. The quality of online relationships can be extremely rich and supportive: A
<a>2018 study</a> found that, among adolescents, the core qualities of
<a>friendship</a> — self-disclosure, validation, companionship, instrumental support, and conflict resolution — persist online. And while parents and teachers may have hard-earned
<a>wisdom</a> and advice to dispense, adolescents often look to their peers for support, because it’s mainly their peers who are navigating similar life experiences.
<a>coaching</a> can further boost cessation program efficacy.
<a>Outcomes</a> from our Facebook cessation intervention, the
<a>Tobacco Status Project</a>, found that live coaching independently predicted quitting over and above the rest of the social media intervention. This finding directly influenced
<a>Quit the Hit</a>, an Instagram-based vaping cessation program developed by Hopelab and Rescue Agency, featuring both peer support groups and live coaching.
<div> <div> <div> <div>We have an opportunity to make a dent in the teen vaping problem before it gets worse.</div> <div>Source: Hopelab, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>support resources</a> for both themselves and their children. Schools can also
<a>bring digital cessation support programs</a> into their community, meeting kids where they are (or where they are about to be), and give them access to an evidence-based toolkit that may not otherwise know was out there.
<p>If we respond now, we have an opportunity to make a dent in the vaping problem before it gets worse. We’re in a moment of transition, and kids are paying <a>attention</a>.</p>

<h1> Microplastics: What You Don't See That May Be Harmful </h1>
<h2> Microplastics are found everywhere. What are the dangers? </h2>
<li>Nearly all evidence points in the direction that microplastics accumulate in the body and can be carcinogenic. </li>
<li>Microplastics are found everywhere, from clothing to toothpaste to babies' teethers.</li>
<li>The microplastics industry may leverage arguments that cigarette companies used, such as the products are helpful.</li>
<p>A <a>recent study</a> by Dr. Kannan and colleagues showed that infants have 10-20 times higher microplastics concentrations in their feces than adults. Kannan explained,</p>
<p>Why? Infants mouthing behavior, such as crawling on carpets and chewing on textiles, as well as various products used for children including teethers, plastics toys, feeding bottles, utensils such as spoons can all contribute to such exposure.</p>
<p>Below is a chart from a review study of the potential effects of microplastics on human health, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 2020.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We can anticipate that the plastic industry responses will follow the same arc as that of the shoe manufacturers and tobacco companies:</p>
<li>Microplastics are helpful (the X-rays will lead to better-fitting shoes).</li>
<li>Because fish are dying from microplastics doesn’t prove they are harmful to humans (mice aren’t people).</li>
<li>Microplastics found in people’s bodies do not mean that they caused the illness (smokers may be living an unhealthy lifestyle in general).</li>
<li>Even if microplastic is hazardous to health, consumers should be free to buy what they want (you don’t have to smoke if you don’t want to).</li>
<p>Change is hard, especially when the danger is invisible. The naked eye can’t see viruses, but we know that they can make us sick. So, too, we can change habits and preferences if we acknowledge just how harmful microplastics are for us.</p>

<h1> Why Marijuana Use May Lower Emotional Intelligence </h1>
<h2> Marijuana can significantly dull emotional processing, according to a new study. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Robert Nelson / Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Psychopharmacology</a> suggests that chronic marijuana use may cause deficits in one's ability to recognize emotional states in others — a hallmark of what psychologists refer to as
<a>memory</a>, processing speed, and
<a>attention</a>. Additionally, there is an emerging research area suggesting cannabis use may affect emotion processing.”
<p>Across the studies, the researchers identified some common themes, such as regular cannabis users demonstrating:</p>
<li>A lack of responsiveness to emotional stimuli.</li>
<li>Decreased accuracy and response time when identifying and differentiating emotional states such as <a>happiness</a>, sadness, or <a>anger</a>.</li>
<li>Decreased <a>neural</a> activity, as measured by brain wave amplitudes, when exposed to emotional stimuli (e.g., happy vs. sad photos).</li>
<li>A dampening of activity in the prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex in response to being shown emotional images, as measured by fMRI.</li>
<a>CBD</a>, can influence emotion processing in different ways. For instance, one study found that THC increases
<a>anxiety</a> in response to fearful social situations while CBD tends to decrease it.
<p>But there is still much to be learned.</p>
<a>sex</a>, polysubstance use, and
<a>psychiatric</a> disorders on socioemotional functioning, and studies should also expand to middle-aged and older adult cannabis users, as the majority of currently published research is limited to adolescents and young adults.”

<h2> Temporary fixes to old habits can actually make people gain weight. </h2>
<li>Creating a commitment to stop a bad habit, such as making a bet, can increase a person's chances of stopping it.</li>
<li>Avoiding losses is a powerful motivational tool when used properly.</li>
<li>The language used when discussing habitual behaviors, such as "I can't" vs "I don't," can help sustain change.</li>
<p>Diets don’t work. Studies show that temporary fixes to old habits can actually make people gain weight. Essentially, the dieter’s brain is trained to gorge when off the <a>diet</a> and inevitably the weight returns.</p>

<p>So far it’s working. My father has lost about 2 pounds per week and his improved blood work convinced his doctor to take him off some of the meds.</p>
<a>recent study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine provides supporting evidence that putting some skin in the game makes people more likely to accomplish their goal of stopping a bad habit.

<p>Until then, let me know if you’ve tried using a commitment in your life to change your behaviors. Did anything work particularly well or did you ultimately go back to your old habits?</p>
<li>Creating a commitment to stop a bad habit can increase the odds of quitting certain behaviors.</li>
<li>Though not appropriate for all behaviors, the technique works because it uses loss aversion, a commitment contract, and provides a social out for not doing the behavior by changing the language we use to describe our actions.</li>

<h1> Vaping and Acute Lung Injury: Are All E-Cigarettes to Blame? </h1>
<h2> An evolving case raises questions about what we really know about vaping. </h2>
<a>has stimulated calls for banning e-cigarettes completely</a>. Since 2016, the
<a>FDA has banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors</a>, but use of vaping products by
<a>teenagers</a> has nevertheless soared.
<a>have recently stopped the sale of flavored e-cigarettes</a> because they are believed to be one of the reasons adolescents are attracted to smoking them. But despite evidence that adolescents are attracted to the flavors in
<a>there is no evidence yet</a> that eliminating them would reduce teenage vaping, making it unclear if that step will have any benefit. Some believe that e-cigarettes should be completely outlawed, and in June,
<a>San Francisco became the first U.S. city</a> to ban e-cigarettes entirely. Meanwhile, the CDC has advised that “while this investigation is ongoing, CDC recommends that you consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.”

<p>Always Ask: What Is the Denominator?</p>
<a>A 2018 statement by Public Health England</a> emphasized that vaping nicotine is far safer than smoking combustible cigarettes. This is because although nicotine is an addictive substance,
<a>it is not known to cause cancer</a>.
<p><a>British authorities stress the benefits of vaping</a> to help traditional cigarette smokers quit and seem more concerned that combustible cigarette smokers incorrectly believe that e-cigarettes are equally dangerous.</p>
<a>We have previously written</a> about the concerns and evidence about whether vaping is a gateway to combustible cigarette smoking. It is clearly something we are much more worried about in the U.S. than in the U.K.
<a>More research is needed </a>to establish whether vaping nicotine produces the same craving and potential for withdrawal symptoms as does smoking it in combustible cigarettes or absorbing it through mucous membranes, as with chewing tobacco.
<p>Always Know the Science Surrounding an Issue</p>
<li>We do not want people who vape to suffer from acute or chronic lung disease, and we don’t have long-term studies reassuring us that years of e-cigarette exposure is safe for the human respiratory system.</li>
<a>As high school senior Eliza P. Shapiro put it on CNN </a>recently while discussing vaping: “Teenagers respond to real data and good science."
<a>FDA now has a Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation</a>, which hopefully will include measures for a rational approach to e-cigarette regulation.
<p>Beyond that, we mourn the loss of those who have died as a result of vaping and hope our scientists get definitive answers soon enough to keep that number where it is.</p>

<h1> Are E-Cigarettes Helpful for Smokers? </h1>
<h2> E-cigarettes may be more effective than nicotine replacement therapy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), electronic nicotine delivery systems, are battery-operated devices used to inhale an aerosol, which typically contains nicotine (though not always), flavorings, and other chemicals.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Are E-Cigarettes Harmful?</p>
<p>Can E-Cigarettes Help Me Quit Smoking?</p>
<a>randomized clinical trial</a> was conducted in the U.K. in which the use of e-cigarettes was compared to nicotine replacement
<a>therapy</a> for smokers trying to quit.
<p>What Does This Mean for Smokers?</p>
<li>E-cigarettes should be used only when behavioral counseling combined with FDA-approved treatments are not successful.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised by their health care professional to use the lowest dose possible to cope with their cravings and to use e-cigarettes for only a circumscribed period of time.</li>
<li> E-cigarette use should be monitored by health care professionals, as are other pharmacologic smoking cessation treatments.</li>
