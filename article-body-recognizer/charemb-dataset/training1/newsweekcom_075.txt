<p>"Pilots are required to continuously use supplemental oxygen when flying unpressurised aircraft, such as the Caravan, when flying above 10,000 feet," the report explained.</p>
<p>According to the latest ATSB investigation, air traffic control (ATC) was unable to make contact with the pilot when the plane was around 33 miles from the Sunshine Coast Airport, located around 56 miles north of Brisbane.</p>
<p>After several calls, ATC called on pilots in nearby aircraft to help contact the Caravan pilot "who was seen to overfly Redcliffe and track towards Brisbane," the report said.</p>
<p>The report says another aircraft attempted to approach the Caravan to try to trigger the traffic alert and collision system but there was still no response from the pilot.</p>
<p>After 40 minutes without contact, the pilot woke up at 5:35 p.m. local time and ATC communications were reestablished when the plane was "about 111 km [around 69 miles] south-south-east of the intended destination," the report said.</p>
<p>The pilot was instructed to land at Gold Coast Airport where the plane landed safely just after 6 p.m. local time.</p>
<p>ATSB Acting Transport Safety Director, Kerri Hughes, said in the report: "The ATSB found that the pilot was likely experiencing a level of fatigue due to inadequate sleep the night before and leading up to the incident."</p>
<p>Most people tend to "underestimate their level of fatigue and tend to overestimate their abilities," Hughes noted in the report.</p>
<p>"This incident emphasises the importance of pilots monitoring their own health and wellbeing, to ensure that they are well-rested and adequately nourished, especially when conducting single pilot operations."</p>
<p>The director said the investigation "carefully considered the role of hypoxia" in the latest case.</p>
<p>She explained: "Although a common symptom of hypoxia is loss of consciousness, it is not typical for someone experiencing hypoxia to regain consciousness, while still operating at the same altitude and without additional oxygen.</p>
<p>"Rather, the pilot had fallen asleep likely due to a combination of fatigue and mild hypoxia, possibly exacerbated by dehydration and diet," Hughes said.</p>
<p>According to an article on the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website, hypoxia is defined as "the lack of sufficient oxygen in the blood, tissues, and/or cells to maintain normal physiological function."</p>

<div> World Viral video <a>RyanAir</a> <a>Flights</a></div>
<p>An incident aboard a Ryanair flight has gone viral after a passenger spat at and kicked fellow travelers.</p>
<p>Fellow passengers shared clips from the flight online, which can be seen here, amassing shocked responses online. The disagreement appears to have started over demands for the woman to wear her facemask and social distance.</p>
<p>The viral video begins with the woman, who has her mask on her chin, sitting down on the flight in a verbal disagreement with a passenger to her right. She then spits at the passenger. A flight attendant interjects and spoke to the woman.</p>
<p>When he left, the passenger continued to rant loudly on the flight, causing the attendant to return. The passenger and attendant had a verbal dispute, with her telling him to "go away."</p>
<p>At one point the woman can be heard stating that she lives in a democratic country and can say what she wants.</p>
<p>However, the altercation took a turn for the worse when the woman pulled at the hair of another passenger. In the clip, she can also be heard mimicking the screams from the passenger.</p>
<p>Final video clips from the flight show the woman being escorted and held by Ryanair staff, while she kicked at a male passenger.</p>
<a>went viral </a>in Texas last week after her public outburst was captured on camera. The woman was dubbed "Boo Hoo Karen" after she demanded to see the airport manager. She was subsequently arrested, and the video has been viewed over five million times.
<p>Lufthansa had two planes flying into Moscow due to depart early Wednesday, but both flights were canceled after Russia refused to provide necessary permits in time, according to The Moscow Times.</p>
<p>The transport ministry said, "Due to the reciprocal practice, the Federal Aviation authority also did not issue any further permits for flights operated by Russian airlines as long as authorizations are pending on the Russian side."</p>
<p>The German ministry clarified that once the permits for Lufthansa flights are granted, Russian airlines will also be permitted to land in Germany as well.</p>
<p>The European Union began sanctioning European-based airlines to avoid flying over Belarus airspace after a flight was diverted under the ruse of a bomb threat in order to detain a 26-year-old journalist and activist by the name of Raman Pratasevich.</p>
<p>Since then, Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Finnair, Lufthansa, and Austrian Airlines are among many that have begun avoiding Belarus.</p>
<p>He said, "A representative of the Belarusian foreign ministry…stressed the readiness of the Belarusian authorities to act on the issue in a transparent manner and to follow all international rules."</p>
<a>said during a meeting</a>, "The
<a>United Nations</a> have all condemned the actions of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and demanded an international investigation, as well as the immediate release of Prataseveich.
<p>Newsweek reached out to Lufthansa airlines for comment.</p>
<p>A flight from Dallas to Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday was diverted to Pensacola, Florida to let off two passengers, an unidentified man and a woman traveling together who allegedly got into a scuffle. What triggered the fight is unknown at this time.</p>
<p>The woman began hitting the man with a cell phone, according to reports. A passenger who saw the fight told Local 10 News said that as the woman was hitting him, the phone began to smoke.</p>
<p>A few passengers were quick to grab water and take care of the smoldering device, and law enforcement came aboard to escort the couple off the plane, according to Engleson.</p>
<p>She said she was thankful for the way Southwest Airlines handled the situation. "They truly made everyone feel super safe, and I can not be more grateful for how the situation ended," she told Local 10 News.</p>
<p>Last month, <a>a fight broke out</a> between a passenger and a Southwest flight attendant, resulting in the flight attendant losing two of her teeth.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Southwest Airlines for more information.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration was left confused after a man they stopped said he was unaware he had bullets in his bag.</p>
<p>On Monday, TSA agents at LaGuardia Airport in New York, stopped a man after they found 50 bullets in his carry-on bag. The man, according to the TSA, told agents he was "unaware" the bullets were in his bag.</p>
<p>Friday marked the highest traffic day for airports since March 2020. TSA agents screened 2,028,961 people, the first time screenings broke the 2 million threshold since the pandemic began.</p>

<p>So far, TSA officers have caught five firearms at TSA checkpoints this year, about half the number that were identified in 2020 and 2019.</p>
<div> U.S. American Airlines <a>Flight cancellations</a> <a>Flights</a></div>
<p>American Airlines canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend, blaming "labor shortages" and the "incredibly quick ramp up of customer demand."</p>
<p>In total, 296 flights were scrapped: 120 on Saturday and another 176 on Sunday. The cancellations came soon after the airline rapidly increased flying to meet a surge in travel demand.</p>
<p>Over the four-day period from Friday, June 18 to Monday, June 21, American is approaching 500 flight cancelations, according to Flight Aware data.</p>
<p>The airline pointed towards "unprecedented" weather conditions and vendor labor shortages as additional reasons why flights were curtailed.</p>
<p>Vendors that provide in-flight catering, wheelchair pushers and fueling services were said to be short staffed, which can slow operations and create inconveniences for customers, an American Airlines executive told the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>However, the airline stressed that the number of flights culled was relatively small and was equivalent to about 1 percent of their planned flying in the first half of July.</p>
<p>"We made targeted changes with the goal of impacting the fewest number of customers by adjusting flights in markets where we have multiple options for re-accommodation," the airline's spokesperson added.</p>
<p>"I think they're afraid they're not going to be able to run the operation as they've scheduled it, so they're pulling back," Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flier website and travel-concierge service, told WSJ. "That's good for the traveler."</p>
<p>American Airlines has made ambitious plans to return to the air this summer, with aims to fly nearly as much this season as it did before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<a>United Airlines</a> Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. and its schedule is planned to be 20 percent larger than Delta's and United's for July, measured by available seat miles, according to Cirium, an airline data provider.
<p>Extreme weather related to Tropical Storm Elsa is causing further travel chaos for passengers on American Airlines flights after labor shortages already resulted in hundreds of flights being canceled in recent weeks.</p>
<p>More than 100 flights American Airlines that were due to depart on Tuesday or Wednesday have been canceled, according to the Flight Aware website.</p>
<a>including the closing of airports</a> such as Tampa International Airport and Sarasota Bradenton International Airport.
<p>A number of flights coming in and out of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) were in the batch of canceled flights, with an American Airlines spokesperson confirming to Newsweek that this was weather related.</p>
<p>On Friday, disruption at the Texas airport ahead of the July 4 weekend meant that DFW had the most flight cancelations of any airport in the world at that time, reported WFAA.</p>
<p>American Airlines had previously warned that there would be a number of canceled flights because of a lack of staff and an increase in customer demand.</p>
<p><a>Hundreds of flights were canceled across the country </a>in one weekend in mid-June, with the airline warning that disruptions could continue until at least mid-July.</p>
<a>American Airlines</a> spokesperson told Newsweek.
<p>According to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center, Elsa is currently moving toward Florida at a speed of around 12 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Elsa is expected to hit Florida with maximum sustained winds of nearly 65 miles per hour, before weakening as it moves inland.</p>
<p>Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises Americans against traveling internationally until they are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>There are around 60 countries and territories that fall within the CDC's "Level 1: COVID-19 Low" risk assessment category, according to the latest CDC advice for traveling abroad, which was updated on Monday.</p>
<p>Those traveling to a "Level 1: COVID-19 Low" area are advised to make sure they are fully vaccinated before heading to the destination.</p>
<a>threat of the Delta variant looms</a>, "need to pay close attention to the conditions at their destination" before they travel and any restrictions that may be in place.
<a>FDA</a> or EMA [ European Medicines Agency] vaccine—they'll still need to do the usual pre-departure test before arrival and take a PCR test on day 2 of returning to England."
<p>While this might be welcome news for some, according to the latest CDC recommendations, the U.K. is currently among the areas in the "Level 4: COVID-19 Very High" category.</p>
<p>The CDC warns Americans to avoid traveling to destinations in the "Level 4" category and advises against all non-essential travel to areas in the "Level 3: COVID-19 High" category.</p>
<h2>Places in CDC's 'Level 1: COVID-19 Low' Category</h2>
<li>Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</li>
<li>Federated States of Micronesia</li>
<li>Northern Mariana Islands</li>
<li>Saint Pierre and Miquelon</li>
<li>Turks and Caicos Islands (U.K.)</li>
<h2>CDC Advice for Vaccinated People Traveling Abroad</h2>
<li>They should also follow all state and local COVID-19 safety recommendations and requirements, such as mask wearing and social distancing, according to the latest advice from the federal body.</li>
<h2>CDC Advice for Unvaccinated People Traveling Abroad</h2>
<p>In addition to all of the aforementioned advice for vaccinated Americans, those who are unvaccinated but traveling abroad are advised to get tested with a viral test one to three days before their trip.</p>
<p>The following additional recommendations also apply for unvaccinated Americans returning to the U.S. after their trip abroad, <a>as outlined by the CDC:</a></p>
<li>If you don't get tested, stay home and self-quarantine for 10 days after travel.</li>
<li>Avoid being around people who are at increased risk for severe illness for 14 days, whether you get tested or not.</li>

<p>Spirit Airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Wednesday in the fourth day of travel disruptions for the airline. In a statement to Newsweek, the company blamed widespread system outages, poor weather and staffing shortages.</p>
<p>The Spirit Airlines' flights scratched for Wednesday make up a great deal of the entire industry's U.S. flight cancellations of the day, which had totaled 523 at the time of this writing.</p>
<p><a>American Airlines</a> had also canceled hundreds of flights in recent days, but it had only removed 3 percent of its scheduled flights on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>"These issues were exacerbated by the fact that we are in peak summer travel season with very high industry load factors and more limited options for guest re-accommodations," the statement added.</p>
<a>Transportation Security Administration (TSA) </a>showed the agency screened more than 2.2 million U.S. passengers on Sunday alone. That figure represents the highest amount of people screened since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago.
<a>Twitter</a> account said: "Spirit Airlines has recently been experiencing a series of operational struggles. These issues are not due to a pilot strike. Any such rumor or report is completely false."
<p>"Spirit management has begun treating this irregular operations as a hurricane recovery and strategically canceled flights around the system with the possibility of a system reset," the union wrote in its <a>statement</a>.</p>
<p>Spirit Airlines' statement to Newsweek said the company believes the issues will be sorted out in the near future.</p>
<p>Government officials announced on Wednesday that Canada will be getting a <a>COVID-19</a> vaccine passport for international travel in the upcoming month.</p>
<a>coronavirus</a>. He said the passport will be "a key step forward in ensuring Canadians will have the documents they need once it is safe to travel again."
<p>"We are working actively with the provinces and territories on a secure, pan-Canadian proof of vaccination for international travel," Mendicino said.</p>
<p>Global News shared the conference which announced the passport on its <a>YouTube</a> channel.</p>
<p>The vaccine passport is expected to be ready by the fall, though an exact timeline has not been given. The document will be digital, but there will be a paper option for those who can't or don't want a digital certificate.</p>
<p>The passport will be available to Canadian citizens, permanent residents and temporary residents living in Canada who are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>"If the provinces wish to work with us in order to use our federal credentials within their province, we would be happy to work with them," Leblanc said.</p>
<p>The <a>European Union</a> already rolled out a vaccine passport system this summer for people to traveling within the region, and other countries have also announced similar plans for passports designed for both domestic and international travel.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Canada has one of the highest rates of inoculation in the world. The agency reported that as of July 31, 81 percent of Canadians people aged 12 and over had been given one shot of a vaccine, 68 percent were fully vaccinated.</p>
<a>Taliban</a> continue seizing control of cities throughout Afghanistan.
<p>The Taliban currently controls almost one-third of the 34 provincial capitals in Afghanistan. On Thursday afternoon, it reportedly broke through defensive lines at the country's third-largest city, Herat.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said on <a>Twitter</a> it had received reports of the Taliban executing some surrendering Afghan troops. The message added that such executions were "deeply disturbing" and "could constitute war crimes."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, the embassy wrote, "Don't erase Afghanistan's human rights gains of the last 20 years."</p>
<p>The current travel advisory for Afghanistan is at "<a>Level 4-Do Not Travel</a>," which was prompted by an elevated risk of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict and COVID-19.</p>
<p>"Domestic flights and ground transportation routes outside of Kabul are severely limited and subject to cancellation or closure," the alert also noted.</p>
<p>The embassy had already issued a similar security alert last Saturday that encouraged U.S. citizens to try to find commercial flights and leave Afghanistan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thursday's alert also urged U.S. citizens in the country to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), which provides regular security updates and allows the embassy to contact users in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>A small single-engine airplane made an emergency landing on a California highway Tuesday, hitting several cars and lodging part of its wing into an SUV, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Aerial Reporter Malik Earnest said the small aircraft took off from Montgomery-Gibbs Airport in San Diego before making the emergency landing. According to CHP, there were two people inside the plane.</p>
<p>"Several agencies from all over San Diego are on scene.@CHP_BCC reports two souls were aboard the plane, and there are no serious injuries to report. The plane did hit several cars, lodging a part of its wing in the rear of an SUV," Earnest tweeted.</p>
<p>The two occupants of the plane are reported to not be injured, Ysea told the outlet.</p>
<p>Aerial photographs of the scene showed the small plane off to the far left of the southbound lanes, resting near the freeway's divider. The plane appeared to be missing half of its right wing, which was located about 500 feet away from the aircraft.</p>
<p>There were reports that fuel was leaking onto the northbound side of the highway, according to <a>NBC</a> San Diego.</p>
<p>The CHP has since closed all southbound lanes and said traffic is being diverted off the freeway. Video footage showed stunned drivers getting out of their cars and taking photos of the crashed plane and its broken wing.</p>
<p>Newsweek contacted the CHP for additional comment but did not hear back in time for publication.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the <a>Taliban</a> is barring flights from leaving Afghanistan because it claims that some of the passengers don't have the required documentation, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>"We've made clear to all parties, we've made clear to the Taliban, that these charters need to be able to depart," Blinken said.</p>
<p>He added that the U.S. is working with advocates and lawmakers to help coordinate landing rights and liaise with other countries in the region on flights over their territory, or overflights.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>Legitimacy, support must be 'earned'</p>
<p>Blinken is telling the Taliban that "any legitimacy, any support will have to be earned" after the group named an interim government.</p>
<p>Blinken spoke after he and his German counterpart on Wednesday hosted a virtual meeting of ministers from 22 countries as well as <a>NATO</a> and the <a>European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Blinken reiterated the cautious initial U.S. response to the Taliban's naming Tuesday of an interim government lineup.</p>
<p>Blinken said that the government and the Taliban will be judged by their actions.</p>
<p>Germany: Support depends on Taliban</p>
<p>Germany's foreign minister has responded skeptically to the Taliban's announcement of an interim government lineup for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Maas said his country is ready to provide humanitarian aid via the <a>United Nations</a> and will continue to speak to the Taliban to secure the departure from Afghanistan of former employees and others.</p>
<p>He added that any commitment beyond that will depend on the Taliban's behavior.</p>
<p>Maas said: "The announcement of an interim government without the participation of other groups and yesterday's violence against female demonstrators and journalists in Kabul are not signals that make us optimistic about that."</p>
<p>Virginia Buckingham was the CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority at the time of the attacks, and the developer of the World Trade Center claimed lax security at Logan was ultimately responsible for the attack on the twin towers.</p>
<p>The developer sued Massport, American and United in a legal battle that didn't end until 2017, when insurers for the two airlines agreed to close the case by paying $95 million to World Trade Center Properties.</p>
<p>Tucked in a grove of ginkgo trees, a glass cube at Logan pays tribute to those lost aboard the two jetliners that took off from Boston and were hijacked by terrorists who flew them into the World Trade Center towers.</p>
<a>United Airlines</a> Flight 175 draws few visitors. And the airport's other nods to its role in the tragedy — American flags that fly above the jetways at the gates where the flights departed — go mostly unnoticed and unremarked.
<p>It's reflective of the city's uneasy ties to the transcendent events of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>"It still feels surreal in a way, because it was just horrifying beyond anyone's ability to grasp," said Buckingham.</p>
<p>On the day of the attacks, Buckingham was preparing to fly to Washington to meet with the Federal Aviation Administration about a new runway at Logan when she got a six-word message that still chills her: "Two planes are off the radar."</p>
<p>Underscoring Boston's uneasy attempts to distance itself from its role in the attacks, subdued 20th anniversary remembrances are planned at the airport on Saturday, September 11.</p>
<p>Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan said nothing is planned apart from the usual TSA honor guards stationed at the airport's main checkpoints in the morning. American and United will have private ceremonies.</p>
<p>Twenty years on, there is little to suggest that Boston has truly come to terms with its supporting role in the attacks.</p>
<p>Although a monument to victims in Boston Public Garden gets traffic, dozens of the 2,997 memorial flags planted there ahead of Saturday's anniversary were uprooted by vandals overnight.</p>
<p>"I'm struck by the amnesia that's set in," said James Carroll, a former priest and retired Boston Globe columnist. "All we're left with is the mythology of 9/11. I would have expected better of Boston."</p>
<p>"I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized," said the Braintree, Massachusetts, resident, whose survivor's guilt triggered a 15-year prescription drug addiction.</p>
<p>Buckingham likens her own life to a piece of sea glass.</p>
<p>A bride-to-be lashed out at guests unable to fork out thousands of dollars on flights to her destination wedding, after sending out 150 invites.</p>
<p>A post shared to Reddit by user Bartarton revealed a screenshot of a <a>Facebook</a> post, supposedly from the bride, in which she <a>publicly criticized guests for not RSVPing.</a></p>
<p>The post, uploaded to the forum-led site on Tuesday, is captioned: "Do people like this really exist?"</p>
<p>As $3,000 on flights alone, excluding hotel, gifts, or outfits, is pretty steep, it seems the bride acknowledged this and decided to change the location to make it more accessible—to Hawaii.</p>
<p>"I'm tempted to just elope and not let any of you be a part of our happiest day. This is it guys you have 3 days to respond to our evites or we're deleting you off FB and good luck keeping up with our lives then."</p>
<a>people agreed with the bride's assertion she sounded entitled</a>. It appears the post first surfaced online in 2018, according to searches made on
<a>Google</a>, and it's gone viral again after being shared across social media this week.
<p><a>GiJake68</a> commented: "Will she someday become self aware or forever think posting this was a good idea?"</p>
<p><a>360walkaway</a> reckoned: "Hopefully she'll see a 'eight years ago you posted this' and facepalm through the back of her head."</p>
<p>"I can't imagine her fiancé is pleased about being named twice in this post/rant. I'd be cringing so hard. Hopefully he knows who he's marrying," <a>EarthWyndFyre</a> wrote.</p>
<p><a>480v_bite</a> simply said: "I'd cancel the wedding."</p>
<p><a>GWindborn</a> revealed: "My entire wedding cost less than she wanted people to spend to see her."</p>
<p><a>Kittykittymeowmeow01</a> reckoned: "I actually hope people "reconsider" their rsvp's and then they don't show up."</p>
<p>Doing the math, <a>TheDevilsAdvokaat</a> pointed out: "And she invited 150 people. If she went to each of THEIR weddings, that's a $300k spend at least. But of course, she never would go. She's an entitled egotist."</p>
<p>While <a>PunkSpaceAutist</a> added: "Lmao Hawaii is closer than Thailand but not necessarily cheaper even if the flights are significantly cheaper."</p>
<p>Wedding website The Knot revealed the average spend on a wedding by a guest in 2019 was $430, which rose to $1,400 when flights were included. This figure—which includes the gift—pales in comparison to the $2,000 starting fee for the Hawaiian bash.</p>
<p>The study of 1,000 guests revealed that location had the biggest impact on an invitee's ability to attend.</p>
<p>"Guests who went to an out-of-town wedding spent up to six times more than those who did not travel. Transportation and lodging were cited as the two most expensive (and important) factors to out-of-town guests," the site said.</p>
<p>The site also revealed the average cost of a destination wedding is $32,000, after surveying couples in 2019. That's compared to $28,000 for an average wedding that year, as they noted COVID heavily skewed results for 2020.</p>
<p>"According to our study in 2019, 21 percent of couples got married under what they consider a destination wedding," they said.</p>
<p>The site also shared etiquette advice over how to approach guests who may not be able to make it for health or even financial reasons.</p>
<p>While it's not clear how far in the future the bride-to-be's wedding was, it would appear the three-day response ultimatum indicated she may have had her own deadlines to respond to, for vendors or bookings.</p>
<p>Newsweek approached Bartarton for comment.</p>
<p>Update 9/16/21, 10.20 a.m. ET: This article was updated to clarify that the post originally appeared online in 2018. </p>
<p>Southwest Airlines pilots blamed poor planning for thousands of flights being delayed or cancelled over the weekend, resulting in massive frustration among passengers. No other airlines faced a large number of delays or cancellations.</p>
<p>The company, for its part, pointed to air-traffic control problems and poor weather in Florida.</p>
<p>In a memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Alan Kasher, Southwest's executive vice president of daily operations, said, "To protect our overall network from compounding issues, additional cancellations are occurring today."</p>
<p>The FAA responded in a tweet on Sunday, not naming Southwest Airlines, saying that there were "no FAA air traffic staffing shortages" reported since Friday.</p>
<p>In a statement Saturday, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) pointed to poor planning as the actual cause of the cancellations.</p>
<p>The union said the pilots were "not participating in any official or unofficial job actions."</p>
<p>Only 4 percent of American Airline flights were cancelled Sunday, with 11 percent being delayed. Less than 1 percent of Delta flights—three in total—had been cancelled, with 10 percent being delayed by 5:10 p.m., according to FlightAware.</p>
<p>The cancellations come at a difficult time for the Southwest due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021 alone, U.S. commercial airlines reported $4.3 billion in pre-tax losses, according to Airlines for America, an airline industry advocacy group.</p>
<p>In an October 8 report, the organization warned, "After several months of steady increases, new ticket sales have subsided in large part due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations."</p>
<a>filing a lawsuit and authorizing its workers to demonstrate</a> against the mandate. The union has also authorized $1 million in support of those protests, which could begin this fall.
<p>Newsweek reached out to both Southwest Airlines and the pilots union for comment Sunday afternoon but had not heard back by publication. This story will be updated with any response.</p>

<p>Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights over the weekend, citing air traffic control issues and disruptive weather.</p>
<p>Since Saturday, Southwest has canceled close to 2,400 flights, according to FlightAware data. Cancellations peaked on Sunday when the airline shut down about 30 percent of its flight schedule.</p>
<p>While issues seemed to diminish moving into Monday, customers were still reporting issues as of early Tuesday.</p>
<p>As the airline seeks to return to its normal flight schedule, here's what you need to know about Southwest's cancellation policy and how to redeem refunds or credits if your travel is affected.</p>
<p>Under the Department of Transportation rules: "Airlines are not required to provide passengers with money or other compensation for costs that fall outside of the canceled airline ticket and fees tied directly to the airline ticket."</p>
<p>There are also no federal laws that entitle customers to money or compensation in the case of delayed flights.</p>
<p>However, while airlines in the U.S. are not required to provide compensation compared to its European counterparts, which are subject to tighter air traveler protections, each airline adheres to its own policies.</p>
<p>According to the Southwest's website, full refunds are issued if a flight is canceled for the same reasons the airline cited over the weekend.</p>
<p>"If Southwest Airlines have canceled due to heavy airline traffic, bad weather, or any other reasons, then, passengers will get a full refund amount without any cancellation fee," the website read.</p>
<p>If you are eligible for a refund under the airline's policy, Southwest will transfer the amount on the same bank account used for booking within 7 to 10 working days after a reservation cancelation.</p>
<p>However, refunds for reservations booked on a third-party website may take 20 to 25 business days to credit.</p>
<p>In the case of a flight delay, Southwest says that passengers will receive compensation in the form of a meal and drink voucher or promo code for future bookings.</p>
<p>In most cases, Southwest does not reimburse hotel expenses or travel-related expenses, like car rentals, for customers whose flights are canceled or delayed overnight.</p>
<p>Southwest has recommended affected customers use their self-service option to rebook any flights that were canceled in recent days.</p>
<p>"We're offering customers added flexibility to explore self-service rebooking options on Southwest.com, where they can get updates on the status of their travel," the airline said in a statement.</p>
<p>A Florida woman has been charged with allegedly hacking into a flight school's computer system and authorizing unsafe aircraft to fly in 2020, just months after she left the business.</p>
<p>Derek Fallon, the CEO of Melbourne Flight Training, said he learned about the hack on January 12, 2020 when he logged onto a computer and noticed that there were several errors, WESH-TV, a local television news station, reported Monday.</p>
<p>He noticed that the make, model and tail numbers of 12 airplanes were deleted and that planes previously flagged as having maintenance issues were cleared to fly, WESH reported.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit obtained by WESH, "aircraft which may have been unsafe to fly were purposely made 'airworthy'."</p>
<p>Fallon also said that inspection limitations were deleted, WESH reported. Fallon said that he instructed all flights to be grounded until the correct information could be restored.</p>
<p>"Between the time the data was altered and fixed, it was a situation that could have endangered human life," Fallon said in an affidavit.</p>
<p>Investigators allegedly found that a login belonging to the current flight operations manager was used to alter the status of the planes, but that manager signed an affidavit saying he didn't change information, WESH reported.</p>
<p>Authorities discovered the IP address used to access the software belonged to Lide's father, who reportedly told investigators he "didn't have a clue" why his computer was used to login to the company's software.</p>
