<h1> Tonga volcanic eruption captured in dramatic satellite footage</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 2:16pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 4:31pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Dramatic satellite footage has captured the sheer power of the underwater volcanic eruption near Tonga, showing a monstrous plume of ash and smoke bursting from the ocean’s surface.</p>
<p>The eruption of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano on Saturday was recorded in real-time on an <a>Earth-watching satellite</a> operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>The footage shows plumes of ash, steam and gas exploding like a mushroom cloud over the Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p>The eruption was so powerful that the space satellite not only captured the huge ash cloud, but also an atmospheric shockwave that radiated out from the volcano at close to the speed of sound.</p>
<p>It could be <a>heard some 1,430 miles away in New Zealand</a>, and the tsunami caused waves that were seen as far away as California.</p>
<p>While the tsunami threat receded Sunday, scientists are struggling to monitor the volcano because the explosion destroyed its sea-level crater and drowned its mass — making it invisible to the satellites.</p>
<p>“The concern at the moment is how little information we have and that’s scary,” Janine Krippner, a New Zealand-based volcanologist with the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program, told Reuters. </p>
<p>“When the vent is below water, nothing can tell us what will happen next.”</p>
<p>There are no official reports of injuries or deaths in Tonga as a result of the explosion or tsunami, but the family of a missing British charity worker Angela Glover said Monday <a>that her body had been found</a>. </p>
<p>The family told The Post that Glover was swept away by a tsunami wave as she tried to rescue her dogs. </p>
<h1> Fears arise that lambda COVID-19 variant from Peru may be resistant to vaccines</h1>
<div> July 5, 2021 1:24pm <div> Updated <div> July 6, 2021 9:25am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Scientists fear that a highly contagious new COVID-19 variant that is ravaging Peru may be resistant to vaccines.</p>
<p>The lambda mutation, or C.37, appears to have emerged in Peru last August — and is being blamed for the country having the highest pandemic death rate in the world. </p>
<p>The concerning strain has since spread to around 30 countries, mostly in Latin America — but also as far as the UK, which has recorded at least eight cases, according to government figures.</p>
<p>There are no known cases of the lambda strain in the US, according to <a>the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>In Peru, lambda has accounted for 81 percent of new infections tested for variants since April, <a>according to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>
<p>The South American nation currently has by far the highest mortality rate in the world, <a>according to Johns Hopkins University data</a>.</p>
<p>Lambda was last month <a>declared a variant of interest</a> by the World Health Organization (WHO), which noted that it was “associated with substantive rates of community transmission in multiple countries.”</p>
<p>“Lambda carries a number of mutations” that may have led to “potential increased transmissibility or possible increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies,” the WHO said.</p>
<p>Scientists in Chile — where lambda is blamed for more than a third of the country’s infections — also<a> warned in a recent study</a>, published in a preprint last week, that it appears to evade vaccines better than other strains.</p>
<p>“Our data show for the first time that mutations present in the spike protein of the lambda variant confer escape to neutralizing antibodies and increased infectivity,” wrote the researchers from the University of Chile in Santiago.</p>
<p>That could explain why it has been able to take hold despite Chile “undergoing a massive vaccination program,” the study warned.</p>
<a>told the Financial Times</a>.
<p>At least one of these appears to be shared with the<a> delta variant</a>, making them both highly contagious, he said.</p>
<p>The WHO, however, has stressed that “further studies are … required to validate the continued effectiveness of vaccines” with the new strain.</p>
<h1> Peruvian terrorist leader Abimael Guzman dies in prison</h1>

<div> September 11, 2021 2:48pm <div> Updated <div> September 11, 2021 2:48pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The leader of Peru’s deadliest terrorist group died in prison Saturday, one day before the 29th anniversary of his capture. </p>
<p>An estimated 69,000 people — most of them in indigenous communities in the Andes — were killed between 1980 and 2000.</p>
<p>From their base in the southern city of Ayacucho, Guzman led at first a rag-tag army of peasants armed with machetes. Later, the group placed car bombs throughout Lima and other large cities.</p>
<p>In 1981, the Shining Path hung dozens of dead dogs from lampposts with signs pinned to them, identifying them as “the dogs of capitalism,” </p>

<h1> World’s largest rodents reclaim home, poop on wealthy gated community</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> September 3, 2021 12:34pm <div> Updated <div> September 3, 2021 1:33pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Turns out these giant rat relatives do give a crap about your fancy-shmancy suburban enclave.</p>
<p>However, La Nación has reported that the capy-able creatures, otherwise known as carpinchos in the region, are back with a vengeance to reclaim their homeland — to the detriment of lush landscaping throughout Nordelta.</p>
<p>Nordelta spokesperson Marcelo Canton said in a statement to Reuters that the displaced critters are known to devour gardens, terrorize pet dogs and defecate with wild abandon, though there is “no risk to humans.”</p>
<p>“It’s the other way round: Nordelta invaded the ecosystem of the carpinchos,” said Enrique Viale, Argentine environmental lawyer, in a statement to the Guardian. </p>
<a>according to a Live Science report</a>, as mature female capybaras may spawn as many as 15 pups per year.
<p>Said Canton of the Nordelta community’s demands: “This has provoked anger from some neighbors who are demanding quick and urgent measures to control the capybaras. That is not a solution for today.”</p>
<p>As Viale explained in the Guardian: “As always, it is the poor who end [up] paying the price.”</p>
<a>sound the alarm</a> over human destruction of precious wetlands and their wild inhabitants, some experts and officials agree that the capybara influx may be the new normal for Nordelta — until they find more humane means of population control.
<p>Said Nordelta’s spokesperson, “We want the capybaras to keep living here. We live well with them, we like them but we don’t think there is enough space for them. So we need to stop an increase in the population.”</p>
<h1> Kanye West lists 3,800-acre Wyoming ranch amid Kim Kardashian divorce</h1>
<div> October 11, 2021 5:35pm <div> Updated <div> October 11, 2021 5:47pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Kanye West is getting rid of his over 3,800-acre Wyoming ranch only two years after he purchased it for an estimated $8 million.</p>
<p>The ranch, known as Monster Lake, hit the market on Monday afternoon for $11 million, the Daily Mail first reported.</p>
<p>This marked the first property West purchased in the state before shelling out an additional $14.5 million for a <a>second bigger ranch</a> that spans over 6,700 acres.</p>
<p>The move also comes a year after he went on a Twitter rant about buying property and land.</p>
<p>“We have to evolve,” Kanye tweeted, adding, “Buy property,” “Buy land,” in separate tweets. </p>
<p>It is unclear why West is parting ways with his beloved property. The Post has reached out to his reps for comment. </p>
<p>But his properties in Wyoming have been referred to as the source of contention between West and estranged wife Kim Kardashian, who decided she didn’t want to <a>move to Wyoming</a> full time — as Kanye hoped.</p>
<p>“We love Wyoming, it’s always been such an amazing place,” Kim, 40, told Jimmy Fallon at the time. “My husband did just buy a ranch there, and his dream and his vision is to move there.”</p>
<p>Kardashian <a>filed for divorce in February</a> and their split has yet to be finalized.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 7</div> </div> </div>
<p>Located outside the town of Cody (population 10,000), the ranch has eight lodging units, a restaurant, an event center and a space for meetings.</p>
<p>There are also barns and corrals for horses.</p>
<p>West owns half of Monster Lake Ranch’s acreage and leases the other half from the federal government.</p>
<p>The ranch was also where Kanye worked on his ninth studio album, “Jesus is King.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the artist worked on his 10th studio album “Donda” at his second ranch, Bighorn Mountain Ranch.</p>
<h1> People are horrified by this man’s extremely tiny NYC apartment</h1>
<div> December 21, 2021 5:16pm <div> Updated <div> December 21, 2021 7:46pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>One TikTok user showed the world just how much you actually get for an apartment in New York City’s sought-out West Village neighborhood. </p>
<p>And it’s not much. </p>
<p>“Here is what it’s like living in the smallest apartment in New York,” Webber said. “Whatever your expectations are, lower them.” </p>
<p>He then opens a door to show one simple room, resembling a walk-in closet and spanning about 75 square feet of living space. </p>
<p>“As soon as you walk in the door, you have the sink,” Webber said. “Right next to the sink is, conveniently located, the kitchen.” </p>
<p>Webber — who didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post — then showed his small shelf space for food and outlined how he has “one bowl, one plate.” </p>
<p>“The pantry is absolutely stocked,” he jokingly added. “I just realized that all those foods are carbohydrates and also come in a box. There is no nutritional value here.” </p>
<p>The kitchen appears to be missing a stove and only has a microwave oven and a mini-fridge. </p>
<p>He then pans out to the “living quarters,” as Webber winks and points to his bunk bed, which consists of a queen-sized bed on the bottom and a twin-sized mattress on top.</p>
<p>“I have two beds, but only one me. Some nights I am a queen guy, other nights I am a twin,” he joked.</p>
<p>Webber then turned on a purple lava lamp, adding: “Yeah, that’s what the place was missing.” He also was able to somehow squeeze in an electric piano below the top bunk.</p>
<p>The tour left viewers horrified at just how bad his living situation was. </p>
<p>“I lowered my expectations and still, they were too high,” one user said in the comments section. </p>
<p>But many additionally noticed one important amenity was missing — the bathroom, about which Webber quipped, “did you not see the window,” in response to one viewer’s question. </p>
<p>But, in reality, he has to share a communal bathroom he posted about in a separate <a>Tiktok video.</a> </p>
<p>Sadly, it gets even worse: There is no soap and you have to bring your own toilet paper.</p>
<p>“So, if you forget, you have to do a little waddle back to your room,” Webber explained. </p>
<a>costs around $1,600. </a>However, one TikTok commenter didn’t think any price tag was reasonable, offering, “Whatever you’re paying is too much.”
<p>Webber revealed in a later post that he has only lived in New York for three weeks. </p>

<div> January 4, 2022 1:51pm <div> Updated <div> January 4, 2022 5:10pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>If you’re anything like us, you live for Sunday morning resets which include a great robot vacuum to multi-task, a refresh of the best bed sheets you’ll find and a full-fledged deep clean of your space.</p>
<p>After doing just that — the process of folding clothes and Windexing mirrors (much like a strict S.W.A.T. team training at times) — there’s often a need for more organization bins or better storage options for some random finds.</p>
<p>Here to make tidying up as seamless as can be is The Home Edit, the brand devoted to “reinvent traditional organizing and merge it with design and interior styling.” </p>
<p>Shearer and Teplin explain these Edits are “packaged for a specific space” — for instance, the pantry, bath, laundry and multi-purpose — but are versatile enough to use throughout your home, too. </p>
<p>“We always say that the perfect system needs to be perfect for you, so if the Bath Edit works better in your home office, then, by all means, go for it,” the founders recommend.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the collection, Shearer and Teplin share their top three organization tips to follow while you’re shopping the new products and tidying up your space:</p>
<li>Contain items with designated zones: “This not only makes items easier to find but also holds you accountable when you start exceeding the space,” Teplin said.</li>
<li>Label your categories, or sort by color (which is a labeling system in itself!): “Labels provide a user-friendly road map to where items are found and where they belong,” Shearer said.</li>
<p>What’s more, the dynamic duo behind The Home Edit are continuing to add more products to their shiny new collection as time goes on, which we’re all super excited about.</p>
<p>Ahead, shop the <a>full collection</a>. It’s pretty and packaged for sure, with the purpose of making your space even more refreshed.</p>

<h1> Female dolphins are probably having the best sex</h1>
<div> April 8, 2019 12:03pm </div>
<p>Female dolphins have clitorises just like human women – only theirs are bigger and better placed suggesting they have better sex sessions.</p>
<p>A group of diligent scientists discovered that lady bottlenose dolphins have large and well-developed sex organs meaning they could achieve orgasms.</p>
<p>They said the structure of the tissue suggests the dolphin clitoris may expand, for example, in response to stimulation. Their findings were published in Experimental Biology.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that the skin under the clitoral hood contains “bundles” of nerves that may increase sensitivity and the potential for pleasure, as has been found in the human clitoris.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggest sex plays an important role in social bonding among dolphins, as seen in other social species.</p>
<p>Researchers said that dolphins have sex all year round – even during periods when they cannot conceive.</p>
<p>Sex in the sea “The location of the clitoris near the vaginal opening indicates it can potentially be easily stimulated during copulation.”</p>
<p>She added that further research was needed, including “physiological and behavioral analyses” to categorically confirm whether sex is pleasurable for lady dolphins.</p>
<p>The research team studied 11 dolphins that had died naturally and were collected under a permit authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service in the US.</p>
<p>To explore the anatomy of the dolphin clitoris, they performed dissections, created 3D CT scans, fixed the tissues in paraffin wax and stained them to examine their structure in detail.</p>
<p>They found that dolphins have a clitoral hood where two areas of extensive erectile tissue merge into a single body, shape and structure very similar to the human clitoris.</p>
<p>In both humans and dolphins, the erectile tissue of the clitoris is larger than the clitoral hood.</p>
<p>The researchers said that the thin, folded nature of the skin around the clitoral hood suggests the dolphin clitoris may expand during periods of engorgement and increased sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, the dolphin clitoris is located in a different position relative to the vaginal opening than in humans.</p>
<p>In another contrast with human anatomy, the researchers did not find in the bottlenose dolphins any evidence of a vestibular bulb – an area of erectile tissue that surrounds the vaginal opening in humans and contributes to orgasms.</p>
<p>Orbach added: “Very little is known about female reproductive morphology in most wild vertebrate species.”</p>
<p>“This research provides a comparative framework to explore other functions of sex that may not be unique to humans. We are on the precipice of a deeper understanding of the relationship between form and function of genitalia.”</p>
<p>She is due to present the findings of the study at the American Association of Anatomists annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.</p>

<p>He flipped for her — and died of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Peter the Dolphin was just 6 years old when he fell in love — with a human. The bottlenose dolphin met research assistant Margaret Howe just as the free love movement was emerging in 1965.</p>
<p>Howe was supposed to spend 10 weeks teaching Peter English words, but Peter was more focused on getting to know his teacher in a different way.</p>
<p>Howe and Peter did everything together — eating, sleeping, bathing and playing — as part of a NASA experiment that aimed to teach Peter to speak through his blowhole.</p>
<p>About four weeks into the experiment, Howe wrote in her diary: “Peter has become sexually aroused several times during the week.”</p>
<p>“I did have a very close encounter with — I can’t even say ‘a dolphin’ again — Peter.”</p>
<p>In the trailer for the documentary, Howe explains that she would masturbate Peter to keep him focused, otherwise he did not pay attention to her lessons.</p>
<p>“It would just become part of what was going on, like an itch, just get rid of that, scratch it and we’ll be done and move on.”</p>
<p>After the experiment ended and the lab was closed, Peter was shipped back to Lilly’s lab in Miami and his health quickly deteriorated.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Peter committed suicide, with veterinarian Andy Williamson ruling his cause of death a broken heart.</p>
<p>“Margaret could rationalize it, but when she left, could Peter?” Williamson said. “Here’s the love of his life gone.”</p>

<h1> Can dolphins take over the world? Study says dolphins can solve problems like humans</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> August 9, 2013 8:39pm </div>
<p>GRASSY KEY, Fla. — A dog may be man’s best friend, but dolphins can imitate human actions, and even how they solve problems.</p>
<p>When a dolphin has one of its senses blocked, it can use other senses to mimic a human’s movements, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelly Jaakkola, research director of the nonprofit marine mammal center, said researchers were surprised by Tanner’s use of echolocation.</p>
<p>“He outsmarted us,” Jaakola said.</p>
<p>She explained that dolphins must decide when to use echolocation, “and that’s problem-solving.”</p>
<p>Janet Mann, a professor of biology and psychology at Georgetown University who was not involved in the study, said the results were not surprising in that they were consistent with how dolphins act in the ocean.</p>
<p>“Of course they would use their echolocation to get more information. Dolphins have to solve problems all the time in the wild,” she said, adding that dolphins use echolocation more at night as well.</p>
<p>Tanner was just as accurate at imitating a human — blindfolded or not — as he was at imitating another dolphin, researchers determined. The study included six sessions spread over a nine-day period.</p>
<p>Further testing is needed to see if other dolphins can imitate as well as Tanner.</p>
<p>“But we have no reason to believe that this dolphin was just an Einstein dolphin that did this,” she said.</p>

<p>After <a>Omicron made its debut in Dec. 2021</a>, society quickly caught onto the most <a>common symptoms</a>: cough, fatigue and tiredness, congestion and runny nose, headache and sore throat.</p>
<p>While it’s not a life-changing fix, a humidifier is a great device to soothe sore throats for COVID-19 infections, the common cold and beyond.</p>
<h2>What do humidifiers do?</h2>
<a>Mayo Clinic</a>, humidifiers are devices that release water vapor or steam to add moisture to the air (humidity) to prevent dryness in many parts of the body. They can be particularly effective for the skin, nose, lips and throat.
<h2>How do I clean a humidifier? </h2>
<p>There are a few different ways to clean a humidifier, but CR advises using water and distilled white vinegar. Here are a few specific steps to get the job done.</p>
<li>Remove the tank from the base and add either 1 cup of vinegar or ½ cup each of vinegar and water to the well of the base.</li>
<li>Reach into the crevices and scrub in the well using a toothbrush, cotton swabs, or another gentle cleaning tool. Rinse until no vinegar smell remains and then towel dry. </li>
<li>Pour 1 cup each of vinegar and water into the tank. Cap the tank and let it soak for 20 minutes, swishing or shaking periodically. Pour out solution and rinse until no smell remains, then towel dry. </li>

<h1> Caraway Cookware fry pan review: non-stick, durable and cost-effective</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 2:49pm Updated </div>
<p>No matter how often I use this pan (at least once a day!) it still manages to look and work the exact same way as it did when I first opened the box. </p>
<a>Walmart</a>. But this durable kitchen workhorse is bound to last you much longer and give you an edge with all kinds of cooking.
<p>It comes in a variety of colors, too! Choose from grey, white, navy, green and more.</p>
<a>Caraway’s entire set </a>which features the fry pan,
<a>sauté pan</a>. Plus, it comes with a magnetic pan rack and a canvas lid holder to keep your cookware in tip-top shape.
<p>After years of struggling with dried out pans, I bought this set for my mom on her birthday and she loved Caraway so much that threw out all of her older (more expensive) cookware. </p>
<p>While I don’t yet own the entire set, I also have the <a>sauté pan</a> which is great for larger dishes like stir fry or recipes with stock. </p>
