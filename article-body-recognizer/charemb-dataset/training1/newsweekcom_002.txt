<p>Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn said only 500 employees have not been vaccinated against the virus and at least 95.7 percent of employees are fully vaccinated or have an accommodation, NBC News reported.</p>
<p>Some health care systems such as Clevland Clinic, consisting of 19 hospitals, chose to pause the vaccination policy. About 85 percent of employees are vaccinated, said a spokesperson.</p>
<a>NBC</a> News. "In this environment, it's very tough, especially in jobs like health care or other industries where it's a very tight labor market."
<p>However, other companies are choosing the keep their mandates in place. Southwest Airlines told their employees their vaccination policy is not changing and they need to be vaccinated by January 4,<a> the Wall Street Journal reported.</a></p>
<p>Boeing's statement cited "over 92 percent of the company's U.S.-based workforce having registered as being fully vaccinated or having received a religious or medical accommodation."</p>
<p>Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal, who is vaccinated, told the newspaper he still wants "to encourage every one of our workforce to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>Pointing to how critical vaccination is for hope of a global air travel recovery, Deal added that "the world, and the airline industry, will recover under vaccination."</p>

<p>Under the new rule, mileage standards would be raised beginning in the 2023 model year so that new vehicles could hit the 40 mpg target by 2026. The Trump administration-era rule targeted raising vehicle mileage standards to 32 mpg by 2026.</p>
<p>The Biden administration's goal is 25 percent higher than that of his predecessor, and 5 percent higher than an August proposal from the EPA.</p>
<p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan said that the new rule was "a giant step forward" for President Joe Biden's climate goals.</p>

<p>Biden has set a goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030 as he pushes a history-making shift in the U.S. from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>Environmental and public health groups mostly hailed the new rules, while the trade association representing most major automakers reacted cautiously.</p>

<p>Aviation executives expressed their fears Monday that the potential coming deployment of 5G wireless technology could harm the airline industry.</p>
<p>"5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate," the letter stated, adding that the rollout of the technology could have "an enormous negative impact on the aviation industry."</p>
<p>Both ATT and Verizon are planning to deploy C-band spectrum 5G wireless networks across the United States on Jan. 5.</p>
<p>The technology was originally slated to go online in November, but the companies agreed to push the date into 2022 after concerns were cited, and now the airline executives are hoping to slide that date even further down the calendar.</p>
<p>The airplane manufacturers, who are typically considered direct competitors, came together in a rare show of unity to voice concerns that the 5G initiative could lead to numerous delays at airports throughout the country.</p>
<p>The pair of companies represent the vast majority of the airplanes built for commercial aviation use, and they also have a large market share of military aircraft.</p>
<p>The letter from Boeing and Airbus cited a statistic from trade group Airlines for America, which stated that if 5G had been in effect in 2019, it would've resulted in the delay or cancellation of 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights.</p>
<p>The sentiment from the airline executives echoed a report released Dec. 7 from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that said 5G technology could lead to scheduling problems and safety issues in the skies.</p>
<p>After issuing its report, the FAA went on to present a pair of airworthiness directives that would prohibit aircraft from operating certain radio functions while in the area of 5G signals.</p>
<p>"Because radio altimeter anomalies that are undetected by the aircraft automation or pilot, particularly close to the ground ... could lead to loss of continued safe flight and landing," one of the directives stated.</p>
<p>However, the FAA later issued a statement in which it said that the "expansion of 5G and aviation will safely co-exist."</p>
<p>The communications giant added that it was taking "additional steps to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations."</p>

<p>Hospitality businesses in the United Kingdom could soon receive some much-needed assistance as the Omicron coronavirus strain continues to spread.</p>
<p>"The open/close strategy is crucifying businesses," said Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association. "Every pound of help is much needed. But this package is far too little and borders on the insulting."</p>
<p>While the government's scientific advisers have recommended further restrictions on businesses and social interactions, the government has been reluctant to order a lockdown in part because of the cost to the public purse.</p>
<p>Instead, Johnson is betting vaccines will be his savior, urging everyone to get booster shots to slow the spread of Omicron.</p>
<p>Even if it is milder, the new variant could still overwhelm health systems because of the sheer number of infections. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.K. have surged by 60 percent in a week as Omicron overtook Delta as the dominant variant.</p>
<p>Businesses argue that the uncertainty alone is wreaking havoc on their companies. Nathan Godley of restaurant supplier Premier Seafoods told the <a>BBC</a> that what he wanted was an idea on how to plan a week in advance.</p>
<p>"Fish doesn't just go from the boat to the restaurant,'' he said. "There's quite a few of us in this supply chain in between, and we all need to know what is happening."</p>

<p>A video purports to show two Delta Air Lines passengers in a brawl aboard a flight from Los Angeles, California to Memphis, Tennessee after one of the men reportedly upset others on the plane by being loud and not wearing a face mask.</p>
<a>amid the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The eyewitness reportedly said the man had been drinking and had been loud before the altercation.
<p>After about 20 seconds, some other passengers intervene. They successfully manage to pull the men apart as a man in an Italia shirt steps between them.</p>
<p>"Guys, break it up. Be calm man. Chill!" the man in the Italia shirt tells them. Other passengers can be heard saying "thank you guys" to those who intervened.</p>
<p>According to TMZ, the two men were not met by police upon arrival in Tennessee. They reportedly were both seen at baggage claim before going their separate ways for the holidays.</p>
<a>NBC</a> News reported. But as of the spring, the number of incidents reported in 2021 had surged to some 1,300 — even though fewer people were flying due to the pandemic.

<p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Seattle to Shanghai was forced to turn around midair last week after the Shanghai airport implemented new lengthy cleaning requirements related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Delta said in an email statement on Monday that the new cleaning procedures at Shanghai Pudong International Airport "require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta."</p>
<p>As a result, some passengers on the nearly 13-hour flight were left with expired U.S. visas and COVID-19 test results, Chinese media reported.</p>
<p>China requires travelers to have a negative PCR and antibody test within 48 hours of the flight. Passengers must have two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks before traveling and show proof upon arrival, CNN reported.</p>
<p>The Chinese consulate in San Francisco said in a statement on Sunday that several flights leaving from the U.S. to China had been canceled or delayed recently and one flight was turned back more than halfway but did not specifically name Delta.</p>

<p>United, Delta and JetBlue have canceled more than 300 flights on Christmas Eve, sending travel plans into chaos on one of the busiest days of the winter holiday season.</p>
<p>United and Delta have so far canceled at least 280 flights collectively, while 49 flights under JetBlue have been grounded, as cases of the new and highly transmissible Omicron variant continue to surge nationwide.</p>
<p>Earlier, United, the third-largest airline in the world, <a>issued a statement</a> saying it had canceled 112 Christmas Eve flights out of caution, citing the surge in Omicron infections.</p>
<p>"We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays," the statement said.</p>
<p>Since then, the airline's cancelations have risen to 166.</p>
<p>In a similar statement, Delta Airlines announced that it had canceled 82 flights on Christmas Eve, also citing the rapid increase in Omicron cases across the country.</p>
<p>Delta has now grounded at least 115, flights, according to Flight Aware.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for <a>American Airlines</a>, one of the world's largest airlines, told Newsweek on Thursday that "American Airlines is not currently seeing anything out of the ordinary in relation to Christmas Eve."</p>
<p>It serves as the latest blow to travelers this holiday season. It comes as the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus on Monday <a>became the dominant source of new infections in the U.S.</a></p>
<p>According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the variant now accounts for roughly 73 percent of new infections nationwide,</p>
<p>The Omicron variant was designated by the World Health Organization as a "variant of concern" on November 26, and has since been reported in some 90 countries.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas weekend, thousands of flights were canceled because of inclement weather and staffing shortages resulting from surging coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>On Sunday, there were 3,274 cancellations and 16,305 delays, according to flight-tracking platform FlightAware.</p>
<p>Delta Air Lines said in a Sunday statement that "winter weather in portions of the U.S. and the omicron variant continued to impact Delta's holiday weekend flight schedule."</p>
<p>Delta said that of the airline's 4,155 flights on Sunday, 161 had been canceled and 40 more cancellations were expected. "Delta expects that around 40 flights may be canceled Monday," the airline said.</p>
<p>For the previous two days, Delta said over 500 flights were canceled because of the spread of Omicron, which has now been detected in every U.S. state.</p>
<p>Other airlines, such as United, American and JetBlue, were forced to cancel flights because of the rise in Omicron cases among staff.</p>
<p>An United Airlines spokesperson told Newsweek that among the 4,000 flights scheduled for Monday, 115 were canceled "due to Omicron staffing issues."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for JetBlue told Newsweek that the airline canceled 66 Monday flights because of staffing problems</p>
<p>"Despite our best efforts, we've had to cancel a number of flights, and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more Omicron community spread," the JetBlue spokesperson said.</p>
<p>An <a>American Airlines</a> spokesperson told Newsweek that "a number of COVID-related sick calls led us to make the difficult decision to precancel some flights scheduled for today."</p>
<p>The statement continued, "We proactively notified affected customers yesterday and are working hard to rebook them quickly. We never want to disappoint our customers and apologize for any disruptions to their holiday travel plans."</p>
<p>CNBC obtained a message to United Airlines pilots sent by Bryan Quigley, the senior vice president of flight operations, which said, "Our current pilot Covid-19 case count is on the rise."</p>
