<h1>White House turned down plan in October to boost COVID testing: report</h1>
<h2>White House set to expand at-home access to COVID testing kits</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>The White House in October turned down a proposal that would have added more than 730 million at-home <a>COVID</a> tests to the market per month, according to a report this week.</p>
<p>But the White House rejected the Oct. 22 bid and three days later announced it would seek to bolster rapid home testing through the "FDA’s regulatory approval process."</p>
<p><a>CNN REPORTER KNOCKS BIDEN OVER INTERVIEW ON COVID TEST SHORTAGES: HE 'SEEMS CONFUSED'</a></p>

<p>An administration official present at the October meeting told the publication that the decision was based on the fact that the U.S. "did not have capacity to manufacture over-the-counter tests at that scale."</p>
<p>The problem with bolstering at-home testing was down to the fact that the FDA had only approved a handful of testing kits and the ability to drastically increase manufacturing of the kits was reportedly limited. </p>
<p>But the announcement by President Biden earlier this week shows a change in the administration’s priority as COVID cases are again on the rise nationwide.</p>
<p>Starting in January 2022, the White House will launch a website that will allow Americans to order free at-home testing kits. </p>
<p>The move is in response to recent shortages in at-home testing kits and long lines to get tested during the holiday season. </p>
<p>"I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion [tests] two months ago, before COVID hit here," Biden said during a Wednesday interview with ABC News.</p>

<p>PSAKI ASKED 'WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK' TO ORDER COVID TESTS EARLIER, BLAMES LACK OF DEMAND EARLIER THIS YEAR</p>
<p>But comments made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki earlier this year suggest the administration had prematurely dismissed the idea. </p>
<p>"Should we just send one to every American?" she scoffed from the podium in answer to questions over increased access to testing kits.</p>
<p>"Then what happens if you—if every American has one test? How much does that cost, and then what happens after that?" she added. </p>
<p>But following the president’s announcement, Psaki indicated she regretted her comments.</p>

<p>"I would say there's not a day that goes by that I don't leave this podium and wish I would have said something with greater context or more precision or additional information," she said earlier this week.</p>
<p>"Going back, I wish I would have done that," she added. </p>
<p>Fox News could not immediately reach the White House for comment. </p>

<h1>Democrats sold the Build Back Better 'fully funded' lie based on budget gimmicks</h1>
<h2>Instead of cutting programs out of their bill, Democrats aimed to hide the real costs of their full agenda</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Progressives attack Manchin for spending bill rejection</a></h4> <p>Congressional Correspondent Aisha Hasnie reports on the growing tensions between Democrats and Sen. Manchin over Build Back Better rejection.</p></div></div>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>For months, Democrats sold a lie to the nation: that their multi-trillion dollar "Build Back Better" welfare spending agenda would be "fully paid for." </p>
<p>This month, that lie collapsed, and with West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin's withdrawal from negotiations with <a>President Joe Biden</a>, the bill has been shelved—for now. </p>
<p><a>TEAM BIDEN WILL PAY A HEFTY PRICE FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON MANCHIN</a></p>
<p>A similar sunset applied to one of the bill’s signature programs, an expanded child tax credit to cover non-working families, including illegal immigrants. </p>
<p><a>JOE MANCHIN TURNED HIS BACK ON MOST OF AMERICA WHEN HE DERAILED BUILD BACK BETTER</a></p>
<p>This expanded child tax credit, now made refundable to families without tax liability, converts the benefit into a permanent welfare program. However, without the artificial sunset, the proposal would have exploded the bill’s budget score. </p>
<p>So instead, Democrats pretended it was a temporary program, hoping that Manchin and their allies in the media would acquiesce. </p>
<p>Washington budgeting can be complicated, but a sunset gimmick is simple arithmetic. Congress estimates legislative costs using ten-year scoring windows. </p>
<p>A program with a sunset is counted as ending prematurely. Hence, a "sunset" five-year program counts against ten years of taxes, even if the program is likely to be reauthorized to continue beyond its initial termination date. </p>
<p><a>MANCHIN'S 'NO' REVEALS A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS FOR THE DEMOCRAT PARTY</a></p>
<p>Once enacted, programs like their camouflaged welfare spending would likely have become permanently entrenched in the federal budget, financed either by higher deficits or by greater tax burdens on working families. </p>
<p>That’s $3 trillion in future taxes Democrats refused to identify or $3 trillion in future deficit spending in an economy already reeling from crippling inflation taxes on Americans’ savings. </p>
<p>It was a fiction too great a lie to sustain. </p>

<h1>Christmas 2021: Where in the United States is having a white Christmas?</h1>
<h2>Rocky Mountains hit by much-needed snow, Midwest seeing a green Christmas</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a>Christmas</a> they're used to after a warm start to the
<a>winter</a>, but Americans in part of more than 20 states will spend their Christmas Day in the
<a>Snow Miser's</a> favored conditions.
<p>According to the National Weather Service, "A white Christmas is defined as having 1 inch or more of snow on the ground Christmas morning." And after a couple of major storms in recent days, parts of the West will have a lot more snow than that. </p>
<p><a>FLORIDA SECRETARY OF STATE SHARES SURPRISING DETAILS ABOUT AMERICA'S FIRST CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION</a></p>
<p>The Rocky Mountains in Colorado are having a badly-needed white Christmas after a major storm hit the area Thursday and Friday, according to a map of snow depth by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). </p>

<p>The ski resorts there saw a very slow start to the winter but are expected to see more snow after between a foot and two feet of snow fell in the last two days. </p>
<p>Another storm hit Idaho, Wyoming and western Montana this week, bringing a white Christmas to many in that region. </p>

<p>Much of the northeast is having a white Christmas too. That includes all of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and most of New York. Most of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are snow-covered too. </p>
<p>Some areas in northeastern South Dakota also have snow, but most of that state is having the <a>Heat Miser's</a> favorite kind of Christmas, as is Texas, Oklahoma and all the Southeast.</p>

<h2>'Let's go, Brandon, I agree,' Biden responded</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Dad tells Biden, 'Let's go Brandon' during Christmas Eve call</a></h4> <p>Jared from Oregon told President Biden, 'Let's go Brandon' during a call with NORAD officials and children on Christmas Eve. </p></div></div>
<p>Things went off script when President Biden and first lady Jill Biden spoke with children and NORAD officials who are tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>A dad who identified as Jared from Oregon closed his family's call with the Bidens by saying, "<a>Let's go, Brandon</a>," a phrase that disparages the president. </p>
<p>The phrase became an internet sensation when fans at a NASCAR race chanted "F--- Joe Biden." A reporter who was interviewing driver Brandon Brown live on air seemed to think that the crowd was chanting "Let's go, Brandon." </p>
