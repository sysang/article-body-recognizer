<div><div><p><b>* </b><a><b>Winter weather advisory</b></a><b> 9 tonight through 7 a.m. Friday *</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Snow set to arrive within about an hour of midnight and end between 4 and 5 a.m.</li>
<li>A brief burst of heavier snow is possible between about 1 and 3 a.m.; roads will become slick as temperatures fall below freezing.</li>
<li>Accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are most probable (see map under “amounts” section below); we expect some school delays and cancellations Friday morning.</li>
<div><div><p><b>5:45 p.m. — Light snow arrives in western Maryland and eastern panhandle of West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be posted around 7:30 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4:10 p.m. — Forecast is on track as snow spreads into West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Radar shows snow falling over most of Kentucky and West Virginia as the storm system sweeps eastward. The snow is still set to arrive in our area between around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., or maybe a little later in our eastern areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Gillian Brockell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 20, 2019</div></div>
<div><div><p>Chief Standing Bear just wanted to bury his son at home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The teenager, on his deathbed, told his dad he was worried that if his bones were not buried with his ancestors, then he would be alone in the afterlife, according to biographer Stephen Dando-Collins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So in January 1879, Standing Bear left Oklahoma’s Indian Territory for Nebraska with his child’s remains.</p></div></div>
<p>That act of grief and love set in motion a chain of events that would make Standing Bear a civil rights hero. On Wednesday, he was honored with a statue representing the state of Nebraska in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall.</p>
<div><div><p>Standing Bear was born sometime between 1829 and 1834 in the Ponca tribe’s native lands in northern Nebraska. A natural leader, he became a chief at a young age, according to the <a>Nebraska History Museum</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>By 1858, the Poncas were forced to cede most of their land except for a small area by the Niobrara River, where they became farmers rather than buffalo hunters. But they did well, growing corn and trading with white settlers often.</p></div>
<div><p>Ten years later, as described by Dee Alexander Brown in the classic “<a>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</a>,” the remaining Ponca land was mistakenly included in a treaty between the United States and the Sioux tribes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Standing Bear and his burial party evaded capture while they traveled home but were caught and detained after visiting relatives at the Omaha reservation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The man who caught them, Brig. Gen. George Crook, had been fighting Native Americans for decades, Brown wrote, but he was moved by Standing Bear’s reasons for leaving the Indian Territory and promised to help him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Crook went to the media, which spread the story of the plight of Standing Bear and his fellow prisoners nationwide. Then two lawyers offered to take up their case pro bono, and asked a judge to free the Poncas immediately.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though Crook was sympathetic to Standing Bear, since he was the official carrying out the federal government’s orders to detain them, the civil rights case that resulted was called <i>Standing Bear v. Crook</i>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. attorney <a>argued</a> that Standing Bear was neither a citizen nor a person, and as such did not have standing to sue the government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the landmark decision from the judge, his <a>opinion</a> still drips with prejudice, calling Native Americans a “weak, insignificant, unlettered, and generally despised race.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>George Washington owned slaves and ordered Indians killed. Will a mural of that history be hidden?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Standing Bear returned to the land by the Niobrara River and buried his son alongside his ancestors. When he died there in 1908, he was buried alongside them, too.</p></div></div>
<div><p>(This provision is also why there are at least eight <a>statues of Confederates</a> in the Capitol. Neither Congress nor the Architect of the Capitol has the power to remove them; it must be done by the states that sent the statues.)</p></div>
<div><div><p>In recent years, Nebraska lawmakers voted to replace both statues. Bryan was replaced by Chief Standing Bear; soon, Morton will be replaced by a statue of author Willa Cather.</p></div></div>
<a>said</a> it was an honor to recognize “one of the most important civil rights leaders in our country that almost nobody knows about.
<div><div><p>“And we hope to be able to correct that today and tell his story,” Ricketts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>How statues of Robert E. Lee and other Confederates got into the U.S. Capitol</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Powhatan and his people: The 15,000 American Indians shoved aside by Jamestown’s settlers</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>This Native American inscription was found deep inside a cave. Two centuries later, scholars think they understand its meaning.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>George Washington owned slaves and ordered Indians killed. Will a mural of that history be hidden?</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>On Christmas Day 1941, crooner Bing Crosby stepped up to the microphone to introduce his new song. He was performing live on his hugely popular national radio show on NBC, “Kraft Music Hall.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the orchestra began to play, Crosby’s calming baritone floated over the airwaves: “I’m dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones I used to know …”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of course, “White Christmas” would become the biggest-selling single of all time. According to Guinness World Records, it has sold some 50 million copies worldwide, with another 50 million in album sales.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Edward Warren was a young doctor in the early 1850s when he first witnessed it. Later in life, he described what he saw at Christmastime among the enslaved population at Somerset Place, one of the largest plantations in North Carolina.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I was convinced from the first that it was of foreign origin,” he wrote, “based on some festive ceremony which the negroes had inherited from their African ancestors.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>There really was a war on Christmas. It was waged by Christians.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“What they’re doing is they’re forcing Whites for a short while to immerse themselves in Black culture,” May said. “There was something very satisfying about that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If someone didn’t give the requisite coins or gifts, the revelers sang a song whose words amounted to, “Oh this poor guy, he’s so broke he can’t even afford to give us spare change,” May said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In the 1970s, the Mashpee Wampanoag sued to reclaim some of their land, but they lost, in part because a federal judge said they weren’t then officially recognized as a tribe.</p></div></div>
<p>The Mashpee Wampanoag filed for federal recognition in the mid-1970s, and more than three decades later, in 2007, they were granted that status. (The Gay Head Aquinnah on nearby<b> </b>Martha’s Vineyard are also federally recognized.)</p>

<div><div><p>Paula Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag who is an author and educator on Native American history, said the Interior Department’s decision last week was “huge” for her people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A lot of us were quietly holding our despair and not really trying to think about it,” Peters said. “We have been at this for so long.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“I was a teenager when my father was then chairman of the tribe and filed suit to recover our land. We have been at this for nearly 50 years. It’s kind of unbelievable when you look at what was promised us and how it was taken.”
<div><div><p>In its 55-page decision, the Interior Department cited several examples of how the tribe had long been under federal jurisdiction, one of the factors in deciding whether to keep its land in federal trust.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Arthur, did you have a nice weekend?” Betty White asked Arthur Duncan.<b> </b>The entertainer, in her early 30s at the time, was center stage, speaking to the young Black tap dancer seated on her right.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I did something a little different,” Duncan told her. “I rehearsed with a choral group that’s going to do Christmas carols this Christmas.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Oh, wonderful,” White said. “Are you going to go house to house?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His reply to her — that they would be performing at local hospitals and orphanages — was as wholesome as the beloved actress and entertainer, who died this week at 99.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Goodbye to Betty White, popular culture’s beloved (and saucy) great-grandma</p></div>
<div><div><p>Her response?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Live with it.”</p></div></div>
<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision banning segregated schools. As in, before the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Little Rock Nine and the Greensboro, N.C., lunch-counter sit-ins.
<div><div><p>Television was still a new medium, but White was already a veteran performer of stage and radio, had acted on a sitcom and had co-hosted a Los Angeles daytime talk show.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So on her nationally televised “The Betty White Show,” she sang, interviewed guests, performed in skits and read the commercials live. There was even a regular children’s segment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And there was Duncan. At 21, the California native had been performing in a dance quartet for years and was looking for his big break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White gave it to him, he recounted in the 2018 documentary “<a>Betty White: First Lady of Television</a>.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The first TV show I had ever been on, and I credit Betty White for really getting me started in show business, in television,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And all through the South, there was this whole ruckus,” White remembered in the doc. “They were going to take our show off the air if we didn’t get rid of Arthur, because he was Black.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People in the South resented me being on the show, and they wanted me thrown out,” Duncan agreed. “But there was never a question at all.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I said, ‘I’m sorry, but, you know, he stays,’ ” she said.<b> </b>“‘Live with it.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Betty White, one of the most endearing and enduring faces on television, dies at 99</p></div>
<div><div><p>Duncan appeared on the show at least three times. On <a>another episode</a>, White interviewed a Black child during the children’s segment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s unclear whether her decision to keep Duncan affected the show’s fate, but it was repeatedly rescheduled for different time slots before quietly being taken off the air that same year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White went on to game shows, the talk-show circuit and eventually mega-stardom as Rose Nylund on the 1980s sitcom “The Golden Girls.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Duncan later toured with Bob Hope and appeared on “The Lawrence Welk Show” for nearly two decades. Decades later, in the doc, he was still in awe of her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She was just magnificent,” he said.</p></div></div>

<p>On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that if Republicans continue to block a voting rights bill, the chamber would vote on changes to filibuster rules. Then he set a deadline for the vote: Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>

<div><div><p>But the context in which King shared his views on the filibuster is the same one in which the Senate now finds itself: amid battles over voting rights legislation.</p></div></div>
<a>President John F. Kennedy had pitched it</a> a month earlier in a speech to the American people, saying he wanted to end racial segregation in public accommodations and to strengthen voting rights.

<div><div><p>Toward the end, William Workman of the State, a Columbia, S.C., newspaper, brought up Kennedy’s civil rights bill. Would King, he asked, be amenable to bringing Kennedy’s proposals to a national referendum?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Well, this would certainly be all right with me, because I think the vast majority of people in the United States would vote favorably for such a bill,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was that way “all throughout the South,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a ‘Made in the USA’ supply chain crisis</h1><h2>Shipping lines flock to Asia-to-U.S. trade lanes at expense of many developing nations.</h2></div>

<div><div><p>As the world’s largest cargo ships rush to the United States with all the clothes, furniture, toys and electronics that American consumers might want, Aditya Awtani is feeling neglected.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>he needs to make clothes in his high-ceilinged factory in Mombasa, Kenya.
<div><div><p>The shipping headaches, along with freight costs that have nearly quadrupled, are carving a hole in his profits, straining his relations with customers and threatening his 5,800 employees’ jobs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There are days when I walk into the factory and I see workers with their arms folded because the containers have not come, which is a very depressing sight to see,” Awtani said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America's Broken Supply Chain</p></div>
<div><p>As supply chains strain, some corporations rewrite production playbook</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Africa, sadly, I can’t think of any other continent that is last on the rung. Africa will be the last to come out of this,” Awtani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The resulting port congestion means it takes longer for each cargo ship, some carrying nearly 18,000 shipping containers, to make the round trip between China and the United States’ West Coast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at a time when more ships are needed, Africa is seeing fewer, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which tracks worldwide port calls by all types of vessels.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How crazed is the used car market? This auction sparked a frenzy over two-year-old minivan</p></div>
<div><div><p>African nations, including Kenya, Guinea, Angola and Namibia, also lost direct connections to some foreign countries, leaving their shippers reliant upon more expensive services that connect through a third port.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The rich countries are the least impacted,” said Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group. “We see delays in getting some products. It’s not that we don’t get the products.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>David Malpass, president of the World Bank, this fall said per-person income was growing 10 times as fast in the advanced economies as in the developing world, where the economic outlook is “grim.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Redeployment of tonnage never led to shortages,” Jan Tiedemann, senior shipping line and port analyst for Alphaliner, said. “The difference this time around is the market is sold out. There’s no more ships.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The number of container ships calling at African ports fell 2 percent during the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2019, according to UNCTAD.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But that figure masks differences among regions and vessel sizes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Including the smaller ships that are more common in many parts of Africa, Mombasa is still receiving as many vessels as it was two years ago, according to the Kenya Ports Authority, a state corporation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet ultimately, the number of vessels calling at a port is not as important economically as the amount of cargo moving through it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the third quarter, the port handled 7 percent fewer containers than it did during the same period in 2019, KPA said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>If shipping were more reliable, Awtani said, he would increase his weekly container order by 25 percent.
<div><div><p>Vessels that originate in Shanghai, able to hold almost 30,000 TEUs, are already full when they reach Colombo. So they skip the port, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They view the priority as USA for cargo,” added Dayananda, whose factories supply U.S. brands including Victoria’s Secret.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For competitive reasons, most carriers provide little public detail about specific deployment decisions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Carriers have redeployed ships according to where rates are the highest,” said Tiedemann. “It’s a big game of musical chairs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two-thirds of the roughly 70 vessels stuck outside the top U.S. import gateway in Southern California belong to those smaller carriers, according to Gene Seroka, executive director of the port of Los Angeles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many of the new players sail from China without a reservation at a L.A. terminal and thus go to the end of the floating queue. Some are ships that freight forwarders charter for big retailers such as Walmart or Home Depot.</p></div></div>
<p>Like many African economies, Kenya imports several times as many containers as it exports. Traditionally, that meant there were plenty of empties available for the country’s exporters to ship coffee, tea and apparel to foreign customers.</p>
<div><div><p>The supply chain disruptions are also making themselves felt on Nairobi’s Biashara Street, where shopkeepers decry high freight costs, shipping delays and the resultant price increases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kenya’s inflation rate has topped<b> </b>6 percent for the past five months, the longest it’s been above that mark in four years, according to the Central Bank of Kenya.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><a>National</a></div></div><h1>Tracking U.S. covid-19 cases, deaths and other metrics by state</h1><h2>More than 000,000 people have died from coronavirus in the U.S., and more than 00,000,000 cases have been reported.</h2></div>

<p>No numbers can fully convey the state of the covid-19 pandemic in the United States, but several metrics taken together provide a clearer view of what is happening now and what may be coming soon.</p>
<a>Department of Health and Human Services</a> (hospitalization and testing) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (vaccinations). Not all tracking sites use the same sources or report dates, so case and death numbers can differ.

<div><div><p>Showing data for</p><div><div><div><div>the U.S.</div></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><textarea/></div></div></div>
<div><h3>Cases in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average case rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>
<div><h4>New reported cases per day </h4><p>At least have been reported since Feb. 29, 2020.</p><p>7-day average cases</p><div>Loading data...</div><div><label>Show full anomaly values</label></div><p>Data as of ET.</p></div>
<p>The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a warning: If cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. However, areas with little testing probably will appear to have fewer cases regardless of how rampant the virus may be.</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average is the best way to view trends in new cases, because more than half of states don’t report new data every day. That is why certain days of the week show up as consistently higher or lower than others.</p>
<div><h3>Covid-related deaths in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average death rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>
<div><h4>New deaths reported per day </h4><p>At least have been reported since Feb. 29, 2020.</p><p>7-day average deaths</p><div>Loading data...</div><div><label>Show full anomaly values</label></div><p>Data as of ET.</p></div>
<p>Health officials believe the virus has killed more people than state totals indicate, especially early in the pandemic before testing and effective treatments were widely available.</p>
<p>A rise in deaths usually follows a rise in new cases by about a month. For example, after the delta variant caused a surge of new cases beginning in July 2021, the death toll began to climb in August.</p>
<p>As with the new cases chart, occasional single-day anomalies reflect one-time adjustments by states. They are noted but not included in the seven-day averages.</p>
<div><h3>Hospitalizations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Reported covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Currently hospitalized</div><div> Filled ICU beds</div></div></div>
<p>A rise in hospitalizations tends to follow a rise in new cases by a couple of weeks.</p>
<div><h3>Vaccinations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Doses of covid-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Reported doses administered per day</div></div><div>See more detailed vaccination statistics for each state in the Vaccine Tracker.</div></div>
<p>The vaccine rollout beginning in December 2020 was limited and chaotic, but free vaccines are now widely available and recommended for everyone age 5 and older. The CDC also recommends booster shots for many people.</p>
<p>Note: Fully vaccinated shows people who have completed vaccination, either through both doses of a two-dose vaccine, or a single dose of a one-dose vaccine.</p>
<div><h3>Tests reported</h3></div>
<div><h4>Tests reported per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Positive tests</div><div> Negative tests</div></div><p>Note: Data is preliminary. The most recent days are frequently revised upward.</p></div>
<p>Testing was slow to ramp up in 2020, but it has become more robust, so the rate of positive tests is another clue to the concentration of the coronavirus in an area.</p>
