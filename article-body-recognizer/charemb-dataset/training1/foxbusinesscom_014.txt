<p>Tuesday’s statements are in line with comments made earlier this month by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who suggested without providing evidence that NATO was looking to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe.</p>
<p>He said Russia may be forced to do the same, Reuters reported. </p>
<p>The rhetoric from top Kremlin officials over the last few weeks suggests a pattern of attempted provocation, according to security experts. </p>
<p>President and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, Alina Polyakova, <a>said </a>"Putin's framing of Russia as a victim is disinformation.</p>
<p>"Ukraine didn't invade Russia," she added. "Russia has been the aggressor in every recent conflict — but it serves a purpose: justifying military aggression to the Russian people."</p>
<a>said </a>Tuesday, "Putin just declared war on Ukraine (pretending it's war against the U.S. and its allies, provoked by us)."
<p><a>NATO</a> Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday it welcomes "meaningful dialogue" with Russia early next year.</p>

<h1>US, Russia set to hold 'strategic security' talks in January</h1>
<p>By Caitlin McFall, Patrick Ward</p>
<p>Officials from Washington and the Kremlin will sit down for "strategic security" <a>talks</a> next month as tension over Russia's <a>military buildup</a> on the Ukrainian border continues to mount.</p>
<p>"The United States looks forward to engaging with Russia," a spokesperson for the National Security Council told Fox News Tuesday. "When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table, and we will put our concerns on the table. </p>
<p>"There will be areas where we can make progress, and areas where we will disagree. That’s what diplomacy is about," the spokesman added.</p>

<a>some experts feared</a> would be used to legitimize a Ukrainian invasion.
<p>Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along its shared border with Ukraine, though Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday claimed he does not want confrontation with the former soviet state.</p>
<p>The Russian president instead demanded security guarantees from the West that Ukraine be denied access as a member nation of NATO – citing alleged <a>security threats</a> it could pose to Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its NATO allies have not said if Putin will be successful in securing his demands, but have made clear Russia will face severe economic repercussions should it violate Ukraine’s sovereignty. </p>

<p>The bilateral talks are scheduled for Jan. 10. They are a part of the previously agreed to <a>Strategic Security Dialogue</a> that Biden and Putin announced during their June summit in Geneva.</p>
<p>Biden and Putin are expected to address not only tensions over Ukraine but arms control and continued nuclear deterrence.</p>
<p>The Russian president will also meet with NATO leaders two days later on Jan. 12. </p>

<p>"Look, there is no federal solution. This gets solved on the state level," Biden said.</p>
<p>One example came from Harwood during Tuesday’s "New Day" the morning after Biden’s comments went viral.</p>
<p>CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona began by criticizing Biden’s response to the omicron variant and how his comments appear to be shifting blame.</p>
<p>"And this could really cost them politically," Zanona said. "At the end of the day, voters are going to be voting on whether or not they feel like the country has returned to normal. And it just does not feel that way right now."</p>

<h1>Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin accused of 'running PR for the Taliban' following viral tweet</h1>
<h2>The columnist has been one of the biggest media cheerleaders for the Biden administration</h2>
<h4><a>Media top headlines August 24</a></h4>
<p>In media news today, critics express outrage as Biden again takes no questions on Afghanistan, DeSantis blasts Associated Press in an open letter, and Psaki gets panned after saying it's 'irresponsible' to say Americans are 'stranded' in Afghanistan</p>
<p><a>Washington Post</a> columnist <a>Jennifer Rubin</a> is facing intense backlash over a tweet critics are saying is promoting the <a>Taliban</a>. </p>
<p>Rubin has been one of <a>President Biden's</a> biggest media cheerleaders amid the ongoing turmoil in <a>Afghanistan</a> as the administration pursues its turbulent military withdrawal.</p>
<p>However, a tweet made on Tuesday suggests she has gone beyond echoing talking points from the White House. </p>
<p><a>WASHINGTON POST'S JENNIFER RUBIN HIT FOR PAIR OF PIECES BOOSTING BIDEN AMID AFGHANISTAN FALLOUT: ‘SYCOPHANT’</a></p>
<p>"Taliban is asking, not telling: ‘We are asking the Americans, please change your policy and don’t encourage Afghans to leave,’" Rubin tweeted, along with a broken link to the Washington Post's live Afghanistan updates page.</p>
<div> <div><p> (Twitter)</p></div></div>
<p>Critics blasted the "brain worms" hot take on social media. </p>
<p>"Are you serious," Washington Examiner's chief congressional correspondent Susan Ferrechio reacted. </p>
<p>"'Asking' at gunpoint," GOP strategist Matt Whitlock shot back. "It's one thing to shill for the Biden administration, it's another to shill for the Taliban as they hurt their own people."</p>
<p>WAPO'S JENNIFER RUBIN RIPS WH FOR NOT RAMPING UP AFGHAN RESCUE MISSION AFTER CHEERLEADING BIDEN ALL WEEK</p>
<p>Ruthless podcast co-host Comfortably Smug accused Rubin of "running comms for the Taliban" while former Trump White House aide Ben Williamson similarly knocked the columnist for "running PR" for the terror group.</p>
<p>"Wow, the Taliban are modernizing — they hired a spokeswoman!" National Review reporter Isaac Schorr quipped.</p>
<p>"blowing the url is perfect way to end this pro-taliban tweet," Washington Free Beacon executive editor Brent Scher wrote. </p>
<p>Rubin denied she was offering a defense for the Taliban in response to Fox News. But when asked if she could explain what she meant by the tweet, Rubin replied "No."</p>
<p>The former conservative writer has spent much of this week defending President Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal despite the strong backlash his administration has received.</p>
<p>However, she did offer rare criticism in reaction to Britain's ability to get its citizens out of the Taliban-controlled country versus the U.S. </p>
<p>"at @DeptofDefense briefing: British paratroopers going out into Kabul to get their people. Why aren't we? DOD isn't authorized. WH needs to give that authorization and give enough troops to do that. WTF are we waiting for?" Rubin asked. </p>
<p>That brief criticism was quickly drowned out by her overwhelming praise for Biden. </p>

<p>A Hamptons waterfront <a>home</a> once owned by the late Peter Peterson, co-founder of private equity firm Blackstone, has gone under contract for $18 million.</p>
<a>Bespoke Real Estate</a> co-founder and president Cody Vichinsky, whose agency is handling both sides of the transaction.
<p>Vichinsky told FOX Business, "there's a lot of serious people that live on that pond," including titans of industry and celebrities such as Jay-Z and Beyonce, and Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>It's unclear when <a>Peterson</a> – who passed away at 91 in 2018 – owned the <a>property</a>, but the current owner has had the place for decades and at one point, Martha Stewart was a neighbor. </p>

<h1>Liberal media largely give Biden a pass for claim COVID gets solved at state level after scolding Trump</h1>
<h2>'You can bet the press will chalk it up to simply that they now know so much more about the virus and thus they were never inconsistent or partisan,' Curtis Houck said</h2>
<h4><a> 'The Five' react to Biden skirting responsibility on COVID-19 pandemic amid omicron surge</a></h4>
<p>'The Five' panel react to Biden saying 'there is no federal solution' to COVID-19 pandemic, and calling for states to ramp up their efforts</p>
<a>President Biden</a> a pass for attempting to ricochet responsibility on
<a>COVID-19</a> to individual states after he promised to use the federal government’s powers to combat the issue, despite scolding former President Trump for the same move.
<p>"Look, there is no federal solution. This gets solved on the state level," Biden said Monday on a call with governors about combating the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Biden also pointed to long lines at testing locations over Christmas weekend amid the omicron surge and declared, "Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do."</p>
<p><a><u>BIDEN SAYS HE AGREES WITH GOP GOVERNORS: THERE'S ‘NO FEDERAL SOLUTION’ TO PANDEMIC</u></a></p>
<p>Coverage was much different during the previous administration.</p>
<p><a><u>FAUCI SAYS TO CANCEL NEA YEAR'S EVE PARTIES, AS MILLIONS STRUGGLE FOR NORMALCY NEARLY TWO YEARS INTO PANDEMIC</u></a></p>
<p>In April 2020 when President Trump targeted individual states with strict stay-at-home orders, the <a>Times declared</a> he was "ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic." </p>
<a>published a report</a> headlined, "Trump unveils ‘Opening Up America’ plan that punts coronavirus recovery to governors despite ‘total authority’ vow," which began, "When push comes to shove, President Trump would rather just pass the buck."
<p>Politico published a report in November 2020 headlined, "Trump administration leaves states to grapple with how to distribute scarce vaccines," which declared the administration was "shunting" difficult decisions to states.</p>
<a>criticized Trump’s handling</a> as "meager and insufficient" while vowing "to fully use the federal government’s powers once inaugurated to speed the production and dispersal of vaccines and protective equipment."
<p>The Post also reported that Biden called the scale of testing under Trump a "travesty." </p>
<p>Nearly a year into his presidency, <a>Katie Pavlich</a> feels the president is now skirting responsibility for the pandemic and resorted to "blaming" the governors during the call. </p>
