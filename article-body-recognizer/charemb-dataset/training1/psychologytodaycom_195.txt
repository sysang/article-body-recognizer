<h1> How to Read Between the Lines With Greater Comprehension </h1>
<h2> Egonomics 101: Affirmation and self-affirmation operate by supply and demand. </h2>
<p> Posted January 2, 2022 </p>
<li>Human imagination floods our minds with disaffirming thoughts—but also ways to give ourselves reassuring pep talks. </li>
<li>Affirmationomics is the dynamics of supply of and demand for affirmation. </li>
<li>There are many ways to meet our demand for affirmation, including self-affirmation—positive self-talk. </li>
<li>If we can't admit to our need for self-affirmation, we're likely to manage it poorly. </li>
<p>People value affirmation. We seek or demand it because life is rough, especially for us humans. We’re an <a>anxious</a> species trudging through a sandstorm of potentially disaffirming possibilities.</p>
<p>Why us? Because language enables us to imagine anything. It floods us with dreadful thoughts and wishful ways to cheer ourselves up. We’re more visionary and delusional than other organisms.</p>
<p>Language also provides us with the power of reassurance: flattery, complements, likes, pandering, pep-talks, and romantic interpretations of all sorts. </p>
<a>confidence</a> that there’s some kind of happily-ever-after in store for us no matter how bad things get. Romantic partnership can feel like that but so can a belief that we’re fated to rise like a phoenix or reside in a heavenly hereafter.
<p>The supply of outside affirmation is unevenly distributed. Popular people get lots of external affirmation. Some people get almost none. </p>
<p>There are cultural changes in affirmationomics. Through social media, it has become much easier to supply affirmations—“likes” with a click of button—and easier to seek them with posts and selfies. </p>
<a>advertising</a>. Maybe you also know what it’s like to be that someone.
<a>self-talk</a> will feel like affirmation to us, it may have the opposite effect on others, giving them the impression that we’re “thirsty,” needy, trying desperately to convince ourselves that we’re OK when we’re not.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Created by author.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>appetite</a> in any of us can be fed by self-flattery or condemnation of others. There are sado-narcissistic, cru-sadist cults that feed their egos on snobbish disdain of outsiders. Such sado-narcissistic cults are a form of public collective
<a>meditation</a>, though that’s tricky because the mojo-eroding doubts can flood in. It could be in prayer, which can become a kind of mojo-replenishing virtue signaling.
<p>We can also get self-affirmation from watching TV—for example, <a>laughing</a> at fools in comedies, identifying with badasses in action films. Masturbation (in private) can also be a healthy form of self-affirmation. </p>
<p>Stevie Wonder sings, “Everybody’s got a thing, but some don’t know how to handle it,” which could also be sung as “Everybody needs a thing, but some don’t know how to handle it.”</p>

<h3>The General Definition of NPD</h3>
<p>People with narcissistic personality disorder lack emotional <a>empathy</a>. This means that my partner could not feel happy for me when I succeeded at something (unless it reflected well on him) or bad when he hurt me. </p>
<p>All of the above made him ultra-sensitive to negative feedback, easily offended, and very aggressive towards me when he became angry.</p>
<p>In the beginning of our relationship, he was very admiring and attentive to me. I didn’t realize it, but “getting” me after courting me made him feel strong and special.</p>
<p>By the end of the relationship, I felt like a broken confused mess.</p>
<p>Even though I now know this, it is still taking me a long time to heal because I really loved him and I believed him when he said he loved me and that we would be together forever.</p>

<li>Narcissists prioritize power over intimacy and loathe vulnerability, which they consider weak. </li>

<h1> Why Do We Like Narcissists (Initially)? </h1>
<h2> We like narcissists, because we assume they have high self-esteem. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Narcissism? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist who understands narcissism</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<a>self-esteem</a>. Narcissism is associated with being “
<a>immodest, self-promotional, self-enhancing, and entitled</a>.”
<sup>1</sup> Narcissists are high on trait egoism and low on
<a>communalism</a> (e.g., cooperativeness).
<p>Self-esteem differs from narcissism and refers to the subjective evaluation of one’s <a>own worth</a>.<sup>2</sup> Self-esteem and narcissism are only <a>modestly linked</a> (r=0.09-0.41).<sup>3</sup></p>
<a>overestimate narcissists’ self-esteem</a> (initially).
<sup>4</sup> Let us examine their studies and findings in detail.
<p>Studies: Narcissism, Self-Esteem, and Liking</p>
<p>The researchers then examined the reactions of study participants (called perceivers) to the above individuals (called targets) in the following studies:</p>
<a>narcissistic</a> targets were perceived to have higher self-esteem. So even when two targets had the same actual self-esteem, the narcissistic one was perceived to have higher self-esteem.
<p>In addition, participants favored narcissists despite being aware of the fact that narcissists are more egoistic than non-narcissists. Therefore, it was perceptions of self-esteem, not narcissism, that mediated the effect of liking.</p>
<p>However, in conditions where the perceivers were provided with information on a target’s narcissism, perceivers liked high-narcissism targets less than those with lower narcissism. Why?</p>
<p>In summary, participants liked narcissists more than they liked non-narcissists, even when they accurately perceived the narcissists’ level of narcissism, knew what narcissism implies (more egoism), and disliked narcissism itself.</p>

<p>Why Do People Think Narcissists Have Very High Self-Esteem?</p>
<p>One possibility is that people believe narcissism equals very high self-esteem. So once they perceive narcissism in an individual (e.g., notice the person is acting selfishly), they assume the individual must have very high self-esteem.</p>
<a>eyebrows</a>) related to narcissism, which give the impression of higher self-esteem. Yet research shows that wearing expensive clothing or showing cleavage is more strongly associated with narcissism (the
<a>entitlement/exploitativeness </a>component in particular) than with self-esteem.
<sup>5 </sup>A third explanation is that narcissists desperately want to be liked, so they try to appear more self-confident than is really the case.

<p>1. You are being isolated from your family and friends.</p>
<p>"Why do you need to visit your aunt? You visited her last month." "She's still in the hospital." "Like I said, you visited her last month." </p>
<p>2. They try to pit you against others. </p>
<p>The narcissist will use phrases like, "Everyone knows that you aren't good to me"; "Sally said that I should just leave you, she knows what you are like"; "Harry said he'd be happy to be with me."</p>
<p>Keep in mind that "everyone," "Sally," and "Harry" may not have said those things. It is a way for the narcissist to gain control, make you feel "less than," and isolate you from others. </p>
<p>When you confront Sally and Harry, they tell you they never said anything of the sort to the narcissist. When you confront the narcissist, they say, "Of course they told you they never said that. How stupid of you to ask." </p>
<p>3. The rules apply to you, not them.</p>
<p>4. You never seem good enough. </p>

<p>Narcissists may also spend an excessive amount of time on their appearance and looking at themselves in the mirror. They will flex their muscles for no apparent reason. They want to make sure they are the most attractive person in the room. </p>

<h2> The Art and Science of Charisma </h2>
<a>narcissistic</a> individuals and predators use their powers to manipulate others.
<div> <h3> What is charisma? </h3> </div>
<a>Charisma is a personal quality</a>, evident in the way an individual communicates to others, that makes someone more influential. This power to attract
<a>attention</a> and influence people can be embodied in the way someone speaks, what someone says, and how someone looks when communicating. 
<div> <h3> What is a charismatic person like? </h3> </div>
<a>variety of factors</a> can make a person charismatic. They include but are not limited to: confidence, exuberance,
<a>body language</a>, and a passionate voice. People with charisma are often enthusiastic and speak with
<div> <h3> What are some examples of charismatic people? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How is charisma used? </h3> </div>
<a>Charisma can help rouse followers or team members</a> to band together in pursuit of
<a>goals</a>. It can infuse group efforts with a sense of meaning and purpose, reminding everyone of the values they share—often through the use of symbols and storytelling. The specific goals and values can vary across places and social groups.
<div> <h3> Is charisma necessary in leadership? </h3> </div>
<a>business leaders with the highest ratings on charisma</a> are not necessarily the most effective. In a variety of
<a>leadership</a> contexts, however, charisma can be valuable and may help instill confidence in and a sense of connection to the leader.
<div> <h3> Why are narcissists charismatic? </h3> </div>
<p>While <a>narcissism and charisma are not the same</a>, narcissistic people have been <a>described as having a “charismatic air,”</a> which may relate to the outward <a>self-confidence</a> or boldness that many narcissists exhibit.</p>

<h2> How to Develop Charisma </h2>
<div> <h3> How can I be more charismatic? </h3> </div>
<a>to express emotions and make an impression.</a>
<div> <h3> Are people born charismatic? </h3> </div>
<a>Charisma may come more naturally</a> to some people—certain
<a>extroversion</a>, could help. But even highly charismatic people may have learned from role models along the way, and some experts believe that charismatic behaviors can be trained.
<div> <h3> Can you fake charisma? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Practice may make someone more charismatic, but <a>“faking” charismatic leadership could ultimately fall short</a> if a person who speaks convincingly fails to actually uphold the values he communicates.</p> </div> </div>

<h1> The Dos and Don'ts of Working for a Narcissist Boss </h1>
<h2> Here's your guide to what works and what doesn't. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Narcissism? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist who understands narcissism</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>empathy</a>, self-awareness,
<a>emotional regulation</a>, and stable
<a>self-esteem</a>. They see life in black and white, think hierarchically, and are driven by repressed
<a>shame</a> and an exaggerated compensatory persona of superiority and entitlement. Your narcissistic boss doesn't just believe he is better and more deserving than you: His
<a>identity</a> and self-esteem balance on that belief.
<a>attention</a> and control. But more covert narcissists are
<a>passive-aggressive</a> and often go to great lengths to conceal their selfishness and cultivate a do-gooder public image.
<p>3. Do validate your boss. Narcissists need a continuous flow of attention and admiration to function. Like hot-air balloons, they need others to inflate them to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Validate your boss whenever and however you can. Point out strengths and successes and offer praise and positive feedback. </p>
<p>7. Do be reliable, professional, and self-assured. This isn't always easy, especially when your boss is doing the opposite, but you will need to bring your A-game to work.</p>
<p>10. Do make an exit strategy. Working for a narcissist is ravaging to one's self-esteem and personal agency. No matter how skilled you may become at managing the situation, it takes a heavy toll on your emotional and physical health.</p>
<p>Your boss won't stop pushing you to impossible standards, won't play fair, and won't grow a <a>conscience</a>. You owe it to yourself to find a way to put this job in the rear-view mirror. </p>

<p>1. Don't expect fair play or reciprocity. Narcissists flout rules, violate ethics, steal ideas, conduct smear campaigns, disavow responsibility, and project and deny their own behavior without a second thought. </p>
<p>2. Don't expect loyalty. Narcissists expect loyalty from others without earning or returning it. Your boss will not have your back, no matter how much he may tell you he is your champion. </p>
<a>rage</a> or a host of passive-aggressive punishments.
<p>5. Don't take things personally. Things can feel very personal with narcissists. They inflate your flaws, leverage your vulnerability, play on your hopes, and compulsively project their own issues and emotions onto you.</p>
<p>6. Don't expect credit. In narcissists' zero-sum-game mindset, giving credit to others represents a personal loss for them. Don't expect credit from your boss, and if someone else credits you, be prepared for your boss to take ownership of it. </p>
<p>8. Don't fawn. Your boss wants your validation and may look to you for bolstering and praise, but be careful not to sound insincere. Narcissists are hypervigilant, and above all, can't abide looking foolish or out of control. </p>
<p>9. Don't put your self-esteem on the line. We all need to feel a sense of purpose and competence in the work we do, but your worth as a human being should never be part of the equation. Don't let your boss make it feel that way. </p>

<p>Previous researchers have distinguished between “<a>vulnerable” and “grandiose” narcissistic types:</a></p>

<h3>How to manage your emotions around a narcissist</h3>
<p>With these findings as background, let’s examine ways that you can manage your own emotions when you’re dealing with people high in narcissism:</p>
<a>self-esteem</a> and profound feelings of inadequacy, it’s important to recognize when they can benefit from professional intervention. Despite the belief that personality is immutable,
<a>psychotherapy research</a> shows that people can change even long-standing behaviors. Bolstering the individual’s self-esteem may not be something you can tackle on your own, but it is something you can work on with outside help.
