<h1>Utah girl with autism commits suicide, sparking outrage online over bullying, racism</h1>
<h2>The school initially defended its handling of the bullying allegations but later launched an outside investigation</h2>
<a>bullying</a> episodes that targeted Izzy, who was autistic and the only Black student in class. Other incidents included harassment about her skin color, eyebrows and a beauty mark on her forehead, her mother said.
<p>Tichenor-Cox informed the teacher, the school and the district about the bullying. She said nothing was done to improve the situation. Then on Nov. 6, at their home near Salt Lake City, Izzy died by suicide.</p>
<a>autism,</a> issues that have been highlighted by the nation's racial reckoning and a renewed emphasis on student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
<p>In <a>Utah</a>, the suicide also intensified questions about the Davis School District, which was recently reprimanded by the <a>Justice Department</a> for failing to address widespread racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The district, where Black and Asian American students account for roughly 1% of the approximately 73,000 students, initially defended its handling of the bullying allegations but later launched an outside investigation that is ongoing.</p>

<p>Izzy's mother, 31, blames the teacher for allowing the bullying to happen. Prior to this year, she said, Izzy and two of her other children liked the school.</p>
<p>Tichenor-Cox has also called out deep-rooted racism in the predominantly white state of Utah, where she said the N-word that kids called her when she was a child in the 1990s is still hurled at her children three decades later.</p>
<p>But she doesn't want fury to be her only message. She vows to make Izzy's life matter by speaking out about bullying, racism and the importance of understanding autism so that no other parent has to suffer like she is.</p>

<p>As she looked at a picture on her cellphone of Izzy smiling with fresh braids in her hair last May, Tichenor-Cox teared up as she realized that was her last birthday with her dear daughter, who dreamed of being a professional dancer.</p>
<p>"No parent should have to bury their 10-year old," she said. "I’m still in shock. ... This pushes me to get this out there like this. Mommy is pushing to make sure that this don’t happen to nobody else."</p>

<p>Davis School District spokesman Christopher Williams declined to provide an exact timeline on the investigation, reveal the employment status of Izzy's teacher or respond to any direct accusations.</p>

<p>The district has agreed to take several steps as part of a settlement agreement, including establishing a new department to handle complaints, offering more training and collecting data.</p>

<h3>3 reasons to borrow money with long-term payoffs</h3>
<p>Although <a>borrowing money</a> to buy crypto isn't advisable, taking out a loan with interest isn't always a bad investment. Here are a few examples of how loans can pay off in the form of long-term financial gains and savings:</p>
<a>mortgage rates</a> are relatively low, it's unlikely that you'll lose money buying a home as long as you borrow within your means and repay the loan strategically.
<a>may pay off</a> in the form of higher earnings down the road — although this isn't always the case.
<a>recent analysis</a> predicts that well-qualified borrowers could save nearly $2,400 by consolidating their credit card debt. Just be mindful not to rack up more debt while you repay the loan amount.

<p>PUTIN WANTS US AND ALLIES TO GUARANTEE NATO WON'T EXPAND EAST</p>
<p>The announcement comes just one day after Russian President <a>Vladimir Putin</a> threatened to take military-based "reciprocal measures" to counter what he argued were "unfriendly steps" by the U.S. and NATO. </p>
<p>Putin alleged the Kremlin was "fully entitled to these actions that are designed to ensure Russia’s security and independence."</p>
<p>Putin’s warning followed what the Pentagon said were unfounded accusations by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who <a>claimed</a> U.S. contractors were smuggling "unidentified chemical components" into Ukraine. </p>

<p>Tensions between the U.S. and NATO have spiked in recent weeks with Russia’s continued military buildup along the Ukrainian border. </p>
<p>The White House and its western allies have repeatedly warned Putin that if he invades Ukraine there will be serious repercussions. </p>
<p>But U.S. intelligence officials have said they believe Russia plans to invade Ukraine in the New Year – a multifront invasion that could include as many as <a>175,000 troops</a>.</p>
