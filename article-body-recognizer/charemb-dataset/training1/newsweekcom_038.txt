<p>Christmas is steeped in tradition and the Queen's customary speech broadcast on December 25 is something looked forward to by millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>2021 has been a particularly trying time for the monarch, who faces spending her first Christmas without her husband Prince Phillip, who died in April.</p>
<p>She has also battled against a period of ill health, resulting in the Queen cancelling a series of Royal engagements in the latter part of 2021.</p>
<p>And the family has also been rocked by sexual abuse allegations about her son Prince Andrew, with a trial anticipated to start in the U.S. late next year.</p>
<p>British broadcasters <a>BBC</a> and ITV will air <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s annual speech which finds Her Majesty addressing the news about her influential family and the wider world over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>But although both channels will be broadcasting the speech on U.K television, there are other options for <a>Royal Family</a> fans to stream her monologue live online.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Christmas speech, which is prerecorded each year at Buckingham Palace, is traditionally broadcast on Christmas Day at 3pm GMT (10am ET) and lasts for approximately 10 minutes.</p>
<p>For those hoping to live-stream the event outside of the U.K, based on previous years, the broadcast will also be available for viewing on the BBC's website, as well as the Royal Family <a>YouTube channel</a> and <a>Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p><a>It remains unclear what plans are in place for how the royal family will celebrate Christmas this year, although Page Six claims Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do not intend to return to the UK for the festivities</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, royal heir <a>Prince William</a> and his wife <a>Kate Middleton</a> have split their time during the festive period with both of their families.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took to <a>Instagram</a> this time last year to address the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>They wrote: "Wishing a merry Christmas doesn't feel right this year, so instead we're wishing for a better 2021."</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, the entire clan has traditionally walked to St Mary Magdalene Church, which is situated close to the Queen's country retreat of Sandringham, where she usually spends the Christmas period.</p>
<p>This church dates back to the 16th century and used to be visited by the Queen's Great-Grandmother, Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II praised the environmental campaigning of five royals—but not Prince Harry and <a>Meghan Markle</a>.</p>
<p>The Monarch, 95, gave her most <a>emotional Christmas Day message</a> yet as she reflected on the death of her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip.</p>
<p>Elizabeth described how Philip's "mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him."</p>
<p>She also praised his contribution to promoting the environment and name-checked four more royals as well.</p>
<p>Meghan and Harry were not among those mentioned—though she did give a subtle nod to her joy at their baby daughter Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>
<p>Prince Harry founded eco-tourism firm Travalyst, and the couple in November pledged to make their <a>Archewell foundation net zero by 2030.</a></p>
<p>In her Christmas message, the queen said: "Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones" but added that children help her feel joy again.</p>
<p>And she mentioned the arrival of "four more this year," in reference to Harry and Meghan's daughter baby Lilibet, born in June.</p>
<p>Three of the queen's granddaughters, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall, also had babies this year.</p>
<p>"They teach us all a lesson—just as the Christmas story does—that in the birth of a child, there is a new dawn with endless potential."</p>
<p>It comes after Meghan and Harry <a>released the first picture of Lilibet</a> on their 2021 Christmas card, taken by their wedding photographer Alexi Lubomirski.</p>
<p>They included a message, which read: "This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa', and Lili made us a family.</p>
<p>"As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families—from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave."</p>
<p>Meghan and Harry signed off: "Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie Lili."</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II said "Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones" as she celebrated without husband Prince Philip for the first time.</p>
<p>The 95-year-old Monarch paid her most touching tribute yet to the Duke of Edinburgh, acknowledging "one familiar laugh missing this year."</p>
<p>Elizabeth said the twinkle in her husband's eye was "as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him" but life "consists of final partings as well as first meetings."</p>
<p>In her <a>annual Christmas speech to her nation</a>, the queen said: "Although it's a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year, especially, I understand why.</p>
<p>"But for me, in the months since the death of my beloved Philip, I have drawn great comfort from the warmth and affection of the many tributes to his life and work—from around the country, the Commonwealth and the world.</p>
<p>"His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation—were all irrepressible. That mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him.</p>
<p>The queen's annual Christmas message this year was among her most personal and emotional as for the first time she marks the occasion without her husband of 73 years, <a>who died in April</a>.</p>
<p>Visible on her desk in the White Drawing Room at Winsor Castle was a photograph from their Diamond Wedding Anniversary in 2007 at Broadlands, Hampshire.</p>
<p>However, Elizabeth also struck an optimistic tone as she <a>looked ahead to her Platinum Jubilee next year</a>, when she marks 70 years on the throne.</p>
<p>However, <a>Prince Charles</a> was among the royals to visit St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, the church where Philip's funeral was held. It is also the same chapel where <a>Prince Harry</a> and <a>Meghan Markle</a> were married in May 2018.</p>
<p>Charles and a small group of other family members visited the queen while <a>Prince William</a> and <a>Kate Middleton</a> spent Christmas Day at their country retreat, Anmer Hall, near Sandringham.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Kate's Christmas carol concert was broadcast on ITV and showed her playing the piano during a duet of For Those Who Can't Be Here with Scottish singer songwriter Tom Walker.</p>
<h2>Queen Elizabeth II's Christmas Message in Full</h2>
<p>Although it's a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year, especially, I understand why.</p>
<p>But life, of course, consists of final partings as well as first meetings; and as much as I and my family miss him, I know he would want us to enjoy Christmas.</p>
<p>They teach us all a lesson—just as the Christmas story does—that in the birth of a child, there is a new dawn with endless potential.</p>
<p>I wish you all a very happy Christmas.</p>
<p>Police in the United Kingdom arrested an armed suspect on the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day as Queen Elizabeth II was at the residence for the holiday.</p>
<a>BBC</a> reported Saturday that Thames Valley
<a>Police</a> detained the man, who reportedly had an "offensive weapon." The suspect is 19 years old and hails from Southhampton, according to police. He was arrested within "moments" of intruding on the castle property.
<p>Mears also said that the incident remained under investigation, the BBC reported. The police superintendent went on to say that authorities "do not believe there is a wider danger to the public."</p>
<p>The queen is currently at Windsor Castle for Christmas. Typically, the queen spends the holiday with her family at Sandringham, the royal estate in eastern England.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to press representatives for the castle for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p>
<p>As per tradition, the queen shared a Christmas message with her subjects and the world on Saturday. However, the message was prerecorded at Windsor last week, according to The Washington Post.</p>
<p>The queen also mentioned the ongoing pandemic and how it's impacting people in her kingdom and around the world.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Daily Mail to Pay Meghan Markle 'Financial Remedies' Over Copyright Case</h1><div> By Anders Anglesey <time>On 12/26/21 at 11:59 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>The owners of the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline have agreed to pay Meghan Markle "financial remedies" after the company lost a court case over a handwritten letter to her father.</p>
<p>Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Mail on Sunday, agreed on a financial payment to the Duchess of Sussex after she won her legal case of copyright infringement over a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle.</p>
<p>On August 27, 2018, Meghan sent a five-page letter to her father and the gist of its content was shared in a February 9, 2019, article in the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline website.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex's legal team argued at London's High Court of Justice that the publishing of the letter was an infringement of copyright.</p>
<p>While she won her case via a summary judgement earlier this year, Associated Newspapers appealed on the grounds it should have gone to trial.</p>
<p>But, the full judgement of the January 19-20 hearing said Meghan had "a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private."</p>
<p>It added: "The Mail articles interfered with that reasonable expectation."</p>
<p>Judge Lord Justice Warby also compelled The Mail on Sunday and Mail Online to publish a statement about the result.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, Associated Newspapers said in statements published on the front page of The Mail on Sunday and homepage of MailOnline the court had found it had infringed the Duchess of Sussex's copyright.</p>
<p>The 84-word article on Mail Online said the court had found the Associated Newspapers infringed Markle's copyright by publishing extracts of her handwritten letters to her father on both The Mail on Sunday and on the website Mail Online.</p>
<p>It added that "financial remedies have been agreed" and shared the full judgement of the January 19-20 hearing as well as the Court's summary.</p>
<p>The Guardian Media Editor Jim Waterson appeared to poke fun at Associated Newspapers' decision to publish the statement on Christmas Day when many people would be celebrating with their families.</p>
<p>He said: "If a court has ordered your newspaper to issue a front page statement acknowledging your legal defeat to Meghan Markle, why not shove it out on the quietest news day of the year? Merry Christmas to one and all."</p>
<p>Following her legal victory, the Duchess of Sussex said in a statement: "This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what's right.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex and her husband <a>Prince Harry</a> are divisive figures and left the U.K. for California following their exit from frontline Royal duties.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan made damning claims about the British royals during an interview with <a>Oprah Winfrey</a> earlier this year, which sparked a debate about the institution and racism.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II has said she is "deeply saddened" over the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu aged 90.</p>
<p>The 95-year-old monarch reminded the world of her meetings with the human rights champion as social media filled with pictures of the South African with Prince Harry and <a>Meghan Markle</a>.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex introduced son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor to the archbishop during their tour of Africa in 2019.</p>
<p>They also released a statement describing him as an "icon for racial justice" and saying he "remained a friend."</p>
<a>Royal Family</a> in being deeply saddened by the news of the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man who tirelessly championed human rights in South Africa and across the world.
<p>"I remember with fondness my meetings with him and his great warmth and humour.</p>
<p>"Archbishop Tutu's loss will be felt by the people of South Africa and by so many people in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and across the Commonwealth, where he was held in such high affection and esteem."</p>
<p>Elizabeth met Tutu at Buckingham Palace on November 20, 2013, and also presented him with a medal on June 4, 1999.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan's statement read: "Archbishop Desmond Tutu will be remembered for his optimism, his moral clarity, and his joyful spirit. He was an icon for racial justice and beloved across the world.</p>
<p>"It was only two years ago that he held our son, Archie, while we were in South Africa—'Arch and The Arch' he had joked, his infectious laughter ringing through the room, relaxing anyone in his presence.</p>
<p>"He remained a friend and will be sorely missed by all."</p>
<p>Tutu died on Boxing Day at the Oasis Frail Care Center, in Cape Town, and his funeral will be held on January 1.</p>
<p>Prominent Harry and Meghan fan account Royal Suitor wrote: "#HarryAndMeghan introduced Archie to the Archbishop during their 2019 tour."</p>
<p>She added: "#HarryAndMeghan understood the historical significance of that meeting with #DesmondTutu even then."</p>
<p>Royal author Robert Jobson was among those to share the memory of Harry and Meghan's 2019 introduction to the Archbishop.</p>
<p>"I took this photo of @TheDesmondTutu with Prince Harry, Meghan Archie in Cape Town in Sept 2019."</p>
<p>ITV royal correspondent Chris Ship wrote: "Sad to hear of the death of the giant of the anti-apartheid movement Archbishop Desmond Tutu—at age 90.</p>
<p>"We remember those images of him with Harry, Meghan and Archie in 2019—a highlight of their royal tour of South Africa."</p>

<div>The violence has escalated to the point where civilians often get caught in the cross-fire between military and armed separatists in the country.</div>
<p>Cameroon is concurrently fighting an internal war commonly known as the Anglophone Crisis.</p>
<p>After World War I the country was divided into 80 percent French and 20 percent British territories. The latter was further separated into Northern and Southern British Cameroons.</p>
<p>Collected here are some of the photographs that feature in the project. These images are part of the "Humans of the Forgotten War: Stories" series, with some of the real names changed for safety purposes.</p>
<p>As a result of the conflict, there are many who have become prisoners of war — such as journalists, separatists and civilians. Conditions in prison are deplorable, with food being used as a means to control inmates.</p>
<p>The following conceptual images were created with South Cameroonian displaced people representing the sentiments and emotions that prisoners in Cameroon have expressed.</p>
<p>For this project, contact with the French military was established, but they refused to comment. The government did not respond.</p>

<div>Several pride flags feature a variety of colors and symbols that represent different members of the LGBTQ community.</div>
<div><p>With Pride celebrations kicking off in June in the U.S. and other countries, we took a look at some LGBTQ Pride flags and the meanings behind them.</p><h2>Rainbow flag</h2></div>
<p>The flag was modified in 1979 by the organizers of the 1979 San Francisco Pride parade, who wanted to "split the flag into two in order to decorate the two sides of the parade route," according to Virginia's Old Dominion University website.</p>
<p>"To achieve this, they needed an even number of stripes, so the turquoise stripe was dropped, which resulted in a six stripe version of the flag we know today — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet," the website adds.</p>
<a>Old Dominion University</a> notes: "There have been various iterations of the lesbian flag since one was first introduced in the 1990s." The latest version of the
<a>lesbian flag was created by Emily Gwen in 2018, and includes the seven stripes from a previous version (the lipstick flag).</a>
<p>The dark orange represents gender non-conformity and the orange denotes butch lesbians, while the light orange symbolizes community.</p>
<p>The white portion of the flag represents the "unique relationships to womanhood," while pink marks serenity and peace and the dark rose shade represents femininity, <a>the University of California, Santa Barbara website</a> says.</p>
<a>Amherst College website explains</a>.
<a>Asexual Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) in 2010</a>. The
<a>black stripe represents asexuality, while the grey stripe the grey area between sexual and asexual. The white symbolizes sexuality and the purple stripe represents community.</a>
<a>University of California, Santa Barbara says.</a>
<a> launched in 2011 and created by Marilyn Roxie</a>. It features a lavender strip at the top "as it is a mixture of blue and pink, traditional colors associated with men and women, in order to represent androgyny," the
<a>Amherst College website says</a>.
<p>Gender fluid is a <a>subgroup in the genderqueer community and falls within the transgender umbrella</a>.</p>
<p>Its flag represents "the fluctuations and flexibility of gender in gender fluid people," the <a>Amherst College website explains. </a></p>
<p><a>Created in 2010</a>, the pansexual pride flag features the colors pink, yellow and blue. The pink symbolizes attraction to those who identify as female, while blue marks attraction to those who identify as male.</p>
<p>The yellow represents "attraction to those who idenify as genderqueer, non-binary, agender, androgynous, or anyone who doesn't idenfity on the male-female binary," the <a>University of California</a>, Santa Barbara says.</p>
<a>Amherst College website says.</a>
<p>Created by Jim Evans in 1995, the polyamorous flag features four colors and the Greek lowercase letter "pi," which represents the first letter of the world "polyamory."</p>
<p>The blue symbolizes "openness and honesty of all parties involved in the relationships," while the red denotes love and passion.</p>
<a>Old Dominion University website says. </a>
<p>In the demisexual flag, "the black chevron represents asexuality, gray represents gray asexuality and demisexuality, white represents sexuality, and purple represents community," the website says.</p>
<header><h1>China's Communist Party Over 100 Years, in Pictures</h1><div> By John Feng <time> On 7/1/21 at 10:43 AM EDT </time></div> </header>
<div>The Chinese Communist Party emerged from a grassroots movement 10 years after the end of Imperial China. A century later, it is the largest ruling party in the world.</div>
<a>China</a> (CPC) held its inaugural National
<a>Congress</a> in the coastal cities of Shanghai and Jiaxing. Its founders, among them Mao Zedong, had been heavy influenced by Russia's October Revolution of 1917.
<p>The party emerged at a time of chaos in the country, which was under the newly established government of the Republic of China. The ROC's Sun Yat-sen had helped to end 2,000 years of imperial rule in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.</p>
<a>Taiwan</a>, where it remains today.
<p>Deng Xiaoping, who had ousted Mao's chosen successor, seized control of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978. His reforms turned China from a closed economy into a partially open market.</p>
<a>Xi Jinping</a>, declared goals that included economic, technological and military dominance on the world stage—all with him at the helm.
<p>Since taking power, Xi has doubled China's military spending from $100 billion to over $209 billion in 2021. In the interim, China's legislature has abolished presidential term limits, paving the way for him to remain ruler for life.</p>

<p>He explained that they were really close and had a lot in common. He said that his brother was a gamer and that one of the most special items was his brother's gaming chair which he wanted him to have before he died.</p>
<p>In the post, the man explained that he kept the gaming chair in his office but found out a few days ago that his fiancée, 31, sold it.</p>
<p>"Days ago I found out that my fiancee who has been out of job and complaining about no longer being able to attend the gym took the chair and sold it online to be able to pay for her next month's gym membership," the post read.</p>
<p>He explained that when he found out, he had a "negative reaction" and flipped out on her. The fiancée said she was "desperate for money" and had nothing else to sell because she already sold her belongings.</p>
<p>u/AdNO3535435 said he reminded his fiancée who the chair belonged to but she replied that he had "tons of keepsakes" from his brother and shouldn't act like it was the "end of the world."</p>
<p>In the United States, selling property that does not belong to oneself without explicit permission from the owner is considered theft.</p>
<p>"Things haven't got better and I got called overdramatic for reacting and treating my fiancee like that over a gaming chair," the post read. "I feel guilty because I've never yelled at her in my life before. AITA? Was I too hard on her?"</p>
<p>More than 3,850 users flocked to the comments, some to say that the Redditor was being overly dramatic over a gaming chair, and others saying he should break up with his fiancée.</p>
<p>"She's a disrespectful, narcissistic thief. She needs to go," one comment read.</p>
<p>"Sell the engagement ring you bought her and buy back your brother's gaming chair," one user suggested. "Proceed based on her reaction to that."</p>
<p>Another user said u/AdNO3535435's fiancée was completely in the wrong and even suggested reporting the chair as stolen in an attempt to get it back.</p>
<p>The user also claimed the Redditor's fiancée showed that she does not respect his property and that she is old enough to know "that her actions can have consequences."</p>
<p>"And too bad if her consequences are of the legal kind due to her theft," the user continued.</p>
<p>Many users also mentioned that from what u/AdNO3535435 said, his fiancée sounded like she had narcissistic tendencies and that he would be hurting himself by staying with her.</p>
<p>"You are 100% NTA but don't be an a**hole to yourself by accepting this kind of treatment in your life," one user wrote. "The sort of person who would even consider what your girlfriend did isn't a good person. Period."</p>
<div> Culture Work <a>Reddit</a> <a>Viral</a></div>
<p>Thousands of Redditors came together to share their paid time off horror stories after one user's post about their boss ignoring their planned vacation time went viral.</p>
<a>Reddit</a>'s widely-popular r/antiwork subreddit, the thread includes an explanation of the early-morning text u/Impossible-Head2121 woke up to, and their blunt response.
<p>"I just received an early morning text from my manager asking me to come in," the original poster wrote. "I politely responded that I am on vacation."</p>
<p>"She said that she knows but that they are short-staffed due to the recent snow storm, and that she knows I live close enough to walk to work, even in the snow," they added.</p>
<p>According to Zippia, 28 million Americans work without any paid vacations or holidays. And in cases that employees are provided paid holidays and additional time off, the amount of time allowed varies across employers.</p>
<p>Explaining that the same boss had once berated them for texting her a question while she was on vacation, the original poster said that they decided to stand firm, and refused to go into work.</p>
<p>"I ended up just saying 'I can't come in,'" they wrote. "The only response I got was 'K'."</p>
<p>Many commenters on the original thread sided with u/Impossible-Head2121, and shared their own stories of receiving work requests during their paid time off.</p>
<p>"Had an old boss that would take a mile if given an inch," u/NinjaGrizzlyBear wrote. "If you're on PTO but you answer a quick text about a project, it would likely turn into an hour long phone call."</p>
<p>"It's like they wanted to intentionally plant a seed during somebody's vacation so that the employee would subconsciously be worrying about the task the whole time they were off," they added.</p>
<p>u/Ragtothenar said they previously worked at a juvenile hall, and detailed the lengths they went to to avoid off-the-clock phone calls.</p>
<p>"They did some crazy bullsh*t like call people on their way home and make them come back to work a 16 hour shift," they explained. "If I saw any number pop up from the area code... and I was off the clock, I never answered it."</p>
<p>In a pair of additional comments, u/Domeuh and u/value_null echoed those sentiments, and said they have issues with their personal phones every time they take a day off.</p>
<p>"If I'm not scheduled I don't answer any call that isn't family," u/Domeuh wrote.</p>
<p>"It's weird. Every time work tries to call on my day off, I happen to be hiking in the deep wilderness with no signal," u/value_null added sarcastically.</p>
<p>While Reddit's r/antiwork subreddit is chock full of threads detailing bad job interviews, one particularly tense exchange between a potential employee and an interviewer caught the attention of thousands of users on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a viral thread boasting over 32,500 votes and 800 comments, u/p-heiress said they were accused of being late to a job interview, despite their claims they were actually five minutes early.</p>
<p>The Redditor said that when the first met the manager who would be interviewing them, the interviewer immediately questioned their dedication to their potential employer.</p>
<p>"She starts by saying 'I don't know if I want to interview someone who's late,'" u/p-heiress wrote. "I tell her I got there 5 minutes early... then reminded her that she was 10 minutes late, and asked what does that say about her?"</p>
<a>"Great Resignation,"</a> Americans have quit their jobs at an incredible high rate throughout 2021.
<a>doctor's note</a> from an applicant before they were hired, and another interviewer berating an applicant for requesting a "
<p>"Yeah, you don't want to work there," u/Efficient_Mastodons wrote in a comment that received 2.2K votes. "Every time she does something out of line she'll blame it on the employees."</p>
<p>"Are these bosses even trying anymore? You'd think they don't actually want to hire someone with behavior like this," u/Rmf16 added.</p>
<p>Redditor u/strawberrywine21 commended the original poster for calling 'corporate' following the interview.</p>
<p>"Calling corporate was a good call," they wrote. "It might not change anything, but it might. Especially if this is the 5th or 6th time they've gotten the same complaint."</p>
<p>"Honestly I just hope she realizes she can't try to bully someone when she doesn't know the whole store," u/p-heiress wrote. "She tried to embarrass me, and I wasn't having it."</p>

<p>Members of Reddit's widely-popular r/AmITheA**hole subreddit were quick to defend one user after she said her boyfriend accused her of "tricking" him into eating vegan meals.</p>
<p>But the Redditor's boyfriend had no idea.</p>
<p>Bewildered, u/TheElderAgrippina said that when she told her boyfriend that he had eaten multiple meals with "fake meat," he was immediately enraged.</p>
<p>"He got really mad," she explained. "He accused me of tricking him into eating something he found disgusting and 'forcing' my diet on him."</p>
<p>However, despite growing access to plant-based products, many people, like the original poster's boyfriend, are resistant to the incorporation of vegan foods and potential meat replacements.</p>
<p>Following her boyfriend's explosive reaction to eating vegan lasagna, he left the apartment and according to u/TheElderAgrippina, "he wrote a few paragraphs about how betrayed he felt" via text.</p>
<p>In the post's top comment, that has received 19.6K votes itself, u/SmallSacrifice blasted the original poster's boyfriend and said his justifications for being upset were invalid.</p>
<p>Redditors u/Maskydoo and u/Allaboutbird both speculated that u/TheElderAgrippina's boyfriend was embarrassed he never noticed he was eating plant-based meals.</p>
<p>"He got caught being wrong and rather than admit it he chooses to deflect and blame you," u/Maskydoo wrote.</p>

<p>In a comment upvoted 6.8K times, u/SonuvaGunderson was exasperated at the behavior, and encouraged OP to consider separating from her boyfriend.</p>
<p>"I hate this kind of thing. He ate and enjoyed the food... UNTIL he learned there was no meat," they wrote. "Give me a break."</p>
<p>"[Not the a**hole]. Time for a new boyfriend who shows just a bit more maturity than a 10 year old," u/SonuvaGunderson concluded.</p>

<p>Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for sex trafficking led right-wing commentators to cast doubt on the integrity of the court.</p>
<p>The British socialite was found guilty of grooming girls for former lover Jeffrey Epstein to abuse after a month-long trial.</p>
<p>The jury returned guilty verdicts on five out of six charges, including that she sex trafficked a minor.</p>
<p>After the verdict, claims began to appear about the court's processes in relation to evidence about Epstein's network of powerful friends.</p>
<p>Alt-right commentator Jack Posobiec posted on <a>Twitter</a> suggesting documents had been sealed.</p>
<p>He wrote: "Ghislaine Maxwell has been found guilty.</p>
<p>"All details of Epstein's Network ordered sealed."</p>
<p>The post received 23,000 likes and more than 9,000 retweets and quote tweets at the time of writing.</p>
<p>"If the fake J6 committee can subpoena innocent people's cell phone data and bank records then <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>'s whole network should be publicized."</p>
<p>"In summary: It's worse than all the 'conspiracy theories'."</p>
<p>His post was liked 35,900 times at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Adam Klasfeld, the managing editor of LawCrime, reported on the case in person and disputed the claim.</p>
<p>He told The Daily Dot: "I'm not quite sure what that even means, but insofar as I can make sense of the claim, it's easily disproven; quite a bit of information about Epstein's associates is already in the public record."</p>
<p>Newsweek was unable to find any public record of a new judgement having been passed in relation to documents about the case following the verdict.</p>
<p>A number of high profile associates of Epstein were also named as having flown on his plane during the trial, despite not being defendants in the case.</p>
<p>They include Donald Trump, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, <a>Prince Andrew</a>, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Bill Gates, <a>among others</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in December, a decision was taken between the defense and prosecution that Jeffrey Epstein's famous little black book wouldn't be released to the public, The Independent reported.</p>
<p>The contacts book has previously been leaked online. Leland Nally, a journalist with Mother Jones, once called everyone in the contacts book for a feature.</p>
<p>Some evidence in Maxwell's case remained sealed, including Epstein's little black book, however Posobiec's Tweet suggested that all the evidence had been kept secret.</p>
<p>This doesn't account for the high profile names of Epstein and Maxwell's rich and powerful friends that were disclosed in court.</p>
<p>The decision to seal the contacts book was also made during the trial and was therefore not related to the verdict, which hadn't yet been reached.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Jack Posobiec for comment through Human Events, where he is a senior editor.</p>
