<p>Anxiety disorders are complex and result from a combination of genetic, behavioral, developmental, and other factors. Risk factors for GAD include a family history of anxiety and recent or extended periods of <a>stress</a>. </p>
<a>twins</a> and families suggest that
<a>genes</a> play a role in the origin of anxiety disorders.
<a>Childhood</a> adversity and parental overprotection have both been associated with the later development of GAD. It is important to rule out medical causes of anxiety, such as thyroid disorders, before a diagnosis is made.
<div> <h3> How common is generalized anxiety disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is anxiety rising among youth? </h3> </div>
<a>teenagers</a>. The percentage of those 6 to 17 years old who have been diagnosed with anxiety
<a>increased</a> from 5.5 percent in 2007 to 6.4 percent in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
<a>Research</a> from 2021 suggests that 20 percent of children and adolescents have experienced clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety. Many factors may be
<a>contributing to the rise in youth anxiety,</a> such as intense pressure and expectations, overprotective
<a>parenting</a>, social media, and

<p>Psychotherapy involves talking with a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor to learn how to deal with problems like anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</p>
<p>CBT is very useful in treating anxiety disorders. The cognitive dimension helps people change the thinking patterns that support their fears, and the behavioral dimension helps people change the way they react to anxiety-provoking situations.</p>
<p>For many people, the best approach to treatment is medication combined with therapy. </p>

<p>Psychopharmacology is the study of substances that influence mental states. Such agents induce changes in mood, sensation, thinking, or behavior, and may be derived from plants or other natural sources or chemically synthesized in a laboratory. </p>
<a>psychosis</a>. It also includes agents that relieve acute and
<a>chronic pain</a>, and others that curb
<a>insomnia</a> and facilitate sleep.
<p>While some psychoactive agents play an important role in reducing the suffering of those with illness, others, such as “smart drugs,” are of increasing interest for enhancing mental capabilities in healthy people. </p>
<h2> The Major Types of Psychoactive Drugs </h2>
<a>antidepressants</a> and antipsychotics, or by their chemical makeup. Examples of the latter include opioids, often prescribed for pain relief, and benzodiazepines, often given to relieve panic and other

<a>attention</a> and mental focus in people with
<a>ADHD</a>. Caffeine is also a central
<a>nervous system</a> stimulant and may be
<a>the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world</a>, consumed in beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola drinks.
<div> <h3> What do antidepressants do? </h3> </div>
<a>Depression</a> is a complex disorder, affecting many systems of the body and brain, and there is considerable debate on whether antidepressants work and for whom. They can take at least four weeks to have an effect, restoring
<a>motivation</a>, and otherwise re-energizing sufferers. There is evidence that effective antidepressants stimulate the
<a>growth of nerve cells in the brain</a>, creating new pathways of cognitive and behavioral flexibility.

<div> <h3> Is medication more effective than psychotherapy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is there so much controversy about drug treatment for mental health conditions? </h3> </div>
<a>The controversy</a> may largely reflect the lingering stigma attached to mental health problems and related fears that brain-based medications will alter fundamental attributes of personality; they don’t.
<h2> How Psychoactive Agents Work </h2>
<div> <h3> How do antipsychotic agents reduce hallucinations and delusions? </h3> </div>
<a>dopamine</a> is thought to be responsible for the
<div> <h3> Why are stimulants used to curb hyperactivity? </h3> </div>
<a>dopamine </a>and norepinephrine to make them more available. The increased neurotransmitter, in turn, bolsters communication with brain areas responsible for such

<div> <h3> What are common side effects of psychoactive drugs? </h3> </div>
<div> More people have experienced increased anxiety recently, and found relief with a pharmaceutical intervention. There may be a significant side effect, though. </div>

<h2> Why Attention Matters </h2>
<a>Ritalin</a>. And others—particularly those with
<a>ADHD</a> or other mental health concerns—may struggle to pay attention even when it matters most.
<div> <h3> Do some people have shorter attention spans? </h3> </div>
<a>individuals with long and short attention spans both had value</a> in early human societies. The latter, for example, might have been novelty-seekers, more adventurous and quicker to migrate than others.
<div> <h3> Is it possible to multitask? </h3> </div>
<a>lower efficiency on both tasks</a>, greater
<a>stress</a> and distractibility, and even reductions in the brain’s grey matter.
<div> <h3> How does sleep affect attention? </h3> </div>
<a>much more difficult to rebound from distraction</a>, to complete tasks, and to finish jobs without mistakes. And in the case of driving, when focus is absolutely essential, insufficient rest leads to a higher accident rate.
<div> <h3> Why do I sometimes feel time speeding up or slowing down? </h3> </div>
<a>“Matrix effect”</a> has found that, in moments of extreme danger, such as a near accident, our perception of time slows significantly, enabling us to remember moment-by-moment details we cannot produce for more mundane events.
<div> <h3> Can your own mind distract you? </h3> </div>
<a>preoccupied by our inner thoughts and self-talk</a>, though, the costs can sometimes be tragic, such as leaving a child unoccupied in a car.

<a>mindfulness</a>, which cultivates the brain’s ability to direct attention to specific cues.
<div> <h3> Will meditation improve my focus? </h3> </div>
<a>Mindfulness training can help people stay calmer and more focused</a> when their mind wanders. With greater
<a>mindfulness</a>, many individuals find it easier to accept and sit with negative thoughts, develop greater personal awareness, and sustain attention. There is mixed evidence, however, on whether
<a>meditation</a> is any more effective at heightening focus than other mindfulness techniques.
<div> <h3> How can we help children focus? </h3> </div>
<a>they get quickly distracted</a> and the quality of their engagement suffers. When they have only a few toys to choose from, they play with more focus and
<h2> When the Mind Wanders </h2>
<a>fantasies</a>, and interior monologues to plot their futures, amuse themselves, and generate creative solutions for their challenges. Today, living in an environment full of distraction, some experts suggest that we should consider
<a>spending more time lingering in our daydreams</a>. Rather than representing a lapse in attention, occasional mind-wandering could help us remember more effectively, solve problems more creatively, and maintain greater mental health.

<a>refreshed and more effective</a> after they snapped back to attention.
<a>Unfocusing and refocusing</a>, some experts believe, may be a secret to solving personal and professional challenges, as when we walk away from a vexing problem only to have the solution pop into our head quickly when we return to it.
<div> <h3> Are there benefits to distraction? </h3> </div>
<a>pull us away from negative thoughts or unhealthy activities</a>. Video games, for example, can draw our attention away from overeating or
<a>attention</a>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Approximately 5 to 11 percent of children may live with ADHD, likely making it the most common
<a>childhood</a> mental health disorder. But ADHD affects many adults as well, making challenges of learning, working, and establishing healthy relationships. A combination of
<a>therapy</a> and stimulants is often used to help treat ADHD.

<h1> 7 Executive Functioning Challenges for People With Autism </h1>

<li>Executive functioning is necessary for planning, decision-making, impulse control, and emotional regulation.</li>
<li>People with autism often have problems with executive functioning.</li>
<li>This can cause problems with communication, follow through, planning, self-care, and rigid thinking.</li>

<h3>Executive Function and Autism</h3>
<p>Some of the ways in which EF issues affect people with autism include:</p>
<p>EF can contribute to communication issues, particularly if someone finds it challenging to hold information during a conversation. Communication can also be affected by a lack of inhibitory control and a tendency to say inappropriate things. </p>
<p>Poor impulse control can lead to unhealthy or self-destructive behaviours. For instance, a lack of impulse control may contribute to someone with autism staying up all night researching their new hobby.</p>

<h1> What Is Autistic Stimming? </h1>
<h2> Why stimming may help autistic people regulate their emotions. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Autism? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to help with autism</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>"Stimming" refers to self-stimulating behaviors.</li>
<li>Stimming is one of the diagnostic criteria for autism.</li>
<li>People with autism may stim to cope with sensory overload, to communicate, to deal with boredom and agitation, or when they are calm.</li>
<li>Stimming performs a range of functions and is something many autistic people can't control.</li>
<a>autistic</a> stimming behaviours, they tend to think of head banging, hand flapping, or sitting on the ground and twirling over and over. But stimming can be far more subtle, and a range of behaviours fall into this category.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: sifotography, 123rf</div> </div> </div> </div>
<ul><li>Fidgeting</li> <li>Pacing</li> <li>Biting or chewing lips</li> <li>Chewing pencil </li> <li>Shaking leg or foot</li> <li>Picking or biting nails</li> <li>Cracking knuckles</li> <li>Twirling hair</li> </ul>
<p>Some stims which are more commonly associated with autism include:</p>
<li>Random humming, shrieking, or other noises</li>
<li>Skin picking or rubbing</li>
<li>Repeating words or phrases</li>
<li>Spinning, twirling, pacing</li>
<li>Tapping on ears or objects</li>
<li>Tasting or licking—including thumb sucking, finger sucking, or tasting things people ordinarily wouldn’t taste</li>
<h3>Stimming is Self-Soothing</h3>
<a>stressed</a> or over-stimulated and am in the process of trying to calm down; I may also stim when I’m already calm, as stimming can be an enjoyable behaviour that takes me to a very zoned-out place.
<h3>Stimming Can Relieve Boredom</h3>
<a>bored</a>. When there’s no focus for an autistic person’s thoughts, they can feel frustrated and even agitated. Stimming can help manage those emotions and help them remain calm.
<h3>Stimming Can Help People Concentrate</h3>
<h3>Stimming Can Be a Way of Communicating</h3>
<a>anxious</a> or agitated. I often start to stim—usually by vigorously rubbing my feet—when I am feeling anxious. My body starts communicating long before the thoughts have formed in my head or before I have found the words to express myself.
<h3>Is Stimming a Problem?</h3>
<a>attention</a> their stimming behaviours have attracted.
<p>However, it's important to remember that, in many cases, people with autism cannot do much to control their stimming—no matter what consequences it might have. </p>

<li>People with autism are often expected to fit into a world that doesn't meet their needs; for some, lockdown provided some relief.</li>

<h3>How Some of My Clients Have Described Lockdown</h3>
<p>Sarah told me, “I feel so guilty because so many people have suffered, but I loved being shut away from people and activities I hated. Just having that pressure off to be around anyone but my husband and dogs felt amazing.” </p>
<a>anxious</a> about returning to “normal,” and while many people with underlying mental health issues have experienced a worsening of these issues during the pandemic, some people with autism have experienced increased anxiety and
<a>depression</a>. There is also a sense of panic about having to create new routines and respond to new ways of doing things, when, for a long time, a stripped-down and simplified version of life was the experience of many people.

<h3>The Fear About Lifting Lockdowns</h3>
<p>Zoe told me, “I felt sort of safe during the pandemic—worried about COVID, but safe at home. But I’ve become so introverted, I can’t see how to get back to normal.</p>

<h1> "Do People With Autism Have a Sense of Humor?" </h1>
<h2> Why people with autism can offer us a unique perspective on humor. </h2>
<li>It is sometimes assumed that people with autism lack a sense of humour.</li>
<li>People with autism are as funny as neurotypicals—but they may, at times, display humour in different ways.</li>
<li>People with autism are less likely to engage in laughter purely for the sake of social interaction.</li>
<li>People with autism may display some behaviours, such as random and nervous laughter, which can cause interpersonal challenges.</li>
<p>"Are people with autism funny?" is a question that is asked a lot; I hope I can offer some clarification by addressing it, both as a woman with autism and as a therapist who works with <a>autistic</a> clients.</p>

<p>This conception of autism was not entirely new. From its initial inclusion in the DSM-IV, some researchers were concerned about the Asperger’s diagnosis, as they felt it was simply a variation of autism.<sup>1</sup></p>
<h3>Was Asperger’s Linked with Nazism?</h3>
<a>Some prominent historians have argued</a> that Hans Asperger was complicit in Hitler’s regime of “euthanasia” in his bid to create a “genetically fit” German population.
<sup>2</sup> Psychiatrists and other physicians were involved in a Nazi programme that murdered children who were seen as either physically or mentally "inferior" or "undesirable." Asperger, along with some of his colleagues, attempted to mould certain
<a>autistic</a> children into "productive" citizens. He was also responsible for sending others to the Spiegelgrund clinic, where they were starved or given lethal injections. Asperger's complicity in the death of
<a>neurodiverse</a> children has fueled some calls to further abandon the Asperger's label, even in a colloquial sense.
<h3>How Have People Responded to the Change?</h3>
<sup>3</sup> Although the change took place nearly ten years ago, many people with autism continue to refer to themselves as having “Asperger’s” or being “Aspies.”
