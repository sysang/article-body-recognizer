<p>Going forward, the capacity and ticket sales for VTL land travel into Singapore or Malaysia from Jan 21 next year will be cut by half - equivalent of 24 one-way bus rides per day.</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust the VTL (Land) capacity, taking into account the public health situation in both countries and globally," said MTI.</p>
<h2>VTL FLIGHTS INTO SINGAPORE FROM JAN 21</h2>
<p>For entry into Singapore on designated VTL flights from Jan 21, total ticket sales will also be capped at 50 per cent of the allocated quota, added the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) in a separate release.</p>
<p>It also said that it would implement more measures to enhance the safety of aviation workers, including polymerase chain reaction routine testing and requiring N95 masks and face shields for those working in public areas such as taxi stands.</p>
<h2>OMICRON CASES IN SINGAPORE</h2>
<p>MOH said on Monday that there have been 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected to date in Singapore, with 65 imported and six local.</p>
<p>On Monday, MOH reported 195 new COVID-19 cases, of which <a>45 were Omicron infections</a>. It also announced <a>a suspected Omicron cluster</a> at Anytime Fitness in Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.</p>
<a>will not be allowed to undergo home recovery</a>. They will be taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for isolation and management of the disease.
<p>Identified close contacts will also not be allowed to self-isolate at home, instead being placed on a 10-day quarantine at designated facilities, and PCR tests will be conducted at the start and end of their quarantine.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysia reports first Omicron case involving traveller who arrived from South Africa via Singapore: Khairy </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The first positive case of Omicron has been detected in Malaysia in a student from South Africa, said Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin on Friday (Dec 3). </p>
<p>The foreigner, who is studying in a private university in Ipoh, Perak, arrived in Malaysia on Nov 19.</p>
<p>He said that the student had arrived in Malaysia from Singapore. </p>
<p>In response to media queries, Singapore's Health Ministry said on Friday night that the student arrived in Singapore on Nov 19 from Johannesburg, South Africa, on flight SQ479. </p>
<p>She had remained in the transit holding area at Changi Airport until her departure to Malaysia on the same day.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in Malaysia, the student was shuttled on a university bus from KLIA to Ipoh, where she underwent quarantine.</p>
<p>The next day, on Nov 20, she got her test results back saying she was positive for COVID-19. </p>
<p>Five others who were on the same bus as the student were then placed under quarantine. All of them tested negative. </p>
<p>The student was fully vaccinated in Malaysia in September before she went home to visit her family in South Africa. She was asymptomatic and has completed her quarantine on Nov 29.</p>
<p>According to Mr Khairy, the student and eight close contacts will undergo RT-PCR swab tests again on Friday, "just to make sure that (she is) no longer positive". </p>
<p>The minister added that the student entered Malaysia before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Omicron a variant of concern on Nov 26. </p>
<p>Following WHO's pronouncement, Malaysia had temporarily imposed entry restrictions on foreign workers and international students from eight African countries with a high risk of Omicron infections from Dec 1.</p>
<p>Travellers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi are not allowed to enter Malaysia during the ban. </p>
<p>Mr Khairy said in the Friday press conference that from Dec 3, travellers arriving at KLIA from high-risk countries will also wear tracking devices throughout their quarantine period.</p>
<p>“The VTL (vaccinated travel lane) with Singapore will continue for the time being, with additional self tests on the third and seventh days for those who come from Singapore via the VTL,” he added. </p>
<h2>HOW OMICRON WAS DETECTED</h2>
<p>The minister explained that the case was detected as part of the ministry's surveillance initiative following WHO's pronouncement on Omicron. </p>
<p>Malaysia's Institute for Medical Research carried out PCR genotyping assay on 74 positive samples detected at KLIA between Nov 11 and Nov 28, he said. </p>
<p>The results showed that one of the samples was highly likely to be Omicron, he added. </p>
<p>"Subsequently, whole genome sequencing was carried out and showed a positive result for Omicron variant on Dec 2," Mr Khairy said. </p>
<p>The minister said Ministry of Health decided to carry out genomic tests on positive cases reported prior to the Nov 24 WHO pronouncement on Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"That means we are not just carrying out (the tests) now. I requested for all samples since Nov 11 to be retrieved and run through whole genomic sequencing for us to be sure of the variants," he explained. </p>
<p>Mr Khairy added that there has been no drastic rise in COVID-19 cases in Ipoh, Perak, and the places where the said traveller had been, such as KLIA. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysia detects 11 more Omicron COVID-19 cases, all imported </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia reported 11 more Omicron COVID-19 cases on Saturday (Dec 18), taking the total to 13. </p>
<p>All 11 infections are imported, comprising three who travelled from the United Kingdom, three from the United States, two from Nigeria, two from Saudi Arabia and one from Australia. </p>
<p>Nine of the cases are Malaysians, while two are Nigerians, said Malaysia’s health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.</p>
<p>He added that the 11 cases are among the 18 samples that showed a suspected presence of the Omicron variant, as announced by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin on Thursday. </p>
<p>“The other seven samples, however, (we) could not confirm the presence of the Omicron variant because the whole genome sequencing could not be done due to the low level of viral load in the samples,” Dr Noor Hisham said.</p>
<p>With more imported Omicron cases in Malaysia, health authorities said COVID-19 measures have been stepped up at all international entry points and in the community.</p>
<p>Nigeria, for instance, has been added to the list of high-risk countries. Mr Khairy said earlier this week that travellers from these countries have to wear digital tracking devices throughout their mandatory quarantine period. </p>
<p>Travellers arriving from the UK must self-test daily throughout their quarantine and report the results on the MySejahtera app.</p>
<p>While large-scale New Year’s Eve celebrations are not allowed, people attending small-scale, private festive events must do self-tests before attending them, Mr Khairy had said. </p>
<p>Malaysia’s health ministry is also urging people to get their COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'A week of anxiety': Xi'an residents hunker down for city COVID-19 lockdown </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The city transformed as all <a>13 million residents were ordered to stay home</a>: Streets emptied, people formed long lines at COVID-19 testing stations and officials cordoned off apartment compounds.</p>
<p>The historic former capital - a popular destination for international tourists prior to the pandemic - was swiftly sealed off after more than 200 COVID-19 cases were detected this month.</p>
<p>In China, even a single COVID-19 case can prompt stay-at-home orders and strict travel bans.</p>
<p>Xi'an resident Wei told AFP the lockdown had left her feeling "miserable", as a series of outbreaks had prevented her from seeing her husband, who lives in Beijing, for months.</p>
<p>"Beijing had an outbreak a while ago, and now Xi'an has an outbreak - it just alternated," Wei said.</p>
<p>The lockdown comes at a bad time for the city's graduate school applicants, who are now struggling to ensure they can sit the coming weekend's national postgraduate entrance exams.</p>
<p>"It's been a week of anxiety," said one exam candidate who declined to give her name.</p>
<p>"The exam centre requires two paper nucleic acid certificates from the past 48 hours. But now the nearby test centres only provide electronic results, the nearby hospitals are sealed off, and the exam centre won't answer the phone."</p>
<p>With roads blocked, she had no idea how she was going to reach the exam site.</p>
<p>Local media showed residents flocking to markets to stock up on supplies as news of the impending lockdown broke on Wednesday.</p>
<p>And state-run Global Times warned Xi'an was facing "a huge test of its governance capability".</p>
<p>Many local officials across China have been sacked after being judged to handle outbreaks badly, driving local governments to maintain strict rules.</p>
<p>In Xi'an, anxious tourist site operators had already been asking visitors to show negative COVID-19 tests for entry before the outbreak, with train arrivals needing to prove they were COVID-19-negative.</p>
<h2>ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT</h2>
<p>China has recorded fewer than 5,000 COVID-19 deaths overall, compared with more than 800,000 in the United States.</p>
<p>With the government sticking rigidly to its zero-COVID-19 strategy, many residents told AFP they supported the stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>"(I believe) it should happen, that there should be a lockdown," Sun, a Xi'an resident who only wanted to be identified by her surname, told AFP.</p>
<p>She said she had an inkling the lockdown was coming because she lived in a neighbourhood where multiple COVID-19 cases were detected.</p>
<p>"The government said we can go out once every two days to buy things, so I didn't do any preparation except to buy a few things last night," said Sun, who will continue working from home.</p>
<p>The country where COVID-19 was first detected has wrestled down infection rates to a mere fraction of those abroad through a now-predictable routine when cases are detected: Cut off transport, isolate local residents and <a>test millions</a>.</p>
<p>Residents told AFP they felt better prepared for lockdown nearly two years into the pandemic, and believed extreme measures were necessary to nip the outbreak in the bud.</p>
<p>"We all saw the lockdown of Wuhan. At the time, nothing was certain, but this time we're not that panicked and trust the government," said Wei, the resident who had been separated from her husband.</p>
<p>Wuhan went under lockdown for an unprecedented 76 days in early 2020.</p>
<p>Cordoning off the city is a "countermeasure which we should do at an early stage, as early as possible", Yuan, an interpreter and mother-of-two living in Xi'an, told AFP.</p>
<p>She said her entire residential compound was about to get tested for the third time since the start of the outbreak.</p>
<p>With schools closed, her two children were switching to online learning, she said.</p>
<p>"Compared with Wuhan, I very much believe that our lockdown will not extend for too much time," she said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China orders 13 million Xi'an residents to stay home over COVID-19 outbreak </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: The <a>northern Chinese city of Xi'an</a> ordered all 13 million residents to stay home in a strict lockdown on Wednesday (Dec 22), while dramatically tightening travel controls to fight a growing COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>With Beijing preparing to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, China is on high alert as it fights local outbreaks in several cities.</p>
<p>Xi'an reported 52 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, bringing the total to 143 since Dec 9.</p>
<p>Residents "should not leave the city unless necessary", the government said, adding that those seeking to leave would have to provide evidence of "special circumstances" and apply for approval.</p>
<p>The orders came a day after the city began testing all of its 13 million residents.</p>
<p>Long-distance bus stations were closed and authorities have set up disease control checkpoints on highways out of Xi'an, government notices said.</p>
<p>More than 85 per cent of flights to and from the city's main airport have been grounded, according to flight tracker VariFlight.</p>
<p>Inside the city, passenger capacity has been slashed on buses and trains, and schools closed.</p>
<p>All "non-essential" businesses and public facilities aside from supermarkets, convenience stores and medical institutions have been ordered to close, while the local government has urged employers to allow people to work from home, CCTV reported.</p>
<p>Large-scale meetings including activities in outdoor parks have been suspended, while the museum housing the world-famous Terracotta Army - the 2,000-year-old mausoleum of China's first emperor - has shut until further notice.</p>
<p>China - where the coronavirus was first detected - has slowed new cases to a trickle since the middle of last year through a zero-Covid strategy involving tight border restrictions, targeted lockdowns and lengthy quarantines.</p>
<p>Even a single case can lead to a swift imposition of curbs.</p>
<p>The southern city of Dongxing on Tuesday ordered its 200,000 residents to isolate at home after an infection was detected.</p>

<p>Debbie Rodriguez said she thought "long and hard" about cancelling this year's family Christmas trip to New York City before opting last-minute on Thursday to travel from Houston.</p>
<p>"We just decided we're not going to live in fear," said Rodriguez, 48, as she waited for luggage at New York's LaGuardia airport with her husband and two children.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said her fully vaccinated family had planned to see the Rockettes' Christmas show before it was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak, so they will instead check out landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Central Park.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, they will dine indoors at a restaurant in Harlem away from the crowds, then visit the Empire State Building, she said.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday screened 2,081,297 passengers through the nation's airports, an increase of 144,000 over the number of travellers it screened pre-pandemic on the same date in 2019.</p>
<p>In-person Christmas services will be held at all churches and parishes in the Archdiocese of New York, which includes more than 2.5 million Roman Catholics across 10 counties, communications director Joseph Zwilling said.</p>
<p>There will be no new restrictions in place because of Omicron, but Zwilling said the Archdiocese would continue to require mask-wearing and social distancing as it has since last year. "The existing measures have been working," he said.</p>
<p>"Guests want to get through one holiday before they focus on the next, especially since new details about the Omicron variant are announced daily," he said.</p>
<p>In the last seven days, the average number of new COVID-19 cases has risen 37 per cent to 165,000 per day, according to a Reuters tally. Deaths and hospitalisations, which can be lagging indicators, are relatively unchanged nationwide.</p>
<p>Cases have risen 96 per cent so far in December, while deaths are up 55 per cent and hospitalisations have increased 28 per cent.</p>
<p>Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Ohio all set one-day records for new cases this week, according to the Reuters tally.</p>
<p>US health officials have said people who are fully vaccinated should feel comfortable proceeding with holiday travel and family gatherings. They warned those who are unvaccinated are at higher risk of getting seriously ill or dying from the virus.</p>
<p>"We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked," President Joe Biden said in a Twitter post on Thursday, after outlining his latest steps to combat the virus earlier this week.</p>

<p>In Manhattan’s Bryant Park on Thursday, bundled-up skaters circled the outdoor ice rink with views of the Empire State Building as carols and Christmas pop songs boomed from loudspeakers.</p>
<p>At the rink's edge, Reneé Rosenthal, a 51-year-old merchandising representative for Hallmark greetings cards, embraced a friend she has known since elementary school in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Rosenthal said she booked the five-day trip with her husband and two teenaged children from their home in Houston in the summer, when everything seemed like it was getting back to normal.</p>
<p>They switched their plans to include a horse-drawn carriage ride through Central Park and a sightseeing tour on an open-top double-decker bus.</p>
<p>The skating and reunion with her old friend still worked out, however.</p>
<p>"This is the only thing we had planned that we didn’t have to change," Rosenthal said.</p>

<p>LONDON: Around 1 in 10 people in London were likely infected with COVID-19 on Sunday (Dec 19), according to new official estimates that underlined the relentless advance of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Daily modelled estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics showed around 9.5 per cent of Londoners had COVID-19 as of Sunday, within a 95 per cent confidence interval of 8.43 per cent to 10.69 per cent.</p>
<p>The figures came a day after Britain recorded a record number of new coronavirus cases as the Omicron variant swept across the country, with the daily tally reaching 119,789 from 106,122 a day earlier.</p>

<p>The ONS report also showed a record 1 in 35 people in England had COVID-19 between Dec 13 and Dec 19 - compared with a previous estimate published on Thursday of 1 in 45 in the week to Dec 16.</p>
<p>Many industries and transport networks are struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolate, while hospitals in Britain have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.</p>
<p>Omicron's rapid advance has driven a surge in cases in Britain over the last seven days, with the total rising by 678,165, government data showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>As the Conservative government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson struggles to limit the economic impact of the latest COVID-19 outbreak, it said on Wednesday it was <a>reducing the legal self-isolation period</a> in England to seven days from 10.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Overwhelmed US Midwest hospitals prepare for worst with Omicron </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The rapid spread of Omicron infections has hospitals in the US Midwest "preparing for the worst," with their intensive care units and medical personnel already severely strained from a wave of the potent Delta variant of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Indiana, Ohio and Michigan have been hit harder in recent weeks by the virus than any other states. About one in four of their hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to US Department of Health and Human Services data.</p>
<p>The impact is even greater in their intensive care units, where COVID-19 patients now account for one-third or more of the beds, according to HHS.</p>
<p>Ohio’s hospital population has more than doubled since early November, and the stress on the system’s capacity was especially acute in the northeast part of the state that includes Cleveland, Ohio Hospital Association spokesman John Palmer said.</p>
<p>“If these hospitalisations keep going up, it's going to reach a breaking point,” said Palmer, whose association represents 250 hospitals and 15 health systems.</p>
<p>With 78 per cent of in-patient beds and 81 per cent of ICU beds filled, Ohio hospitals are postponing elective surgeries and transferring some patients to other facilities in anticipation of an Omicron surge after holiday gatherings, Palmer said.</p>
<p>“We hope for the best but we're preparing for the worst when it comes to Omicron," said Palmer. "The reality is that we have a lot of unvaccinated Ohioans.”</p>
<p>Hospitals in Michigan are using 82 per cent of their regular beds and 87 per cent of their ICU beds, according to federal HHS data.</p>
<p>The state said early this month that 76 per cent of hospitalised COVID-19 patients were unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Michigan and Indiana are among six states that President Joe Biden this week said will get immediate help from federal emergency response teams, each with more than 100 clinical personnel and paramedics.</p>
<p>The other states are Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. Four of the six states were among the country's top 10 for COVID-19 hospitalisation rates as of last week, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
<p>"With Omicron cases doubling every two to three days, our health systems are likely at risk of becoming rapidly overwhelmed," she said.</p>
<p>By contrast, New York City's COVID-19 hospital population has remained stable over the past month, despite an explosion of Omicron-induced infections in recent weeks. The city said 71 per cent of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>"The good news is our hospitals are doing well and we are seeing a very different reality than we saw in 2020 - many fewer people in ICUs, thank God," Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a briefing on Wednesday.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> UK says COVID-19 surge 'extremely difficult' as Omicron grips Europe </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Speaking after UK media reported Britain might impose new curbs after Christmas, Johnson said the situation was "extremely difficult" and hospitalisations were rising steeply in London.</p>
<p>"I have to say to the British public, and I say to everybody, we will <a>not exclude the possibility of going further</a> if we have to do things to protect the public," Johnson said after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Omicron infections are multiplying rapidly across Europe and the United States, doubling every two or three days in London and elsewhere and taking a heavy toll on financial markets, which fear the impact on the global economic recovery.</p>
<p>The variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong and so far been reported in at least 89 countries. The severity of illness it causes remains unclear.</p>
<p>Any limits on Christmas celebrations would come at a high political cost for Johnson, already under fire over reports he and his staff <a>broke lockdown rules last year</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about speculation the government would ban indoor socialising and limit tourism, Johnson said: "We're looking at all kinds of things ... we will rule nothing out."</p>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced a shutdown on Saturday, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places until at least Jan 14.</p>
<a>draft of proposed steps</a>. The document also said access to restaurants would remain limited to people who could provide proof of vaccination or recovery.
<p>Ireland on Friday ordered bars and restaurants to close at 8pm and reduced the capacity in all public events. Italy is also considering new measures, newspapers reported on Sunday.</p>
<h2>'RAGING THROUGH THE WORLD'</h2>
<p>Coronavirus cases surged in New York City and around the United States over the weekend, dashing hopes for a more normal holiday season and stretching the country's testing infrastructure just days before Christmas.</p>
<p>In Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said <a>Omicron is spreading faster than the Delta variant</a> and causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.</p>
<p>WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said it was too early to conclude Omicron is milder than prior versions of the virus, adding that it could still make enough people sick to "overburden" healthcare systems.</p>
<p>Many monoclonal drugs "will not work with Omicron," she said of the infused treatment used to lessen disease severity of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Monoclonal antibody drugs deliver lab-made versions of the body's natural antibodies to fight infection, while vaccines spur the body to make its own antibodies and build its own immunity.</p>
<p>European stocks were down 1.33 per cent. Shopper numbers across Britain's high streets fell 2.6 per cent over the Dec 18-19 weekend versus the previous weekend, researcher Springboard said.</p>
<p>Last week, the European Central Bank cut its euro zone growth forecast for next year to 4.2 per cent from 4.6 per cent previously, citing the pandemic among "headwinds".</p>
<p>ECB President Christine Lagarde said, even if economies were learning to adapt to living with COVID-19, tighter restrictions could delay the recovery.</p>
<p>Israel added the United States to its "no-fly" list, citing concerns over the Omicron variant. US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said Omicron was <a>"raging through the world"</a> as he urged Americans to get booster shots.</p>
<p>More than 274 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally since the pandemic began. More than 5.65 million people have died.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum on Monday postponed its annual meeting in Davos due to the spread of Omicron, putting off the event scheduled for January until mid-2022.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Thailand reinstates mandatory COVID-19 quarantine, scraps waiver programme </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<a>quarantine waiver</a> from Tuesday (Dec 21), a government spokeswoman said, due to concerns over the spread of the
<a>Omicron variant</a> of the coronavirus.
<p>The decision to halt Thailand's "Test and Go" waiver means visitors will have to undergo hotel quarantine, which ranges between 7 to 10 days.</p>
<a>except for the tourist resort island of Phuket</a>.
<p>"After Dec 21, there will be no new registrations for 'Test and Go', only quarantine or Phuket sandbox," said deputy government spokeswoman Rachada Dhanadirek.</p>
<p>On Monday, the <a>country reported its first case</a> of local transmission of the Omicron variant. </p>
<p>Thailand had reopened to foreign visitors in November, ending almost 18 months of strict entry policies that contributed to a collapse in tourism, a key industry and economic driver that drew 40 million visitors in 2019. </p>
<p>Thailand has so far detected 63 cases infected with the Omicron variant, with one case of local transmission and the rest imported cases.</p>
<p>About 200,000 visitors who had previously registered for the quarantine waiver and sandbox programme will still be eligible, said government spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana.</p>
<p>"This is not to shut off tourists but to temporarily suspend arrivals," he said.</p>
<p>The decision will be reviewed on Jan 4, he added. </p>
<p>Thailand was a popular tourist destination for Singaporeans before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Singapore launched its vaccinated travel lane for Thailand on Dec 14, allowing fully vaccinated passengers on designated flights from Thailand to enter Singapore without having to serve quarantine.</p>
<p>The authorities have previously advised Singaporeans and residents to monitor the latest public health and border measures in the countries they are visiting, and plan ahead for contingencies.</p>
<p>CNA has contacted Thai authorities about the implications for visitors from Singapore who were intending to travel to Thailand and then return to Singapore via the vaccinated travel lane.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Thailand reports first local Omicron case, eyes reinstating quarantine for foreign visitors </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<a>foreign visitors</a> due to concerns over the
<a>spread of Omicron</a>, as the health ministry reported on Monday (Dec 20) the country's first case of local transmission of the coronavirus variant.
<p>The public health ministry will propose scrapping a quarantine waiver for vaccinated visitors and revert to hotel quarantine and a <a>"sandbox" programme</a>, which allows free movement in specific locations, minister Anutin Charnvirakul said.</p>
<p>The proposal was driven by worries over the spread of Omicron, Anutin told the Inside Thailand television show, adding it will be made to the government's COVID-19 taskforce "soon".</p>
<p>Thailand had detected 63 people infected with the Omicron variant so far, Anutin said, with one case of local transmission and the rest imported cases.</p>
<p>"She is potentially the first in Thailand to get Omicron from an overseas traveller, her husband, and the first locally transmitted case," said Chakrarat Pittayawonganon, an official from the Disease Control Department.</p>
<p>Both the husband and the wife had been fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said.</p>
<p>The couple had one high-risk contact, a taxi driver, who was being quarantined and pending a second coronavius test due on Wednesday, Chakrarat added.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Mendadak kalut: Goyang lesu industri dangdut Indonesia di tengah ketidakpastian pandemi </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kiki Siregar </a> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: Dengan rias wajah lengkap dan kostum gemerlap, Netha Salsabila sempat kerap memukau penonton saat ia mendendangkan lagu-lagu dangdut berirama rancak yang mengundang siapa pun untuk ikut berjoget.</p>
<p>Perempuan berusia 32 tahun dengan nama panggung Ranesa Queen ini adalah biduan dangdut di kota Madiun, Jawa Timur, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Seperti banyak penyanyi dangdut lain, ia terpaksa mengubah profesi dan gaya hidupnya akibat COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ketika pandemi meruak tahun lalu, panggung hidupnya pun bertukar latar. Alih-alih menyemarakkan pertunjukan demi pertunjukan di malam hari, ia kini menyiapkan makanan untuk para pelanggan di pagi hari.</p>
<p>“Alasan saya alih profesi karena banyak job-job yang batal dikarenakan sulitnya perizinan untuk hajatan serta hiburan, kayak pernikahan atau ulang tahun,” jelasnya kepada CNA.</p>
<p>“Makanya saya pindah ke kuliner, jualan online makanan kayak lele goreng.”</p>
<p>Lazim diketahui, pertunjukan dangdut tak jauh dari nyanyi, musik, dan tari.</p>
<p>Ketika situasi masih normal, menyelenggarakan pertunjukan semacam itu tidaklah rumit. Namun, di masa pandemi, pelik untuk menyatukan semua unsur tadi ketika segala jenis pentas terbuka untuk khalayak tak boleh digelar.</p>
<p>Dengan segala macam pembatasan yang berlaku di tempat-tempat umum, sulit bagi para seniman dangdut untuk mencari nafkah saat peluang mengadakan pergelaran publik lenyap begitu saja.</p>
<p>Menurut para pakar musik, genre yang kerap disebut sebagai musik nasional Indonesia ini hadir di Asia Tenggara (Indonesia dan Malaya) pada akhir 1950-an.</p>
<p>Bermula dari penggabungan musik Melayu dengan beragam elemen Hindustan dan Arab, dangdut versi kontemporer telah memasukkan banyak unsur musik kerakyatan asli Indonesia.</p>
<p>Kemasyhuran dangdut, khususnya di Indonesia, mencapai puncaknya pada tahun 1990-an ketika genre ini menjadi bentuk hiburan massal sekaligus sarana promosi pesan-pesan nasional dan berbagai narasi populer.</p>
<p>Saat ini, sebagai sejenis musik kerakyatan, dangdut terus hidup di hati para penggemar dari berbagai lapisan.</p>
<p>Popularitasnya yang tinggi telah menarik minat banyak muda-mudi — termasuk Netha — untuk menjadi penyanyi, musisi, atau penari dangdut.</p>
<p>Akan tetapi, seiring memburuknya situasi COVID-19, banyak pelaku industri musik dangdut yang terpaksa menanggung dera pandemi akibat sedikit atau bahkan tidak adanya kesempatan untuk naik pentas.</p>
<p>Alur kisah "mendadak dangdut" dialami Netha 17 tahun silam, ketika seorang teman memintanya menggantikan seorang biduan yang mangkir naik panggung secara sepihak.</p>
<p>“Kebetulan saya hobi nyanyi dari kecil. Saya bergabung di grup namanya Sentana.</p>
<p>“Saya belajar banyak dari musisi-musisi yang sudah saya anggap sebagai saudara saya sendiri,” ujar Netha.</p>
<p>Sebagai penyanyi dangdut, ia dapat mengantongi sekitar Rp5 juta (US$350) per bulan dari serangkaian pertunjukan.</p>
<p>Tawaran-tawaran tampil di kota lain, seperti Malang atau Tuban, dapat mendongkrak penghasilannya hingga Rp7,5 juta per bulan.</p>
<p>Kini, ia hanya mengumpulkan sekitar setengah dari angka tersebut.</p>
<p>“Saya kangen manggung sama makan-makan pas hajatan. Sekarang saya cuma duduk manis di rumah, enggak bisa ngumpul bareng seniman-seniman lain.”</p>
<p>Lagi pula, menjalankan bisnis makanan adalah tugas sulit yang membutuhkan kesabaran dan keuletan ekstra, katanya.</p>
<p>”Pagi-pagi banget saya udah harus siap-siap, terus foto-foto makanan buat di-upload ke akun medsos,” ujar Netha, seraya menambahkan bahwa media sosial menjadi penghubung antara ia dan sebagian besar pelanggannya.</p>
<p>Mantan penyanyi dangdut lain, Novi Listiana, telah beralih ke sektor pertanian demi memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sejak pandemi.</p>
<p>Tinggal di Boyolali, Jawa Tengah, perempuan berusia 23 tahun ini sebelumnya sering tampil dari desa ke desa di kampung halamannya.</p>
<p>“Saya jadi penyanyi bukan karena suara saya bagus, tapi karena saya satu-satunya tulang punggung keluarga kecil saya.</p>
<p>“Jadi saya melakukan ini demi keluarga, nyanyi sejak tahun 2013, waktu saya masih SMP,” ujarnya.</p>
<p>Ketika ia menikah di tahun 2018, Novi sempat berpikir untuk mengubah karier sekaligus citranya.</p>
<p>Di negeri berpenduduk mayoritas Muslim ini, penolakan dari sebagian kalangan yang menganggap bahwa cara berpakaian beberapa pedangdut perempuan terlalu terbuka dan “tidak Islami” tak ayal membuat Netha bimbang.</p>
<p>Saat memutuskan untuk meninggalkan pentas dangdut, Novi kesulitan menemukan peluang kerja lain, lebih-lebih di tengah kondisi pandemi Indonesia yang kian parah.</p>
<p>“Sejak pandemi COVID-19, saya sepi job, bahkan gak ada. Mau cari kerja di mana-mana juga susah,” ujarnya.</p>
<p>Suaminya, seorang pemain kendang, turut memutuskan untuk meninggalkan karier bermusik.</p>
<p>Lelaki itu lantas mengajari istrinya bercocok tanam, dan mereka pun mulai mencari nafkah sebagai petani kecil.</p>
<p>“Awalnya risi dan malu. Tapi semakin lama malah jadi seneng dan sampai sekarang nyaman juga jadi petani,” katanya kepada CNA.</p>
<p>Menurut Novi, dari segi pendapatan tak ada yang berkurang. Dengan penghasilan kasar Rp2 juta per bulan, angka yang dulu dia dapatkan sebagai penyanyi dangdut tidaklah berbeda.</p>
<p>Namun, sebagian musisi dangdut tak seberuntung itu. Agus Suprapto dan Listyo Pramono, misalnya.</p>
<p>Agus, yang selama hampir dua dekade berprofesi sebagai kibordis dangdut, kini menjalani hari-harinya sebagai tukang servis elektronik.</p>
<p>Dia juga membuka warung makan sederhana serta menyewakan Playstation 3 (PS3).</p>
<p>“Pertengahan 2020 lalu, sekitar Juli atau Agustus, saya sampai harus menjual keyboard Yamaha saya buat bisa beli alat-alat servis elektronik, beli TV bekas buat rental PS3 saya, sama buat buka kios,” tutur pria berusia 46 tahun itu.</p>
<p>Dulu, pada musim-musim hajatan, sebagai kibordis ia dapat tampil setiap hari dan membawa pulang sekitar Rp200.000 hingga Rp300.000 usai tiap pertunjukan.</p>
<p>Kini pendapatannya bergantung pada siapa saja yang memanggilnya untuk memperbaiki alat-alat elektronik, keterampilan yang dia pelajari secara otodidak lewat video-video Youtube. Panggilan servis biasanya datang dua atau tiga kali dalam sepekan.</p>
<p> “Mungkin karena pandemi, panggilan servis jadi lebih sedikit. Sekarang sih yang penting bertahan hidup,” ujar ayah dari satu anak usia prasekolah ini.</p>
<p>Dia mengakui, menjadi teknisi kecil-kecilan telah menyajikan suka dan duka tersendiri. Kadang dia marah jika ada pelanggan di kampungnya yang tidak sanggup membayar.</p>
<p>Ada kalanya pula dia ikut senang melihat kebahagiaan pelanggan yang puas dengan hasil kerjanya memperbaiki alat-alat elektronik yang rusak.</p>
<p>“Dari satu orang saya bisa dapat maksimal seratus ribu rupiah. Ya, namanya juga hidup di desa,” kata warga Desa Joho, Jawa Timur, tersebut.</p>
<p>“Ada juga yang enggak ngasih dengan alasan belum ada uang. Kalau enggak dikasih, ya udah enggak apa-apa. Saya soalnya sudah pernah ngerasain kaya gitu.”</p>
<p>Bagi mantan gitaris dangdut Listyo Pramono, menjadi pengangguran merupakan pukulan berat sejak ia kehilangan mata pencaharian.</p>
<p>Ketika pandemi melanda, pria berumur 40 tahun yang selama 15 tahun berprofesi sebagai musisi dangdut itu beralih menjadi buruh pabrik gula.</p>
<p>Namun, dari waktu ke waktu dia menganggur, sebab peluang kerja di pabrik tersebut hanya berlaku musiman.</p>
<h2>ADA ASA UNTUK DANGDUT: PENGAMAT</h2>
<p>Analis musik Bens Leo mengakui bahwa pandemi telah memaksa banyak seniman dangdut untuk beralih profesi.</p>
<p>Namun, ia menyebutkan bahwa hal yang sama juga dialami oleh para seniman genre lainnya.</p>
<p>Meski demikian, ia percaya bahwa para pelaku pertunjukan dangdut secara keseluruhan memang menghadapi tantangan yang lebih besar, sebab di Indonesia jumlah mereka lebih besar jika dibandingkan dengan para pelaku industri hiburan yang lain.</p>
<p>Pembatasan-pembatasan akibat pandemi, yang berujung pada kian sempitnya kesempatan, telah menimbulkan persaingan yang jauh lebih ketat bagi mereka dalam memperoleh pekerjaan atau tawaran manggung.</p>
<p>Kini, ketika situasi pandemi COVID-19 di Indonesia mulai menunjukkan secercah asa dan banyak daerah perlahan membuka diri, acara-acara skala kecil dengan protokol kesehatan yang ketat akhirnya diperbolehkan.</p>
<p>Pengamat seperti Bens yakin bahwa panggung dangdut akan kembali menggelora dengan begitu banyaknya pelaku industri ini yang merasa bahwa mereka “sudah punya DNA dangdut.”</p>
<p>Ia percaya para seniman dangdut kemungkinan besar akan kembali tampil seiring datangnya lebih banyak tawaran dari berbagai pihak.</p>
<p>Netha, sang biduan dangdut yang kini berjualan makanan, tak ragu-ragu mengungkapkan keinginannya untuk kembali pamer suara jika peluang itu kembali terbuka.</p>
<p>Akan tetapi, dia bersikeras bahwa bisnis kulinernya akan diutamakan, dan berdendang dangdut akan ia lakukan sesekali saja.</p>
<p>“Kalau panggung hiburan kan tiap tahun akan ada pendatang baru, jadi saya mau fokus ke usaha kuliner. Syukur-syukur kalau bisa menjalankan dua-duanya,” ujar Netha. </p>
<p>Kibordis Agus dan gitaris Listyo juga berharap pandemi akan benar-benar berakhir dalam waktu dekat, sehingga mereka dapat kembali ke panggung.</p>
<p>Bagi sebagian individu seperti Novi yang telah menekuni bidang lain, kembali ke alunan melodi dan gelora goyang dangdut tak lagi jadi pilihan.</p>
<p>“Saya udah melupakan dunia gemerlap itu, karena yang saya rasain, bahagia itu enggak harus hidup mewah.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Japan's November retail sales rise for second month </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Japan's retail sales rose faster than expected in November, thanks to decreasing COVID-19 cases in the month, which have encouraged shoppers to ramp up spending on goods and services.</p>
<p>Retail sales gained 1.9 per cent in November from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday (Dec 27), faster than economists' median forecast for a 1.7 per cent gain and the 0.9 per cent advance in October.</p>
<p>To support the economy, the government on Friday approved a record US$940 billion budget for fiscal 2022, including cash payouts to families and businesses hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Prospects of a consumption-led recovery, however, are clouded by uncertainties around the new Omicron coronavirus variant, which started to spread in the community last week in Japan's largest cities.</p>
<p>"So far, consumers haven't been too concerned with the Omicron as foot traffic data still shows increase," said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.</p>
<p>The government said on Thursday it was not considering immediate changes to domestic COVID-19 restrictions due to the Omicron.</p>
<p>"But if new infections jump...there is a risk, or a likelihood at this point, that consumption will be suppressed by the Omicron," Koike said, adding returning travellers during the holiday season could spread infections.</p>
<p>Compared with the previous month, retail sales increased 1.2 per cent in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a downwardly revised 1 per cent rise in October.</p>
<p>After the government lifted curbs in September, nationwide daily COVID-19 cases in Japan fell to fewer than one per million people earlier this month.</p>
<p>No restrictions have been reinstated, other than strict border controls to stop the spread of the new Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The world's third-largest economy is set to rebound by an annualised 6.1 per cent in the current quarter from a 3.6 per cent slump in July-September, according to the latest Reuters poll of economists.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Bangladesh arrests ferry owner after blaze that killed 39 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>DHAKA: Bangladesh police on Monday (Dec 27) arrested the owner of an overcrowded ferry that caught fire and killed at least 39 people last week, after investigators blamed the toll on a disregard for safety.</p>
<p>The blaze broke out in the middle of the night on Friday when many of the ferry's 700 passengers were sleeping near the southern district of Barguna.</p>
<p>Survivors relayed harrowing stories of having to jump into the Sugandha river from the three-storey ferry, which was only designed to carry 420 people.</p>
<p>Most of the victims burnt to death while others drowned in frigid waters while trying to escape.</p>
<p>Ferry owner Hum Jalal Sheikh was arrested Monday, a police spokesman told reporters, a day after a court issued an arrest warrant for eight people including the captain and crew of the Obhijaan-10.</p>
<p>Marine police officer Mahbubur Rahman said the vessel did not have adequate fire extinguishers and buoys to face a major mid-river accident.</p>
<p>"We spoke to the survivors and they said the driver of the ferry kept the vessel moving for nearly an hour after its engine room caught fire," he told AFP.</p>
<p>"Had they stopped the ferry and anchored immediately, it could have saved all these valuable lives."</p>
<p>Experts in Bangladesh blame poor maintenance, lax safety standards at shipyards and overcrowding for the South Asian nation's frequent maritime disasters.</p>
<p>At least 21 people were killed in August when a boat packed with passengers collided with a sand-laden cargo ship.</p>
<div> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h5> Heavy snow causes travel chaos in Japan </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Heavy snow causes travel chaos in Japan </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Heavy snow caused traffic jams, flight cancellations and disruption to train services in central Japan on Monday (Dec 27), with record drifts recorded in some areas.</p>
<p>More than 3,200 households have been left without power in the region, according to Kansai Electric Power, as officials warned more snow was forecast overnight.</p>
<p>No injuries or deaths due to the freezing weather have yet been confirmed, government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno said.</p>
<p>"A strong winter pressure pattern is causing heavy snow, mainly along the Sea of Japan side of the country from northern to western Japan, with some areas experiencing record snowfall," Matsuno said.</p>
<p>"The amount of snow is expected to increase tomorrow ... increased caution and vigilance are still required."</p>
<p>A major road in the Shiga region was closed "due to stranded vehicles", Matsuno said, with TV footage showing long lines of stationary cars that later began to move.</p>
<p>The traffic snarl-up reportedly began when a truck slipped near Hikone city, where 68cm of snow fell in 24 hours to this morning - 30 times deeper than average - according to public broadcaster NHK.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 passengers were snowed in overnight on a local train line in the region, NHK said.</p>
<p>Around 130 domestic flights were cancelled on Sunday due to the snow, Jiji Press said, with NHK reporting some 50 cancellations on Monday.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysia seeks UN climate adaptation funds amid deadly floods </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<a>deadly floods</a> that have displaced nearly 70,000 people this month.
<p>The funds requested are paltry relative to the amount the country has pledged to spend on flood mitigation efforts, though experts say the plan's implementation would likely cost much more.</p>
<p>Since Dec 18, torrential rain has caused <a>severe flooding</a> that killed at least 48 people in eight Malaysian states, prompting calls for the government to improve its preparedness to extreme weather events.</p>
<p>The plan will focus on areas such as water, agricultural, and food security, public health, forestry, and infrastructure, Zaini said in a written response.</p>
<p>"The ministry also has long-term plans to request for climate funds that can assist in implementing programs addressing the impact of climate change," he said.</p>
<p>Zaini did not give specific details on the adaptation plan, or how much the government would need to implement it.</p>
<p>The GCF funds are the first time the Malaysian government has sought any money for climate adaptation, which are policies that a country puts in place to deal with climate change effects.</p>
<p>The funds pale in comparison to the RM9.8 billion (US$2.33 billion) for flood mitigation projects such as building water barriers, catchment areas, and deepening rivers that Zaini said Malaysia has set aside already.</p>
<p>"Adaptation will take much more funds compared to mitigation because we need to overhaul our urban planning, all these costly infrastructure projects," said Ili Nadiah Dzulfakar, a co-founder of climate activist group Klima Action Malaysia.</p>
<p>A draft adaptation plan should examine the interaction of flooding or droughts on food security and crop yields and the need for energy efficient healthcare services with strong communication systems, she said.</p>
<p>In 2018, Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia's then-environment minister, proposed a so-called Climate Change Act along with an adaptation strategy but a formal plan was never submitted to the parliament and progress faltered amid political turmoil in 2020.</p>
<p>Malaysia typically has flooding on its eastern coasts that are exposed to the northeast monsoon between October and March.</p>
<p>But authorities were caught off-guard by unusually heavy rainfall and flooding this month in highly-populated urban areas in its western and central regions, which some experts say were worsened by poor drainage and overdevelopment.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> South Korea authorises emergency use of Pfizer's oral COVID-19 treatment </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SEOUL: South Korea authorised for emergency use Pfizer's antiviral pills targeting COVID-19 as the first of its kind to be introduced in South Korea, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said on Monday (Dec 27).</p>
<a>restored tough distancing curbs</a> last week after easing them in November, after a series of record daily new infections and serious cases stretched medical services, despite a vaccination rate of over 92 per cent for those aged 18 or older.
<p>The drug will be used for adults or children 12 years or older weighing over 40kg with mild to moderate symptoms with a high risk of developing a severe case of coronavirus due to causes such as underlying diseases.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> China's local COVID-19 cases edge higher as Xi'an enters 5th day of lockdown </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: China's local symptomatic coronavirus cases crept up again, with most new infections reported in the northwestern city of Xi'an as it entered a fifth day of a lockdown.</p>
<p>Residents are banned from driving cars around town, with no vehicles are allowed on the roads unless they are assisting with disease control work.</p>
<p>Police and health officials will "strictly inspect" cars, and those who break the rules could face 10 days' detention and a fine of 500 yuan (US$78), according to a city government social media account.</p>
<p>The <a>latest outbreak</a> has led to 635 local confirmed cases in Xi'an, a city of 13 million people, during the Dec 9 to Dec 26 period, with no Omicron variant infections yet reported.</p>
<p>Across China, a total of 162 domestically transmitted COVID-19 infections with confirmed symptoms were reported for Sunday, up from 158 a day earlier, according to official data on Monday. No deaths were reported for Sunday.</p>
<p>The new case number marks the highest count of local symptomatic infections since the daily bulletin provided by the National Health Commission started to classify asymptomatic carriers separately from end-March 2020.</p>
<p>China had 101,277 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic as of end Dec 26, including domestically transmitted ones as well as those found among international travellers. The death toll remained at 4,636.</p>
<p>Xi'an has launched a city-wide disinfection campaign, with staffers spraying pathogen-killing solutions on surfaces of roads and buildings. Residents are advised not to touch plants after the disinfection.</p>
<p>It also started a new round of mass testing on Monday, urging residents to stay at home except for having their sample collected.</p>
<p>Xianyang city and Weinan city, also in the Shaanxi province where Xi'an is based, reported one local symptomatic case respectively for Sunday. Local infections were also found in Guangxi region and the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong and Sichuan.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Beijing will draw conclusions from Washington’s reaction to Russia on Ukraine </h1>
<div> <p>Ukraine is not Taiwan, but Russia’s actions, and more importantly Washington’s response, may hold lessons for East Asia, says Christian Le Miere.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Le Miere </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: As Russian troops gather to the east of Ukraine, Europe is desperately trying to garner whether an invasion is likely and how to prevent it. </p>
<p>In Asia, the potential invasion of Ukraine has fewer direct strategic effects, but it does have comparative points of interest for the region’s own flashpoints. </p>
<p>Two in particular stick out: Whether the US will be able to deter Russian aggression or support Ukraine if necessary, and how the push towards deepening alliances is inherently destabilising. </p>
<h2>ALLIANCES CAN BE STABLISING AND DEBSTABILISING</h2>
<p>Ukraine is not Taiwan. The history, status, geography and many other factors make the two entities highly distinct. </p>
<p>Russian intervention in Ukraine does not make Chinese intervention in Taiwan any more or less likely. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ukraine offers a useful data point for other areas of tension in Asia. </p>
<p>In Asia, China is also viewing with concern how the US is strengthening its alliances and defence relationships with entities in dispute with Beijing, from Taiwan to Japan and Vietnam. </p>
<p>The European example suggests that a mutual defence alliance such as NATO can be a stabilising factor in geopolitics once it has been created. </p>
<p>While such alliances can thus be stabilising, the process of alliance creation can be destabilising. The change in status quo and shift in relative power creates security concerns in one or more parties. </p>
<p>The window between indicating a change in the alliance and actual creation of that alliance presents an opportunity for rivals to try and affect the outcome to their liking. </p>
<p>The other side of the Eurasian landmass, similar dynamics may now be playing out. </p>
<p>One such example of this change in US alliance posture in the region is Taiwan, where Washington has augmented its diplomacy and offered greater rhetorical support. </p>
<p>For Beijing, the possibility that the US might more directly deploy its forces to defend Taiwan complicates its own defence planning and makes a campaign to reincorporate the island much more challenging. </p>
<p>As such, this incremental alliance formation is for the time being a destabilising factor in cross-strait relations, unless and until the US is able to demonstrate a more solid deterrence capability and commitment to Taiwan’s defence. </p>
<p>Ukraine may also stand as a useful lesson for East Asia as it reflects on US resolve to defend partners and deter rivals. </p>
<p>In response to the Russian build-up, the US has threatened punishing sanctions and support for Ukraine’s military, including a potential post-invasion insurgency, should Moscow invade. </p>
<p>The US’ overall reaction to Russia’s actions will set the tone for its relationship with Moscow, but also provide indicators for Beijing. </p>
<p>Three factors are worth considering: Whether or not the US is able to deter Russia; whether US resolve to defend Ukraine is robust and whether Washington is willing to make concessions to Russia’s demands to prevent conflict. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the danger exists that a feeble response by the US may be seen as encouragement in Beijing to consider riskier actions in a range of theatres. </p>
<h2>STABILITY IN EAST ASIA NOT COMPARABLE WITH SITUATION IN UKRAINE</h2>
<p>If the US is willing to allow Russia to bully and invade its neighbour, and a potential NATO country at that, would it be perturbed by China taking further islands in the South China Sea from Vietnam or Taiwan in a limited operation? </p>
<p>So, the thinking may be in Beijing, if Washington is not willing to risk too much for Ukraine, would it really risk everything for tiny islands thousands of miles from its shores? </p>

<p>KAYAH, Myanmar: A handful of Myanmar nurses hiding from the junta have been running makeshift clinics to treat COVID-19 patients and resistance fighters with medicine smuggled past military checkpoints.</p>
<p>A boycott of government institutions has left many hospitals without staff and the junta has arrested and killed scores of protesting health workers, rights groups say.</p>
<p>Aye Naing - not her real name - left her job in a public hospital soon after the coup and in June began volunteering in Kayah state in Myanmar's east, where the military and anti-coup fighters have clashed repeatedly.</p>
<p>"When the fighting starts, we have to run and hide in the jungle," she told AFP at a clinic housed at a school abandoned because of fighting near the town of Demoso.</p>
<p>After a devastating COVID-19 wave in June and July - where new daily cases peaked at 40,000 - the junta has said new infections are down to around 150 per day, and that the Omicron variant is yet to appear in Myanmar.</p>
<p>But with the struggling <a>health system in shambles</a>, limited testing is being done.</p>
<p>In Kayah, around 85,000 people have been displaced by the violence, according to the UN's refugee agency, with many crowded into camps where infections spread easily.</p>
<p>Most of Aye Naing's patients are displaced families, she said, as well as fighters from local People's Defense Force (PDF) groups - militias that have sprung up across the country to fight the junta.</p>
<p>"I was told there weren't many doctors and medical workers in this area, and that villagers were asking for them," she said.</p>
<p>"So, I made the decision to come, and tried to get hold of some medical supplies."</p>
<p>At one village, her team conducts swab tests through a small tear in a sheet of plastic stretched over a bamboo frame.</p>
<p>Those who test positive are prescribed paracetamol or vitamins, the only medicine on offer.</p>
<p>Donated oxygen must be used sparingly: refilling canisters involves a trip to the closest large town, passing junta checkpoints along the way.</p>
<p>After each shift, Aye Naing removes her plastic protective suit and disinfects it, along with her mask, ready for the next one.</p>
<p>In an empty classroom, an infected PDF fighter sits out his quarantine strumming a guitar.</p>
<p>In areas where resistance to its rule is strong, the military has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical supplies, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report.</p>
<p>"Burmese military check everyone at their gates and arrest people they find carrying medicines," said Hla Aung, another nurse working at the clinic whose name has been changed to protect her identity.</p>
<p>"It's like we are risking our lives."</p>
<p>In the six months following the coup, 190 health workers were arrested and 25 killed, according to a report by Insecurity Insight, Physicians for Human Rights, and Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>But Aye Naing said she will keep going.</p>
<p>"My parents' support keeps me strong," she said.</p>
<p>"My father has sent as much medicine as he can."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> UN 'horrified' by reports of massacre of civilians in Myanmar </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>UNITED NATIONS: A UN official said on Sunday (Dec 26) he was "horrified" by credible reports that <a>at least 35 civilians were killed</a> and their bodies burned in Myanmar, and demanded the government launch an investigation.</p>
<p>Two workers for non-profit group Save the Children <a>remain missing</a> after their vehicle was among several that were attacked and burned in the incident in eastern Kaya state.</p>
<p>A monitoring group and local media have blamed the attack on military troops.</p>
<p>"I condemn this grievous incident and all attacks against civilians throughout the country," United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths said in a statement.</p>
<p>He called for "a thorough and transparent investigation".</p>
<p>Myanmar has been in chaos since a February coup, with more than 1,300 people killed in a crackdown by security forces, according to a local monitoring group.</p>
<p>"People's Defence Forces" (PDF) have sprung up across the country to fight the military government, and have drawn the military into a bloody stalemate of clashes and reprisals.</p>
<p>On Saturday, photos appeared on social media purporting to show two burned-out trucks and a car on a highway in Hpruso township in Kayah state, with the charred remains of bodies inside.</p>
<p>A member of a local PDF group said its fighters had found the vehicles Saturday morning after hearing the military had stopped several vehicles in Hpruso after clashes with its fighters nearby on Friday.</p>
<p>"When we went to check in the area this morning, we found dead bodies burnt in two trucks. We found 27 dead bodies," he told AFP on condition of anonymity Saturday.</p>
<p>"We found 27 skulls," said another witness who did not want to be named, and who said there were other dead bodies that could not be counted.</p>
<p>Save the Children said later Saturday that two of its Myanmar staff had been "caught up" in the incident and were missing.</p>
<p>The two had been travelling home after carrying out humanitarian work in the region, the charity said in a statement, adding it had since suspended its work in several regions.</p>
<p>Myanmar's military government previously said its troops had been attacked in Hpruso on Friday after attempting to stop seven cars driving in a "suspicious way".</p>
<p>Troops had killed a number of people in the following clash, spokesman Zaw Min Tun told AFP, without giving details.</p>
<p>The Myanmar Witness monitor said it had confirmed local media reports and witness accounts from local fighters "that 35 people including children and women were burnt and killed by the military on 24th December Hpruso township".</p>
<p>Satellite data also showed a fire had occurred around 1pm on Friday in Hpruso, it added.</p>
<p>AFP was unable to confirm the reports surrounding the clash, but AFP digital verification reporters said the images purporting to show the incident had not appeared online before Friday evening.</p>
<p>PDF groups have surprised the army with their effectiveness, analysts have said, as the military struggles to break resistance to its rule.</p>

<p>CIANJUR, West Java: Erawati looked at a picture of her deceased daughter Sarah.</p>
<p>“She was a good person, she never did unusual things,” the 48-year-old woman said when CNA met her at her home in Cianjur earlier this month.</p>
<p>Her daughter was found lying on the front porch of her house last month, after being allegedly splashed with acid by her 48-year-old husband, who is now in police custody. Their marriage lasted for merely six weeks.</p>
<p>Ms Sarah, who went by one name, died on the same day, less than three weeks from her 21st birthday. The case sparked a national outcry on the protection of women who are in contract marriages.</p>
<p>Such marriages are controversial. They are not legally recognised by the state and are said to involve financial remuneration, sexual exploitation and even human trafficking.</p>
<p>In Ms Sarah’s case, she received 150 million rupiah (US$10,500) as dowry. Written on a piece of paper, the groom also promised to pay one billion rupiah “if promises are not kept and for example, (if) I file for a divorce”.</p>
<p>Local and national authorities are cognisant of the need to stamp out such marriages. However, there are hurdles to implementation and the commitment of multiple agencies is needed.</p>
<h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS CONTRACT MARRIAGE? </h2>
<p>According to Devie Rahmawati, a social issues researcher with the University of Indonesia, such arrangements have been taking place in tourist destinations like Puncak in Bogor and Cianjur in West Java since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>They often involve middlemen and the weddings are done in accordance with Islamic nuptial requirements known in Indonesia as nikah siri. However, such marriages are not recognised by the state.</p>
<p>Research also showed that such marriages have been happening in some parts of Central Java, Mdm Rahmawati added.</p>
<p>Head of the national commission of violence against women Andy Yentriyani added that contract marriages put women at risk.</p>
<p>She also asserted that every religion views marriage as an honourable institution, as it is fundamental in the formation of families, which are the foundations for society. </p>
<p>“I think not a single religion wants a marriage to be treated arbitrarily just to legalise a sexual relationship,” said Mdm Yentriyani.</p>
<p>Cianjur locals interviewed by CNA said that contract marriages do happen in the community.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are quite a few of them here,” said Cianjur based snack-seller Syahdan, who goes by one name.</p>
<p>“Perhaps some of them believe it is better to be in such marriages than having premarital sex which is haram, or hiring prostitutes which could expose them to diseases such as AIDS, so they choose contract marriage.</p>
<p>“But on the other hand, there are also disadvantages … There have been cases when the women were demanding and just left their husbands or vice versa,” the 21-year-old said. </p>
<p>Ms Irma, 23, also confirmed that there are some people in her village who are in contract marriages. “I don’t approve of it though, because it is fake,” said the woman, who also goes by one name.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mdm Erawati argued that strictly speaking, Ms Sarah was not wed via a contract marriage. She said that while there was a financial arrangement, the marriage with the foreigner did not have an agreed time frame.</p>
<h2>WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SO FAR</h2>
<p>In an interview with CNA, Cianjur regent Herman Suherman said there have been many instances of contract marriage in his regency, particularly in the districts of Cipanas, Pacet and Sukaresmi. </p>
<p>“But people don’t want to admit it openly, perhaps because it might be a disgrace or shame. </p>
<p>“There are many people who have been affected by it, lured by a certain amount of money. They only see the (financial) gains, but actually, there are many who have suffered from it,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Suherman said that some women have given birth to children as a result of the practice, only to be abandoned by the men. </p>
<p>He also claimed there are cases where women entered contract marriages thinking that it would be a monogamous arrangement, only to find out that they had to satisfy the sexual needs of several men.</p>
<p>Mr Suherman issued a regency-wide regulation in July banning contract marriages. </p>
<p>He stated that the practice goes against the purpose of marriages under Indonesian law. Under national laws, the purpose of marriage is to form a happy family that is eternal and based on divinity of the Almighty.</p>
<p>The Cianjur regency regulation also states that contract marriage “is very detrimental to society, especially women and Islamic law”. </p>
<p>However, the regulation does not spell out clear sanctions since a regent level instruction cannot enforce criminal punishments. Typically, it only serves as an appeal to the public.</p>
<p>Cianjur’s government also formed an anti contract marriage task force that aims to combat the practice by going on patrols. But as Indonesia was experiencing a deadly wave of COVID-19 cases in July, the task force became idle. </p>
<p>Shortly after Sarah’s case was reported, Cianjur’s government reactivated it to educate people that contract marriage is prohibited. The task force was also asked to seek out the actors involved.</p>
<p>One of its members, Mdm Rina Mardiah, recently went undercover during a patrol mission.</p>
<p>“Some people say contract marriage doesn’t exist anymore, but actually when we went undercover we found out it still exists.</p>
<p>“We went to three different locations … and we found a victim, a perpetrator and a pimp,” said Mdm Mardiah.</p>
<p>As the task force cannot arrest and prosecute offenders, they had to let them go. But she said these people will be watched closely.</p>
<p>She said that contract marriage can be considered human trafficking, as the women are often tricked into it. Often, they were offered a job only to be sold to a man.</p>
<p>Mdm Mardiah recounted the case of a 17-year-old girl who was promised a job but ended up in a contract marriage.</p>
<p>“Luckily, she managed to run away two or three days after the wedding. But she never told her parents about the incident and she refused to disclose the details to people out of fear and embarrassment,” she said. </p>
<p>If a case is proven as human trafficking, the police can take follow up actions.</p>
<p>Still, Mdm Mardiah opined it would be useful to have regulation at the provincial level banning contract marriages and imposing sanctions.</p>
<p>Head of Cianjur’s police criminal investigation unit Assistant Commissioner Septiawan Adi told CNA that the unit cannot handle contract marriage cases since there is no legal basis for it to act. </p>
<p>Last week, Bogor regent Ade Yasin said she intended to ban contract marriages and is mulling over whether to introduce a regency wide regulation.</p>
<h2>HURDLES TO TACKLING THE ISSUE</h2>
<p>At the national level, the murder case has sparked awareness on the need to act against contract marriages. But government agencies are also cognisant that there are hurdles to implementation. </p>
<p>Mr Adib Machrus, the director responsible for peaceful family development in the ministry of religious affairs said his ministry views contract marriage as “illegal, invalid, prohibited by law.” </p>
<p>However, he told CNA that it is not easy for the ministry to track down contract marriages. In most instances, there are no religious affairs officers involved when nikah siri is carried out, he said.</p>
<p>The religious affairs ministry also encourages everyone to wed in a legal manner as recognised by the state, he added. </p>
<p>Ideally, there should be a law that is specifically targeted at contract marriages but she is cognisant that it would take time and effort to get it passed in the parliament. </p>
<p>“The most important thing right now is to ensure prevention. How to make a movement starting from the family as the smallest unit in the society as the main pillar.</p>
<p>"This is the key, how we build communication between parents and children, among the children and anyone who lives in the family."</p>
<p>Mdm Susianawati visited Cianjur in September to raise awareness about women and children protection, including the prevention of contract marriages.</p>
<p>Mdm Rahmawati of the University of Indonesia shared similar views. She said it is important to remind everyone about their individual rights and responsibilities as human beings.</p>
