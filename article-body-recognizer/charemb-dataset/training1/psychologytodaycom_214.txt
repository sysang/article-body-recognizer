<p>Compartmentalization is a defense mechanism in which people mentally separate conflicting thoughts, emotions, or experiences to avoid the discomfort of contradiction.</p>
<p>That uncomfortable state is called cognitive dissonance, and it’s one that humans try to avoid, by modifying certain beliefs or behaviors or through strategies like compartmentalization.</p>
<p>For example, someone might compartmentalize conflicting values if he feels strongly about environmentalism and climate change yet finds a job as a logger.</p>
<h2> Compartmentalization in Therapy and Mental Health </h2>
<p>Compartmentalization is not inherently negative—sometimes you need to put one conflict or aside in order to tackle another challenge. But in some instances, compartmentalization can be indicative of a deeper problem.</p>
<p>Working with a therapist can allow people to acknowledge inner conflict and perhaps change their behavior for the better.</p>

<h2> How to Prevent Relapse </h2>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy (CBT) can help people overcome the fears and
<a>negative thinking</a> that can trigger relapse.
<p>Experts in the recovery process believe that relapse is a process and that identifying its stages can help people take preventative action. </p>
<a>attention</a> to self-care, their isolation, or their inconsistent attendance at therapy sessions or group meetings sets them up for relapse. This is when an individual needs self-care, sleep, and healthy eating.

<h2> What Does a Relapse Mean? </h2>
<h2> What Defines a Relapse? </h2>
<h2> Why Does Relapse Happen? </h2>
<div> <h3> Is it normal to relapse? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> When is relapse most likely to occur? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What causes relapse? </h3> </div>
<p>Physical Relapse. Once a person begins drinking or taking drugs, it’s hard to stop the process. Good treatment programs recognize the relapse process and teach people workable exit strategies from such experiences.</p>
<div> <h3> What are common triggers for relapse? </h3> </div>
<p>• The discomfort of withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>• Unpleasant feelings including hunger, anger, <a>loneliness</a>, and fatigue.</p>
<p>• Feeling isolated. Being alone with one’s thoughts for too long can lead to relapse.</p>
<p>• Seeing old friends who still use drugs.</p>
<p>• Finding oneself in places associated with past drug use.</p>
<p>• Over-<a>confidence</a> that everything is under control.</p>
<div> <h3> What does it mean if you relapse? </h3> </div>
<p>A lapse or relapse should be regarded as a signal to:</p>
<p>• Manage triggers.</p>
<p>• Build a support network of friends and family to call on when struggling and who are invested in recovery.</p>
<p>• Avoid situations where people are likely to use drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>• Learn ways of managing stress.</p>
<a>catastrophizing</a> and set the stage for relapse.
<div> <h3> Why do people relapse when things are good? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Will I always be in danger of relapsing? </h3> </div>
<h2> What to Do If You Relapse </h2>
<h2> Learning from Relapse </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the best way of dealing with craving? </h3> </div>
<p>Helpful techniques include:</p>
<p>• Accept. Recognize that cravings are inevitable and do not mean that a person is doing something wrong.</p>
<p>• Delay. Tough it out. It will pass.</p>
<p> • Distract. Go for a walk, take a shower, play music, play a video game, call someone in your support network.</p>
<p>• Escape. If you are at a gathering where provocation arises because alcohol or other substances are available, leave. Cravings can intensify in settings where the substance is available and use is possible.</p>
<p>• Go for a walk or run or other exercise. It’s not only works as a distraction but also bolsters the ability to summon the power of judgment and other regulatory functions.</p>
<p>• Engage in mindfulness meditation. Learning techniques of mindfulness allows you to distance yourself from the e craving and examine it rather than automatically accept its command.</p>
<div> <h3> Why is sleep so important? </h3> </div>
<p>Sleep deprivation undermines recovery in indirect ways as well. It weakens emotional control. It intensifies the effects of stress. It exacerbates depression and <a>anxiety</a>. And it robs people of the energy needed to rebuild their life.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I know if my need for drugs stems from emotional pain? </h3> </div>
<a>adverse childhood experiences</a> (ACEs) such as trauma, especially when combined with a chaotic
<a>psychotherapy</a> and a primary reason why it is considered so important in recovery. Therapy not only gives people insight into their vulnerabilities but teaches them healthy tools for handling emotional distress.
<h2> Overcoming Hopelessness and Shame </h2>
<p>It is possible to overcome shame—by releasing it. Shame diminishes as recovery proceeds. Neuroscientist Adi Jaffe, who himself overcame severe addiction, identifies five steps for doing so:</p>
<p>1. Identify important past events that gave rise to negative beliefs about yourself.</p>
<p>2. Inventory personal strengths as well as weaknesses.</p>
<p>3. Identify features in your life—relationships, work—that can help take the focus off addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>4. Shift perspective to see relapse and other “failures” as opportunities to learn.</p>
<p>5. Choose to get help, even though shame often deters people from doing so.</p>
<h2> Maintaining Recovery/Preventing Relapse </h2>
<div> <h3> How do I know what are high-risk situations? </h3> </div>
<p>Some situations are predictably problematic.</p>
<p>The following situations are among the most common causes of relapse:</p>
<p>• exposure to environmental cue related to drug use</p>
<p>• interpersonal difficulties</p>
<p>• lack of social support</p>
<p>• pain due to injuries or medical problems</p>
<p>• lack of a sense of <a>self-efficacy</a></p>
<div> <h3> How do I handle high-risk situations? </h3> </div>
<p>Avoidance is an excellent coping strategy if you know that you are likely to run into danger. Of course, that requires understanding what your triggers are. But life is often unpredictable and it’s not always possible to avoid difficulty.</p>
<p>One way of ensuring <a>recovery from addiction</a> is to remember the acronym DEADS, shorthand for an array of skills to deploy when faced with a difficult situation—delay, escape, avoid, distract, and substitute.</p>
<p>• Avoid. Some events or experiences can be avoided with a polite excuse.</p>
