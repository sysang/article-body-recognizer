<div><div><p>I like the addition of leafy greens in this version of the Niçoise chickpea pancakes known as soccas, but if you’d rather make a classic version, substitute 1/2 cup of water for the greens.</p></div></div>

<a>stories of outbreaks</a>, customers isolating in their cabins and ports turning away ships evoked conditions that brought cruising to a halt in March 2020, albeit without the severe cases or deaths that
<a>marked the first wave of the pandemic</a>. Cruise lines have imposed stricter measures since the omicron variant’s discovery, and no industry-wide pause appears to be in sight.
<a>conditional sailing order</a> to expire as planned on Jan. 15. At that point, the restrictions imposed for pandemic-era cruising
<a>will become recommendations</a>.
<div><div><p>On Thursday, the agency announced it was escalating the travel health notice for the industry from Level 3 to Level 4, suggesting that all travelers — even if vaccinated — <a>should avoid taking cruises</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Cruise passengers on holiday trips deal with outbreaks: ‘We’re sailing on a petri dish’</p></div>
<div><div><p>In light of the most recent outbreaks, at least one lawmaker is calling for a second shutdown on cruises.</p></div></div>
<a>tweeted</a> Tuesday. “Cruises are repeating recent history as petri dishes of COVID infection.”

<a>said</a> should give passengers peace of mind. Those measures evolved — especially after the emergence of the
<a>delta</a> variant in late summer — to include coronavirus vaccine requirements for most or all passengers, pre-cruise testing and masking in some crowded indoor areas, even for the vaccinated.
<div><div><p>Cruise lines say they are reacting to the omicron variant with additional requirements, namely mask rules indoors for everyone unless they are eating, drinking or in their own staterooms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>MSC Cruises said Tuesday that it will add — and pay for — an additional antigen test for all new passengers, either as they are boarding or once they’re onboard.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Cruises will no longer be required to follow CDC rules starting in January</p></div>
<div><div><p>In response to Blumenthal’s tweet Tuesday, Golin-Blaugrund said that cases on ships in recent weeks made up just a small percentage of the populations onboard and that no setting is immune from the virus.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Infectious-disease experts say the rules that cruise lines have in place are very good — but not perfect.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Thomas Russo, professor and chief of the division of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo, had a Baltic cruise planned for this August and September that he postponed a year due to ports closing and logistics concerns.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said that although he enjoys cruises, now is not the time for anyone who is immunocompromised or at high risk of severe disease — advice the CDC also gives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it’s a hard pass on cruises right now” for that population, he said. “Just be patient, wait until this current wave passes.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>You asked: Are cruises safe from covid?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Jessica Justman, an infectious-diseases specialist and epidemiologist at Columbia University, has a family member on a Caribbean cruise now.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Justman said if she were considering a cruise, she would want one that mandated vaccination and boosters for everyone, as well as testing twice a week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, cruise companies and observers say they are seeing some short-term cancellations in light of the omicron surge, but solid longer-term demand has persisted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Colleen McDaniel, editor in chief of <a>Cruise Critic</a>, said members of her site’s active online community are “reevaluating” what they want to do.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we’re seeing right now is pretty substantial discussion about it,” she said. Some plan to still go, others are planning to reschedule until the summer.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Still, Schattauer said she didn’t want to cancel. She feels comfortable with the cruise line’s mask policy and other safety measures.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hopefully with the stricter protocols and mask rules, we’ll see less cases than we’ve seen on a few cruise ships that have recently been in the spotlight,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that all travelers — even those who are vaccinated — should avoid cruises.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, the agency said cruise lines reported 5,013 <a>coronavirus</a> cases on ships operating in U.S. waters between Dec. 15 and 29, a massive increase from the 162 cases reported over the previous two weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The CDC escalated the travel health notice for cruising from Level 3 to 4, its highest. Previously, the agency advised that people who were not fully vaccinated or those at increased risk of severe illness should not cruise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This reflects increases in cases onboard cruise ships since identification of the Omicron variant,” the CDC said<b> </b>on its <a>website</a>. The agency last lowered its warning from Level 4 to Level 3 on June 17.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The update comes as 91 ships carrying passengers from U.S. waters have <a>reported</a> cases over the past seven days and met the threshold for CDC investigation, according to a tally updated Thursday using data submitted by cruise lines.</p></div>

<header><div/><div><h1>Every U.S. cruise with passengers has coronavirus cases on board</h1></div><h2>The CDC has opened investigations into 92 ships</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:43 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Coronavirus cases have been <a>reported</a> on every cruise ship sailing with passengers in U.S. waters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The number of ships under investigation had grown sharply in recent days, but it wasn’t until Tuesday’s update, using data submitted by cruise lines Monday, that every ship reached that level.</p></div></div>
<a>warned</a> all travelers, including those who are vaccinated, to avoid cruise ships. The advice came after the agency said the number of cases skyrocketed from 162 in the first two weeks of December to 5,013 between Dec. 15 and 29.
<div><p>CDC warns against cruise travel after 5,000 new cases in 2 weeks</p></div>
<div><div><p>Cruise lines are requiring all crew and most, if not all, passengers to be fully vaccinated to sail. Passengers also need proof of a recent negative test before boarding.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Since late December, several cruises have been <a>turned away</a> from ports because of passengers or crew on board testing positive. Most have continued on their journeys, even when they were forced to skip the stops they had planned.</p></div>
<a>confirmed</a> it was canceling a nine-day Caribbean voyage on Norwegian Getaway that was scheduled to leave Miami that day. The reason, according to the cruise line: “COVID related circumstances.”
<div><p>“We will never compromise on health and safety and we will of course, continue to take all appropriate action to ensure everyone’s well-being and to protect public health,” the company said in a <a>statement</a>.</p></div>
<header><div><h1>From airport WiFi to ‘juice jacking’: 7 ways to protect your data when traveling</h1></div><h2>Travel can be full of cybercrime land mines. Here are expert tips to avoid them. </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 22, 2021 at 4:48 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Whether your online data is locked down may be the last thing on your mind as you rush through the airport checking departure times and work emails.</p></div></div>
<a>Lookout</a>, points out that we may have been taught to install protections like anti-virus software on our computers, but our personal devices remain vulnerable — and a preferred entry point for cybercriminals.
<div><div><p>“They leverage the trust we have in these devices against us and know that they’re a treasure trove of personal and corporate data,” Schless said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the risks, “there are certainly ways to be safe,” said Paige Hanson, chief of cyber safety education at the anti-virus and security software company <a>Norton</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are seven ways travelers can protect themselves against hackers.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Let By The Way help you navigate travel dilemmas</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Scrutinize the public WiFi options before connecting</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The public WiFi we often rely on away from home can be filled with cybersecurity land mines. Places with lingering travelers — like airports, train stations and coffee shops — can be prime targets.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hanson said travelers should treat their public WiFi use “like someone is looking over your shoulder” and avoid logging into sensitive accounts such as your bank, medical provider or even social media.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to extend your flight credits and vouchers</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Use your own charger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another significant risk for travelers is using a charger that isn’t yours, Schless said. He warns against ever accepting a stranger’s offer to borrow their charging cord.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Attackers can exploit USB cords and load malicious software into them that loads itself onto your device the second you plug it in,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Testing French Bee’s new cheap flight from New York to Paris</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turn off auto-connect functions</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If your personal devices are programmed to auto-connect to WiFi networks, Hanson recommended turning that off while traveling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Additionally, she said, travelers should turn off their WiFi and Bluetooth when not in use for further protection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is an added bonus to turning off these settings: You’ll save precious battery power.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turn on account alerts before travel</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>To stay up to date on your accounts while traveling, Crockett told travelers to turn on alerts for their credit card and banking apps. Doing so will let the company alert you if there is unusual spending or log-ins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Crockett also advised travelers to know how to lock their debit or credit cards before hitting the road. If you lose or misplace them during the trip, you can lock them to prevent fraudulent use.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to cancel flights, hotels and other bookings due to variant concerns</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Add two-factor authentication or biometric log-ins</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Two-factor verification works</a> by requiring both a password and a unique code. Even if a hacker had your password, they would need to physically have one of your personal devices to get the code for the second step.
<div><div><p>Even better: Hanson suggests enabling biometrics — i.e., a fingerprint or face ID — to open your devices or apps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Consider a VPN</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hanson warned against using a free VPN. “If it’s free, you might be the product,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another option is downloading a security app for your phone to prevent mobile phishing attacks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That email asking for proof of vaccination might be a phishing scam</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Be wary of subscription renewal emails</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“On mobile devices, these campaigns can be executed across SMS, email, social media platforms, third-party chatting apps, gaming and even dating apps,” Schless said.</p></div></div>
<p>For example, Crane Hassold, director of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security, a cloud email security platform, said he has recently noticed cyberattacks targeting travelers by impersonating the Transportation Security Administration via email.</p>
<div><div><p>While TSA does send renewal reminder emails, travelers should go directly through the <a>TSA website</a> for information on their existing accounts.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 23, 2021 at 12:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Through the constant travel whiplash of 2021, we scrambled to keep up with border closures and testing requirements. We learned about new variants and vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We compiled that advice through our By The Way Concierge column, and to end the year, we’re revisiting our most helpful tips to prepare you for 2022 travels. And as always, <a>send us your latest dilemmas. </a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Are PreCheck, Global Entry or CLEAR still worth it?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Should I get TSA PreCheck or Global Entry? Are they worth it?</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><p>The airport can be so unpredictable these days. Any of these line-cutting services may be a godsend one day, and completely unnecessary the next. Your travel style and where you are traveling most may also be <a>part of the equation.</a></p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How should I handle holiday visits to unvaccinated households?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>How should I handle visits (after air travel) to households where some members are unvaccinated?</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While <a>the subject of vaccinations</a> with families can be a thorny subject during the holidays, experts agreed on some key tools to get you through it: tests, masks and gathering outside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>My Airbnb host won’t refund me. How can I get my money back?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Airbnb host refused to refund me even though Airbnb has asked multiple times. Am I entitled to a refund? I have met all the Extenuating Circumstances besides canceling the reservation myself.</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The airline rescheduled our flight. What can we do?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While a rescheduled flight is definitely a hassle, you might want to keep the new itinerary unless it significantly upsets travel plans. <a>Here’s why.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do I find a coronavirus test in a foreign country?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Please explain how you can obtain a coronavirus test for reentry to the U.S. when you do not know the location, cost, procedure or language to get this service.</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Packing <a>your own test may be the best move</a>, but many hotels offer to arrange testing to take some of the stress off travelers. The specifics will vary from property to property.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will travel insurance protect your trip as covid spreads?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Travel insurance is not one-size-fits-all. <a>Policies and what they cover can vary wildly</a>. And everyone’s will be priced differently. If you are looking for a policy that covers covid, you should expect to pay even more.</p></div>

<a>have steadily continued into the new year</a>. After U.S. airlines navigated the Thanksgiving bump relatively unscathed, this was the
<a>“messy” holiday travel</a> season some experts envisioned.
<a>omicron variant</a> for sending their crews to sick leave or isolation after being identified in contact tracing. Winter weather
<a>in the East Coast</a>, the Pacific Northwest and hub cities like Chicago and Atlanta has exacerbated the industry’s struggles, even as
<a>new guidance</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cutting isolation time in half.
<div><p>Back in the summer, a <a>chaotic travel season</a> rife with staffing shortages, By The Way <a>compiled a guide</a> for what to do if your flight gets canceled and how to get a refund you are owed. Here’s a helpful reminder.</p></div>
<div><p>Teachable moments from cancellation horror stories</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If your flight gets canceled</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bad news is your flight has been canceled. The good news is the airline owes you a refund; <a>Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations</a> entitle you to one.</p></div></div>
<a>inundated with requests</a> for months, pushing the DOT to crack down on wrongful denials and investigate delays in payment. In November, following an investigation into Air Canada, the airline reached a
<a>$4.5 million settlement</a> with DOT, saying it had provided $570 million in required refunds over the course of the pandemic.
<a>18 months starting in January 2020,</a> it received 124,918 consumer complaints related to air travel — more than 84 percent of which were about refunds. That compares with about 8 percent a year before the pandemic.
<div><p>How to get in touch with airlines in a hurry</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If your flight gets delayed</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Scott’s Cheap Flights</a> founder Scott Keyes. “If your flight were to get canceled, what are flights that this airline has that would work for me and my schedule?”
<div><div><p>Once you have picked a new flight that works for you, get on the phone with customer service and request it specifically.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s going to be much more fruitful than saying, ‘My flight got canceled, what do I do?’ ” Keyes said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron may be on your next flight. Here's how to protect yourself.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you want to be protected</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are a few things you can do to put yourself in a better position for this uncertain time of flying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Protecting yourself starts when you book the flight. Brian Kelly, the founder and chief executive of <a>the Points Guy</a>, recommends booking your flights with frequent flier miles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Most airline frequent-flier programs will actually refund your points and taxes and fees, so it’s kind of like buying a refundable ticket,” Kelly said. “They give you maximum flexibility.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Look for nonstop flights to your destination that depart earlier in the day. You will have fewer variables to deal with, and should something go wrong, you’ll have more rerouting options than if you were departing later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Keyes strongly urges travelers to skip checking a bag.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>What I learned about flying after surgery </h1></div>
<h2>Limited mobility, plus labor shortages, made an international trip challenging. But it is possible. </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Eileen Cho</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 12:20 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>With limited knowledge in hand, I managed to prepare for and get through 20 hours of travel but not without hitting a few snags along the way. Here’s what I learned on my journey and how you can plan for your own post-surgery trip.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Preflight</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>I also secured a protective boot for the trip, which ended up being essential because it allowed me to stand on two feet for the first time since surgery. It also offered protection from any abrupt contact made to my foot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Getting to the airport</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Check-in counter to the gate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because of my SkyPriority status, I was given access to the expedited immigration and security line. If I didn’t, I would have asked for it, which airlines allow on a case-by-case basis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The first leg</div></h3></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> protocols. I explained why I needed assistance, and the flight attendant came back with gloves on to help handle my bag.
<div><div><p>With aspirin, a raised foot, compression socks and massaging, I was able to endure the flight without too much discomfort.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The layover</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The last leg</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The lessons</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Reflecting on my experience, I didn’t think to factor in the labor shortage. And I wish I had known how important it is to confirm wheelchair assistance once seated on each flight and to have money to tip the assistance employees.</p></div>

<div>LOCALS THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW</div>
<li>Madrileños like to talk to people visiting their city. Don’t be afraid to ask them a question, especially if you are at a bar. You may just make a friend that feels lifelong, even if it’s only for one night.</li>
<li>You’ll find yourself wanting sunglasses. The sun is out year-round, even in winter, which is why the locals are accustomed to spending time out and about.</li>
<li>Most places will offer you a tapa with every drink you order. There’s no rule about it, but it’s a welcome perk.</li>

<div>Spend Sunday at the Rastro</div>
<div><b>BTW: </b><i>Look for Calle de los Mancebos. Find the remains of the medieval wall and sit under the palm tree to have a beer and watch the Madrileños.</i></div>
