<h2> Positive self-talk could help you regulate emotions and boost your performance. </h2>
<li>Positive self-talk involves talking to yourself (internally or out loud) in an encouraging way. </li>
<li>Research suggests that positive self-talk can aid athletes' performance.</li>
<li>Non-athletes can benefit from encouraging self-talk, too.</li>
<p>Our thoughts have a lot to do with how we respond to high-stakes moments. To up your performance game, we can turn to the sports psychology field for some much-needed coaching.</p>
<h3>What Does Science Say About Positive Self-Talk?</h3>
<a>athlete’s secret weapon</a>. A 2020 study of three 800-meter runners found evidence that using self-talk made them
<a>run faster and feel mentally tougher</a>. Their performances spoke for themselves, even if the athletes didn’t think their speed had changed in the moment.
<h3>How to Make Positive Self-Talk Work for You</h3>
<a>confidence</a>-boosting way. You might even add some coaching instructions. (Think Muhammad Ali and “Float like a butterfly; sting like a bee!”)
<p>This isn’t to say that only athletes can participate in and benefit from positive self-talk. You can try this method for yourself next time you’re about to give a performance. Here’s how to put positive self-talk to work for you.</p>

<p>1. Start early. Positive effects may be especially strong when you’re a novice.</p>
<a>career</a>, she and her coach came up with computerized self-talk exercises to help her redirect her negative self-talk. This helped her to stay focused and relaxed on the court.
<a>competition</a>-level athletes.
<p>2. When the task is simple, keep the self-talk simple: Just tell yourself you can do it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, your motivational self-talk doesn’t have to be as inspiring as the speech Coach Gary Gaines (played by Billy Bob Thorton) gives to the Permian Panthers in the 2004 movie <a>Friday Night Lights</a>. </p>
<a>memory</a> behind it, like striking a soccer ball or sprinting the 100-meter dash. You just have to hype yourself up a bit. In fact,
<a>slightly increase your heart rate</a>, but otherwise reduce sudden changes in your heart rate. This may help prepare your body for performance while keeping you steady.
<p>3. When the task is complex or new, talk yourself through what to do.</p>
<p>4. Don’t just wait for your <a>inner voice</a> to start talking—do it actively.</p>
<a>tends to be more positive and motivating</a>.
<p>Adapt this thinking to your own situation. Don’t wait for your inner voice to come up with encouragement. Feed it to yourself before your big moment.</p>
<p>5. Talk to yourself in the third person for better <a>emotion regulation</a>.</p>
<p>At first, you might feel silly doing it, but psychological science supports this practice!</p>
<a>emotion regulation in high-stakes situations</a>, any help we can get is a good thing.

<h1> 9 Tips to Save Your Politically Divided Friendships </h1>
<h2> Techniques from couples’ therapy could save friendships that cross party lines. </h2>
<li>The deeper the relationship, the more worthwhile it is to have meaningful conversations about core values.</li>
<li>Be willing to temporarily set aside political identifications and the desire to change someone's mind.</li>
<li>Challenge your assumptions and try your best to understand the other person's views. But remember that you're allowed to draw boundaries and stick to your morals.</li>
<p>The past few years, and perhaps especially the last one, have likely seen peak levels of family conflicts and friendship breakups over <a>politics</a>.</p>
<a>“just a few”</a> or no friends who voted for the opposite-party candidate in the 2020 elections. According to
<a>another poll</a>, 80 percent of Republicans believe “the other side” has been taken over by socialists, and 80 percent of Democrats believe “the other side” has been taken over by racists.
<a>therapy</a> could help you save them.

<h3>1. Determine your overarching goal for the relationship.</h3>
<p>Is this a close family member with whom you hope to have a relationship for decades to come? Is this a college acquaintance you’ll only interact with at your 10-year reunion?</p>
<a>climate change</a> with your waiter.
<h3>2. "Take off your jersey."</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided that having a political conversation is worthwhile for your relationship, you can mentally prepare before it starts.</p>
<a>I Think You’re Wrong (But I’m Listening)</a>. They suggest beginning a conversation about politics with a loved one by “taking off your jersey” and stepping away from identifying with a side.
<p>Neither of you is here as a Democrat or Republican. You’re both here as a genuinely curious friend or child or neighbor to discuss a specific issue, not debate party ideologies. </p>
<h3>3. Reimagine your goal.</h3>
<p>Let go of the idea that you’re going to change someone’s mind. It will immediately make you (and your conversation partner) a much easier person to talk to.</p>
<p>Instead, make your goal to understand why the other person feels the way they do. Don’t cheat by sneaking in an addendum goal, such as, “Once I understand how they feel, I can talk them out of it by debunking their myths.”</p>
<h3>4. Don't use "why" as an accusation; use "tell me more" as an open-ended invitation.</h3>
<p>A crucial part of wanting to understand someone else is knowing how to ask open-ended questions. Sometimes, people think they’re doing this when they ask “why” and “how.”</p>
<p>A real open-ended question is a simple invitation: “Tell me more,” or “That’s an interesting point. Could you elaborate?” </p>
<h3>5. Assume that you’re making some assumptions.</h3>
<p>We shouldn’t assume we know someone else’s thoughts and feelings, but we often don’t realize that we’re making assumptions!</p>
<h3>6. Allow emotions; don’t only focus on facts.</h3>
<p>People are not perfectly rational. To expect people to be rational is, in itself, irrational.</p>
<h3>7. Show that you understand, even if you disagree.</h3>
<h3>8. Forego closing arguments.</h3>
<h3>9. You’re allowed to draw lines on certain issues. You’re also allowed to draw boundaries in relationships.</h3>
<a>empathy</a> and curiosity to communicate can help you clarify this.
<a>marriage</a> equality to be sacred, while your friend may hold traditional religious definitions of marriage to be sacred. And there may be no way around this disagreement.
<h3>When to end a relationship over political disagreements</h3>
<a>attention</a> to their moral principles. We’re allowed to draw boundaries and focus on relationships that feed our souls, open our minds, and make us better people.

<h1> How to Cope with the Fear of a Loved One Dying </h1>
<h2> Tips to keep yourself tethered in the present when anxious about death. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>People may experience anxiety over a loved one's death, whether that person has a high risk of dying or not.</li>
<li>If a loved one is at high risk of dying, it's best to allow oneself to feel the fear and grief but get help if those feelings become paralyzing.</li>
<li>Being worried about a loved one dying when it's unlikely could be a symptom of generalized anxiety disorder.</li>
<p>One memorable patient, whom I saw years ago while training at a cancer center, was a young entrepreneur, wife, and mother to three young kids. She was at the center because her husband had just been diagnosed with brain cancer.</p>
<p>So, what did this brave woman do to put an end to her profound worries? How can we calm our own anxiety that a loved one will someday die? Or how do we cope if we know that day may be approaching sooner rather than later?</p>
<h3>The two types of anxiety over a loved one's death</h3>
<a>fear</a>. To start, let’s be clear about an important distinction. There are two major types of anxiety about a loved one’s death:
<li>When a loved one has a severe illness or is at high risk of dying, and you are <a>anxious</a> about their impending death.</li>
<li>When your loved ones are not particularly at risk for dying, but you can’t stop worrying about them dying anyway.</li>
<p>These two types of anxiety are very different and require different responses.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: Worrying when a loved one is at a higher-than-usual risk of dying</h3>
<p>At the same time, make sure your natural anxiety and grief don’t turn into a state of paralysis or preoccupation. It may be time to take some steps if you find yourself:</p>
<ul><li>Unable to engage in proper self-care.</li> <li>Unable to manage the basics in life.</li> <li>So preoccupied with thoughts about your loved one's death that you can’t enjoy your time with them now.</li> </ul>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Imtmphoto/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Let's look at two things you can do to help yourself.</p>
<div> <h2>Anxiety Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Is Botox Good for Mental Health? </a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Why Anxiety Can Be Good for Us: The Parable of the Hamster</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<h3>Scenario 2: Worrying about someone’s death when they’re unlikely to die</h3>
<p>Have you ever worried about someone’s death so intensely that by the time they walked in the door and explained they were late because of car troubles you'd worked yourself into a panic? </p>
<a>stressed</a>, upset, or vulnerable.
<p>No matter the source of your worry, there are ways to lessen the hold it has on your life.</p>
<a>people with GAD</a> believe, consciously or not, that worrying helps prevent bad things from happening. When we worry, we feel like we’re doing something proactive, which distracts us from our feelings of panic or helplessness.
<p>But the idea that worry somehow helps or prevents tragedy is an illusion. Worrying can’t change the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Understand that thoughts are just stories your brain tells you. Now that you know why your brain comes up with persistent worries, you can start to let them go. The key is to realize that thoughts are just stories. </p>
<p>Be patient and kind to yourself. All the strategies we talked about today are easier said than done. We must show ourselves patience and kindness. Remember that you're experiencing deep, existential anxiety.</p>
<p>When worries threaten to overwhelm you, treat yourself with the same kind of compassion.</p>

<h1> Can Money Really Buy Happiness? </h1>
<h2> Money and happiness are related — but not in the way you think. </h2>
<li>More money is linked to increased happiness, some research shows. People who won the lottery have greater life satisfaction, even years later.</li>
<li>Wealth is not associated with happiness in all countries. From a global perspective, non-material things tend to predict wellbeing.</li>
<li>Money, in and of itself, cannot buy happiness, but it can provide a means to the things we value in life, such as free time and peace of mind.</li>
<h3>Higher earners are generally happier</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shift Drive / Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Swedish study </a>on lottery winners found that even after years, people who won the lottery had greater life satisfaction, mental health, and were more prepared to face misfortune like
<a>divorce</a>, illness, and being alone than regular folks who didn’t win the lottery. It’s almost as if having a pile of money made those things less difficult to cope with for the winners.
<h3>Evaluative vs. experienced well-being</h3>
<h3>Material wealth is not associated with happiness everywhere in the world</h3>
<p>If you’re not a very high earner, you may be feeling a bit irritated right now. How unfair that the rest of us can’t even comfort ourselves with the idea that millionaires must be sad in their giant mansions!</p>
<a>non-material things </a>that predicted experienced well-being (e.g., learning, autonomy, respect, social support).
<h3>Earned wealth generates more happiness than inherited wealth</h3>
<a>ultra-rich millionaires</a> (net worth of at least $8,000,000) found that those who earned their wealth through work and effort got more of a happiness boost from their money than those who inherited it. So keep
<a>dreaming</a> big and reaching for your entrepreneurial
<a>goals</a>… as long as you’re not sacrificing your actual well-being in the pursuit.
<h3>There are different types of happiness, and wealth is better for some than others</h3>
<ul><li>Excitement</li> <li>Contentment</li> <li>Gratefulness</li> <li>Love</li> <li>Compassion</li> <li>Pride</li> <li>Peace</li> </ul>
<p>...and that's just a short list.</p>
<a>self-focused positive emotions</a> such as pride and contentment, whereas less wealthy people have more other-focused positive emotions like love and compassion.
<p>In fact, in the Swedish lottery winners study, people’s feelings about their social well-being (with friends, family, neighbors, and society) were no different between lottery winners and regular people. </p>
<h3>Money is a means to the things we value, not happiness itself</h3>
<a>envious</a>, and I would hypothesize that this is the main reason why lottery winners are more satisfied with their life.
<p>Consider this simply: If we had the financial security to spend time on things we enjoy and value, instead of feeling pressured to generate income all the time, why wouldn’t we be happier?</p>

<h1> 5 Ways to Develop Self-Love, and Why You Need To </h1>
<h2> The most important relationship you have in life is the one with yourself. </h2>
<li>Listen to your body and give it exactly what it needs, including rest and nourishment.</li>
<li>Allow yourself to really experience your emotions, even difficult ones.</li>
<li>Express yourself creatively, and spend time on the activities you care about.</li>
<li>Be patient and forgiving to yourself, and set boundaries where you need them.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kichigin/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Or you could be kind and <a>empathetic</a> and gentle. If given the choice, which relationship would you rather be in? And if it’s the loving one, how can you go about cultivating that love? Let’s explore a few good places to begin:</p>
<h3>1. Listen to your body.</h3>
<a>attention</a> to my body until something goes wrong.
<h3>2. Give yourself permission to feel.</h3>
<a>guilt</a> and frustration simply for being human. If we allow and appreciate our emotions, instead, we’d have greater self-awareness and self-compassion.
<h3>3. Express yourself, gain mastery.</h3>
<p>One of the greatest ways you can love yourself is to give yourself the satisfaction of mastery and freedom of expression. Dig into something you care about and give yourself the permission to fail. </p>
<h3>4. Forgive yourself, and be patient.</h3>
<h3>5. Set boundaries and be your own best advocate.</h3>
<p>What are we telling ourselves? We don’t think we deserve respect. How can you love and treasure someone if you don’t even respect them?</p>

<h1> 4 Strategies to Invest in Your Mental Health Bank </h1>
<h2> Your personal mental health bank needs constant attention. </h2>
<li>Make daily deposits into your mental health for pleasure and progress through actions such as taking time to relax or begin a new hobby.</li>
<li>Invest in your mental health by committing to your values and morals.</li>
<li>Pay attention to your mental health balance and flag when things are going wrong.</li>
<h3>Tip 1: Take a Log of Mental Assets and Debts</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Gutesa/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Tip 2: Make Daily Deposits</h3>
<p>Remember the old adage, “A penny saved is a penny earned”? Well, that definitely applies here! Many people consistently fall into a mental health trap known as magnification and minimization.</p>
<p>I think of deposits in two extensive categories which I call “Pleasure” and “Progress.”</p>
<a>shame</a> or judgment here; if you find pleasure in watching old episodes of Full House for the nostalgia factor, or Bachelor in Paradise for the drama, then go for it!
<a>confidence</a>, it can lead to a reduction in negative emotions. Just like with Pleasure, you want to pick one thing that you can do each day for the Progress column. You should choose something that feels challenging but doable.
<h3>Tip 3: Diversify Investments</h3>
<a>ethics</a>, and standards of living. For example, if I am a
<a>spiritual</a> person, then studying religion and attending religious services may be a top priority.
<h3>Tip 4: Turn on Mental Alerts </h3>
<p>In order for all of this to work, we have to mindfully manage our mental health bank. You will need to monitor for suspicious activity and write down warning signs to watch out for in your emotional spending habits.</p>
<a>attention</a> to your debts, they can quickly accumulate and outpace your deposits. Consequently, this also involves creating routines that include accumulating positives as a standard practice.

<li>While psychotherapy is the primary form of treatment for IAD, there are simple ways to adjust your mindset when illness anxiety takes hold.</li>
<a>fear</a> of having or developing an illness, not necessarily dying, but the fear that maybe someday I will be diagnosed with a disabling illness. I spend a lot of time on WebMD researching illnesses that I'm convinced I have.”
<p>This sounds like it could be Illness Anxiety Disorder.</p>
<a>Illness Anxiety Disorder</a> (IAD) may not be a familiar term, but here’s a word which may be: hypochondriac. Hypochondriasis used to be a medical diagnosis but has been split into two new diagnoses:
<a>Somatic Symptom Disorder</a> and Illness Anxiety Disorder. We will focus on the latter, as it relates to my patient’s question.
<h3>What is Illness Anxiety Disorder?</h3>
<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a> (the bible of psychological diagnoses), Illness Anxiety Disorder is defined by the following symptoms:</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Antonio Guillem/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Preoccupation with having or developing a debilitating or life-threatening illness.</li>
<li>The patient doesn't actually have any physical symptoms, or if they do, they're mild. If a medical condition is present or the patient is high-risk for developing a medical condition, their anxiety about it reaches extreme proportions.</li>
<li>Typically, people with IAD are either care-seeking (that is, frequently performing health checks and going to the doctor), or care-avoidant (they avoid doctor's appointments entirely, for fear of what they might learn).</li>
<h3>Nine Signs and Symptoms of Illness Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<a>stress</a>,” you might start dwelling on the word “probably” and begin thinking about more deadly causes of headaches and ignore the doctor’s main message that there’s no cause for concern.
<li>Jumping to conclusions: Just because you have a sore throat does not mean you have <a>COVID-19</a>. Your headache is not necessarily a brain tumor.</li>
<li>Fortune telling: Assuming that your pessimistic expectations are true. For example, proclaiming that you know you would die from the flu if you got it.</li>
<li><a>Catastrophizing</a>: Viewing minor ailments as having terrible consequences. For instance, assuming that random aches and pains are always a sign of an underlying terminal illness. </li>
<li>Overgeneralization: Taking one example as proof for a general rule (for example, “I feel tired today. I must have mono.”)</li>
<li>Emotional reasoning: Treating your feelings as facts. For example, “There must be something physically wrong with me because otherwise, I wouldn’t feel so <a>anxious</a>.”</li>
<p>Keep in mind that there is a relationship between your thinking, emotions, behaviors, and physiological responses. Therefore, if you think in these ways, you will only increase your worry and your physical discomfort.</p>
<h3>Physical vs. Psychological Symptoms</h3>
<p>From this example, we can see how a subtle physical change (stomach ache), combined with maladaptive thinking, can lead to increased anxiety and the arrival of other symptoms (heart palpitations and nausea).</p>
<p>If you have this disorder, it may be difficult to move forward without support. <a>Psychotherapy</a> is the primary form of treatment for IAD. Meanwhile, here are a few tips to help ease your illness anxiety:</p>
<li>Externalize your anxiety: Instead of telling yourself "I'm going to get very sick and die," it might be helpful to instead say, "My illness anxiety is being loud today.</li>
<li>Decrease <a>compulsive behaviors</a>: Limit the amount of time you spend on medical forums, examining your body, going to the doctor each time you have a minor ailment, and continually looking to family or friends for reassurance.</li>
<a>self-talk</a> arises, make a list of the evidence for and against the diagnosis. You will find that, in most cases, there is no substance to the worry. It’s like clickbait in your brain.
<p>Naturally, some level of concern about your health and well-being is normal. But if it's getting to a point in which the worry is worse than the physical symptoms, then it might be time to see a qualified mental health professional.</p>

<h1> How Boundaries and Self-Esteem Affect Your Relationships </h1>
<h2> Using the Relationship Grid to understand our personalities. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Self-Esteem? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Thinking about relationship patterns in terms of self-esteem and shame can help us understand our behaviors and where relationships go wrong.</li>
<li>The Relationship Grid was developed by therapist Terry Real and is a way to visualize where your primary maladaptive relationship style trends.</li>
<li>No matter where you fall on The Relationship Grid, we should aim for the middle ground between extremes.</li>
<a>self-esteem</a>? Or do you perhaps have too many boundaries and too much self-esteem? We want to avoid these extremes: they cause problems when we try to form healthy relationships.
<p>To help us understand relationship patterns and behaviors, we'll outline The Relationship Grid, developed by therapist Terry Real, which is a useful way to conceptualize where your primary maladaptive relationship style leans.</p>
<p>In this model, the horizontal axis represents boundaries and the vertical axis represents self-esteem.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Terry Real</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>shame</a>, or “one down.” Shame and grandiosity are not opposite emotions—they are the same emotion pointed in opposite directions.
<p>In essence, you have too much shame if you land on the toxic shame side of things and too little shame if you land on the grandiose area.</p>
<h3>Boundaryless vs. Walled Off</h3>
<p>Essentially, on this axis, you either have too few boundaries or too many.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the two axis of The Relationship Grid, let's take a look at the four quadrants they create. Knowing which quadrant you fall in can help explain how you approach relationships.</p>
<p>Bottom Left: Walled Off and Shameful</p>
<p>Upper Left: Walled Off and Grandiose</p>
<p>In general, they are mean-spirited and cruel. Unfortunately, people who primarily land in this quadrant will not see themselves as the problem, despite the fact that living in this way leads to a very <a>lonely</a> existence.</p>
<p>Upper Right: Boundaryless and Grandiose</p>
<a>anger</a>, and impulsiveness, all of which could be taken to the extreme with violence and abuse. They are determined to keep the relationship at all costs and often feel justified in using these behaviors because they feel victimized by their partner.
<p>Lower Right: Boundaryless and Shameful</p>
<p>In its most extreme form, this quadrant is represented by desperation and neediness.</p>

<h3>What do healthy boundaries and self-esteem look like?</h3>
<p>After hearing all of this and understanding The Relationship Grid, you may be wondering what healthy boundaries and self-esteem look like. As in most things in life, you are looking for the middle ground between all of these extremes.</p>
<p>If you are walled off, try getting uncomfortable. Look for opportunities to be authentic with those around you.</p>
<p>If you are boundaryless, take a step back and consider what your boundaries are in a situation, or what common boundaries someone might have in this situation.</p>
<p>Remember, we want to avoid the extremes in all of these quadrants, as they lead to problems in our ability to connect with others in healthy ways.</p>

<h1> How Does Trauma Hijack the Brain? </h1>
<h2> A look at how traumatic experiences affect brain development. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Trauma? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from trauma</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Trauma can confuse the communication between the three parts of your brain.</li>
<li>Learn about and reflect on how each part of your brain reacts in different situations.</li>
<li>Use that information to help identify interventions that can help lessen the influence of these traumas.</li>
<p>Have you ever wondered how trauma might be impacting your brain?</p>
<p>Today, I’m going to discuss the concept of the triune brain and how each part of your brain may process <a>traumatic</a> experiences. </p>
<h3>The triune brain model</h3>
<p>Triune literally means “three in one.” The triune brain model describes three areas within the brain that have a unique way of understanding and processing information; however, they are meant to function as a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>In the triune brain model, the oldest part is the reptilian brain, which includes the brain stem and cerebellum. It operates on instinct and is responsible for the survival-related functions of the body.</p>
<p>The mammalian brain, a.k.a. the emotional or limbic brain, is responsible for our emotional and relational experiences. The mammalian brain includes the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. </p>
<p>Emotions lend another dimension to our experience by letting us know of our likes and dislikes, which helps identify what is emotionally important or meaningful to us and adds emotional richness to our lives and relationships.</p>
<a>long-term memory</a>. These experiences of shared pleasure or pain are also encoded as nonverbal memories of
<a>attachment</a> experiences, laying down templates for expectations of future relationships.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Eldar Nurkovic/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The neocortex, a.k.a. the cerebral cortex, the frontal cortex, or the neomammalian brain, is the front structure of our brain and is split across the left and right hemispheres.</p>
<p>The right hemisphere is associated with <a>creativity</a> and <a>intuition</a>. It processes information in a more symbolic, implicit, and nonlinear fashion.</p>
<h3>How trauma impacts brain development</h3>
<p>The development and functioning of the three brains rely on our childhood experiences. This includes early attachment figures like caregivers, conditions in our environment, and traumas.</p>
<div> <h2>Trauma Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>5 Secrets About Trauma Therapists</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Understanding the Long Shadow of Trauma</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>When we are triggered and in a threat mode, our neocortex is temporarily less active. When we are in danger, our mammalian and reptilian brains take over and prompt us to act quickly in order to stay alive.</p>
<p>While this is good in the case of ducking from a frisbee, it can make it incredibly difficult to think clearly, analyze, plan, or learn new information.</p>
<p>I sometimes think of it as the “blue screen of death” that older computers used to get when there was a malfunction. There was only one way out: You had to reboot the system.</p>
<p>Working through trauma is highly personal and specialized, but I can offer a few tips to get you started.</p>
<a>self-talk</a> are more helpful; however, when you’re at an 8, you might need to do physical activities, like breathing exercises, to help calm you down.

<h1> 6 Tips to Maintain the Calm During the Chaos of the Holidays </h1>
<h2> We all feel stressed at some time or other. Here are some methods to de-stress. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Stress? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome stress</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>It seems as if every year, the holidays come crashing down quick and hard. Most of us remember celebrating the end of summer with our last barbeque, and then Christmas decorations suddenly appear in our local stores.</p>
<p>Whether it’s dealing with the holidays, facing a health challenge, or grieving the loss of a loved one, it’s important to have tools to cope with the chaos that can surround us. </p>
<a>divorce</a> survived by reminding herself that “from all bad comes good.”
<a>meditation</a>, exercise, or reading.
<p>Here are six methods to help you keep calm during periods of chaos:</p>
<p>Proper breathing techniques</p>
<p>Begin by saying the following, and repeat it as much as needed:</p>
<p>May I be filled with loving-kindness. </p>
<p>May I be peaceful and at ease. </p>
<p>May (a person I love) be filled with loving-kindness. </p>
<p>May (a person I love) be well.</p>
<a>stressful</a> events in our lives.
<p>To begin writing, find a journal that appeals to you and a pen. Settle down in a quiet area where you won’t be interrupted for at least 20 minutes. Stream-of-consciousness writing is writing nonstop, which allows your thoughts to wander. </p>
<p>If this is difficult for you, here are some writing prompts that may help:</p>
<li>Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a peaceful place. When you feel calm, write down what you imagined: what you saw, heard, smelled, and felt. Revisit that place in your mind during chaotic times.</li>
<li>Write about a positive experience you had recently, and why it resonated with you.</li>
<li>Write a thank-you note to someone who recently made a kind gesture.</li>
<li>If you could change something about your day, what would it be? Write down your thoughts.</li>
<li>Write about all the things you do that instill you with a sense of calm.</li>

<p><a>Positive thinking</a></p>
<a>gratitude</a> journaling, which highlights all the positive aspects of your life. Also, take care of your body, mind, and spirit.
<p>In summary, it’s a good idea to be aware of and practice your calming strategies before being bombarded with stress, because sometimes it’s more difficult to help ourselves when we’re feeling overwhelmed. </p>
<p>So be calm... and enjoy your life!</p>

<h1> How Can You Improve Your Focus in 2020? </h1>
<h2> There are many ways in which you can improve your focus. </h2>
<p> Posted December 30, 2019 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Stefan Cosma</div> <div>Source: courtesy of Upsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>With the New Year, consider, the new you!</p>
<p>In addition to taking external actions that can facilitate focusing, there are ways to do so inwardly. In general, focusing moves inward and pulls information from the deeper and wiser self, or the body.</p>
<li>Clear a space for yourself and ask yourself, “How are you?” Think, but don’t obsess about what prevents you from feeling fine.</li>
<li>Pay attention to your felt sense—what are you feeling in your body about a particular problem or issue?</li>
<li>Get a handle by providing a word or image that comes to mind in regard to #2.</li>
<li>Resonate (go back and forth between the word or image and your felt sense). When they match, then feel that for a minute.</li>
<li>Ask, “What is it about the problem that makes me feel so_____?” (The idea behind #5 is to wait for your body to answer the question. Feel where there is a stirring within you.)</li>
<li>Receive— welcome what came to you, and be aware.</li>
<p>While the above addresses dealing with the internal practice of focusing, here are some external practices that can also facilitate your ability to focus:</p>
<li>Turn off your cell phone.</li>
<li>Tidy up your desk and work area.</li>
<li>Get back into your customary routines.</li>
<li>Keep only one tab open on your computer.</li>
<li>Set a time limit for social media interactions.</li>
<li>Listen to music that helps you concentrate.</li>
<li>Get a good night’s sleep.</li>
<li>Maintain a daily <a>mindfulness meditation</a> practice.</li>

<li>Engage in self-care activities such as walking, yoga, massage, facials, coffee with a friend, or whatever makes you feel better about yourself.</li>
