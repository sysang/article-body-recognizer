<p>While things were picking up for us on the digital front, our conversations with the landlord were not yielding much fruit.</p>
<p>As early as July, we proposed a Gross Turnover Model, which was in essence asking the landlord to share our pain. That did not go through.</p>
<p>The landlord was willing to give us a small rental reduction, but that was still disproportionate to the drop in footfall.</p>
<p>Our last resort was to file for a Notification of Relief, which helps SMEs like us to defer rental payments until November. That allowed us to manage our cash flow for the time being.</p>
<p>We were still quite hopeful. But before we could make that proposal, the landlord told us: "Oh, Elsie, I've got good news for you. We found someone to take over your shop already."</p>
<p>Editor’s Note: GuocoLand has clarified that Butterflies Marigolds was informed in September 2020 that their option to renew their lease had lapsed, and as such, GuocoLand would begin sourcing for a suitable replacement tenant. </p>
<p>The landlord knew our pre-COVID sales numbers — we were here for the past three years — and that Butterflies and Marigold was a profitable business. We had consistently turned in those numbers.</p>
<p>How could they do this to us, especially when it is so difficult for retailers now?</p>
<p>We could find another shop space, but let me put it this way: Say you are playing football and suddenly there is a heavy downpour. Do you want to keep playing in the rain? Or take shelter for a while?</p>
<p>Perhaps for Butterflies and Marigolds, this is our time to take shelter. We are going to try to pivot 100 per cent towards online for now.</p>
<p>We can operate out of a warehouse or my home, as long as we find the space to continue live-streaming every week.</p>

<p>I still had a very good run. My partner and I ran a very successful business for 16 years. That is an achievement that nobody can take away.</p>
<p>Of course I feel very sad to let this shop go. But as painful as it may be, it is not the end of the road.</p>

<h1> They grieved when their baby was born blind. Now they see a world of possibilities for him </h1>
<div> <p>Eric and Wei Shi panicked at first: How could they raise Elliot to be like everyone else? Would he lag developmentally? Could he ever be rich and successful? A year on, they're using his story to inspire others.</p> </div>

<p>SINGAPORE: There are nine photos of baby Elliot displayed above the Koh family’s dining table. They provide a window into a time when life was very different for his parents.</p>
<p>Eric, 32, and Wei Shi, 31, put the photos up one evening last July when Elliot was four months old. They were looking forward to showing them to him as he grew older.</p>
<p>They have never got to do so. The very next day, they brought him to the doctor, suspecting a developmental delay. A day later, they found out Elliot was blind and was unlikely to ever have sight.</p>
<p>Eric remembers both of them bursting into tears on the spot. “My wife was still listening to the doctor intently to hear his explanation and diagnosis,” he says. “I just walked out of the room and cried.</p>
<p>“Nothing much needed to be said.”</p>
<p>The clinic was crowded, but his world went silent when he walked out of the doctor’s office. He called his mother, broke it to her and they cried on the phone together.</p>
<p>He was still in shock as he tried to process how it had come to this.</p>
<p>It started with a comment from Wei Shi’s father, who had noticed Elliot seemingly having trouble tracking things with his eyes.</p>
<p>The couple did not think much of it then. Newborns often do not see very well yet, and their son would catch up, they rationalised.</p>
<p>But the signs kept coming. He showed no interest in the toys his grandmother placed in front of him. He did not seem to smile or look at his surroundings.</p>
<p>And when Wei Shi brought Elliot on a play date, she noticed that her friend’s baby of the same age was curious and excited, reaching out to grab toys, while Elliot remained passive and did not lift his head.</p>
<p>At that point, they decided to take him to a doctor, although they were still “not too worried”. But the paediatrician referred them to an ophthalmologist, who gave them the news that shook their world.</p>
<p>The couple did not exchange many words that day. But questions kept running through their minds. What could they do for Elliot? What will happen to him when they are gone?</p>
<p>Wei Shi could not help but wonder: Had she done anything — maybe it was her diet or lifestyle — during her pregnancy or even during the delivery that could have resulted in this?</p>
<p>But Eric made it clear that neither of them was to blame.</p>
<p>“We can’t solve the problem just by assigning blame,” he says. “I was just focused on providing support for Elliot and Wei Shi, just to be there and give them what they need.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: He lost his sight at 47 - a fragrance company helped give him his life back</a></h3>
<p>Elliot, now 15 months old, was eventually diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited disease that causes vision loss.</p>
<p>It affects about two to three newborns in every 100,000 births, according to the United States’ National Library of Medicine and the American Association for Paediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</p>
<p>“The doctors said it wasn’t detectable on any scan because the retinas were just so tiny. And it’s not something that was avoidable,” she added.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Once I knew that, I started to think that maybe I should focus on what I can control rather than the past, which is beyond my control. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Eric and Wei Shi wanted more answers to all the questions they had. Being young, modern parents, as they described themselves, they turned to Google first.</p>
<p>They searched for the abstract, like how the blind visualise things, as well as answers as to how they could interact with and take care of Elliot.</p>
<p>WATCH: Raising a blind baby and the lessons we've learnt from it (12:02)</p>
<p>They joined Facebook groups for parents of children with the same disorder. While these were international groups, it was encouraging to see that the other children were growing up well.</p>
<p>The couple also picked up useful tips on caring for Elliot, but the issue was a lack of local context. They knew his condition was rare but had still hoped that help would be readily available for blind infants in Singapore.</p>
<p>For example, Wei Shi remembers looking for pre-schools or specialised therapies for visually impaired babies and children. But she came away disappointed.</p>
<p>“It made me panic a little because I didn’t know better,” she says. “And if there’s nothing on the Internet, where can I find this information?”</p>
<p>She recalls asking the doctors as much as possible about what to expect and so on. But there were times the couple were also at a loss to know what to ask, she adds.</p>
<p>Help came from an unexpected source. As Eric sat in hospital waiting for Elliot to undergo tests, he flicked his phone’s screen and went on Reddit, which he browsed regularly. He had never made a post on the forum — but that day, he did.</p>
<p>It was, simply: Baby born blind. Need help.</p>
<p>The replies he got surprised and touched him. Some pointed out local resources and organisations that support the blind; others said they had visually impaired friends and were happy to share their experiences.</p>
<p>“People were so willing to help,” he says. “They gave us more than enough resources for us to get by.”</p>
<p>That was how they met Cheryl Yeo. An orientation and mobility specialist from Guide Dogs Singapore, the 29-year-old teaches people with visual impairment how to travel independently, and the skills they eventually need to use a guide dog.</p>
<p>The Kohs had tried ringing up several organisations but could not get through in the post-circuit breaker period, with people still working from home. Cheryl, whose calls were rerouted to her mobile, was the first person to call them back.</p>
<p>The conversation lasted almost two hours. The couple were anxious and, she recalls, sounded overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“One of the big questions Eric asked was whether Elliot would be able to get a girlfriend,” she says. “It’s rather funny, but it’s actually quite a big concern because it’s about how he’s going to grow up, be like everyone else and find a job.”</p>
<p>She arranged for them to speak to some of her clients and linked them up with other organisations and services they could tap for support.</p>
<p>It was a great comfort to the couple. “What we wanted at that point in time was just reassurance, that somebody understood what we were going through,” says Eric. “She’s been a great help.”</p>
<p>They count her as one of their friends now. She visits them regularly, teaching them how to interact and play with Elliot, and even brings along her husband and eight-month-old baby.</p>
<p>As the months went by, the family developed their own routine. It bears similarities to those of other families with young children, but with noticeable tweaks.</p>
<p>During breakfast, Wei Shi puts Elliot’s hand on her jaw so he can feel the chewing motion. It is to encourage him, but it is no picnic; he does not like food, and the colourful vegetables in his porridge do nothing to entice him.</p>
<p>“In the past, I introduced exciting stuff with different textures. But it was disappointing if he didn’t eat,” she says. “Nowadays I don’t care already. I’d just throw everything into a pot to make porridge.”</p>
<p>His books are heavy on texture, have buttons that play music, and one has Braille markings, passed to him from another family with a visually impaired child.</p>
<p>Wei Shi points out, however, that his condition does not mean they cannot do visual activities like reading a book with him. The activity simply must be adapted so he can understand.</p>
<p>While there are toys that he cannot fully enjoy, such as stacking cups and animal figures, the couple make a point of letting him feel the different shapes and textures.</p>
<p>What has met with little success, however, is an activity board filled with locks, switches and lights, known as a toddlers’ busy board. It was handmade by Eric during his wife’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>The appeal of these toys often comes from children watching their parents use them. But Eric has not given up hope. “Perhaps when he’s 15, he’ll start getting interested,” quips the father.</p>
<p>Each activity they plan for him is purposeful, from the nightly baby massages to help him relax before bedtime, to naming his body parts out loud as they touch each one.</p>
<p>Like other parents, they take him out to enjoy new experiences, though the highlight of the outing may only be something like Elliot sitting on artificial grass at Jewel.</p>
<p>It can be tiring, Wei Shi says, to plan all the activities and look after him. But his sweet smile when he crawls to her and feels her face spurs the couple on. That action is a sign of improvement too.</p>
<p>“All the lost sleep, the time spent with him to bring him to who he is today, is totally worth it,” she says.</p>
<p>Eric and Wei Shi learnt from the start that being blind meant Elliot would have no visual motivation to lift his head and reach forward, which would result in other developmental delays, such as in standing and even crawling.</p>
<p>So sometimes they cannot imagine he has come this far.</p>
<p>Crawling is a difficult milestone to achieve, says Wei Shi. Besides the lack of visual motivation, there is the fear of moving head-first into an unfamiliar, dark space. And many visually impaired babies would skip this stage.</p>
<p>Getting the hang of it was not easy for Elliot. It took months of effort, professional therapy and his parents’ perseverance with shaking a rattle in front of him to encourage him before he began making tentative movements forward.</p>
<p>“I would’ve been okay if he’d skipped crawling altogether. I thought it was just good exercise for him,” says Wei Shi. “But one fine day, he just pushed up and started crawling.</p>
<p>“I was really, really proud of him.”</p>
<p>Their pride grows when they see him exploring the house by himself, even the corners he had not explored before, or moving across the living room to get closer to the sound of nursery rhymes from the television.</p>
<p>He now goes for physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy about once a month at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. And they have high hopes for him once again.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants their kid to be lousy,” says Eric. “Like any other Singaporean parent, our initial thought was for our baby to be rich, successful and happy with what he does.”</p>
<p>While that changed when they discovered Elliot’s condition, they have come to understand over the months that he can achieve as much as a sighted person.</p>
<p>“Our expectations shouldn’t be (lowered) from … ‘I want my kid to be successful’ to ‘okay, just be independent,’” says Eric. “You just have to realise that he’ll have to reach these targets in a different way.”</p>
<p>Dealing with reactions from others, however, is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Eric was recently reminded of an incident when Elliot was about six months old and was wearing baby spectacles that stopped him pressing his eyes, a tendency among visually impaired children that could result in sunken eyes, notes Wei Shi.</p>
<p>He was in a baby carrier with Eric, who was picking up breakfast for the family, and on that one trip, at least three people stopped to ask about the spectacles.</p>
<p>“I just got annoyed and walked away,” recalls Eric, who also felt sad. “At that point in time, we’d accepted it … but it’s generally not so easy to just start telling people and open up about it.”</p>
<p>Last month, when Elliot received his first cane — a blue, child-sized one — the emotions hit home again.</p>
<p>“We’re not ashamed of him. And we know that the best thing to do is to get him used to walking with a cane so he can be independent as soon as possible,” says Eric.</p>
<p>“But when people can easily tell he’s visually impaired … I don’t feel I’m ready to go out there and explain yet.”</p>
<p>Wei Shi says that before her son came along, she had never interacted closely with a visually impaired person, let alone be friends with one. In parenting Elliot, she and Eric have grown more socially aware.</p>
<p>“The reason they gave is along the lines of … ‘we’re afraid we don’t know how to take care of the baby properly,’” he says.</p>
<p>“I understand this from their perspective … Liability is something no company would want to have. But we just wanted them to be a little more understanding and inclusive.”</p>
<p>Eventually, they found a school willing to help them.</p>
<h3><a>READ: 'No different from other teachers': The childcare aide with special needs </a></h3>
<p>“Compared to 10 years ago, when there was less awareness of the needs of the special needs community, today’s society has made great progress,” he adds. “But obviously, as a parent, I hope more can be done.”</p>
<p>Wei Shi is doing her part with an Instagram account she created in September to document Elliot’s developmental milestones and the various ways she helps him learn.</p>
<p>The account, @blindandshine, has more than 1,500 followers. She has also attracted some collaborations with brands. “I don’t want any other pair of parents to feel the helplessness that we felt should the same thing happen to them,” she says.</p>
<p>She can also advocate for Elliot at a pragmatic level, for example after he received three sets of Braille blocks for Christmas. These well-intentioned gifts were the likely result of a Google search for “Braille toys”, she says.</p>
<p>“(But) people have the misunderstanding that maybe he can’t play with normal toys,” Wei Shi adds. “He can, just maybe he needs adaptations.”</p>
<p>She knew, however, where they were coming from — she had once been in their shoes. “I had preconceived thoughts, not because I’m an elitist but simply because of a lack of awareness. And nobody told me these things,” she says.</p>
<p>The change the couple have undergone in their lives in the past year has been both unexpected and dramatic. Every month, however, they still take a family photo, their camera set up on a tripod as they coax Elliot to face forward.</p>
<p>“He always looks down,” says Wei Shi. “It’s not meaningful for him because he doesn’t know why we’re pausing.”</p>
<p>But each photo is lovingly saved, not so much for him to enjoy in future but for his parents to look back on as he grows.</p>
<p>Just visible in the background of one of the photos on their wall is a pegboard with the words “Today’s brew”, mimicking the look of a cafe.</p>
<p>Today, the board stands on the television console, unmissable as one enters their home — and it reads “Love’s blind”. Because the love within the family, as Wei Shi says, comes from the heart rather than by sight.</p>
<p>They still grieve over what could have been, but it is not a case of “Oh, we’re so sad”, says Eric.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know this was going to happen. But looking at his growth and happiness, we’re just as happy taking care of him as any other parent would be of their child.”</p>
<p>To mark each milestone in Elliot’s life, such as his first birthday or when he got his first cane, Eric also takes out a recorder and documents the moment with his voice.</p>
<p>“Today, people will know your story, and you’ll inspire many people,” Eric talks away into the recorder. “You want to be an influencer and earn money? Be a politician? Also can.”</p>

<h1> How effective is Sinovac vaccine? Here are some lessons from other countries </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Lianne Chia </a> <a> Charmaine Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: While her peers were choosing between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, 32-year-old Jade Lim made an uncommon choice.</p>
<p>Despite having no known allergies to the two vaccines, she went with the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, available at approved private healthcare institutions within the Special Access Route framework.</p>
<p>“Everyone was shocked,” she said, as she recalled how her friends and family reacted.</p>
<p>But she felt more comfortable with Sinovac — an inactivated virus vaccine — compared with the other two, which use messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology. For one thing, she was concerned about the side effects of the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>“As a healthy person with a good immune system, I feel that it wasn’t necessary to take something that would trigger so much reaction in the body,” said the vet.</p>
<p>“Also … what’ll happen 50 years later (is something) we wouldn’t know, whereas inactivated virus (vaccines) have been used for decades.”</p>
<p>It works as a “recipe” to direct the production of a specific part of the virus, the spike protein, to trigger an immune response without exposing patients to the virus.</p>
<p>Human trials of mRNA technology started in 2009, while inactivated viruses were introduced at the end of the 19th century and has since been used to treat ailments like typhoid, polio and even seasonal flu.</p>
<p>WATCH: Is the Sinovac vaccine effective or safer? (3:11)</p>
<h2>DATA PUT ‘UNDER THE MICROSCOPE’</h2>
<p>Based on Ministry of Health estimates on Aug 10, 85,000 people in Singapore would have received their first dose of the Sinovac vaccine by Aug 12.</p>
<p>Those with the Sinovac jabs are now included in Singapore’s vaccination count and considered as fully vaccinated. But as Sinovac is not part of the national vaccination programme, those who want the vaccine must pay S$10 to S$25 per dose.</p>
<h4> <div>Related stories:</div> </h4>
<p>They are also not covered by the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, which gives a one-time payout for anyone suffering adverse reactions to the mRNA vaccines in the national vaccination programme.</p>
<p>Despite this, there have been queues for the Sinovac vaccine.</p>
<p>Infectious diseases specialist Loh Jiashen from Farrer Park Hospital noted that “it’s not exactly true”, however, that Sinovac is safer than the mRNA vaccines, which have been used in “millions of doses” round the world.</p>
<p>“The amount of (mRNA) data that’s come back has been rigorous, robust, and the whole data has been examined under the microscope,” he said. “The Sinovac safety data isn’t as open and not as publicly available.”</p>
<p>He noted that Sinovac’s efficacy rate is 51 per cent, while that of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is 95 per cent and 94 per cent respectively. The higher the efficacy rate, the more protection there is against symptomatic disease.</p>
<p>“If you want to give a vaccine, you should generate antibodies at least better or more than somebody who’s caught an infection,” he added.</p>
<p>“In its early trial, it was shown that the antibody (level) generated by the Sinovac vaccine was lower than that generated by people who’ve gotten COVID.”</p>
<p>A recent Mayo Clinic study in Minnesota, however, found that the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines against the Delta variant had dropped to 76 per cent for Moderna and 42 per cent for Pfizer-BioNTech. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, a United Kingdom study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88 per cent effective against the Delta variant.</p>
<h2>THE HONG KONG SITUATION</h2>
<p>Over in Hong Kong, where the vaccine has been offered since February, more than 2.5 million doses have been given to people, compared with over 4.1 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech one.</p>
<p>According to CNA correspondent Wei Du, who has tracked the city’s vaccination roll-out, the Sinovac vaccine is “freely available … so no need to queue up overnight and no need to make a mad dash for it”.</p>
<p>But there is a “general sense of distrust” of mainland China and of “anything that comes from mainland China”, she said. “People are also very clear about the fact that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine simply works better.”</p>
<p>So why then do some Hongkongers still go for Sinovac, given that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is just as readily available and there is less data on the protection Sinovac offers against more transmissible strains like the Delta variant?</p>
<p>“The efficacy of preventing hospitalisation and preventing death is very similar for both vaccines, so the efficacious advantage for (Pfizer-)BioNTech isn’t that obvious,” said David Lam, who administers Sinovac vaccines at his private clinic.</p>
<p>WATCH: The full episode — How effective is Sinovac? Inactivated virus vs mRNA vaccine (22:28)</p>
<p>Lam, who is also chairman of non-profit group Medical Conscience, said “it’s quite obvious” that people who receive the mRNA vaccines have more pains.</p>
<p>“So some people thought, why don’t we just use something (that), in their mind, is mild — less dizziness, less pain, less fever,” he noted.</p>
<p>In terms of severe side effects, there were 28 cases of Bell's palsy, a kind of facial paralysis, among nearly 452,000 individuals who received their first Sinovac jab, according to University of Hong Kong researchers.</p>
<p>But there is no definitive evidence on how the vaccine might cause this rare reaction.</p>
<p>“If you do develop adverse effects, the government payout is also the same (whether it’s the Sinovac or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine),” said Du. “Both vaccines are approved by the government and are provided by the government.”</p>
<h2>BETTER WITH BOOSTER JAB?</h2>
<p>It appears to medical doctor and epidemiologist Dicky Budiman, who is advising the Indonesian government on the containment of COVID-19, that the protection Sinovac offers decreases “after six months”.</p>
<p>The vaccine also appears to be less effective against the Delta variant compared with mRNA vaccines or the AstraZeneca one. That is why he recommends a booster dose — from Moderna — after the first two Sinovac jabs.</p>
<p>He cited European countries like Spain and Germany, which are mixing COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>So too is Thailand, where over 600 Sinovac-vaccinated medical staff were infected between April and last month. Thai authorities have announced that a first dose of Sinovac will be followed by AstraZeneca as the second dose, for a booster effect.</p>
<p>Malaysia, too, is reviewing data to determine whether Sinovac vaccine recipients should be given a booster jab with another vaccine.</p>
<p>Is this also a possibility in Singapore? According to Danny Soon, a member of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, it is too early to tell.</p>
<p>“Sinovac is given as an option at this point because there may be some people who have a personal preference for it. There may be some … who won’t be eligible for the mRNA vaccines because of allergies,” he said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> So it’s a small number of people who potentially could be looking for the Sinovac vaccine.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>The “first choices” for people thinking about which vaccine to have should be the mRNA vaccines in Singapore’s national vaccination programme, he advised.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>As at Aug 11, the Health Sciences Authority is still reviewing additional data given by Sinovac. The results will determine whether there will be any change in regulatory approval for the vaccine.</p>
<p>The key thing is, as Soon put it, “it’s better to have some vaccination than no vaccination”.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> CNA Insider </a> </p> <h5> Not just free delivery and bulk discounts: The rise of community group buys in Singapore </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Not just free delivery and bulk discounts: The rise of community group buys in Singapore </h1>
<div> <p>Some started off just wanting their food delivered with no extra charge. These group-buy hosts now collate orders for hundreds of people at a time — and make new friends in the process.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lianne Chia </a> <a> Christy Yip </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: In the year or so since Mrs Tan began joining group buys, she has seen everything from high-quality fresh fruits to microfibre cloths to ergonomic chairs being hawked at a discount.</p>
<p>Today, the 31-year-old, who wished to be identified by her last name only, estimates that half her groceries come from orders placed through chat groups on WhatsApp or Telegram run by others in her estate.</p>
<p>“While the prices weren’t necessarily cheaper than in a neighbourhood supermarket, we felt the fruit and vegetables were significantly fresher than what we were getting. We eat a lot better with the same amount of money,” she said.</p>
<p>She also appreciated the flexibility and convenience of being able to pick up her items at her neighbours’ homes.</p>
<p>This process, known as group buying, involves people in the same estate banding together to place bulk orders for items in order to cut delivery costs and enjoy discounts from suppliers.</p>
<p>Group buys have also sprung up island-wide based on shared interests, like for those buying children’s toys or for couples looking to renovate their homes.</p>
<p>But even as it appears that the primary aim of group buys is to get a good deal, other side benefits have emerged along the way. Even hawkers are benefiting, though the question remains: To what extent?</p>
<p>And while there is uncertainty about breaching regulations in running group buys, the positives outweigh the drawbacks, so far, for the likes of Mrs Tan.</p>
<p>Group buying has actually existed since the noughties, but in a slightly different form: E-commerce site Groupon Singapore.</p>
<p>Once popular with consumers, Groupon’s market share went down over the years, and it evolved into a model where the group buy component became “very minor”, according to Nanyang Business School deputy dean Boh Wai Fong.</p>
<p>Both professors agreed that the latest iteration, community-led group buying, has experienced its recent rocketing popularity riding on the back of the circuit breaker and other pandemic restrictions.</p>
<h3><a>READ: For some businesses, enhanced online browsing to drive sales could become a new norm</a></h3>
<p>Indeed, almost all the estate-based group-buy hosts CNA Insider spoke to had got their start during the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>For former cabin crew member Cherie, who runs a group buy in the Changi Simei area, it started out as a way of finding neighbours to share the delivery cost of food.</p>
<p>“Anybody who lives in Simei would tell you the same thing: They’ve been eating the same food from the same hawker stalls since the beginning of time,” said the 28-year-old, who preferred to be known by her first name only.</p>
<blockquote> <p>It’s not financially sustainable for one person to be ordering food from 10 different businesses and paying a S$10 delivery fee 10 times, so I thought this would address the gap and give the community more options.</p> </blockquote>
<p>With time on her hands after the circuit breaker, she started an Instagram account to reach out to more people who might be interested in joining her group buys. She also went around her estate distributing flyers.</p>
<p>Her group chat now has just over 250 participants — a modest number compared to others, she said. But on average, she gets free delivery for about seven in 10 of her group-buy orders.</p>
<p>“I went to join the group to see what food I can order, and I saw a lot of people commenting on a post asking, ‘Who’s staying in Sengkang? Let’s group-buy together,’” she recalled.</p>
<p>She participated in a group buy for Swiss rolls before deciding to start one with Ashley.</p>
<p>Their group buys have expanded to include, on occasion, pillows, hand sanitiser, skincare products and even staycation deals after vendors reached out to them, drawn to their collective buying power.</p>
<p>LOW ENTRY BARRIER, BUT THERE ARE CHALLENGES</p>
<p>The barriers to organising a group buy are low. When Mrs Tan — who started her group buys with frozen fish soup — wanted to try nitrate-free sausages, she decided to ask the supplier if group discounts were available, and there were.</p>
<p>As her group buys are on a small scale, the logistics are simple and it is “not much of a sacrifice”, she said, to do the administrative work of collating orders on a spreadsheet and to liaise with the supplier.</p>
<p>But for others, the work can be more intense. Cheryl estimated that she spends, on average, two to three hours daily on admin, such as doing Google forms to collate orders, answering customers’ questions, checking payments and managing social media.</p>
<p>“It can drain my energy sometimes,” she said, adding that juggling this with her full-time marketing job can be tough.</p>
<p>There can also be hiccups, like customers who forget to collect items or pay for them.</p>
<p>That was something Rachel Lum had to deal with when she used to organise a group buy in her condominium by shopping with Treedots, a social enterprise that matches buyers to surplus meat and seafood sold by suppliers.</p>
<p>For S$18.80, she could get five kilogrammes of fresh chicken breast, split among her neighbours. But not receiving timely payments was a slight price to pay.</p>
<p>“If it was just one person, I’d send a private message. But if that person didn’t respond, I’d tag the person in the group as a reminder,” said the 36-year-old.</p>
<p>Camay Goh, who organises group buys in Yishun, has faced issues with buyers who do not collect their items on time.</p>
<p>So she has instituted “house rules” of sorts: Frozen food will be confiscated if not collected by the end of the day, while other items like crackers can be stored for up to three days.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, there won’t be space to walk in my house,” said the 28-year-old.</p>
<p>Over in Zoe Wong’s four-room flat, one room is set aside for storing the items her customers have ordered. These range from small products, like toothpaste made from natural ingredients, to bulky items like high chairs and tricycles.</p>
<p>Then there is Mandy Lee, who runs large group orders for merchandise from Korean boyband BTS. She sees parcels arriving at her flat, which she shares with her parents, as often as 10 times a day.</p>
<p>“The delivery men all know me already,” said the 34-year-old.</p>
<p>For their efforts, some group-buy hosts collect an admin fee or take a commission from vendors. Cheryl charges a S$2 fee per order, but she stressed that her group buy was primarily a “passion project” rather than a money-making venture.</p>
<p>Mandy, meanwhile, charges customers only enough to cover costs such as the shipping to Singapore and credit card fees.</p>
<p>For her, there are other benefits. The number of orders she places allows her to achieve “Super VIP” status on some websites, which means she can get discounts to offset the cost of her own merchandise.</p>
<p>Experts say group buys are a win-win deal for both customers and businesses. “For customers, the low price is great. And for the businesses, they like bulk orders because there’s a very stable recurring revenue,” said Asst Prof He.</p>
<p>Group buying, he added, comes under a new business model called consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M), which involves “finding opportunities to cut out the middleman”.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a farm selling produce to a wholesaler, which is then sent to a distributor and eventually the grocer’s.</p>
<p>“You cut all of them out, now all of a sudden, you have huge savings that you can pass on to customers,” he said.</p>
<p>But the line between group buying and other models of online shopping such as drop shipping has been blurred.</p>
<p>Drop shipping involves the direct delivery of a product from the manufacturer or supplier to customers. For group buys, the focus is on negotiating with the seller, and hosts need not get their items directly from the manufacturer or supplier.</p>
<p>“They both buy in bulk, and there’s also the chance that group-buy hosts could buy from a manufacturer or wholesaler. It doesn’t restrict them from doing so,” said Prof Boh.</p>
<p>In the case of Group Buy Queens, about 80 per cent of the items come direct from the manufacturer, Zoe estimated. This includes high chairs, foldable car seats and learning towers.</p>
<p>Her partner, Eva, is from China and uses her family’s contacts there to source manufacturers.</p>
<p>“We’re quite open with our reviews,” said Zoe. “When we assess the items, we’d say what we like and what mothers might need to consider before they buy.”</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES BENEFIT TOO</p>
<p>Banding together does not just help customers get a great deal. Home-based businesses and hawkers can also benefit.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Home-based FB businesses flourish amid pandemic</a></h3>
<p>Home-based business Lindle SG, which sells dry mee siam and ngoh hiang, gets about 80 per cent of its orders through group buys. It is run almost single-handedly by one woman, known as Auntie Linda, who does the marketing, cooking and delivery.</p>
<p>“With group buys, my aunt can drop everything off at one location, instead of having to go to six different locations within two hours to make the lunch deliveries,” said Chloe Zhang, a family member who helps out occasionally.</p>
<p>"This means she doesn’t need to rush and has more time to go back home and prepare for the dinner deliveries."</p>
<p>Even popular hawker stalls like Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian at Fengshan Food Centre can benefit from reaching new markets.</p>
<p>Since it started working with group-buy hosts about a year ago, it has delivered packets of their bak chor mee (minced meat noodle) to locations as far away as Jurong West and Bukit Panjang.</p>
<p>“There are very few of us who make soup-based bak chor mee,” said stallholder Sim Chee Moey.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Lim Ke Er, added: “People in the west may not know about or have tried it, so these group buys have helped connect us with them.”</p>

<p>But how much of a difference does it make for hawkers? They cannot put a number to how much group buys have helped, owing to the inconsistency of the bulk orders coming in.</p>
<p>Chee Moey said group buys, on average, range from about 40 to 60 packets. But order sizes can vary. One time, she received an order for 200 packets, although she stressed that it was a rare incident.</p>
<p>There is also no telling when, or how often, hosts come knocking. “Sometimes we only work with them once, and that’s all,” said Ke Er. “They’d also want to cater other food for their members.</p>
<p>“They can’t always eat ours — it’d be very sian (boring).”</p>
<p>They are nonetheless grateful for the extra business.</p>
<p>“Every little bit helps,” the 61-year-old said, citing a drop in business of about 50 to 60 per cent overall.</p>
<p>For this reason, Cherie from Changi Simei Group Buy does not take a cut or ask for bulk discounts from vendors.</p>
<p>“If the uncle is going to sell you char kway teow for S$4, how can you ask him for a discount?” she said. “I don’t have the heart to undercut all these people.”</p>
<p>She also makes a point of supporting businesses doing good.</p>
<p>For example, after finding out about Project Cookoh, an initiative of volunteer organisation ReadAble to help mothers in the Jalan Kukoh neighbourhood start home-based food businesses, she decided to tie up with them to bring their food to Simei.</p>

<p>“I feel that group buys can be used to help the community in general as well, not just to eat,” she said.</p>
<p>SMELLS LIKE KAMPUNG SPIRIT</p>
<p>What started out as a means to get good deals — and support a favourite hawker — has had another welcome side effect: Stronger bonds among neighbours and friends.</p>
<p>Mandy has made many friends through her group buys, and even travelled to Korea to watch a BTS concert with a customer with whom she reconnected.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of closet K-pop fans who like the band but don’t dare to say they do, because there’s a certain stereotype,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve met a lot of people who are solo fans like me, who don’t have other people to share their interests with.”</p>
<p>Some of them have become “very good friends”, she said, and they “hang out whether or not they buy anything”. Others give her small gifts or cakes when they collect their items. “We’re all fans, so we’re tight,” she added.</p>
<p>The estate-based group buys have also turned neighbours into friends. Members of Yishun Group Buy often chit-chat on WhatsApp and share other good deals in the area, such as at new shops in the neighbourhood malls.</p>
<p>“We also go out and eat together, and celebrate occasions,” said Camay. “We wouldn’t have known each other without this group buy.”</p>
<p>Over in Sengkang, the table set up outside Cheryl’s house for people to collect their buys attracted the attention of neighbours who had never gone beyond exchanging greetings.</p>
<p>“Some of them came up to me and asked me what I was selling,” she recalled. “After that, they said they wanted to join.”</p>
<p>Today, they are friends. She often hangs out in one of their homes to work or just spend time together. On collection days, she can count on them to lend a hand. “We do everything together now,” she joked.</p>
<p>While she says that her immediate neighbours do not mind her activities and have joined her group buys at one point or another, she ensures that her activities do not bother them.</p>
<p>“As long as I don’t block their walkway, they’re okay,” she said.</p>
<p>Cheryl and Ashley also ensure that customers practise safe distancing, should a crowd form during collection. Only one person per household is allowed to come up to the unit to collect items.</p>
<p>Camay, meanwhile, requests that her customers text her when they are five minutes away, so she can leave their items in a Styrofoam box outside her door — collections are thus contactless.</p>
<p>Are group-buy hosts worried, however, that they are breaching any regulations for running home-based businesses?</p>
<p>“We’ve done this for a year … If it isn’t allowed, I think someone would’ve come by now,” said Ashley. “We’re playing it by ear for now. If we hear we aren’t allowed to do it, we’d adhere to it.</p>
<p>“We’re not setting out to intentionally break any rules.”</p>
<p>There are also pitfalls like overconsumption.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you see something, you want to help your neighbours hit the minimum spend, and then you find it languishing at the back of your cupboard,” said Mrs Tan. “This is something I’ve learned and tried to avoid.”</p>
<p>But are group buys here to stay, and in what guise?</p>
<p>If the Chinese example is anything to go by, cited Asst Prof He, Singapore could see e-commerce platforms muscling in on the act and possibly crowding out individual community hosts.</p>
<p>Recently, China has seen the meteoric rise of Pinduoduo, which offers discounts to users who invite their friends to join in their purchase.</p>
<p>“Those doing this at the grassroots level can only bring in maybe a few hundred customers. But the platforms could bring in millions,” said Asst Prof He.</p>
<p>But for now, the hosts in Singapore are happy to let their activities remain a side project. Almost all of those CNA Insider spoke to hold full-time jobs and are doing group buys in their free time.</p>
<p>“This is not about making money,” said Mandy. “It can be tiring, tedious at times, but the whole buying process is very fun.”</p>

<p>* denotes name changed to protect the person’s identity</p>
<p>SINGAPORE: When Jane* opened up to her secondary school counsellor about the cold wars and troubles she was having with some close friends, she was told that “life’s like that”.</p>
<p>That was the then 14-year-old’s first session.</p>
<p>“I felt ignored, like (school counselling is hopeless) even if I bring up my problems,” said Jane, now 17 and in her first year at junior college.</p>
<p>“It brings the idea that those who aren’t faring well have some problems and need to see the counsellor, rather than (the idea that) people … want to see a counsellor because of personal reasons,” she said.</p>
<p>After three compulsory sessions on her time management — none of which circled back to the issue with her friends — Jane did not hear from the counsellor again.</p>
<p>Then there is the contrasting experience of Hanna Lee, 19, who was asked to see a counsellor when she was in Secondary 2 for frequent truancy.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go to school. I just had trouble with getting there regularly,” she said.</p>
<p>Her form teacher, who was aware of her family issues, texted or called her whenever she was absent to ask what was going on. One day, the teacher said: “If you need some help, I can arrange an appointment with the school counsellor.”</p>
<p>She remembers learning breathing exercises and wanting to go to school so she would not miss an appointment.</p>
<p>She saw the counsellor for three years, until she graduated from secondary school. Today, she is waiting to start her undergraduate degree in philosophy.</p>
<p>Jane and Ms Lee first shared their experiences on Reddit, where CNA Insider saw at least three threads asking about school counsellors.</p>
<p>Some of the youths agreed that “with school counsellors, it’s really hit-or-miss”.</p>
<a>“ill-equipped” to deal with youths’ mental health issues</a>.
<div><p>With school counselling being one of the first ports of call for students, why is there a disparity in their experiences? Given the task of managing both students’ well-being and their academic standards, what challenges do schools face?</p></div>
<p>‘JUST FOCUS ON STUDYING’</p>
<p>“It felt like I wanted to talk about the issue (affecting me), but I’m constantly being redirected to talk about another thing,” she said.</p>
<p>Unlike the sympathetic ear she was given at secondary school, she felt it was “a lot more” about the practicalities at junior college.</p>
<p>“(The counsellor) said, like, ‘You have all these things, and you need to learn which one to focus on. You only have two years; you need to focus on academics.’ And then I was more stressed,” she said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Students go to school counsellors because they need an escape from academics. But when they go to the school counsellor, they end up talking more about academics. It’s kind of counter-intuitive. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>After that hour-long session, she never went back.</p>
<p>In response to a call via CNA Insider’s Instagram account for experiences with school counsellors, one reader shared that he constantly felt dismissed by the counsellors from his university’s counselling centre.</p>
<p>He was told things like, he was “not prioritising things” or he should “just focus on studying, and everything else will get sorted out”.</p>
<p>The final straw for him? “I was told I should be like other students and just study, and not waste her time and mine,” said the reader, who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>He “struggled through a few more years” while dealing with his parents’ marriage issues, the family business and a break-up, and the centre did not reach out to him. He eventually quit school.</p>
<p>Besides feeling that their worries or stressors were “downplayed”, many people in the Reddit threads were concerned that counsellors would “snitch” on students to their teachers and, especially, their parents.</p>
<p>“(Students) are scared to tell (their) parents. They don’t want to disappoint the parents, or parents could be the source of their pain,” noted former school counsellor Gary Koh.</p>
<p>According to him, all records are confidential, and there are only three instances when counsellors must break confidentiality: Harm to self, harm to others or when the law comes into question.</p>
<p>“She got scolded and punished by her parents. The counsellor reported it to the teachers, who called her parents,” said Jane.</p>
<p>However, some students, like Ms Lee, were told at the outset when the counsellor would have to break confidentiality. So when she shared her suicide ideation with her counsellor some months later, she “knew what (she) was getting (herself) into”.</p>
<p>Teachers, too, find confidentiality hard to navigate. “Sometimes we do need to know, and counsellors may not be able to tell us anything,” said former secondary school teacher Rachel*, who left the profession last year.</p>
<p>“As a teacher, I’d ask the counsellor how the student’s doing. Is there any way I can help? But in terms of what actually goes on, counsellors aren’t supposed to (tell us).”</p>
<p>Where necessary, she used to ask the students directly. “If (the counsellors) feel the need to get parents involved, they’d also have to consult the student,” said Rachel.</p>
<p>Being informed beforehand made a difference for Phoebe Chew. She started seeing her counsellor in Secondary 3 as her teachers were concerned about her home environment.</p>
<p>About three months later, she was informed that her parents would be contacted, though her issues were not related to harming herself or others, or anything to do with the law.</p>
<p>“That was one of the worst nightmares any student could possibly want,” said Ms Chew, now 21 and studying social work and psychology at university. “But I think the school counsellor had enough concerns to raise them to my parents.”</p>
<p>In the end, it was still a “nightmare scenario” as her “parents weren’t happy”.</p>
<p>In serious cases, said Rachel, when she did need to involve parents, that was when it became “a bit tough”.</p>
<p>“The resistance comes more from parents,” she said. “Because some parents refuse to believe their child needs help. They feel like, ‘Oh, it means (my child) is crazy.’”</p>
<p>All students CNA Insider spoke to also reported a sense of fear and shame when going to see the counsellor for the first time.</p>
<p>Marcus* remembers the feeling as he walked to the counselling room, which was located within what looked like a pantry area.</p>
<p>“It feels like a very shameful thing, and I guess being in a school environment, people gossip. I was really scared people would see me going to the counsellor and think something’s wrong with me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Basically, the teacher walked up to me and told me, ‘Actually, you shouldn’t beat yourself up over a girl. If you really can’t handle it, then I’ll give you the number of the school counsellor,’” recalled Marcus, now 21.</p>
<p>Hearing this, he thought, “Am I just emotionally weak? If I go to the school counsellor, it kind of means I’m weaker than everyone else.”</p>
<p>But because he was “screwed up”, he decided he could use some help from the counsellor, even if it felt “lame” and “emasculating”.</p>
<p>Some students also said efforts to inform students about school counselling felt “almost like an afterthought”.</p>
<p>“Whenever the school mentions (it), it’s always very briefly, at the bottom of the (presentation) slide. ‘Oh, by the way, we have a school counsellor, this is the number, the email. Then okay, next slide,’” Ms Chew said.</p>
<p>Others said the counsellor’s office was “tucked away on an upper floor of the school” or “just some room next to the vice-principal’s office”, so it hardly felt prominent, much less welcoming.</p>
<p>She also walked around school, especially during recess, and smiled or waved at students she knew. If they gave any indication of being open to talk, she would walk up and check in with them.</p>
<p>“Most of the students knew that she was a school counsellor, and they were all very open to her talking to students and being around,” Ms Lee said.</p>
<p>RATIO OF COUNSELLORS TO STUDENTS</p>
<p>“At this age, 13 to 18, it’s the period when teens go through the most mental instability, like stress and social anxiety. And pressures really get to them, maybe because their brain hasn’t developed yet or whatever,” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s … when, I feel, the most help needs to go out to students. But looking at the numbers alone, it’s so inadequate.”</p>
<p>On July 27, in the wake of the River Valley High School incident, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in a ministerial statement that all schools now have at least one school counsellor, while some have two.</p>
<p>“Where feasible, we’ll recruit more school counsellors or ‘re-role’ suitable educators, to augment the counselling support network,” he said.</p>
<h3><a>READ: MOE to strengthen support networks in schools; all teachers to get enhanced training on mental health literacy</a></h3>
<p>Teachers told CNA Insider that having one or two school counsellors is insufficient for their schools, especially with the “increasing volume of students who need mental health support”.</p>
<p>Ex-teacher Rachel said school counsellors’ heavy caseloads have resulted in a prioritisation of “urgent cases”, like those with suicidal tendencies, over others.</p>
<p>“It makes sense, but there are students who are struggling with social interactions, for example, which are important too. And these things can build up and escalate,” she said.</p>
<p>“I know they’re doing their best already, but there isn’t enough of them to manage.”</p>
<p>Another teacher, David*, is at a school with a population of “about 900 to 1,000” and one school counsellor available. “Even if we increase to two counsellors, we’re still talking about one counsellor to 400, 500 students,” he said.</p>
<p>Noting that school counsellors often go above and beyond to care for students, he cited how his school counsellor walked one of his students with mental health issues to class every day to build trust and help her overcome her anxiety.</p>
<p>“One case already takes a lot of energy,” said David.</p>
<p>Some schools in Singapore, however, may have more school counsellors than others. Mr Koh, who was a counsellor at an Integrated Programme school for 10 years, said there was a team of seven counsellors to a cohort of 4,300.</p>
<p>That is a ratio of one to 600, which he felt was already “overwhelming” at times. “It’s mentally tiring. All you need to have is one student who has depression — it’d suck the life out of you,” he said.</p>
<p>He eventually left his job owing to the “trauma” of encountering “too many” suicide cases in and out of school. “It takes its toll on you,” he said. “I needed to disconnect for my own well-being,”</p>
<p>Even so, he acknowledged that he was “privileged” to have worked in a team of counsellors as it offered more choices to students.</p>
<p>“It’s like seeing a doctor, right? All doctors are trained, but sometimes you go to one doctor, and you don’t find him helpful. Then you go to the next doctor down the road, you get the same medication, but something is different,” he said.</p>
<p>“The benefit of having a pool of counsellors (is having) different modalities, different styles, different personalities … So a student who may not quite work well with me can find another counsellor whom (he or she) can connect better with.”</p>
<p>David agreed as he has had a few students who have reflected that they had negative experiences with the school counsellor.</p>
<p>“If they have a bad experience, they won’t be so keen to explore counselling again.”</p>
<p>As part of plans to strengthen schools’ capabilities, the Ministry of Education (MOE) aims to deploy more than 1,000 teacher-counsellors in the next few years, up from the 700-plus in schools now.</p>
<p>Teacher-counsellors are teachers who have received additional training so they can help students who are dealing with more challenging social-emotional problems, such as grief and loss.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament this week, Mr Chan said: “Some of (the new teacher-counsellors) will volunteer, and some of them will be identified to take on additional training to become teacher-counsellors</p>
<p>“Instead of teaching two subjects, they may reduce the load of teaching … to even become one subject. But they take on the additional responsibilities within the school to help in the counselling service provided.”</p>
<p>While having more teacher-counsellors may help to take some load off school counsellors, experts CNA Insider spoke to said playing a dual role can be “conflicting” for teachers sometimes.</p>
<p>“(For) a counsellor, one of the most foundational skills is the ability to listen empathically to the essence of what the person is saying, and also to observe the effect of the conversation on the other.”</p>
<p>She added that it will be a “real challenge” for teachers to “switch hats” and hold back on sharing, even if well-intentioned.</p>
<p>Mr Koh observed that even though the school he was with had teacher-counsellors, more students chose to see school counsellors for help.</p>
<p>“I think students still struggle, (thinking), ‘But this is my teacher? This teacher teaches this subject … I don't really want that,’” he said.</p>
<p>This was echoed by former Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong, who advocated prioritising mental health during the Budget 2020 debate.</p>
<p>“The question to ask here is: What’s the primary role of our teachers in schools? If they see their primary role as competency-giving, competency may sometimes be in conflict with students’ well-being,” she told CNA Insider.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t competent (academically), you’re sometimes made to feel terrible in class — and sometimes unintentionally by the teachers.”</p>
<p>Recalling her time as a teacher, Rachel said the biggest “pressure” came from having to keep her students’ grades up.</p>
<p>“I remember a few departments were called down to the principal’s office because those subjects didn’t do well (in examinations),” she cited. “If your class didn’t do well, there was something you did wrong.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: Fewer exams, assessments in schools to reduce emphasis on academic results: MOE</a></h3>
<p>And rather than wearing many hats, Cindy emphasised that “teaching itself is already a full-time job”, something she would like to be able to excel in “because that’s what I signed up for,” she said.</p>
<p>Joyce* concurred, saying that she will never choose to be a teacher-counsellor. “I chose to teach history because I’m good at it, and I love it. You wouldn’t ask a counsellor to teach history on the side, right?”</p>
<p>David, on the other hand, sees the benefits of equipping himself with the basics of counselling.</p>
<p>“For most teachers, you’d have some form of relationship with the students. I think going for it is a good thing … so that I can have a better journey with my students,” he said.</p>
<p>According to him, teachers selected to become teacher-counsellors attend “a full five-day course”, which he wanted to go for when it was offered to him. But he could not, owing to his heavy workload.</p>
<p>As it is, however, some teachers who are not teacher-counsellors have already been acting as counsellors if students are more comfortable talking to them, Cindy said.</p>
<p>“It falls on the teacher to do the follow-up on their mental well-being, as well as triangulate with the parent. We end up wearing many hats: Teacher of knowledge but also a teacher of values and social well-being, and also a teacher-as-caregiver.”</p>
<p>“The new measures come from the underlying assumption that teachers have, or could be equipped with, the ability to diagnose and competently deal with students with mental health issues under our charge,” said Cindy, a secondary school teacher.</p>
<p>“With poorly defined boundaries of where a teacher’s role begins and ends with regards to mental health, the culpability in the case of a repeat incident will fall onto teachers,” she added.</p>
<p>Ideally, teachers and school counsellors would interact in a symbiotic relationship, said Inner Light Psychological Services clinical psychologist Tracie Lazaroo.</p>
<p>She explained that both teachers and school counsellors act as “gatekeepers”, but they possess “unique resources” that will help with their students’ well-being.</p>
<p>“Teachers are equipped with unique student-related knowledge including how they have been performing in class, their temperament, behavioral tendencies and level of interaction with other students,” Dr Lazaroo said.</p>
<p>According to the MOE, teachers are trained to engage students to understand their issues, but should refer them to school counsellors should they need “extensive support”.</p>
<p>Counsellors, Dr Lazaroo said, would be equipped with “more in-depth interviewing skills”. They would also be able to “create support strategies for the student” and make referrals to community services for long-term support.</p>
<p>Hence, some teachers, like Joyce, feel like even with additional training, they can never be fully equipped to take care of students’ mental health, or that there is a limit to what they can do.</p>
<p>“Genuinely, I'm only comfortable to a certain extent. I just don't have the eloquence to phrase things in a way that would help a person and I think it’s a skill to be able to talk about (mental health) in a way that's helpful to a teenager.”</p>
<p>“That’s a skill that counsellors have.”</p>
<p>Cindy agreed, noting that the expectation that teachers should be utilised to tackle mental health “hints at a more systemic issue regarding the perception of teachers and their duties”.</p>
<p>“As much as we wish we have the capacity to do everything that is asked of us, the reality is that the more roles we take on, the worse we are going to perform across all of them.”</p>
<p>‘TEACHING IS JUST 20 PER CENT OF THE JOB’</p>
<p>The most common grievance for teachers who spoke to CNA Insider is having to care for students’ well-being on top of a crushing workload.</p>
<p>In her Facebook post, Mdm Halimah also said that for teachers already overloaded with work, it is not possible for them to "delve deeply" into the issues affecting one child as that would require close monitoring, observation and engagement.</p>
<p>As for teacher-counsellors, Rachel observed that even though those in her school were “slightly offloaded” in terms of teaching responsibilities, there were still “a lot of backend” things that they had to attend to.</p>
<p>“I always tell people that teaching is really just 20 per cent of the job. The rest is administrative, like doing lesson plans, classroom management and marking.”</p>
<p>“Even if you have less classes to teach, when it comes to marking papers, testing exams, everybody has their load.”</p>
<p>David also questioned if teacher-counsellors can successfully juggle the dual role if the number of teachers in a school does not increase - especially when there is subject-based banding in school.</p>
<p>Subject-based banding was introduced in 2019, where students will take subjects at a higher or lower level based on their strengths.</p>
<h3><a>READ: 28 secondary schools to pilot full subject-based banding from 2020</a></h3>
<p>“More banded classes means you’ll need more teachers. It’s not going to be easy to offload teachers to really focus on being a teacher-counsellor.”</p>
<p>Additionally, what is “missing from the conversation” of mental health in schools is the mental well-being of teachers, Cindy shared.</p>
<p>“Mental health issues among teachers are very present, yet rarely talked about … I don’t see how we can create a safe space to discuss mental health issues when we ourselves are situated in an environment that discourages it,” she said.</p>
