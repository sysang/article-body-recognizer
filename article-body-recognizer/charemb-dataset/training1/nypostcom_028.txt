<h3><a>EPISODE 99: JETS SEASON IN REVIEW, CRUCIAL OFFSEASON AHEAD</a></h3>
<p>With around $60 million in cap space this offseason, two top 10 picks and some young talent already in place, there is hope of a brighter future for the Jets.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 98: WILLIE COLON TALKS ZACH WILSON, JETS POSTGAME COMMENTS</a></h3>
<p>My co-host Brian Costello got his roses from Jets fans after his column reacting to the SNY Jets postgame comments made on Sunday on Zach Wilson. Coz roasted Bart Scott and Twitter showed him lots of love. Heck of a column, Coz.</p>
<p>We spoke about that, previewed Jets-Bills and sat down with one of the guys on that postgame crew, former Jets offensive lineman Willie Colon, on the latest “Gang’s All Here” podcast.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 97: ZACH WILSON’S BEST NFL GAME FEAT. ANTHONY BECHT</a></h3>
<p>Zach Wilson played his best game as a NFL QB Sunday.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 96: DAMIEN WOODY TALKS JETS, TOM BRADY, JOHN MADDEN</a></h3>
<p>There is a very good chance that Sunday at MetLife Stadium will be the final time that Tom Brady faces the Jets.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 95: ZACH WILSON, RUN GAME PROPEL JETS TO WILD WIN FEAT. STEVE GELBS</a></h3>
<a>No. 2 pick in the draft</a> to now standing at No. 4. But it’s about wins as the Jets try and build a foundation of success.
<p><a>Zach Wilson</a> gave Jets fans reasons to smile on Sunday, including the signature moment of his rookie season on a 52-yard magical touchdown run.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 94: BATTLE OF THE TOP TWO PICKS FEAT. KIM JONES</a></h3>
<p>To preview Sunday’s game, we bring you a new episode of the “Gang’s All Here” podcast with Brian Costello and Jake Brown, featuring a chat with NFL Network’s Kim Jones.</p>

<p>The Jets will take their talents to South Beach on Sunday as they play the red-hot Dolphins.</p>

<h3><a>EPISODE 91: ZACH WILSON REGRESSES IN UGLY LOSS FEAT. LEGER DOUZABLE</a></h3>
<a>followed that up with an awful performance against the Saints</a> on Sunday, which saw about 20 people left in the building in the final minutes of 
<a>a 30-9 loss at MetLife Stadium</a>. Wilson has had a rocky rookie season with a whole lot more downs than ups. The good thing for Wilson is he did not turn the ball over in a game for the first time this season. That’s where the good ends, though.
<h3><a>EPISODE 90: INJURIES, KICKERS CONTINUE DOOMING JETS FEAT. ERIK COLEMAN</a></h3>
<p>You get a kicker! You get a kicker! You get a kicker! *Insert Oprah GIF here.* Since Nick Folk departed from the Jets after the 2016 season, it’s been a wild ride for Jets kickers.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 89: ZACH WILSON PROGRESSES, BUT DEFENSE STILL STINKS FEAT. STEVE SERBY</a></h3>
<p>Another week, another pathetic showing from the Jets defense.</p>
<a>defense was an atrocity</a>, losing 33-18 to the Eagles to fall to 3-9 on another lowly season. The Eagles did not punt until 1:54 remaining — in the game. That’s unheard of.
<p>The good thing is Wilson <a>looked a lot better than last week’s winning effort</a>, and the Jets hope he can continue to get better and have a complete game without throwing a pick.</p>
<p>To break down Wilson’s performance and the loss, we bring you a new episode of the “Gang’s All Here” podcast with Brian Costello and Jake Brown, including a chat with The Post’s Steve Serby.</p>

<p>The Jets won their first game of the season Sunday. They now try to win one in another country.</p>
<p>They head to London on Sunday to take on the 1-3 Falcons, looking to make it a two-game winning streak heading into their bye. Who better to talk about the state of the team after rookie QB Zach Wilson’s career day than Broadway Joe himself?</p>
<p>Joe Namath joined Jake Brown and Brian Costello on the latest “Gang’s All Here” podcast. We discuss what he has seen from Wilson, Robert Saleh, his career and even some Studio 54 memories. It’s well worth the listen.</p>
<h3><a>EPISODE 75: WILSON’S DAZZLING FIRST JETS WIN FEAT. LEGER DOUZABLE</a></h3>
<a>making big throws when the Jets needed it most</a>. The defense brought the heat on Ryan Tannehill. While it came down to a former Jets kicker missing a field goal to clinch it, a win is a win. Wilson and the Jets badly needed one.

<a>hand the Raiders a victory on a silver platter</a> Sunday. If there ever was a time to not blitz when you have two rookie cornerbacks and are up four points with 12 seconds to go, that would be it. The call ultimately cost Williams his job

<h1> Texas synagogue terrorist Malik Faisal Akram had been probed by UK spy agency</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 9:41am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 11:28am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The British terrorist who took four people hostage at a Texas synagogue had been investigated by UK intelligence services, but determined not to be a terroristic threat, according to reports Tuesday.</p>
<p>Malik Faisal Akram, who had a history of mental illness, was investigated by MI5 “in the second half of 2020” after a tip that he could be a possible Islamist terrorist threat, government sources told the Guardian.</p>
<p>It was “closed shortly afterwards with an assessment that there was no indication he presented a terrorist threat at that time,” a government source also <a>told the Telegraph</a>.</p>
<p>Although he was put on a list of Subjects of Interests (SOI), the spy agency concluded that he did not “pass the threshold” for a full-blown investigation, the UK paper said.</p>
<p>“There were no grounds for further examination and no basis to prevent him traveling,” a source told the Telegraph. </p>
<p>The revelations come amid alarm that Akram was able to enter the US on a tourist visa given warnings over his mental health as well as his extensive criminal record, the papers noted. </p>
<p>His rap sheet dates back to at least 1996, when he was jailed for violent disorder following a baseball bat attack on a member of his extended family, the Telegraph noted.</p>
<p>Police had been <a>trying to locate him</a> as recently as three weeks ago, although it was not clear why, the Sun reported.</p>
<p>Still, Akram was able to fly from the UK to JFK Airport on Dec. 29, listing his intention to stay in a hotel on Queens Boulevard, sources previously confirmed to The Post.</p>
<p>He stayed in the Big Apple for just two days before boarding another flight on New Year’s Eve to Texas, where he had previously stayed at homeless shelters.</p>
<p>On Saturday, he held four people, including a rabbi, in the terrifying ordeal at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville.</p>
<p>Akram was shot dead after the heroic rabbi <a>fought back and threw a chair at him</a>, freeing him and his congregants from the more than 10-hour standoff.</p>
<p>President Biden on Sunday declared it an act of terrorism, and the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK government condemned “this act of terrorism and anti-Semitism.”</p>
<p>A US official told the Telegraph that there was no information on America’s intelligence databases to suggest Akram should be denied entry.</p>
<p>MI5 will look at Akram’s case to see if anything should have been done differently, sources told the paper.</p>
<p>MI5 has up to 3,000 jihadist suspects under active investigation at any one time, with at least 30,000 no longer being investigated, the Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>Two teenagers were detained for questioning in the UK late Sunday, and the FBI was told that Akram appeared to have a close contact in Texas.</p>
<p>Wayne Walker, CEO and pastor of OurCalling, said he turned photos and video over to the FBI showing a man who hugged Akram when he took him to the shelter on Jan. 2.</p>
<p>“He was dropped off by somebody that looked like he had a relationship with him,” said Walker.</p>

<h1> Germany signals it may halt Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 2:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 2:37pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz met with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Berlin on Tuesday to discuss the next steps after the talks in Geneva and Vienna sputtered and said Berlin is willing to stop the pipeline if Russia attacks.</p>
<p>“It is clear that there will be a high price to pay and that everything will have to be discussed should there be a military intervention in Ukraine,” Scholz told reporters.</p>
<p>“We have repeatedly underlined at various levels of this government that if energy is used as a weapon, that would also have a corresponding impact on this pipeline,” Baerbock told reporters as she stood alongside Lavrov.</p>
<p>Lavrov said it was “counterproductive” to politicize the pipeline.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to meet with Baerbock on Thursday, one day after he travels to Kiev for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has deployed more than 100,000 troops and military equipment along Ukraine’s eastern border, a move that US and Western officials say is in preparation for an invasion.</p>
<p>“We are now at a stage where Russia could, at any point, launch an attack on Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. </p>
<p>The pipeline, operated by Russian-owned Gazprom, has been built but has not received regulatory approval to operate.</p>
<p>Critics of the project in the US warn that the pipeline will make Germany and Europe more dependent on Russia for energy.</p>
<p>President Biden <a>said last May</a> that he decided to waive sanctions over the pipeline because “it’s almost completely finished.”</p>
<p>Last week, the <a>Senate rejected</a> a bill introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would have imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2 by a 55-44 vote, falling short of the required 60.</p>
<p>“President Biden should listen to the Senate and to the people and government of Ukraine, and reverse his catastrophic decision to grant Russia waivers from congressionally mandated sanctions,” he added.</p>
<p>Six Democrats voted to support the legislation, with one Republican — Rand Paul of Kentucky — opposing.</p>
<h1> House Dems pass NASA bill sending voting rights to certain Senate end</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 13, 2022 11:36am <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 12:21pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Democrats merged the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act into a single text and crammed the new bill into previously passed legislation extending NASA’s authority to lease its facilities. </p>
<p>Because the so-called “shell” NASA bill already cleared the House and Senate, Democrats can kick-start debate on the Senate floor without Republican support. </p>
<p>Any attempt by Democrats to actually pass the election reform bill will fail in the 50-50 Senate, with no Republicans expected to support attempts to end debate. </p>
<p>The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act looks to undo court rulings that weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by requiring certain states to receive federal preclearance before enacting redistricting plans or new voting laws. </p>
<h1> Trump dismisses Capitol riot ‘Hang Mike Pence’ chants</h1>
<div> November 12, 2021 9:22am <div> Updated <div> November 12, 2021 9:34am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Former President Donald Trump defended his supporters who chanted “Hang Mike Pence” as they breached the US Capitol on Jan. 6, telling ABC News Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl that “people were very angry.”</p>
<p>Pence, Trump’s vice president, was presiding over a joint session of Congress to count electoral votes when rioters overwhelmed law enforcement and broke into the Capitol building, halting the count for hours.</p>
<p>“Were you worried about him [Pence] during that siege?” Karl asked Trump in the audio. “Were you worried about his safety?”</p>
<p>“No, I thought he was well protected, and I had heard that he was in good shape. No,” Trump responded. “Because I had heard he was in very good shape. But, but no, I think —” </p>
<p>“Because you heard those chants,” Karl interjected. “That was terrible. I mean —”</p>
<p>“He could have — well, the people were very angry,” Trump responded. </p>
<p>“They were saying ‘Hang Mike Pence,’” Karl countered. </p>
<a>repeatedly expressed disappointment</a> that Pence did not intervene on that day.
<p>Last month, Pence told Fox News he has a “strong relationship” with Trump and claimed the two men had sat down and “talked through” their differences following the riot. </p>
<p>The vice president added that he and Trump had “parted amicably at the end of the administration and we’ve talked a number of times since we both left office.”</p>
<a>former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows</a> and longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, and is also looking to obtain records from the administration. 
<p>On Thursday, a federal appeals court gave Trump a small win, <a>pausing a lower judge’s </a>order to hand over the documents to investigators.</p>

<h1> Lara Logan dropped by talent agency after comparing Fauci to Nazi doctor</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:08am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 9:42am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Former “60 Minutes” correspondent Lara Logan has been dropped by her talent agency over a recent TV interview in which she compared Dr. Anthony Fauci to Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. </p>
<p>The South African-born journalist made the chilling comparison during a Nov. 29 appearance on “Fox News Primetime,” where she discussed the top US infectious diseases expert and White House chief medical adviser.</p>
<p>Seth Oster, United Talent Agency’s chief communications officer, confirmed to Mediaite Monday that the agency cut ties with Logan several weeks ago.</p>
<p>A company insider told the outlet that Logan was dropped over her “highly offensive” and “unacceptable” comments.</p>
<p>The journalist began hosting “Lara Logan Has No Agenda” on Fox Nation, the network’s streaming platform, after parting ways with CBS News in 2019.</p>
<p>She has appeared regularly on the network as an unpaid guest but has not been booked since comparing Fauci to the Nazi war criminal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no new episodes of her Fox Nation program have aired and Warm Springs Production, the company that produces her series, has distanced itself from her, <a>the Daily Beast reported.</a></p>
<p>Logan declined to comment to the Daily Beast. Warm Springs Production and Fox News did not respond to requests for comment by the outlet.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged that it’s “absolutely true” that she has not appeared on Fox News since November.</p>
<p>When asked about her standing with Fox, she said, “I really don’t know, to be honest, because, you know, I’m not on their payroll. So I, you know, I’m not in communication with them.”</p>
<p>Hecker suggested “it would really be dumb” of Fox Nation not to have Logan back on.</p>
<p>“I think they’ll lose viewers for it,” she said, according to the Daily Beast.“They might not care,” Logan replied. “They just might not care.”</p>
<p>In December, Fauci said on MSNBC that he was “astounded” that Logan had not been disciplined for her “totally slanderous” comments in comparing him to the so-called “Angel of Death,” according to the Daily Beast.</p>
<h1> Cracker Barrel ordered to pay millions to customer who was served chemical</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 12:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A jury in Tennessee ordered Cracker Barrel to pay a man millions for serving him a glass filled with a cleaning chemical instead of water — but he’ll get far less due to a cap on damages, according to his attorney.</p>
<p>But Cronnon will receive only about $750,000 — despite a jury finding that Cracker Barrel acted negligently — due to a limit on economic damages, his attorney told the station Thursday.</p>
<p>“This is an unfair law,” attorney Thomas Greer said. “He will not receive anything close to what he is entitled to.”</p>
<p>Cronnon, whose initial lawsuit sought $150,000 in damages, suffered serious injuries in the incident, including internal burns that he’s still dealing with nearly eight years later, Greer said.</p>
<p>Cronnon’s lawsuit does not indicate who specifically served him the corrosive cleaner instead of water during his lunch. Greer accused Cracker Barrel of abusing the court system by denying that its employees did anything wrong.</p>
<p>“They will likely appeal this verdict and do everything in their power to avoid paying this man a penny,” Greer said. “And I will be prepared to fight for him.”</p>
<p>Reps for the restaurant chain said they were “disappointed” by the jury’s verdict.</p>
<p>The jury returned the verdict after deliberating for roughly 40 minutes, <a>Greer told CNN</a>.</p>
<p>Cronnon, who is still incurring medical expenses due to his injuries, refused to comment, Greer told CNN.</p>
<p>“Cracker Barrel’s negligence didn’t just cause Mr. Smith physical harm, it took away part of his identity,” Greer said.</p>
<h1> Two more House Democrats announce they won’t seek reelection at midterms</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:28pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Reps. Jim Langevin (D-RI) and Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.) announced Tuesday that they will not seek reelection in November, becoming the 27th and 28th House Democrats who will not be back in the chamber after the midterm elections. </p>
<p>Langevin, the first quadriplegic elected to Congress after he was paralyzed as a teen in an accidental shooting, currently serves as a senior member on the House Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Homeland Security. </p>
<p>The Rhode Island Democrat’s announcement comes months after he vowed to seek reelection, even if the Ocean State lost a House seat in redistricting and he was forced to challenge Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) in a primary.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to run as a House Democrat because their majority is doomed.” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement reacting to Langevin’s announcement.</p>
<p>McNerney, 70, was first elected to his Sacramento-area seat in 2012 and currently sits on the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce. </p>
<p>The California Democrat thanked his staff and highlighted their work in helping secure the creation of a veteran’s health center facility in San Joaquin County during his tenure in <a>a series of tweets</a> announcing his retirement. </p>
<p>“Jerry McNerney is making the smart decision to quit instead of watching Democrats lose their majority,” NRCC spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair reacted.</p>
<p>Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to regain the majority in the lower chamber. </p>

<h1> Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik gives Nazi salute during parole hearing</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 9:21am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 2:07pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“I was brainwashed,” Breivik told the court. “The order was … to re-establish the Third Reich. And how to do that is up to each soldier.”</p>
<p>Appearing before the court with a shaven head and black suit, the convicted killer also brought signs that read, “Stop Your Genocide Against Our White Nations” and “Nazi-Civil-War.”</p>
<p>In his speech that lasted more than an hour, Breivik insisted he’s longer a threat to society and should be freed now that he’s served 10 years of his sentence.</p>
<p>“Today, I strongly dissociate myself from violence and terror,” Breivik said. “I hereby give you my word of honor that this is behind me forever.”</p>
<p>Breivik, whose application for early release last year was rejected, offered to live in a non-Western country or the Arctic if granted parole.</p>
<p>He blamed his killing spree due to online radicalization by a leaderless network of far-right extremists who motivated him to act.</p>
<p>Breivik also vowed to keep supporting white supremacist and Nazi ideologies, but said he would do say in non-violent means.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, a judge told Breivik to put the signs he carried into court away as prosecutors presented their case.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see anything of the kind when the prosecutor speaks,” said Judge Dag Bjørvik.</p>
<p>“Our position is that it is necessary with [continued] confinement to protect society,” prosecutor Hulda Karlsdottir told Reuters.</p>
<p>The hearing marks the latest courtroom antics by Breivik, who also made a Nazi salute during a proceeding in 2016 in a bid to improve conditions inside the Norwegian prison where he’s being held.</p>
<p>Prosecutors argued Tuesday that he’s still a clear danger to the public.</p>
<p>“The main topic here is the danger associated with release,” Karlsdottir said.</p>
<p>Relatives of survivors had feared that the hearing would provide Breivik with a public platform to further expose his extremist views while experts have said he’s unlikely to be granted an early release.</p>
<p>In 2016, Breivik entered a courtroom during a bid to improve conditions at a Norwegian prison while putting up a clenched fist, portraying himself as a crusader trying to protect Norway and Europe from Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>Four years earlier, he was convicted on murder and terrorism charges and found criminally sane, rejecting prosecutors’ views that he was psychotic at the time.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s hearing is expected to last a maximum of four days, with a decision expected about a week later. If Breivik’s request for release is denied, he can apply for a new parole hearing in one year.</p>

<h1> Knicks hear Garden boos in matinee stinker vs. Hornets</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 3:52pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 5:53pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>All the good the Knicks had done recently got soiled during a dreary MLK Day matinee performance resembling the rainy weather outside.</p>
<p>It was a lazy stinker — a 97-87 loss to the improved Hornets (24-20) that wasn’t nearly that close. The Knicks trailed by 18 points at halftime and never made a run until the meaningless final two minutes.</p>
<p>This wasn’t how Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau wanted to spend his 64th birthday.</p>
<p>The Knicks might’ve been reading their recent press clippings too closely as they had won eight of their previous 11 and looked ready to make a run up the standings.</p>
<p>“Nobody likes to lose,’’ Knicks center Mitchell Robinson said. “We were disappointed. Plus it’s Thibs’ birthday. .</p>
<p>As they walked off the court at halftime, the Knicks got booed by an angry holiday crowd, the team on its way to falling back to the .500 mark at 22-22 and having its three-game winning streak snapped.</p>
<p>It also was a demonstration the Knicks aren’t on par with a clear Eastern Conference playoff team such as Charlotte, which was without late-scratch LaMelo Ball (non-COVID sickness).</p>
<p>“We started out slow — took time to wake up for an early game. We weren’t right and ready,’’ Robinson said. “Early game, we talked about it. We woke up six minutes into the game and it was too late.’’</p>
<p>It was also a cruel reminder the club passed on Bridges in the 2018 draft to take Kevin Knox, who was traded Thursday for the injured Cam Reddish. Maybe the Knicks actually can use Reddish sooner than later.</p>
<a>relationship with the fans still is on the rocks</a>. When it was announced Randle had picked up a silly foul with 6:00 left in the third quarter, the fans booed.
<p>“Are you going to play defense today or what?” one heckler piped up in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Randle also has declared war on the media. He was not made available to the press for the sixth time in seven games.</p>
<p>Even when the Knicks went to the line, they didn’t capitalize, missing 10 free throws.</p>
<p>“That hurt us,’’ Thibodeau said. ‘In the first half it would’ve allowed them, to get over the hump. Sometimes it’s a concentration thing. It’s a big part of the game and we have to do better.”</p>
<p>Against the Hornets’ zone, the Knicks floundered and shot just 40 percent overall.</p>
<p>The Knicks’ starting lineup had been roaring, but the backcourt of Alec Burks and Evan Fournier took a step back — each scoring six points.</p>
<p>“I love playing here,’’ Bridges said. “Fans are great, the city’s great.’’</p>
<p>On MLK Day, Bridges turned the city into his own.</p>
