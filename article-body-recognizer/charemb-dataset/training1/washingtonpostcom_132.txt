<div><div><p>Wilson High School, the District’s largest public high school, was open for business as usual on Tuesday, but Brian Smith kept his daughter home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ongoing surge in coronavirus infections — including 50 positive tests at Wilson, according to its student newspaper — was enough to spook him and many other parents across the city.</p></div></div>

<a>said in August</a> that if cases reached “a trend of concern,” her administration would do what is “necessary.”
<p>But the details of what is considered a critical mass of people out are unclear. Richard Jackson, who heads the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level leadership, said the school system has “been somewhat evasive” when asked.</p>
<div><div><p>“We just want a clear line around what are the benchmarks that a school reaches in order to be viewed as a school that can go virtual, and that hasn’t been made clear,” Jackson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Deb Goldberg, who has two children in D.C. Public Schools, said many parents at both those schools debated keeping their children home this week given the case surge, though Goldberg decided to send hers in.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Two days later, on Sunday, the school sent a formal notice of 29 positive cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Goldberg’s ninth-grade son, Max Scott, argued for staying home because so many teachers were out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was no point in going because we didn’t have any work or teachers,” he said in an interview. “But you don’t want an unexcused absence, so you got to attend.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After school on Tuesday, Max reported that classes this week were about half empty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve had, I think, one teacher in two days, so that’s not good,” he said. He said teachers have assigned work electronically but that most students spend the class period looking at their phones.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>His mother decided to send her children to school double-masked: one surgical mask and one KN-95.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I thought through the risk of exposure versus what I thought were the benefits of being in school consistently,” Goldberg said. She decided the risks, given their vaccinations, were minimal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That was a trade-off I was willing to make. There is no way to reduce the risk to zero when you send them to school. I acknowledge that,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Goldberg fears that D.C. schools might again move to virtual learning, so it’s important, she said, to take advantage of in-person classes while they are offered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I honestly don’t know how much longer they’ll be in school,” she said. “As long as we’re in person, I’ll send them.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools will require a negative coronavirus test for every student and staffer returning after the holiday break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We certainly weighed this decision and believe it’s very important to elevate our surveillance at this time,” D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools families should<b> </b>pick up rapid antigen tests at schools Jan. 3 and 4, and upload results to the <a>system’s website</a> by 4 p.m. on Jan. 4.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Students who do not meet the deadline will not be allowed to attend school when classes begin Jan. 5.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said in an interview Wednesday that the requirement was a good idea, because there’s a lot of angst over the coronavirus surge among parents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Requiring that everyone is tested begins to address that,” Mendelson said. “It’s reasonable that we want to take every step possible to reduce community spread.”</p></div></div>

<a>Fairfax</a> counties, will begin
<a>“test-to-stay” programs</a> that allow unvaccinated students exposed to the coronavirus by a classmate to get tested regularly at school to ensure they are not infected. If they test negative, they are allowed to stay in school.
<div><div><p>D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) referred to the school system’s effort to test over 90,000 students as the city’s “biggest data collection effort throughout covid.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Throughout January, we’re going to have to maintain vigilance about access to the building,” Bowser said. “And we’re going to do our part in the buildings, and we ask that families do their part.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Public Schools’ leadership will host a virtual town hall at 4 p.m. Thursday to further address questions about its return plan.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>How, exactly, will the decision to close schools be made? District officials haven’t said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re not getting clear directives from the leadership,” said Richard Jackson, head of the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level leadership in the school system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said at a news conference Wednesday that he expects some schools will have to pivot online, given the surge in cases throughout the city.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In neighboring Montgomery County, a decision will be made about whether to switch to virtual learning when 5 percent of students, staff and teachers test positive for the coronavirus in a 14-day period, officials <a>have said</a>.</p></div>
<b> </b>For the upcoming semester, Ferebee pledged that families would be notified if their school had to transition to virtual learning by 8 p.m. each evening, unless “there are any extenuating circumstances.”

<div><p>Teachers have often found out from their colleagues instead of their employer who is testing positive for the coronavirus before an official case notification, said Aggie Payton, a special-education teacher at Whittier Elementary.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This is why a lot of people have been quitting or really been upset with this whole covid procedure,” Payton said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Parents, too, have been frustrated because they don’t see a closure coming and can’t prepare in time, said Council member White, who has one child enrolled in a D.C. public school.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re trying to make decisions as parents that’s in the best interest of our children, and we don’t have the information we need to do that,” White said.</p></div></div>

<p>With slot machines flashing and victory bells ringing in the background, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) waved a small slip of paper at the MGM National Harbor casino on Thursday — he had just placed the first legal sports bet in Maryland.</p>
<div><div><p>Hogan put $50 on the prospect of the two Maryland-based teams, the Washington Football Team and the Baltimore Ravens, facing off in the upcoming Super Bowl.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a win, win for Maryland.” Hogan said. “The only loser is MGM because they’re going to have to pay me more than 20 grand when I hit this one.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>an industry that is projected to bring in about $100 million annually once fully up and running.
<div><div><p>“We’ve been behind. People have been betting in our neighboring states and in other places,” Hogan said. “It’s been a long time coming, and I think it’s going to be good.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C.'s sports betting app keeps underperforming, with lots of finger-pointing about what’s to blame</p></div>
<div><div><p>Sports betting has been authorized in 30 states and D.C., and has grown to be a multibillion-dollar industry since a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision stuck down a congressional ban that had restricted sports wagering.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2020, Maryland voters approved a ballot question to allow sports betting in the state. Then, earlier this year, the General Assembly passed a law setting the framework for the industry.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Sports gambling could be the pandemic’s biggest winner</p></div>

<div><p><span>The NFL once viewed sports betting as a threat. Now the league wants the action.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Hogan was joined Thursday by former Washington Football Team player Joe Theismann and Prince George’s County Council Chair Calvin S. Hawkins II, who both placed bets.</p></div></div>

<a>became the first of the chain to unionize earlier this month</a>. Earlier this year, Moe’s Books,
<a>an independent bookstore in Berkeley, Calif.,</a> unionized. Fueled by the coronavirus pandemic and labor market demands, experts say workers are feeding off the energy from other movements to feel empowered to start organizing in their own workplaces.
<div><div><p>Employees at Politics and Prose say they want to join the United Food Commercial Workers Local 400 to help them get a voice in health and safety policies, a living wage and clearer pay transparency.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>they “fully support the right of staff members at P P to unionize if a majority desires it.”
<b> </b>“add a layer of uniformity and bureaucracy that can stifle the kind of originality and flexibility that have helped make P P the valued community enterprise it is.”
<b> </b>wanting a procedural vote to give more people an opportunity to weigh the options, they said in their staff email. And
<b> </b>shortly after employees filed the petition for an election, the owners hired Jones Day for legal representation, one of the largest law firms in the country that has been
<a>known for aggressive union contract negotiations</a>.
<div><div><p>Graham and Muscatine said they hired lawyers from Jones Day because they had previously worked with them on other matters.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The bookstore has cultivated a strong following and customer base in D.C. — some of whom were surprised by the owners’ decision to not voluntarily recognize the union.
<div><div><p>This isn’t the first time employees have attempted to unionize at the bookstore. Workers at Politics and Prose tried to organize under the previous ownership, which also opposed the effort.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Add in a base of well-educated and often liberal workers and consumers in bookstores who are watching other workplaces around the country unionize, Fine said, and there’s strong conditions for organizing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It makes sense that it’s happening now, and it makes it sense that it’s happening in bookstores,” Fine said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The union will spend the next few days settling on the parameters of the election, including who gets a vote, when and where it will be held, all in accordance with the NLRB. The election will probably be held by the end of next month.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Employees said they are organizing because they love the bookstore and see the union as a way for it to grow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve had such wonderful times here,” Salazar said. “But I just feel like the love that we have for reading and for book culture is not something that should be taken advantage of.”</p></div></div>

<a>its own outbreak</a>. And while area schools were laboring to get to their breaks safely by implementing testing and giving extra days off, this week has brought omicron-variant fears and more drastic measures.

<div><p>Good Counsel cancels rest of 2021 classes after covid outbreak</p></div>
<p>Whittier parents previously had received four different letters over the past week notifying them of positive <a>coronavirus</a> cases in the building. Entire classes at a time were initially sent home to quarantine, as other D.C. schools have done.</p>
<p>“We want our families to know we’re committed to safe operations, and when we do have safe operations, we will see the best learning experience possible,” D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said in an interview.</p>

<div><div><p>Parents in Virginia’s largest school district have filed a recall petition against Fairfax County School Board member Laura Jane Cohen (Springfield) over her handling of school closures during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Loudoun parent group files third recall petition against school board, targeting Vice Chair Atoosa Reaser</p></div>
<div><p>In a statement, Cohen disputed the accusations against her, calling the removal attempt “wrong on the facts and wrong on the law.” She called on the circuit court judge to immediately dismiss the parents’ petition.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Spokeswomen for Fairfax County Public Schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p></div></div>
<a>Cohen previously served as a long-term substitute teacher</a> in the Fairfax school system and has also served on district committees including the Career and Technical Education Advisory Committee.
<a>five-page manifesto published to the group’s website</a>, members argue that the Fairfax school board failed students and ignored the wishes of parents by keeping schools closed for much of the pandemic.
<div><p>The petition against Cohen is the second such recall attempt filed by the Open FCPS Coalition. In July, the group <a>filed a recall petition against board member Elaine Tholen (Dranesville)</a>, after gathering more than 5,000 signatures.</p></div>
<a>ruling that</a> “the petition is not based on facts establishing probable cause for removal.”
<div><p>Virginia judge dismisses parents’ recall petition against Fairfax school board member</p></div>
<a>an FAQ posted on the group’s website</a>.
<a>Fight For Schools has so far filed recall petitions against three members of the Loudoun County School Board</a>; one member later resigned, and two recall efforts are ongoing.
<a>Ballotpedia</a>. The most recent Virginia recall effort, pursued against a Prince William County Public Schools board member in 2018, culminated in his resignation.
<header><div/><div><div><a>Education</a></div></div><div><h1>School threats and social media hoaxes are forcing closures, time-consuming investigations</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Hannah Natanson</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Laura Meckler</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 20, 2021 at 3:50 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><div><div>correction</div><p>A previous version of this story said the site of a 2018 mass shooting in Florida was Parkland High School. It was Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla.</p></div></div></div>
<p>School officials contacted the police, setting in motion a full-scale investigation, and the school system decided on a fairly drastic step — closing all campuses, not just the targeted school, for all of its 3,500 students the next day.</p>
<div><p>How can schools detect potentially violent students? Researchers have an answer.</p></div>
<div><p>After Michigan shooting suspect’s parents are arrested, town grapples with an awful new reality: ‘Everyone’s on edge’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Experts are similarly conflicted — emphasizing the need to err on the side of caution but warning of possible downsides.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Fake accounts ... fake threats’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The threats run the gamut.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In New Haven, Conn., a high school closed early on Dec. 6 when a 911 caller warned that someone was approaching the campus with a gun. Police say the girl who made the call admitted lying, was arrested and is now facing felony charges.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“At this point, there are no credible threats,” the message said. “However, even hoax threats create fear and cause disruption to the school community.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>After Michigan school shooting, experts question what could have prevented it</p></div>
<p>McGarry, the Pennsylvania superintendent, said it has become enormously difficult to tell real promises of violence from false ones. He said his staff has recently had to work after hours, on weekends and through holidays to help track down threats.</p>
<div><div><p>“You can get a picture of a picture sent out on social media,” McGarry said. “We are seeing fake accounts, dummy accounts, fake threats.”</p></div></div>
<p>McGarry said the photo turned out to be a picture of “a kid from another community somewhere else,” with no ties to Upper Darby, holding a pellet gun. And police determined the person who sent the message was not an Upper Darby student.</p>
<div><div><p>“For many students, their mental health situation — unrecognized, untreated — might turn to violence as a way for them to express themselves,” Thompson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of course, some threats are not hoaxes. And some threats, even if impossible to carry out, have very real roots in student distress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘DO NOT GO this is important’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a flood of threats continue to inundate schools, some are trying to develop longer-term solutions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the meantime, though, school officials continue to face fast-developing and swiftly changing crises, forcing them to make quick judgment calls in situations in which there are few if any right answers.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Many parents of school shooters ignore glaring warning signs. This grandmother didn’t.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s a little easier in this day and age,” he said. “They have the mechanism to learn from home. Years ago, that wasn’t the case.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the Reading district in Ohio in mid-November, “a trickle, then a flood” of reports came into the district about a social media post warning of violence at school, Enix said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Police immediately launched an investigation and deemed it a credible threat, Enix said. By 9 p.m., the district had decided to close schools the next day. Police arrested a student later that evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The truth is,” Enix added, “if we hadn’t closed school, I’m not sure how many students or staff would have been here that day.”</p></div></div>

<div><span><div><span><div>By Hannah Natanson</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Donna St. George</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Perry Stein</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><div><p>Schools have spent the past few months refining guidelines on masks, staff vaccines, quarantines and other strategies to try to limit the spread of the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ask The Post: We’re taking your questions on returning to school amid the delta variant</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here is a look at some of what’s planned in area districts:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Alexandria City Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 24 for all schools except for Samuel W. Tucker Elementary School, which started Aug. 9. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a mask mandate? Are masks required during recess or lunch?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Masks are required for everyone indoors and while in school vehicles, regardless of vaccination status. No masks are required outside for recess. Students must wear masks during lunch when they are not eating.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for staff members?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All staff members must be fully vaccinated or participate in weekly testing. But school board members <a>said recently</a> that they want a stronger vaccine mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is the school system doing testing? If so, how often and what kind?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district plans to do voluntary, “surveillance” testing of students with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a virtual option? Who is eligible?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district expects to have nearly 530 students learning through the <a>Virtual Virginia</a> program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What are the district’s quarantine rules?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said that per health and safety guidelines, quarantine is 14 days from the date of exposure for close contacts. More details are available on the <a>district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is your district preparing for a possible return to all-virtual schooling should the public health situation force it?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said that it is prepared to pivot quickly to virtual learning if needed and that the infrastructure used last year will remain in place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available <a>on the district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><p>Northam mandates masks inside all K-12 schools in Virginia this fall, even for the vaccinated</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Arlington Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school:</b> Aug. 30.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Staff members <a>are required to be fully vaccinated</a> or be tested regularly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for students?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Starting Nov. 8, high school athletes and eighth-graders <a>participating</a> in winter and spring sports must be vaccinated. Students with medical exemptions must undergo testing for the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district will test students weekly, and families will be asked to opt in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district said it is expecting 800 students to participate across all grade levels. Everyone is eligible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said it will not close school buildings and shift to full virtual instruction unless state officials order it to do so.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>D.C. Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school</b>: Aug. 30. Charter schools, which educate nearly half of the city’s public school students, have <a>varying start dates</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All students and staff members, regardless of their vaccination status, must wear a mask indoors. During lunch, everyone is asked to wear a mask when they are not eating or drinking.</p></div></div>
<a>fully vaccinated by Nov. 1</a>. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) had previously required
<a>all city employees</a> — including school staff members — to be fully vaccinated or get tested each week.
<div><div><p>Student-athletes ages 12 and older <a>must be fully vaccinated</a> by Nov. 1 to participate in school-based sports. Students who turn 12 between Sept. 20 and Nov. 1 must be vaccinated by Dec. 13.</p></div></div>
<a>automatically enroll</a> all public school students into the testing program. Families can opt out. Charter schools may opt into this program, or use a city grant to enact one of their own.
<div><p>D.C. fell short of student testing goals in the spring</p></div>
<a>approved expanding virtual learning eligibility</a> for some charter schools.
<p>The Bowser administration has remained steadfast that it intends to require in-person learning for nearly all students this academic year, and the mayor has said she is not watching for any specific coronavirus case number that could change that.</p>
<div><div><p>Other schools across the city have been prepping for another post-winter break covid-19 surge, and some will take a stricter approach than D.C. public schools’ test-recommended-but-optional approach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>KIPP DC, the city’s largest charter network, changed its plans last week: Now students will be returning to virtual instruction and learning asynchronously on Jan. 3.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Fairfax County Public Schools:</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 23. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a mask mandate? Are masks required during recess or lunch?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a vaccine mandate for staff members?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. All Fairfax school employees must be vaccinated by late October or submit to regular testing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Yes, for high school student-athletes. The district announced Aug. 30 that it will require <a>students who play winter and spring high school sports</a> and other activities that require a physical to show proof of vaccination by Nov. 8.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Is the school system doing testing? If so, how often and what kind?</b></p></div></div>
<p>The district plans to partner with a third-party provider to administer testing, and will continue to work with the county health department to test symptomatic in-person students or staff members who are unable to access testing independently.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Is there a virtual option? Who is eligible?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, although eligibility is limited and based on a documented health need. About 400 students are enrolled in the district’s virtual program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What are the district’s quarantine rules?</b></p></div></div>
<a>website</a> says that in the event of an exposure to the virus, it will work with the county’s health department to conduct contact tracing and determine whether quarantining is necessary. The district said
<a>protocols are in place</a> to ensure continuity of learning.
<div><div><p><b>Is your district preparing for a possible return to all-virtual schooling should the public health situation force it?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district plans to remain open unless directed otherwise by health officials or by executive order. Officials said the system has plans to ensure continuity of learning in the event of a temporary closure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available <a>on the district’s website.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Loudoun County Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Aug. 26.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. All school employees must be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1 or submit to weekly testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district is not performing testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes. The district said that all students were welcome to apply for its distance learning program and that 533 were accepted. Additional students with serious medical conditions were then welcomed to apply off a wait list.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The district said state law does not allow for a return to all-virtual learning, but individual classrooms or schools may temporarily pivot based on in-school virus transmission.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Montgomery County Public Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school</b>: Aug. 30.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, masks are required for all. Masks are strongly encouraged but not required for outdoor recess. Students must be masked while indoors but can remove their masks while eating.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employees <a>must be vaccinated</a>. Those with medical waivers will have to submit to regular testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The school system will do pool testing for random samples of students in prekindergarten through sixth grade, as younger<b> </b>students are not yet eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Yes. The district is offering a virtual academy to accepted students. Eligible students had to show extenuating circumstances, including physical challenges, mental health needs or demonstrated academic success during virtual learning.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Only if ordered by state or federal officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Prince George’s County Schools</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>The first day of school: </b>Sept. 8.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Masks are required indoors and also at recess and when students are not eating during lunch.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The district will conduct coronavirus testing and screening of students and staff members as needed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>If a single coronavirus case is confirmed, the system will close the exposed area of the facility. But if multiple cases are confirmed within at least three days, the system will close the entire facility to clean and sanitize all areas.</p></div>
<div><div><p>More guidance is available at on the <a>district’s website.</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>correction</div><p>A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Anita Deshpande in a photo caption. The caption has been corrected.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reports of the demise of snow days have proved an exaggeration.</p></div></div>
<p>As Americans slog and shrug into year three of this global nightmare, amid the onslaught of the omicron variant and facing a battery of boosters, it was the least the adults could do, said Frank Bellavia, spokesman for Arlington Public Schools.</p>
<div><div><p>“We wanted students to have some sense of normalcy,” he said, “which is why the decision to have snow days.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Region’s biggest snowstorm in three years ends, leaving more than 500K customers without power</p></div>
<i>.</i> And in Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools and Prince George’s County Public Schools, the two largest districts in the state.
<div><div><p>For 9-year-old Lucy Kaufholz and 10-year-old Eve Kaufholz, sisters who moved to Virginia from Florida this summer, Monday meant enchantment — and an early start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy woke up before the sun did, because “my brain gets up early on exciting days.”<b> </b>She got up at 5:54 a.m. on Christmas Day, for example. Monday saw her rise exactly three minutes later, at 5:57 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It wasn’t super snowy yet. Still, Lucy, Eve and their parents — Brianne Kaufholz, 40, and Eddie Kaufholz, 41 — bounded outside for a walk, where they discovered they had the entire neighborhood to themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lucy still cannot believe how much it snowed. At one point, she stuck her ruler into a drift in the front yard — and the snow swallowed it whole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brianne Kaufholz said she is glad Arlington called a traditional snow day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re young enough, they’re going to learn what they need to learn,” Brianne Kaufholz said. “Them experiencing the world on a snow day? That’s more important.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Several D.C.-area school systems will close again Tuesday after the snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>School officials offered similar explanations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bellavia of Arlington noted that his district has built six snow days into its academic calendar this year. Julie Moult, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax school system, said her district has allotted five snow days this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“FCPS believes that traditional snow days provide a memorable and much-loved childhood experience for our students,” Moult said.</p></div></div>
<a>the school system issued on Dec. 10</a>. The district is returning to pre-pandemic-style snow days, with no plan for virtual instruction as an alternative when physical classrooms close.
<div><div><p>“Students participating in learning is important,” he wrote in an email. “The best choice is dependent on the facts driving an operational decision.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Perhaps the most surprising declaration Monday came from Prince George’s County, where children are learning remotely. The district <a>reverted to virtual schooling</a> in mid-December because of rising coronavirus cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the district said three snow days had been built into this year’s school calendar — and officials decided to use one of them Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She gave no reason why a snow day was necessary if children were already attending school online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then again, maybe no reason was needed.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The clash is creating the starkest tension yet this school year about classroom-based learning as the pandemic rages on. For some, it is another tug-of-war between safety and education. For others it’s more nuanced.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In face of omicron surge, schools push ahead with in-person classes</p></div>

<div><div><p>“Having students return from break, and not having a testing protocol first, sets us up for a danger of not only having our school operations collapse but also our health-care system,” Martin said.</p></div></div>
<a>Coronavirus infections have climbed </a>across the region, surpassing 2 million. The seven-day average of new daily cases is up 110 percent in Virginia, 7 percent in D.C. and 74 percent in Maryland as of Monday, according to a Washington Post

<div><div><p>At about 8 a.m. Tuesday morning, Safwan Aziz and John Hildenbrand hit their breaking points.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The problem was that two massive trees had fallen during the snowstorm, blocking the welders’ way out. Each one easily weighed several hundred pounds, the men said. They were laden with heavy snow and frozen to the ground.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Now, Aziz and Hildenbrand decided, they would push the trees out of the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was kind of like a survival mode,” Hildenbrand said. “We just felt: ‘I need to get off this highway.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just wanted,” Aziz said, “to get the hell away from that road.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sen. Tim Kaine was stranded on I-95 for nearly 27 hours</p></div>
<div><div><p>Knocking on strangers’ car windows in the predawn darkness, Hildenbrand and Aziz felt the stirrings of an odd sense of community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One man darted into his car, produced several cans of Pepsi and cut off their tops to make impromptu mugs. He filled them with Aziz and Hildenbrand’s coffee and began handing them out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was a little later, with the sun high in the sky, that the two men had the same crazy idea about the trees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As they took Exit 140, Aziz noticed a man sitting in a truck labeled VDOT, for Virginia Department of Transportation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was just sitting there in his car all warm and cozy, didn’t look like he had a care or concern about all the miles of traffic he was looking at,” Aziz said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite their lack of sleep, the two men decided to head straight for their original destination in South Carolina.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aziz felt grateful for the cold beer, the good food and the fact he wasn’t driving anymore. And for one extra thing, too.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s a good thing John and I are such good friends, because it should be illegal to have to spend 36 hours” trapped in a car with another man, Aziz said. “A good looking-woman? Maybe. But a man? No way.”</p></div>

<b> </b>left many parents struggling to upload their results.
<div><p>As of Thursday morning, approximately 39,000 of the system’s 50,000 students had returned their results, <a>according to officials</a>. Families reported 2,189 positive coronavirus cases; 672 staff members said they were infected.</p></div>
<a>about 7,000 staffers</a>, but 9,200 test results were uploaded from this group.
<div><div><p>DCPS representatives did not answer a request to explain these inconsistencies.</p></div></div>
<a>failed intermittently</a> Tuesday and Wednesday, DCPS sent out an email to parents advising them that students could bring a screenshot of their negative result or a signed note certifying that their result was negative.
<p>Washington Teachers’ Union President Jacqueline Pogue Lyons said she did not believe that was a fair complaint, given the union’s push to require testing before students entered the building and to certify proof of the results.</p>
<div><div><p>Some teachers told The Post on Thursday that staff and student attendance was low at their schools and that they could not teach their normal lessons. But teachers also expressed relief.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There have just been a few concerns, a few glitches,” Lyons said early Thursday afternoon, before the school day ended, “but I haven’t heard anything overall that’s concerning.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s good, but I think they need to physically see them take the test,” Robinson said Thursday morning. “I’m just hoping people are honest.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trivoria Ballard, 33, walked with her children to Tubman Elementary. She had taken her six children to their doctor’s office so they could get PCR tests, but those results take longer and her four Tubman kids needed a rapid test.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I just feel like it’s too much,” Ballard said. “Why go through all of this to get the kids tested to see who’s positive or who’s negative? Why not have them just be virtual?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was awesome,” Willis said. “She was tested and in the classroom within 15 minutes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For example, with my youngest, her teacher makes her put her mask on while she’s chewing her food,” he said. “Which is absurd!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If anything,” McGilly said, “you get more attention when there’s fewer kids around.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I expect that there were probably a hundred different ways to get kids in the building, and I’m looking forward to figuring out what worked,” Bowser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In response, the school system <a>announced</a> in October it would spend $22 million to equip each campus with a full-time substitute teacher and a coronavirus response coordinator.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The next challenge for the district is likely to come next week when more students are expected to show up for classes, said Richard Jackson, head of the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level school leadership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower attendance numbers reported by some school leaders Thursday, he said, made it easier to test students who showed up at schools without proof of a negative test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Monday will be the real day where they’ll see if their systems really work,” Jackson said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The clash is creating the starkest tension yet this school year about classroom-based learning as the pandemic rages on. For some, it is another tug-of-war between safety and education. For others it’s more nuanced.</p></div></div>

<h2>Surges put 89 more schools at risk of closing, after more than 5,600 positive tests over winter break</h2>

<div><p>D.C.-area parents and teachers split over return-to-school plans</p></div>
<div><div><p>As of 6 a.m. Monday, 5,680 students and staff members had reported having tested positive over the winter break, including 4,677 during the break’s last five days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This absolutely reflects a trend that we are seeing across the Washington, D.C., region,” McKnight said.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Can ‘test-to-stay’ keep kids in schools safely? A Maryland system is finding out.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The 11 district schools that are switching to virtual are designated as red schools, while 89 more are yellow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Tuesday’s decision drew criticism from a mix of parents and educators who pointed out that the decision to close each school was based on self-reported data that they believe is unreliable.</p></div></div>
<a>a “test-to-stay” protocol</a> in Montgomery — said the school system had broken its promise to make a decision based on in-school spread and to use the 5 percent cutoff as one indicator, not an automatic pivot point.
<div><div><p>All schools over 5 percent were switched to virtual learning, according to school district data, although officials said each decision had been considered carefully, with advice from the county health department.</p></div></div>
<p>Some parents said they were worried about what comes next, with 89 schools in the yellow zone. “Unless they make a commitment and policy decision, half of the kids in the school system will be out of school by Monday,” Reesman predicted.</p>
<div><div><p>Without testing, Martin said, “How do we know we have captured the full extent of the problem?”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Covid-19 cases, vaccination rates and hospitalizations in the D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><p>Others were frustrated that the school system’s plans were not more proactive, nearly two years after the pandemic began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Omicron was not some kind of sneak attack,” said Lyric Winik, PTSA president at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. “Where were the advance plans for handling another covid influx?”</p></div></div>
<a>Coronavirus infections have climbed </a>across the D.C. region, surpassing 2 million. The seven-day average of new daily cases is up 114 percent in Virginia, 3 percent in the District and 89 percent in Maryland as of Tuesday, according to
<a>a Washington Post tracker</a>.
<div><div><p>The test positivity rate in Montgomery County is 27 percent, according to <a>state data</a> — more than 25 times what it was in the summer and more than eight times what it was in early December.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it’s the wisest decision they could have made,” said Hannah Donart, a mother of two children at Monocacy Elementary, one of the schools that was switched to virtual instruction.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was a relief actually,” she said of the move to virtual instruction. “I’m afraid of passing it on.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Students from the 11 schools will start with full-day live instruction Thursday, school officials said, following a day of teacher planning and asynchronous instruction.</p></div></div>
