<h1> Is Your Partner Passive-aggressive? </h1>
<h2> Learn the symptoms, their subtle tactics, and what you can do. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Passive Aggression? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Passive-aggressive</a> people act passive, but are covertly aggressive. They’re basically obstructionist, and try to block whatever it is you want. Their
<a>unconscious</a> anger gets transferred onto you, and you become frustrated and furious. Your fury is theirs, while they may calmly ask, “Why are you getting so angry?” and blame you for the anger they’re provoking.
<a>codependent</a>, and like codependents, suffer from
<a>self-esteem</a>. Their behavior is designed to please to appease and counter to control. You may be experiencing abuse, but not realize it, because their strategy of expressing hostility is covert and manipulative, leading to conflict and
<p><a>Personality disorders</a> are persistent and enduring. According to the American Psychological Association passive-<a>aggression</a> was considered a personality disorder in the <a>DSM-IV</a>:</p>
<p>The DSM-IV ascribed the disorder to someone with negative attitudes and passive resistance to requests for adequate performance, indicated by at least 4 of these traits not due to <a>depression</a>:</p>
<p>• Passively resists fulfilling routine tasks</p>
<p>• Complains of being misunderstood and unappreciated</p>
<p>• Is sullen and argumentative</p>
<p>• Scorns and criticizes authority</p>
<p>• Expresses <a>envy</a> and resentment toward those seeming more fortunate</p>
<p>• Frequently makes exaggerated complaints of misfortune</p>
<p>• Shows alternating hostile defiance and contrition</p>
<a>narcissistic</a> personality disorders, negative
<a>childhood</a> experiences, and
<p>Characteristics of Passive-Aggression</p>
<a>Denial</a>: Like all codependents, they’re in denial of the impact of their behavior. This is why they blame others, unaware of the problems they’re causing. They refuse to take responsibility for anything, and distort reality,
<a>rationalize</a>, blame, make excuses, minimize, deny, or flat out lie about their behavior or the promises or agreements they’ve made.
<p>Forgetting: Rather than say no or address their anger, they forget your birthday or the plans you’ve discussed, or forget to put gas in the car, pickup your prescription, or fix the leaky toilet. You end up feeling hurt and angry.</p>
<p>Obstructing: This is another nonverbal form of saying NO. When you try to decide on where or when to go on vacation, pick out an apartment, or make plans, they find fault with each suggestion and won’t offer any of their own.</p>

<h1> Passive Aggression at Work: The Perfect Office Crime </h1>
<h2> 5 ways that hidden hostility can derail the workplace. </h2>

<p>An employee's resume reads something like this:</p>
<ul><li>Avoiding responsibility for tasks</li> <li>Doing less when asked for more</li> <li>Missing deadlines</li> <li>Withholding information</li> </ul>
<li>Using sick days during major team projects to disrupt group <a>productivity</a></li>
<li>Resisting suggestions for change or improvement</li>
<li>Bypassing direct supervisor by emailing department head with complaints</li>
<li>Leaving Post-It notes to angrily tell others to clean up their mess</li>
<li>Using e-mail to avoid face-to-face communication</li>
<li>“Forgetting” and “misplacing” important documents</li>
<li>Embarrassing co-workers during meetings and presentations</li>
<li>Following the letter of the law but violating its spirit completely</li>
<li>Insisting “that’s not my job”</li>
<li>Consistently behaving this way across most workplace situations</li>
<p>Is there someone in your office who flaunts these <a>passive-aggressive</a> credentials? </p>
<a>aggression</a> is a deliberate and masked way of expressing feelings of anger (Long, Long Whitson, 2017). When exhibited in the workplace, passive-aggressive behaviors impact everything from department morale to organizational productivity.
<p>If you think you may be dealing with a passive-aggressive employee or co-worker, read on to readily recognize five main categories of this destructive behavior:</p>
<p>Category 1: Temporary Compliance</p>
<a>management</a>, acts of temporary compliance are most satisfying.
<p>Category 2: Intentional Inefficiency</p>
<p>The passive-aggressive worker feels it is more important to express her covert hostility than to maintain her appearance of professional competence. She uses intentional inefficiency to complete work in a purposefully unacceptable way:</p>
<p>Category 3: Letting a Problem Escalate</p>
<p>Sabotage is the name of the game for the passive-aggressive employee who justifies her characteristic crimes of omission by saying, “I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>Category 4: Hidden but Conscious <a>Revenge</a></p>

<div> <div> <h1>Can Personality Change?</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>While traits show stability over time, personality can indeed change—and psychologists continue to explore why, how, and when that happens.</p>
<h2> How Personality Changes With Age </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some ways personality changes in adulthood? </h3> </div>
<a>again 50 years later</a> showed increases in traits such as calmness (thought to be related to emotional stability) and social sensitivity (related to agreeableness). Other work has found evidence that
<a>narcissism decreases</a>, on average, over time.
<div> <h3> How does personality change when we’re growing up? </h3> </div>
<a> increasingly more distinct trait profiles</a> as they grow older. Research involving adolescents and young adults indicates
<div> <h3> Do personalities change after major life events? </h3> </div>
<h2> Changing Personality on Purpose </h2>
<div> <h3> Can you change your personality? </h3> </div>
<a>whether through special courses</a> or through a time-worn method of change:
<div> <h3> How quickly can personality traits change? </h3> </div>
<a>may be enough</a> to enhance a specific facet of personality like self-discipline—at least in the short-term.
<div> <h3> Can people with personality disorders change? </h3> </div>
<a>there is evidence</a> that over time, symptoms of a personality disorder can decrease—even if certain psychological and social
<a>impairments remain</a>. In some cases, therapy may be helpful in improving functioning: For example,
<a>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</a> is one approach commonly used to treat borderline personality disorder.
<h2> What Shapes Personality? </h2>
<div> <h3> What leads to differences in personality? </h3> </div>
<a>non-genetic developmental factors</a>. Some theorists propose that social role changes influence personality in significant ways as a person grows up.
<div> <h3> How much of personality differences are genetic? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does birth order affect personality? </h3> </div>
<a>recent studies show no evidence</a> that birth order plays a substantial role in shaping personality. Research on
<a>only children</a> has also found little to no difference between their personalities and those of others.
<div> As hard is it is to believe, there's an idea that people high in psychopathy have the redeeming quality of boldness, but new research suggests that they’re really just plain mean. </div>

<div> Do all people equally benefit from positive experiences? The theory of Vantage Sensitivity suggests that some people are more sensitive to the effects of positive experiences. </div>
<div> Paradoxically, the more socially detached tendencies of introverts afford them considerable social advantages over more outwardly engaged and vocal extroverts. </div>

<h2> How Valid Personality Tests Work </h2>
<a>Big Five</a> can be assessed using a number of different questionnaires. Still, scientifically validated personality tests tend to have some features in common.
<a>as short as 10</a> items and as long as a couple of hundred (longer tests tend to provide more reliable results), and the items can be single adjectives or full statements about one’s nature.
<p>For example, the second version of the Big Five Inventory includes the following statements, along with several dozen others, each of which is used to assess one of the Big Five traits:</p>
<li>Is complex, a deep thinker. (<a>openness</a>)</li>
<li>Is reliable, can always be counted on. (<a>conscientiousness</a>)</li>
<li>Is talkative. (<a>extroversion</a>)</li>
<li>Is compassionate, has a soft heart. (<a>agreeableness</a>)</li>
<li>Keeps their emotions under control. (<a>emotional stability/neuroticism</a>)</li>
<a>Hare Psychopathy Checklist</a>, are administered through an interview with a trained professional, rather than with a self-test.

<p>Traits are the building blocks of personality. So what is a trait? In short, it’s a relatively stable way of thinking and behaving that can be used to describe a person and compare and contrast that person with others. </p>
<h2> The Big Five Personality Traits </h2>
<a>Big Five Personality Traits</a>.
<div> <h3> What is openness? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is conscientiousness? </h3> </div>
<a>Conscientiousness</a> is a person’s tendency to control impulses and act responsibly and productively. It may be reflected in a person’s preference for keeping things in order, dependability at work, or punctuality.
<a>Grit</a>, a much-talked-about trait concept involving steady persistence toward a goal, is related to conscientiousness.
<div> <h3> What is extroversion? </h3> </div>
<a>Introversion</a> is the opposite of extroversion. (
<a>Shyness</a>, not included in the Big Five, is similar, but not the same as introversion.)
<div> <h3> What is agreeableness? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Agreeableness</a> is a person’s degree of positivity and helpfulness toward other people. Facets of agreeableness include one’s respectfulness toward others, compassion, <a>altruism</a>, and tendency to trust others.</p>
<div> <h3> What is neuroticism? </h3> </div>
<h2> HEXACO and Honesty-Humility </h2>
<p>For more on honesty-humility, see <a>HEXACO</a>.</p>
<p>For more, see <a>Dark Triad</a> and <a>Personality Disorders</a></p>
<div> <h3> What is narcissism? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p><a>Narcissism</a> is generally one’s sense of self-importance and entitlement relative to others. High narcissism may be reflected in attention-seeking or an excessive need for admiration.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is psychopathy? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p><a>Psychopathy</a> captures a lack of empathy, remorse, and impulse control, along with other specific facets. Someone who is highly psychopathic may tend to hurt others without feeling bad or taking responsibility.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is Machiavellianism? </h3> </div>
<p>Machiavellianism refers to a person’s tendency to treat others in a calculating way, including using manipulation in order to achieve goals. It is named after Niccolò Machiavell, the 16th-century author of the book The Prince.</p>
