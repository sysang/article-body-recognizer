<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic. We all struggle differently, but everybody is struggling, and it’s helpful to hear a variety of stories so we can empathize with each other.
<h3>Manage expectations about how quickly “normal" will return.</h3>
<h3>Express gratitude as opportunities emerge.</h3>
<h3>Set goals and make plans.</h3>
<h3>Give yourself credit for your bravery.</h3>
<p>I was reminded today by a meme that we can’t learn to be brave if everything is always wonderful. Let’s remember that we have been brave, we have faced the uncertainty, and every day we get closer to more freedom.</p>

<h1> Overcoming Shame Increases Resilience </h1>
<h2> Strategies for escaping a cycle of shame. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Embarrassment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>A persistent pattern of shame can eventually decrease one's ability to live fully.</li>
<li>Over time, shame becomes harder to recognize, making it harder for people to reach out for support.</li>
<li>Strategies to let go of shame include empathizing with others and identifying one's own strengths.</li>

<a>shame</a>. Perhaps we were having a bad day and yelled at someone that we love. Or we were feeling
<a>stressed</a>, so we indulged in comfort food, then immediately felt ashamed of our lack of
<a>motivation</a> to change or lose hope that change is even possible.
<p>Despite the debilitating ways in which shame can affect our mental health and <a>resilience</a>, it is possible to break the shame cycle. Here are some suggestions on how to get started.</p>
<h3>Remember your humanity</h3>
<p>Many people grow up in households that focus on mistakes and the choices that lead up to them. We learn early that this is how to respond to our mistakes and failures, and it sets the pattern moving forward.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge mistakes, choices, and failures to those you trust</h3>
<h3>Empathize with the flaws and brokenness of others</h3>
<p>The capacity to understand the failures of others, and the ability to sit with them through their struggles, can develop our ego strength. We can achieve personal growth by walking alongside others through their struggles.</p>
<h3>Identify your strengths and positive qualities</h3>
<p>Breaking the cycle of shame is a process, but once you are free from it, you will recognize that you have value, with your flaws and your strengths, and that you can live a meaningful life as a balanced person.</p>

<h1> Mindful Living Increases Happiness and Resilience </h1>
<h2> How being present in the moment can improve your life and experiences. </h2>
<li>The purpose of life is not to "muddle through" to the next stage but to truly notice one's experiences for greater fulfillment and purpose.</li>
<li>Steps for mindful living include slowing down the pace of daily activities and being intentional about them.</li>
<li>Mindfulness can help people be more resilient because they remain aware of their experiences and process them more fully.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Helena Lopes on Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>I can say with great certainty as someone in mid-life that time really does fly. Looking at photos recently after a friend’s passing, I seriously asked myself where the last 20 years had gone.</p>
<a>memory</a> lane has affirmed what I already believed: There is no time like the present. While it is healthy and realistic to set
<a>goals</a> and look forward to the future, we don’t want to wish life away. We also don’t want to get so caught up in being busy that we don’t take time to savor the moments that will one day be memories.
<h3>5 steps for mindful living</h3>
<a>grateful</a> for those experiences.
<a>happiness</a>, our overall collection of experiences can result in more positive emotions. We can become stronger and more
<a>resilient</a> by allowing ourselves to process our experiences and taking the time to be aware of them, instead of muddling through and moving on to the next stage of life.

<li>The behavior of people in your life, and your reaction to it, has a significant impact on your resiliency. </li>
<li>Being conscious of that impact and moderating your behavior in response can improve your mental health. </li>
<li>Taking a break from certain people who drain your energy, even if you can't disconnect from them entirely, can be a helpful strategy.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Leon on Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Each of us has people in our lives who are difficult. It’s unavoidable. There is usually a friend who drains our energy, family members who complicate our lives, or a significant other who impacts our <a>self-confidence</a>.</p>
<a>resilience</a>. To the extent possible, you want to create a close-knit circle of people you trust and who are going to build you up, not burn you out.
<a>self-talk</a> goes a long way after a hard conversation. In addition, you may have to offset these conversations by intentionally making time for people who are a positive source of encouragement.

<h1> How to Escape the Cycle of Negative Thinking </h1>
<h2> Concrete strategies can help you reframe your negative thoughts. </h2>
<li>It can be easy to get overwhelmed and discouraged by negative thoughts.</li>
<li>Trying to always think positively isn't a realistic solution to negative thinking.</li>
<li>Reframing thoughts can help control negative thought patterns and improve one's perspective. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: cheapbooks/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We all think negatively sometimes. We’re having a bad day, and it feels like the world is against us. We start to believe that things are harder for us, that life is unfair, or that other people do not have good intentions.</p>
<h3>Let negative thoughts come and go.</h3>
<h3>Be proactive in gratitude.</h3>
<a>gratitude</a> when you are not struggling will allow you to remember what you were grateful for if times get harder.
<h3>Avoid all-or-nothing thinking.</h3>
<h3>Manage your expectations.</h3>

<h1> Let Go of Your Anger: Take Back Control of Your Life </h1>
<h2> Recognize when your anger is becoming harmful and shift your focus. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>While anger has value, it can become toxic and restrict one from functioning optimally.</li>
<li>Healthy coping skills can help reset the brain during a bout of anger and restore a more peaceful state.</li>
<li>Ways to let go of anger include slow, deep breathing and identifying triggers.</li>
<h3>5 ways to let go of anger</h3>
<p>Here are some strategies to help us reset and restore:</p>
<li>Breathe. It sounds too simple to be effective, but it’s the first step to flipping the switch in our brain from an angry state to a peaceful and restorative state of mind. Take some slow, deep breaths and notice tension leaving your body.</li>
<a>pets</a>, and your home. Are there things that you’ve been neglecting recently because you’ve been focused on what’s making you angry? If so, make a commitment to prioritize things that give you positive energy, contentment, and joy.
<a>attention</a> on what matters and what makes us feel good. This is a quick, in-the-moment strategy that we can employ when we don’t have time to critically analyze the situation.
<a>forgive</a> them — but it can help us to tolerate behavior over which we have no control, meaning that we can go on with our own lives.
<p>Be the example of what you believe. If the behavior and decisions of others frustrate you, live your life the way that you think others should. You will feel much more empowered, and much more <a>resilient</a> for your effort.</p>

<li>Loneliness is feeling an absence of emotional connection and meaningful relationships.</li>
<li>This is bigger than an individual issue: Many people have a hard time connecting with others because of the way our culture is structured. </li>
<li>However, there are things you can do to prioritize making meaningful connections with new friends. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Alex Ivashenko/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Dealing with loneliness</h3>
<h3>1. Think about how you most enjoy and appreciate connecting with others.</h3>
<a>friendship</a>. For instance, if you are an
<a>introvert</a> who enjoys meaningful conversations, going to happy hours might not help you feel connected. But if you’re an
<a>extrovert</a> who loves being around people with a high energy level, you may want to pursue group gatherings so that you have a lot of choices with whom to converse.
<h3>2. Although connecting with people in person has its advantages, sometimes it’s not practical.</h3>
<h3>3. Don’t put pressure on yourself to find connection the way that other people do.</h3>
<h3>4. If you feel like you don’t know where to meet friends, you’re not alone.</h3>
<p>It’s hard to make friends as a working adult. Recognize that it isn’t just about you and that it is a larger problem with the way our culture is structured. Then, think about joining a community that matches your interests.</p>

<p>As we head into 2022 (and I hope that this year will be better than the last two), I wanted to look ahead and share my excitement for where the field of psychiatry is headed.</p>
<p>We have seen <a>attention</a> placed on social media with news of <a>Instagram for kids</a> being put on hold. And fortunately, early detection and greater support for our youth have been identified as a critical and addressable need. </p>
<h3>Where are we headed? What do we need? </h3>
<p>While we still need time to explore all the ethical implications of using this type of information and develop clear policies and plans surrounding integrating online behavior into a clinical setting, the future looks bright. </p>
<p>Every year the world evolves rapidly with new challenges facing us – particularly our youth. With proper funding, <a>collaboration</a> and vigorous research, tapping into technology to help improve our mental well-being is well within reach.</p>

<h2> New developments in emotion science. </h2>
<li>Emotion science is a growing and thriving field, but it currently lacks consensus.</li>
<li>Evolutionary perspectives shed light on what emotions are and how they work.</li>
<li>An upcoming book tackles emotions from the perspectives of evolutionary psychology, anthropology, biology, and psychiatry.</li>
<p>What, exactly, is an emotion?</p>
<p>Emotions are crucial to our lives, so you might be surprised to hear that psychologists don’t have a consensus definition of what they are or how they work.</p>
<a>fear</a> takes hold, it affects everything in your body and mind: it influences what you can see, what you are able to focus on, what is readily available to your
<a>memory</a>, where metabolic resources are distributed in your body, the manner in which you categorize objects as safe or dangerous, how you prioritize your
<a>goals</a>, and pretty much everything else about the way you parse the world.
<a>here</a>. We’ve also discussed how this approach differs from other evolutionary views of emotions
<p>We explore four main things in this work:</p>
<li>Different ways of thinking about emotions from an evolutionary perspective.</li>
<li>Evolutionary approaches to specific emotions, such as <a>romantic love</a>, pride, <a>shame</a>, hatred, <a>guilt</a>, <a>gratitude</a>, disgust, <a>boredom</a>, <a>humor</a>, contentment, and more.</li>
<li>Emotions as they pertain to other domains of life, with chapters on emotions and <a>politics</a>, the legal system, <a>morality</a>, intergroup conflict, <a>forgiveness</a>, rationality, emotions in dogs, emotions in the Great Apes, and more.</li>
<a>addiction</a>, phobias, eating disorders, post-
<a>personality disorder</a>, and more.
<a>decision-making</a>, to a life well-lived, and to what it means to be human. I hope you enjoy diving into them and seeing how much light an evolutionary perspective sheds on this important aspect of human nature.
<p>We’re fortunate to be alive at a time when we’re discovering so much about the human mind. Happy discovering and happy holidays, everybody!</p>

<h1> Psychosomatic Illness and the Mind-Body Problem </h1>
<h2> What these disorders tell us about the nature of mental illness. </h2>
<li>Psychosomatic disorders have historically been conceptualized as psychological problems manifesting as physical symptoms.</li>
<li>Modern approaches attempt to integrate psychological and biological understandings of psychosomatic disorders.</li>
<li>Psychosomatic disorders demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive biopsychosocial model.</li>
<a>DSM-5</a>, refers problematically to an amalgamation of various types of problems (see Frances, 2013).
<p>For decades, these conditions have also been described as "psychogenic illnesses" or "psychosomatic disorders," owing to the idea that psychological factors (psycho-) are causative (-genic) of bodily (somatic) symptoms. </p>
<h3>Exploring the mind-body problem</h3>
<a>neural</a> or physical phenomena. Psychosomatic disorders also demonstrate the importance of the biopsychosocial model (Engel, 1977), a theory that has guided
<a>psychiatric</a> teaching and practice for the past four decades.

<h3>The need for a pluralistic psychiatry</h3>
<p>It is in this spirit that researchers and theoreticians continue to explore the complex relationship between brain and mind and its relevance to the understanding of psychosomatic and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
