<p>KAWS signature character COMPANION, created by international artist Brian Donnelly, was on display from Saturday (Nov 13) at The Float.</p>
<p>The free exhibition was set to run until Nov 21, and was organised by AllRightsReserved – a Hong Kong based studio – and supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
<p>But an interim injunction, applied for by non-profit organisation The Ryan Foundation, has been granted. It orders that the exhibition stop taking place, as it is in breach of the foundation’s intellectual property rights and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Sales and distribution of merchandise related to the exhibition have also been ordered to stop. Merchandise includes vinyl figures, tank tops and camping sets.</p>
<p>The court order is between The Ryan Foundation and AllRightsReserved, and neither STB nor KAWS is party to the order.</p>
<p>Ryan Su, the founder of the foundation, told CNA that the injunction was served to AllRightsReserved at 4.20pm on Saturday.</p>
<p>He added that the foundation had been in talks with AllRightsReserved to bring a KAWS exhibition to Singapore back in 2019, but it did not materialise.</p>
<p>They applied for the court order after they found out that an exhibition would be coming to Singapore.</p>
<p>The Ryan Foundation’s director Adrian Chan said in a separate statement: “The injunction could have been averted if questions were raised and stakeholders consulted.”</p>
<p>The company added that it takes this incident very seriously and "will take all possible steps to ensure that this exhibition can progress in accordance with the laws of Singapore". </p>
<p>"We apologise for any inconvenience caused," it said.</p>
<p>The organisers added that the artwork venue, The Float @ Marina Bay, is temporarily closed. </p>
<p>In a statement to CNA, Donnelly said that he is "honoured" to exhibit KAWS:HOLIDAY in Singapore.</p>
<p>He added that the reception from the people here has been "overwhelmingly positive" and that he is "grateful" to have this opportunity.</p>
<p>"I have no contractual agreement with The Ryan Foundation. Their accusation is baseless," Donnelly said. </p>
<p>STB said it is aware of the court injunction against AllRightsReserved.</p>
<p>“We understand the organisers are exploring all options,” STB added.</p>
<p>The KAWS:HOLIDAY exhibition has travelled to several sites around the world, including Seoul, Taipei, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tokyo.</p>

<h1> 5 things you should know about KAWS, the artist behind the sculpture at the heart of a dispute </h1>
<div> <p>Over the weekend, a 42m-long sculpture along Marina Bay became embroiled in a legal dispute. Here’s what you need to know about the international artist behind KAWS, Brian Donnelly.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Maxine Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>If you were in the Marina Bay area over the weekend, you may have caught a glimpse of a <a>monumental sculpture</a> lounging by the waterfront at the floating platform. </p>
<a>a court order against its event organiser</a>, AllRightsReserved. (Update: The exhibition was
<a>allowed to reopen</a> on Nov 16.)
<p>CNA Lifestyle earlier had a chance to chat with Mr KAWS himself, Brian Donnelly. From celebrity collectors to Fortnite videos, here’s what you need to know about the cultural phenomenon. </p>
<p>1. HIS WORK REIMAGINES POP CULTURE ICONS, FROM MICKEY MOUSE TO THE SIMPSONS</p>
<p>You’re not seeing double if COMPANION reminds you of a certain famed rodent. </p>
<p>Modelled after Disney’s Mickey Mouse, KAWS’ most iconic character originated from Donnelly’s work as a Disney animator, and his fascination with advertising.</p>
<p>His series of larger-than-life characters draw inspiration from the likes of Peanuts, Sesame Street and even The Simpsons (playfully reimagined as “The Kimpsons”).</p>
<p>2. HIS COLLECTORS RANGE FROM BTS TO BIEBER</p>
<p>Donnelly’s work has found resounding success in both the art and design world.</p>
<p>Here in Singapore, the artist made waves with the launch of his KAWS x Sesame Street merchandise with Japanese retailer Uniqlo, which drew snaking queues along Orchard Road.</p>
<p>In spite of his prolific career, Donnelly believes in the value of keeping his art inclusive and reaching a broad audience with his work.</p>
<p>3. HE HAS ROOTS IN GRAFFITI AND TOY DESIGN</p>
<p>Growing up in New Jersey, Donnelly cut his teeth on graffiti art – developing a name for himself by tagging bus stop advertisements with his characters and the tag "KAWS".</p>
<p>But considering the work he puts out now, it’s little wonder that Donnelly doesn't seem keen on being referred to as a street artist anymore.</p>
<p>“I feel like there's a lot of smoke and mirrors in all worlds, whether it's fashion or the gallery system, and museums or institutions. And I always want to kind of navigate around those and mix those things.”</p>
<p>4. HIS WORKS SPAN ACROSS GENRES AND UNCONVENTIONAL MEDIUMS</p>
<p>Even now, the artist seeks to push the boundaries of his practice through new mediums - including those in the realm of video games. </p>
<p>5. SINGAPORE IS HIS SEVENTH STOP FOR THE KAWS:HOLIDAY SERIES</p>
<p>HOLIDAY has toured Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom and even outer space.</p>
<p>Donnelly admitted that he didn't imagine having all these different iterations in different places. </p>
<p>With the HOLIDAY series, the artist explained that he wanted his sculptures to evoke the feeling of relaxing in a pool, laying and looking up with nobody around.</p>
<p>In the context of Singapore, the artist told CNA Lifestyle, “I'm happy to have the opportunity to create a work that can invite people to come out. And I think having these works outdoors is a good way to sort of creep back into the art experience".</p>

<h1> How the Singapore 'Ah Beng' made it to Marvel’s Shang-Chi </h1>
<div> <p>The Malaysia-born, Singapore-raised Crazy Rich Asians star and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah comedian Ronny Chieng explains it all to CNA Lifestyle.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Genevieve Sarah Loh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that Marvel Studios is bringing their first Asian superhero into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and onto the big screen with the long-awaited Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings.</p>
<p>There's plenty to be said about the trailblazing significance of such a massive move, which comes at such a pivotal time for Marvel (ushering in Phase 4 amid a tricky box office climate) and arguably the world at large.</p>
<p>But there is also another “first” to note – small but still significant (if a little cheeky) – in the blockbuster.</p>
<p>And that is the (most likely) unintentional introduction of the Singapore "Ah Beng" into the revered Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in the form of Ronny Chieng’s Jon Jon.</p>
<p>It’s a small role in a massive Marvel movie, insisted the Malaysia-born, Singapore-raised, Australia-schooled and now New York-based Chieng, who serves as a regular correspondent on The Daily Show With Trevor Noah.</p>
<p>As with the <a>Tiger Beer bottle appearing in the Disney+ series Falcon And The Winter Soldier</a>, it’s the perfect "something extra" for Singapore fans to feel just that bit closer to our beloved MCU.</p>
<p>So exactly how much input for the role came directly from Chieng, who famously lived in Singapore for 10 years, where he studied at both Fuchun and Yuhua Primary Schools, and later, Pioneer Secondary School and Pioneer Junior College? </p>
<p>“You know, I was speaking Chinese in the film. And at one point, I dropped some Bahasa Melayu in there as well. So yeah, he's very 'Ah Beng'!”</p>
<p>So was the accent and intonation Jon Jon used Chieng's decision? Or was it Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton’s idea to show that there's more than one specific type of Chinese out there?</p>
<p>“The Chinese part they wrote in, so I did the scenes in English and Chinese,” explained Chieng.</p>
<p>“They didn't know which one would play well so I just did it in both. But isn't that exactly how we roll in Singapore, right? We just go in and out – sometimes we speak Chinese, sometimes we speak English. We just weave in and out.”</p>
<p>According to Chieng, in that “actual Shang-Chi world”, Cretton wanted to have a very international flavour.</p>
<p>He added: "Like in Inglourious Basterds, we show the Germans with different German accents from different regions? I don't think people have really seen Chinese people have different Chinese accents for different regions of the world.”</p>
<p>Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is out in cinemas now.</p>

<h1> Broke and depressed in Taiwan, actor Andie Chen starts a gaming company </h1>
<div> <p>Together with his entrepreneur brother, the Singapore actor started the blockchain gaming company Freedom Nation – and joked that wife Kate Pang now approves of his lifelong hobby playing online games.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>The metaverse is proving very useful for Andie Chen. A year ago, the actor relocated his family to Taiwan in search of career prospects. But within six months, he had run out of funds, to the point where he was borrowing money from his parents.</p>
<p>"I was just really sad and unhappy all the time," he told CNA Lifestyle. "I was the primary caregiver for my kids, and sometimes I would cry at night. I would try to hide it from my kids. If they spotted me crying, they’d come and hug me to sleep."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he found a light at the end of the financial tunnel in the form of a lifelong hobby: Online gaming. Yes, he found a way to earn money by playing games.</p>
<p>A friend introduced him to Axie Infinity, a game at the forefront of the trending "play to earn" movement that melds blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT) with online gaming.</p>
<p>"The players that got to use my NFTs were coming back with stories of fixing their roof, buying medicine for their parents, buying a new phone, and so on. That became a very positive experience," he said.</p>
<p>In three months, he claimed, they have generated S$500,000 of value, based on the value of SLP at average market price, and they are on track to hit a million dollars in the next three months. He values the company at S$12 million.</p>
<p>His wife "used to give me a lot of shit for playing games, mainly passive aggressively," he laughed. "But now, when she sees me playing games, she gets me tea or snacks, and asks me not to work too hard. Gotta love blockchain gaming!" </p>
<p>Chen said he dived deep into educating himself on blockchain and cryptocurrency, watching lots of explainer videos and reading books and white papers.</p>
<p>"I lost a decent chunk of money at the start, but I took it as school fees," he said.</p>
<p>In the not-so-distant future, he said, people will spend more time in the digital space than in the physical world.</p>
<p>"I don’t see it as a good or bad thing, I think it’s a natural progression, just like radio to TV to Netflix. The younger generation are already living in Fortnite and Roblox. It is just us old folks who are still fearful of this change."</p>
<p>In his case, adversity bred innovation. "I think I would never have been able to do (this venture) if I had been healthy and had enough money," he said. "Being down and out has its perks!"</p>

<section> <div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Pregnant, COVID-19 positive Malaysian singer Siti Sarah Raisuddin dies </h1> <div> <p>The 37-year-old had been carrying her fourth child, whom doctors performed surgery to save.</p> </div> </div> </section>
<p>Malaysian singer Siti Sarah Raisuddin, who had been battling COVID-19, died on Monday (Aug 9) at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Malaysian media reported.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old had been pregnant with her fourth child.</p>
<p>Doctors performed surgery and managed to save the baby, a boy who was named Ayash Affan.</p>
<p>However, the singer never got to hold her son, as she died at 5.13am.</p>
<p>Siti Sarah, her husband Shuib Sepahtu and their three other children – Uwais Alqarni, 10; Dzahira Talita Zahra, eight; and Ariq Matin, six – were found to be COVID-19 positive in July, after a domestic helper contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The singer was hospitalised on Aug 4 when her oxygen levels plummeted, and was put into intensive care.</p>
<p>“My heavenly angel has gone forever. I ask you to please give your Al-Fatihah,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Siti Sarah shot to popularity in 2007 after the release of her Sandarkan Pada Kenangan duet with veteran singer Jamal Abdillah.</p>
<p>Siti Sarah and Shuib married in 2011 after a brief courtship. Their love story, peppered with regular public displays of admiration for each other, has since captured the hearts of many Malaysians.</p>
<p>Siti Sarah’s management company, Indigital Music, issued a statement confirming her death “with sadness and a heavy heart”.</p>

<div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Singapore’s first giant panda cub has been born to Jia Jia and Kai Kai </h1> <div> <p>It's finally here! River Safari's panda couple are parents to a cub whose gender isn't known yet.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>The very first born-in-Singapore panda cub has arrived. River Safari’s beloved panda pair, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, are finally parents, Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) announced on Sunday (Aug 15).</p>
<p>The cub was born on Aug 14 and weighs in at an estimated 200g.</p>
<p>Its gender is yet to be determined, but you can bet there’ll be a gender reveal party happening soon.</p>
<p>The nation has been cheering Jia Jia and Kai Kai on in their seasonal mating attempts since they first arrived in Singapore in 2012, but giant pandas are notoriously uninterested in non-bamboo-related pursuits.</p>
<p>This April, when 13-year-old Kai Kai and 12-year-old Jia Jia displayed signs of being in heat, they officially entered their seventh breeding season, said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, WRS' Deputy CEO and Chief Life Sciences Officer.</p>
<p>WRS worked with the China Conservation and Research Centre for Giant Panda (CCRCGP) to carry out the breeding plan for 2021, emphasising natural mating with assisted reproductive technology as back up if required, he explained.</p>
<p>The pandas had shown improvements in their mating techniques the year before, but as the window of opportunity was drawing to a close, CCRCGP experts advised Singapore vets to perform artificial insemination.</p>
<p>The procedure was carried out by the in-house veterinary team at WRS' Wildlife Healthcare and Research Centre, using frozen semen collected from Kai Kai before the mating season.</p>
<p>Then, in July, ultrasound scans revealed signs of pregnancy in Jia Jia, Dr Cheng shared. The gestation period in giant pandas is between 95 to 160 days.</p>
<p>“Female giant pandas display pseudopregnancy, exhibiting all the hormonal and behavioural signs of pregnancy even when they are not expecting. The only sure way of confirming a pregnancy is visualisation of a foetus near to term," he said. </p>
<p>"This happened for us (on Aug 10) when our vet picked up, on ultrasound, not only a clear outline of a foetus but one with a strong heartbeat."</p>
<p>Naturally, the back-of-house team at River Safari’s Giant Panda Forest has been full of excitement – not to mention probably itching to spill the secret of Jia Jia's "breakthrough pregnancy". </p>
<p>“Jia Jia’s first pregnancy and birth of a cub is a significant milestone for us in the care of this threatened species in Singapore,” Dr Cheng said.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Jia Jia and Kai Kai! Do they get a baby bonus?</p>

<h1> Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha star Kim Seon-ho apologises to ex-girlfriend after abortion scandal </h1>
<div> <p>The actor was accused of making his ex-girlfriend terminate her pregnancy when they were dating in 2020. </p> </div>
<p>The star of popular K-drama Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, Kim Seon-ho, has issued a formal apology to his ex-girlfriend following allegations that he had misled her during their relationship and urged her to get an abortion when they were dating in 2020. </p>
<p>In the apology letter, which various publications ran on Wednesday (Oct 20), Kim said that he had dated the person "with good feelings and intentions".</p>
<p>He further apologised to everyone who had trusted him and cheered him on, and to those who had worked with him on various productions, for the harm he had caused. </p>
<p>"I was only able to stand tall as actor Kim Seon-ho because of the people who cheered me on, but I had forgotten this fact."</p>
<p>While “actor K” was not named in the original post, The Korea Herald reported that reporter-turned-YouTuber Lee Jin-ho on Monday identified the person as Kim. </p>
<p>The 35-year-old Kim played handyman Hong Du-sik in the popular tvN series that just ended its run on Netflix over the weekend, starring alongside actress Shin Min-a. </p>
<p>Following the allegation, advertisements featuring the actor were taken down, including those from Domino’s Pizza Korea and Canon Korea, according to the publication. </p>
<p>He has swiftly been dropped from several projects, including season four of 1 Night, 2 Days, as well as the romantic comedy film, 2 O'clock Date. </p>
<p>Kim’s agency, Salt Entertainment, also released a statement on Wednesday, apologising to the people who were hurt or disappointed by recent events. </p>
<p>A day earlier, the agency announced that Kim's interviews with the press had been cancelled; he was initially scheduled to hold a press conference on Wednesday following the conclusion of Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha on Oct 17. </p>

<h1> Wang Leehom says he lived ‘under fear, extortion and threats’ during marriage to ex-wife </h1>
<p>Wang Leehom, the Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter embroiled in the marital scandal storm, has finally broken his silence. </p>
<p>In his latest Facebook post written in Chinese on Monday (Dec 20), Wang wrote that he was "ready to quit my job temporarily and set aside time for my parents and kids to make up for the damage this storm has brought". </p>
<p>He also admitted that he "didn't manage the marriage properly, caused trouble to my family, and didn't give the public the image that an idol should have. It was all my fault."</p>
<p>Wang added: "From now on, I will be mindful of my words and deeds, and assume the responsibilities of a father, son and public figure."</p>
<p>This latest post comes a day after the Lust, Caution actor, 45, first posted about his acrimonious divorce from ex-wife Lee Jinglei. In a four-page post in Chinese on his social media accounts on Sunday, Wang offered his side of the story. </p>
<p>“Our marriage lasted from Nov 27, 2013, to our separation on Aug 5, 2019. Over the period of five years and eight months, I lived in fear, blackmail and threats,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“I can say with certainty that I was not unfaithful in our marriage,” he added.</p>
<p>“MOST FRIGHTENING DAY OF MY LIFE”</p>
<p>The Golden Melody Awards winner said that he met Lee at his concert in 2003 but they only started contacting each other via email in 2011. </p>
<p>Lee, who went by Nishiharu Michiko then, was 26 and not 16 and underaged, as she had implied when they started dating, he said. She is 10 years his junior.</p>
<p>Wang alleged that troubles started not long after when Lee broke the news of her pregnancy to him. </p>
<p>“If you don’t marry me now, I will disappear, change my name, and you will not see the child in my belly in your life. Don’t try to find me, you’ll never find me,” Wang wrote.</p>
<p>He claimed that this information was recorded during a marriage counselling session in 2016. </p>
<p>“I was terrified, but I saw that she was serious about marriage registration that very same day. I could not imagine not ever seeing the child,” said Wang.</p>
<p>“Seeing how upset she was, with her punches and kicks, I nodded and agreed. We registered in New York City on the same day. </p>
<p>“That day was the most frightening day of my life. What I didn’t know was, that day was nothing compared to today.”</p>
<p>THEY SAW FIVE MARRIAGE COUNSELLORS</p>
<p>The RB artiste admitted that they “constantly had issues”, and saw a total of five marriage counsellors, starting from March 2014. </p>
<p>The couple began to negotiate divorce terms in 2020 and Lee had “demanded around RMB$200 million" (S$43 million). </p>
<p>“She is not the person she claims to be; one who does not want a single penny from me,” Wang wrote.</p>
<p>He added: “In the process, she even told the mediator that if I did not comply with her demands, she is willing to tell the media things that would ruin my career.”</p>
<p>The singer shared that he had agreed to give approximately RMB$150 million in assets to Lee “due to my longtime desire for Lee to live comfortably, but she believed these were inadequate”.</p>
<p>These included half of the property in Los Angeles, half of the stocks the couple own and a monthly allowance of RMB$210,000. </p>
<p>Wang claimed in his letter that money was not the issue. “The point now is that we have three precious children,” he continued in his post.</p>
<p>He said that he was only choosing to make a public statement now because it was the only way to speak to Lee at this time. </p>
<p>He also apologised to her. “Lee Jinglei, I am sorry I did not meet your standards of being a satisfactory husband”, and implored Lee to “direct everything to me”. </p>
<p>“I am willing to face all your demands and all your anger, but the Internet really is a world where everything leaves a trace, and you have used it to ruin me.</p>
<p>"Please, please, do not let these records become the source of further humiliation for our three children as they grow up. I beg you to let me see them.”</p>
<p>The singer also apologised to his fans “for not managing my marriage well” and to his friends “who were dragged into this, I bow and apologise to you, as my marriage affected you”.</p>
<p>He ended the long post by saying he “will respond to her lengthy 5,000-word false accusation separately”.</p>

<h1> Wang Leehom's wife posts another letter, says he tried to bribe her to recant statement </h1>
<div> <p>Lee Jinglei has asked for a public apology by 3pm, Sunday (Dec 19). Will Wang apologise or keep his silence?</p> </div>
<p>"The funny part is that I actually seriously considered your request to sacrifice my own reputation in order to save your career... You still selfishly believe that my reputation and future are of no consequence. Only yours is."</p>
<p>She then addressed the points that Wang's father had made in his letter one by one.</p>
<p>She revealed that when she and Wang were dating, no contraception was used throughout that time. "At his age, he should know that that leads to pregnancy," she said. Wang is 10 years older than her.</p>
<p>In 2019, Wang started putting pressure on her to agree to a divorce to allow him to "freely live the single life he wanted to live", Lee said. </p>
<p>In response to Wang's father writing that his son was a good man without misconduct, she shot back, "He didn't tell you about spending time with prostitutes, did he?"</p>
<p>She ended the letter by issuing him an ultimatum: "I would like Mr Wang Leehom to make a public apology before 3pm."</p>
<p>If he does not do so by 3pm on Sunday (Dec 19), she wrote, she will take legal action against Wang and his father, to protect herself from defamation.</p>

<div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Wang Leehom's wife posts emotional tell-all with sordid details of his cheating </h1> <div> <p>Lee Jinglei claims the singer solicited prostitutes and had a string of affairs while they were married.</p> </div> </div>
<p>In the midst of reports that singer Wang Leehom, 45 and his wife Lee Jinglei, 35, have been divorced, Lee took to social media on Dec 17 with a lengthy letter detailing her side of the story.</p>
<p>She wrote that she had always been willing to help him whenever he asked, but now realises that "I'm just a chess piece in your hand... You used me to regain the power you want, making you the angel and me the devil."</p>
<p>Lee also recalled how the couple had met when she was 16 and he was 26, and he had told her that she was pretty and held her hand – all while he was already attached to another girlfriend.</p>
<p>She continued, "I asked to part ways, you called me for weeks to ask me to stay, saying you wouldn’t do it anymore, I would be your 'only' in the future, and gradually we began to build a family together."</p>
<p>She mentioned other cheating instances as well, including a "dance instructor 'friend'" who messaged him while she was heavily pregnant "saying he was very sad because he'd thought the two of you were together."</p>
<p>Additionally, she said, Leehom wouldn't show up at their kids' birthdays, and she couldn't bear having them collapse into her arms in tears.</p>

<h1> Singer Wang Leehom confirms divorce with wife of 8 years </h1>

<p>After recent reports in Taiwanese media about the end of his marriage to his wife of eight years, Mandopop singer Wang Leehom has taken to social media to confirm the news. </p>
<p>Wang posted the update on Weibo and Facebook on Wednesday (Dec 15), although he said that he and Lee Jinglei would not be responding to any media queries. </p>
<p>“Jinglei and I live very simple private lives so we will not be responding to any media queries,” he wrote in his Facebook post. “I’ve had too many shortcomings during my marriage these past few years, and I feel very regretful.”</p>
<p>He added that the couple had “different ideas and plans for the future, so we have decided to live separate lives”. </p>
<p>The couple got married in 2013 and have three children together who are between the ages of three and seven. </p>
<p>"Although we have already submitted the application (for a divorce), we will always be a family,” Wang said in his post, referring to the couple’s children. He also asked for privacy for his family. </p>
<p>No details were mentioned on who will be getting custody of the children.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old singer has released 17 solo studio albums in his career and earned two honorary doctoral degrees from Williams College and Berklee College of Music.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why everyone is talking about Squid Game and identifying with it </h1>
<div> <p>The global hit Netflix series taps into the anxieties and attitudes many of us have experienced during the COVID-19 crisis, says Christian Barker.</p> </div>

<p>SINGAPORE: Imagine if Quentin Tarantino devised a deadly competition to be played on sets from a classic Stanley Kubrick film in costumes designed by a demented Teletubby given free rein in an Adidas factory — and you have Squid Game. </p>
<p>Speaking at a conference in late September, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed Squid Game was “number one in the world, like, everywhere in the world”. </p>
<p>There’s “a very good chance (Squid Game) is going to be our biggest show ever,” he added of the show, which at the time of this commentary’s writing, had been watched by more than 111 million households worldwide, according to Netflix’s claims.</p>
<h2>SQUID GAME REFLECTS OUR COVID-19 GAME OF LIFE</h2>
<p>That a Korean television series has ascended swiftly as one of the “must watch” shows across the globe should hardly come as a shock.</p>
<p>Considering Bong Joon-ho’s Best Picture win for Parasite at the Oscars last year, and with the likes of BTS and Blackpink dominating music charts internationally, it’s clear: This is the era of Asian soft power.</p>
<p>With the silver screen and radio waves conquered, it was only a matter of time before the Korean influence arrived on our televisions. Yet it’s too simplistic to think this was a lucky stroke, riding on viewers’ superficial awareness of K-culture.</p>
<p>There is something about Squid Game’s theme of personal struggles and unlikely friendships against the backdrop of massive uncertainty and impossible tasks that is striking a chord in these pandemic times. </p>
<p>It’s certainly not the kind of show you would watch to indulge in escapism from our COVID-19 reality.</p>
<p>Maybe we see our omnipresent COVID-related worries about what tomorrow will bring reflected in the idea that players in Squid Game have no clue what game they will play next or what fate will befall them. </p>
<p>But the message of hope the show offers in moments when some players choose to be kind and selfless, setting aside their fears to work together and are rewarded is welcomed. </p>
<p>Comforting stuff, for a world wearied by the pandemic and yearning for human connection. </p>
<h2>POWERFUL, TIMELESS NARRATIVE OF THE PURSUIT OF MATERIAL WEALTH</h2>
<p>These themes of downward mobility and inequality were also at the heart of Parasite and Bong’s earlier movie Snowpiercer, depicting the pain of poverty and loss. </p>
<p>As the organiser puts it in the final episode: “Do you know what someone with no money has in common with someone with too much money? Living is no fun for them.”</p>
<p>Perhaps like contestants in the show, this pursuit of success can feel like a technicolour joke, with all of us walking around in brightly coloured, endless Penrose staircases to the tune of the Blue Danube after every round.</p>

<h2>WE ALL FEEL LIKE PLAYERS IN SQUID GAME</h2>
<p>Then again, the dystopic competition category of movies is something we’re already well acquainted with, after watching the Hunger Games and Westworld. </p>
<p>So what sets Squid Game apart? Doesn’t it feel similar to recent Asian survival genre films like Alice in Borderland?</p>
<p>Indeed, Hwang readily admitted to Variety he was inspired by Kinji Fukasaku’s 2000 cult classic movie Battle Royale and its source manga material, where a group of school-uniformed Japanese teens are forced to viciously fight to the death. </p>
<p>But he wanted Squid Game to be more character-driven and focused on their journey.</p>
<p>Does he make it? If you haven’t managed to catch the show thus far, we won’t spoil the ending for you. Suffice to say, despite their newfound wealth, the “winner” is left an empty, traumatised shell of their former self after the games conclude.</p>
<p>As the game organiser points out in the final episode, highlighting the role of self-determination in the game of life: “I never forced you to play. It was your choice.”</p>
