<div><span><div><span><div>Story by <div><div>Siobhán O'Grady</div></div></div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Ali Al-Mujahed</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><span><div><span><div><div>Photos by Lorenzo Tugnoli</div></div></span></div></span></div>
<p>This grim flood has been relentless over recent months because of the unceasing determination of the two main sides in Yemen’s civil war to win what could be the pivotal battle of the seven-year conflict.</p>
<p>In harsh desert terrain on the outskirts of Marib, Iran-backed Houthi rebels are fighting the internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, for control of its strategic stronghold in the country’s north.</p>
<p>They are bolstered by frequent Saudi airstrikes against Houthi positions nearby. But the government forces are themselves vulnerable to Houthi missile and drone strikes.</p>
<p>The Houthis have stepped up those missile and drone attacks in response to Saudi airstrikes, according to Dhaifallah al-Shami, minister of information in Houthi-controlled Sanaa, saying that “it’s one eye for another.”</p>
<h3>‘This war has made us grow old’</h3>
<p>But late last year, he came under fire and had to leave his new leg behind.</p>
<p>On a recent day, Abu Saleh briefly left his position on the front line to travel into town and join the growing line of people waiting for new legs at the general hospital.</p>
<p>The drones are “continuous,” he said, “dropping four to five bombs each day.”</p>
<p>Al-Shami, the minister, denied that any children are fighting for the Houthis and said that any such claims are “not true.”</p>
<h3>Marib ‘stumbling block’</h3>
<p>The battle for this strategic province is hampering renewed efforts to put an end to the war, analysts say, with talks largely stalled.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of U.S. support “affected our morale as leaders,” said bin Aziz, the army chief of staff. “We want our American friends to reconsider this decision.”</p>
<h3>‘I have no one but him’</h3>
<p>A sense of dread is closing in on those Yemenis who fled fighting elsewhere for what they believed would be the safe haven of Marib.</p>
<p>Al-Shami, the Houthi minister, said that the strike targeted a “military site” and that their forces “would never intentionally kill a child.”</p>
<p>Now, Duma is afraid to allow her son outside. “I have no one but him,” she said. “There’s no way I’m going to let him go out.”</p>
<p>When asked her daughter’s name, she paused for around 10 seconds, stunned at her own inability to recall.</p>
<p>“Amal,” she cried out. The only way she has been able to cope with the loss, she added, has been “by trying to forget her.”</p>
<p>Al-Qamhi was killed in a strike by a missile or drone, fellow fighters said. Al-Kahli was killed by a planted explosive, his relatives said.</p>
<p>Their young and serious faces were the latest to adorn memorial fliers heralding them as martyrs for a great cause that were distributed before their funerals.</p>
<p>Nearby, al-Qamhi’s father knelt by his son’s freshly buried body, gently packing the sand around a photo propped against his headstone.</p>
<p>Then he stood up and slowly walked away, hanging his head as he passed rows of other new graves shimmering faintly in the late-morning light.</p>

<p>ORLANDO — A hard but mere 298 days after the SUV flipped on a California hillside and came to rest in a sickening mangle, around the bend and alongside a pond and toward a tee came Tiger Woods on Saturday. He looked downright upright.</p>
<div><div><p>At times, teaming with his 12-year-old son, Charlie, like last year, it all looked far-fetched because of this year — even more far-fetched than Florida usually looks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Woods, who turns 46 on Dec. 30, spent a lot of time in a cart, allowed here because of the unofficial-ness.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He drove that cart, of course.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Candace Buckner: The doors Tiger Woods still won't open</p></div>
<div><div><p>It could not be all that much less frightening, unless you counted the little signs telling of snakes and alligators, all of which seemingly spotted John Daly in his ginormous beard and remained underwater.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tiger Woods admits his days as a full-time member of PGA Tour are over</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t have any golf endurance,” Woods reiterated late Saturday. “It was tiring out there today, a slow day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m definitely calling it a success,” Justin Thomas said, “that both my dad and Tiger made it 18 holes, so that’s good.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s, in fact, so much better than anyone imagined 298 days earlier.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“For just the sport itself,” said Day, the coach at Ohio State, “The concerning part is that the coaches can’t set that up.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Imagine, a middle-aged coach not having complete control over the lives of teenagers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s so much tampering going on,” lamented Swinney, the coach at Clemson, “and so many adults manipulating young people.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>In signing day shocker, top recruit Travis Hunter goes with Deion Sanders and Jackson State</p></div>
<a>your bolt from Notre Dame to LSU</a>), departing without penalty while their former players would have to sit out a year to make the exact same change. More than that, coaches could seek out more lucrative offers (looking at you, Brian Kelly, and
<a>your $95 million</a>) while the players who actually won the games made … nothing.
<div><div><p>“There’s a lot of kids whose identity is wrapped up in football,” Swinney said, “and all this does is further that.”</p></div></div>
<a>transfers</a> and the ability
<div><div><p>So?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People are influencing these kids who are outside the university,” Day said. “And I think, again, that’s concerning.”</p></div></div>
<a>de-committed from Florida State and signed instead with Jackson State</a>, coached by former FSU cornerback Deion Sanders. Did that shock to the recruiting world come with the promise of money from an outside source? Unclear. But so what if it did?
<a>announced he would transfer</a> closer to his home in Southlake, Tex. This week, he chose Texas.
<div><p>“You think about all the time and energy and resources that we spend on recruiting and on one individual family,” Day said. “For them to walk out the door, man, that’s a bad day no matter how it works.”</p></div>
<div><p>Ranking every college football bowl game, from Orange to Frisco</p></div>
<div><div><p>One set of rules for the coaches. Another for the players. Gotcha.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You know who’s got it right? Nick Saban.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Basically, what I do is try to adapt to whatever the circumstance and whatever the situation that we have,” the Alabama coach said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What an idea: read, react and adapt. No wonder Saban has seven national championships.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>For Cincinnati, the College Football Playoff is both a burden and an opportunity</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Barry Svrluga</div></div>Sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 31, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Luke Fickell believes this: “We don’t want to think we’re carrying some flag for the non-big schools.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sorry, Coach. Here’s a flag. Carry it.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Cincinnati's Ahmad 'Sauce' Gardner gets a chance to cook on the CFP stage</p></div>
<i>three</i> have been decided by one score. Half have been decided by at least 20 points. The average margin of victory: 20.9. That’s not exactly the three barnburners a year we hoped for.
<div><div><p>Into that history of blowouts drop the Bearcats, who are 13-0 but seeded fourth behind No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Michigan and No. 3 Georgia. They are basically two-touchdown underdogs. They belong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How many undefeated teams are there out there?” asked Alabama Coach Nick Saban, winner of seven national championships himself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Uh, that would be one, Coach. A fact of which he’s well aware. Even as Saban presides over the college football equivalent of Google, he can relate to the start-up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At the College Football Playoff, a rare sight: A team with a QB controversy (sort of)</p></div>
<a>a thorough 24-13 decision in South Bend</a>.
<i>spring</i> game: 47,218 — at that point, the largest crowd at a sporting event in the country since the beginning of the pandemic.
<div><div><p>The result that day: Cincinnati carried a 21-10 lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately succumbed to a field goal with three seconds left in a 24-21 loss.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Imagine that kind of performance — in the playoff.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The experiences you have in the past help you in the future, especially if you use them in the right way,” Fickell said. “ … It just gives us that much more of an idea of what we’re facing.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Taylor Heinicke belongs in the NFL, but he’s not Washington’s QB of the future</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Barry Svrluga</div></div>Sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:25 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 6:26 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>Four takeaways from Washington's loss to the Eagles</p></div>
<div><div><p>But he did trip, and it wasn’t a touchdown. That was Washington’s day Sunday. In a way, it was Washington’s season — 6-10, with a let’s-just-finish-it-up game at the New York Giants to end it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I thought he did some good things,” Rivera said Sunday. “I thought he gave us a chance.”</p></div></div>
<a>Apologies if you’ve read that before</a>.
<div><div><p>It’s also another way of saying this: He won’t be the starter who carries a winner deep into January.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s not true just because of the numbers. It’s true for two other reasons, both on display Sunday: his physical limitations and the fact that his best quality can also lead to his worst results.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That was awful,” Heinicke said, providing spot-on analysis.</p></div></div>
<i>trying</i> to throw the ball away and he merely didn’t have the arm strength to get it to the sideline. The play was negated because Philadelphia committed a penalty. But it stood out as the worst Heinicke has to offer. He knows that.
<div><div><p>Let’s not make it into an issue going into the season finale against the Giants. Whether Allen plays is moot. We know his arm is stronger than Heinicke’s. We know Heinicke is more creative and resourceful.</p></div></div>

<h1>Daniel Snyder pledged support for the NFL’s investigation. His actions tell a different story. </h1>
<h2>Washington’s owner took former employees to court, deployed private investigators and was accused of trying to ‘silence’ a key accuser</h2>

<b> </b>allegation of sexual misconduct against team owner Daniel Snyder.
<b> </b>denied the woman’s claims. But the existence of an allegation against him, which had been kept secret by a confidential $1.6 million settlement, had the potential to rock a franchise already reeling from scandal.
<b> </b>A few weeks later, Wilkinson sought to interview the former team employee who had made the accusation, according to people familiar with the investigation.
<div><div><p>Then Snyder and his team stepped in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Snyder’s attorneys, in their own sealed letter filed in court, denied trying to block the interview and offering the woman more money, according to people familiar with that letter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Snyder declined an interview request. Lawyers representing Snyder and the team declined interview requests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Daniel Snyder pushed back as the NFL probed. Here are takeaways from The Post’s reporting.</p></div>
<a> The Post story that prompted Wilkinson’s investigation</a>, his lawyers filed petitions in federal court seeking,
<b> </b>to identify former employees who had spoken to The Post — an effort one federal judge suggested was intended “to burden and harass” former employees who had spoken to reporters.
<b> </b>according to these former employees or their attorneys
<b> </b>— acts many of them viewed as intimidation aimed at discouraging former employees from participating in the NFL’s investigation.
<b> </b>intended to speak to Wilkinson —
<div><p>More than a dozen women allege sexual harassment and verbal abuse by former team employees at Redskins Park</p></div>
<a> the Ray Rice domestic violence </a>case and
<a>the release of executive findings</a>.
<b> </b>secretive handling of the Washington investigation, which has spared Snyder from any public punishment, has
<div><p>But among former team employees, it has not escaped notice that the emails spared Snyder any embarrassment while damaging the reputation of one of his perceived enemies: Bruce Allen, the longtime team president Snyder fired in 2019.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Allen declined to comment.<b> </b>The NFL also declined to comment or to answer any questions about the investigation and its handling of the emails that were leaked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s very sad and disheartening that [the NFL is] not willing to do the right thing,” said Rachel Engleson, a former team marketing director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Here’s this billionaire owner,” she said of Snyder, “who can do anything he wants.”</p></div></div>
<a>The Post reported on it and the confidential settlement last December</a>. Even then, the details were scarce: a private plane ride, an allegation, a denial, an investigation, a payout.
<p>The woman reported her allegations to David Donovan, then the team’s general counsel. Donovan oversaw an investigation that exonerated Snyder and accused the woman of fabricating her allegations, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<div><p>Wilkinson learned about the settlement in late July 2020, according to a court filing by the team’s former lawyer, within days of a <a>Post story</a> detailing allegations of sexual harassment inside the Washington franchise.</p></div>
<p>After the phone call, according to a declaration filed by Donovan and people familiar with the matter, Chirite gave Wilkinson documents relating to the allegation and the settlement, including a report Donovan wrote after his investigation.</p>
<div><div><p>The next month, The Post published <a>a second story about the team’s workplace</a>, including allegations of sexual harassment from 25 more former employees, with two accusations involving Snyder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few days after that story published, the NFL assumed oversight of the investigation, and the team said it had released all former employees from nondisclosure agreements so they could speak with Wilkinson.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>According to people with knowledge of the letter, Bolden claimed to Wilkinson that the team’s release of former employees from NDAs did not apply to the 2009 accuser. Bolden and Reed Smith declined to comment on the record about this letter.
<div><div><p>Snyder’s lawyers responded in writing to Sullivan, denying his claim that they’d offered her more money, according to people familiar with their response.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington Football Team settled sexual misconduct claim against Daniel Snyder for $1.6 million</p></div>
<div><p>Wilkinson expressed skepticism that Donovan was acting on his own. In court filings, she accused him of pursuing the lawsuit on behalf of someone else, “obstructing the independent investigation designed to uncover the truth.”</p></div>
<p>Donovan, in his court filings, expressed that it was a “near certainty” the NFL would publicly release Wilkinson’s report, which he predicted would “disparage” his investigation that exonerated Snyder in 2009.</p>
<div><div><p>But interviews and previously unreported court records demonstrate that Snyder wasn’t just interested in identifying the sources of the Epstein stories.</p></div></div>
<p>Each time a judge forced someone to turn over records, Snyder’s list of suspects grew. Then his lawyers went to court again, eventually filing claims against ten people or companies in seven states from August 2020 through April 2021.</p>
<div><div><p>Joe Tacopina, a lawyer for Snyder, said in media interviews that he had evidence that Blair was a key figure in a global conspiracy to defame Snyder through online stories tying him to Epstein.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>his ex-wife and several former co-workers in the weeks after The Post story published.
<div><div><p>“It’s very alarming when people you haven’t talked to in years tell you that somebody is snooping around about you,” Baker said.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic, unsettled several former team employees. And some said they felt the combination of private investigator visits and subpoenas had a chilling effect on former colleagues who declined to speak with Wilkinson or reporters.
<a>the team reached confidential settlements with several cheerleaders who appeared in the videos</a>.
<a>offered financial settlements to other former female employees</a> who had gone public with accounts of harassment, provided they agree to stop speaking to journalists and on social media about their time working for the team.
<a>drew criticism from advocates for victims of sexual harassment</a>.
<div><div><p>NFL officials, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said Daniel Snyder would need Goodell’s permission to return to leading the team alongside his wife. Damage control from the Snyder camp came swiftly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, Snyder’s quest to uncover the sources of damaging stories about him had dwindled mostly to one target: Allen, the team’s former president.</p></div></div>
<a>the Wall Street Journal</a> and
<a>the New York Times</a>, costing Gruden his job and subjecting Allen to public criticism.
<a>second New York Times story</a> based on another batch of Allen’s emails disclosed his “cozy relationship” with NFL general counsel Jeff Pash.
<div><div><p>One of the remaining unanswered questions related to Wilkinson’s investigation is who leaked those emails.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Goodell, in his one news conference since the emails leaked, reiterated the league’s stance that no details from Wilkinson’s investigation would be released, he claimed, to protect the identities of witnesses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My clients wanted a report, and I think Beth Wilkinson intended to write one all along,” Banks said. “But Roger Goodell and the NFL chose to bury whatever she found.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Mark Maske, Beth Reinhard and Niha Masih contributed reporting.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>This story has been updated to include a statement issued by Snyder’s attorneys after the story was published.</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adela Suliman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:51 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s Nadal vs. Djokovic — but not on the tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Nadal, speaking Thursday after winning a match at the Melbourne Summer Set ATP 250 tournament, <a>told</a> reporters that Djokovic knew the risks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s normal that the people here in Australia get very frustrated with the case because they have been going through a lot of very hard lockdowns,” Nadal said. Djokovic “makes his own decision,” he added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you are vaccinated, you can play in the Australian Open and everywhere,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, 34, who won the Australian Open last year, was <a>detained</a> by officials at the airport amid growing outrage over a decision to award the athlete a visa and medical exemption from vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia, once known for its tough <a>“covid zero”</a> policies to keep the virus at bay, is now grappling with the <a>omicron variant</a> and one of the world’s sharpest spikes in infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Nadal</a> and <a>Djokovic</a> have previously tested positive for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Djokovic situation has spawned debate on social media along with <a>memes</a>, as <a>airlines</a> offer the player a ride home and others <a>refer</a> to him as “Novax Djokovic.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rules are rules, and there are no special cases,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Thursday, as he thanked border officers and confirmed that Djokovic’s visa had been canceled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our government’s strong border protection policies, and particularly in relation to the pandemic, [have ensured] Australia has one of the lowest death rates of covid anywhere in the world,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>The world No. 1 men’s tennis star is now <a>reportedly being held at a hotel</a> used to house asylum seekers as his lawyers lodge an appeal.</p>

<div><div><p>Over a replay of Porter making a three-pointer at the buzzer to beat the Wizards, Consor remarked that the Rockets’ 21-year-old shooting guard, “like his dad, pulled that trigger right at the right time.”</p></div></div>
<a>NBA point guard Kevin Porter</a>, who spent six seasons with the Baltimore and Washington Bullets.
<div><div><p>LeBron James tweeted about Consor’s comment Thursday and seemingly called for his job before Consor offered an explanation and apologized for what he said was an honest mistake.</p></div></div>
<a> since 2007</a> but occasionally fills in on NBC Sports Washington’s TV broadcasts. A Wizards spokesman said Consor will continue to call the team’s games on the radio.

<div><div><p>During the nearly three months in which there have been almost no games amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, the news organizations that cover sports have made cutbacks seemingly one after the next.</p></div></div>

<p>The Athletic, a subscription-based sports media company, on Friday became the latest outlet to retrench, telling its employees on a staff-wide conference call that nearly 10 percent of its workforce — 46 employees — would be laid off.</p>
<div><div><p>An Athletic spokeswoman confirmed the cuts. Axios <a>first reported on the memo</a>.</p></div></div>
