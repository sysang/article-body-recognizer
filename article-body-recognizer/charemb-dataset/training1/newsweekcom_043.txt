<p>Of course, factors other than the Zoom phenomenon spawned the strong demand for cosmetic surgery. One was the drop in spending on restaurants and travel, leaving money on the table for other things.</p>
<p>And so, whether you're ready or not for your close-up, your close-up is ready to dominate how your company sees you. Power up the selfie light.</p>
<p>Cosmetic surgeons know that we're suffering from one too many close encounters with our video selves. That's why they are standing by to put our aesthetic insecurities to rest, forceps and scalpels primed for action.</p>

<p>Texas has low taxes, which is nice. Its mild winter weather appeals to many in the snowbound north. And the cost of living there is certainly lower than that of the elite coastal cities. Also nice.</p>
<p>Texas has cool progressive cities—Austin's at the top—that fit right into the knowledge workers' list of allurements. But these diabolical state laws and restrictions apply to those places as well.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court rushed out its decision letting the law stand. Chief Justice John Roberts said the majority's ruling was tentative—that this was not an overturn of Roe, not yet.</p>
<p>Some said the law gets a pass because no one intends to enforce it. If so, its intention is merely to create an atmosphere of suspicion, confusion and fear.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Rudy Giuliani</a> New York City <a>9/11</a> <a>9/11 Anniversary</a></div>
<p>At 10 a.m. on 9/11, I was in New York on a train being kept underground in Penn Station. The two planes had just hit the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>The conductor came on one last time and told us to stay calm, take our bags and leave the train. We ascended into the light and a totally transformed city, country and world.</p>
<a>George W. Bush</a> was incommunicado most of the day. But Giuliani was there among the smoking debris, the only visible political figure offering solace, and even more importantly, reassurance that life would go on.
<p>He spoke eloquently about the collective grief. Asked how many had died, he said, "The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear."</p>
<p>But he also pleaded with New Yorkers to keep faith in the future. "Tomorrow, New York is going to be here," he said.</p>
<p>The most calming thing he said that afternoon, though, was that two of the subway lines were again operating and named which ones. Yes, it was going to be OK.</p>
<p>Giuliani became "America's Mayor," hailed as the ash-covered leader of 9/11. Time magazine made him "Person of the Year," and Queen Elizabeth gave him an honorary knighthood.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a>—culminating in his speech on Jan. 6, calling on Trump supporters to engage in "trial by combat" right before they ravaged the capital.
<p>Giuliani had already fallen far. In 2018, he attended a game at Yankee Stadium, and when the announcer said, "The New York Yankees wish a very happy birthday to Mayor Giuliani," the crowd burst out with boos.</p>
<p>There's been much speculation about what happened to him. In New York City, he could have had bridges, roads and schools named for him. All that's left is a memory of Giuliani's finest hour urging battle against fear in the darkness of 9/11.</p>

<p>Republicans will not win hearts by insisting that they don't have to help America repay its debts—especially since they racked up so much of them.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Gen z</a> Climate Change <a>Climate</a> <a>Joe Biden</a></div>
<p>"I'm really enraged that we have a Democratic trifecta and they haven't delivered for us yet," Lauren Maunus, 23, Sunrise's advocacy director, told POLITICO Magazine.</p>
<a>Democrats</a>, if anything, make it harder to get any progressive measures passed.
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s approval ratings and making Democrats look dysfunctional—the infrastructure plan limped over the finish line.
<a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>,
<a>Ilhan Omar</a>, Rashida Tlaib,
<p>Five Sunrise exhibitionists recently went on a hunger strike outside the White House, supposedly pressuring Biden to magically deliver them more action on climate. Imagine the worry that those precious bundles would miss a few meals.</p>
<p>Last June, Sunrise leaders planned for members to get arrested outside the White House. Mission accomplished, one of the Sunrisers boomed into a microphone, "What we just did is f---ing amazing. We just shut down the White House!"</p>
<p>Again, this was a Democratic White House, and the protesters, according to POLITICO, didn't seem to get any demands met. Also, Biden has been as much a tiger on climate as any Democrat can be, given the political realities.</p>
<p>By the way, chanting "F--- <a>Joe Manchin</a>" in a parking lot is not very effective. Joe Manchin does not seek Sunrise Movement's approval.</p>
<p>Not that the activists have noticed. Maunus beseeched Manchin "to look us in the eyes and tell us that his actions will be responsible for millions more deaths around the world." Oh, honey. I don't think he's going to do that.</p>
<p>Should <a>Republicans</a> take control of both the House and Senate in the midterms—a distinct possibility—Americans wanting a forceful program to curb climate change may get less than nothing. Politics is not a game for children.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials in Texas said Wednesday afternoon that they are searching for a teenager believed to be responsible for carrying out a shooting at a convenience store in Garland on Sunday.</p>
<p>Three teenagers ages 14, 16 and 17 died in the shooting, and a 15-year-old was injured, according to Garland police.</p>
<p>Officers previously took a 14-year-old into custody on Monday in connection with the shooting. That teenager, who has not been publicly named, was identified as a person of interest in the case as of Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<a>Police</a> Department's Wednesday afternoon news release.
<p>"The male suspect is then seen getting back in the white truck on the passenger side and the truck fleeing at a high rate of speed," police said Sunday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Garland police said they arrested a 33-year-old man in connection with the shooting. The man, who was identified as Richard Acosta Jr., was allegedly driving the vehicle that was seen in the footage obtained by police.</p>
<p>Acosta turned himself in to police on Monday and was facing capital murder charges with bond set at $1 million, police said.</p>
<p>"The shooting appears to be in retaliation from a previous disturbance, and was believed to be a targeted attack on one or more of the persons inside the store," police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Garland police said detectives found information that "shows that the driver of the truck, Richard Acosta, who previously turned himself in, is the father of the shooter" police were searching for.</p>
<p>Individuals who believe they have information on the shooting or on the teen's whereabouts were encouraged to contact the Garland Police Department or share tips with Garland Crime Stoppers.</p>

<p>One of the jurors in the Kim Potter trial called the guilty verdict the "hardest decision" they've ever had to make but ultimately said they believed the jury "made the right decision."</p>
<a>Daunte Wright</a>, the 20-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by Potter, a former Brooklyn Center police officer, last April.
<p>Body camera footage showed Potter yelling "taser, taser, taser" before shooting Wright in the chest with a gun she alleged she mistook for her taser.</p>
<p>"We did an initial vote, then we did temperature checks throughout," the juror said. "Initially for both counts we were predominantly 'guilty.'"</p>
<p>The juror emphasized that the jury didn't base their decision on past crimes of other Minnesota police officers and said those suggestions "cheapens the verdict and the seriousness" of the trial.</p>
<p>The juror said that while there had been accusations made about Wright being "not a good person," those claims didn't impact the jury or change his "opinion on the tragic loss of life that happened."</p>
<p>"I feel really bad for Daunte's family," he said. "It was hard having them on the witness stand. You can tell Daunte meant a lot to them. And it's hard to think about Daunte's son. I think that's the hardest part for me."</p>
<p>But the juror also said he considered how Potter's family would take the verdict.</p>
<p>The juror said "the key turning point" in the trial was when the jurors were handed Potter's gun and taser to feel a difference in weight, with the gun being twice as heavy.</p>
<p>Another major factor in the jury's decision was Potter's 26-year history with the force.</p>
<p>Potter is expected to be sentenced in February. The more serious charge of first-degree manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.</p>
<div> News Opioid crisis <a>OxyContin</a> <a>Settlements</a></div>
<p>Besides that order, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain extended an injunction that temporarily halts litigation against the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, from moving forward.</p>
<p>Drain was also the judge who initially approved the original settlement in September. Under it, members of the Sackler family would provide $4.5 billion in cash and other assets to support opioid crisis victims and help remedy the health crisis.</p>
<p>The Sackler family would have had to rescind ownership of Purdue Pharma, which would then become a new company that would funnel its profits into battling the opioid crisis. In exchange, the Sackler family would be protected from opioid lawsuits.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Justice Department and eight states opposed the condition that allowed the family to be protected from lawsuits. The states also said the $4.5 billion payment would not hold the family sufficiently accountable.</p>
<p>The deal had been hashed out over two years of negotiations and mediation in bankruptcy court. Eventually, lawyers for the overwhelming majority of local governments and states signed on.</p>
<p>In December, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in favor of those states, finding that judges do not have authority to grant third-party releases as Drain did.</p>
<p>Two states, Connecticut and Washington, argued that suits against the Sacklers should be allowed to move ahead immediately. Those states said they would not move ahead now with litigation against the company.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Sackler family did not speak at Wednesday's hearing. Representatives of the family did not immediately respond to questions from the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Connecticut and Washington said in a filing that the Sacklers would agree to an appropriate settlement only if lawsuits can move ahead and they "are then forced to come to grips with the prospect of continued litigation against them."</p>
<p>Still, he said that if the Sackler family does not negotiate in January, Purdue would not seek further injunctions to protect the family from lawsuits.</p>

<p>He continued to approach an officer with the knife despite the police's warning, and one or more of the officers opened fire on him, police said. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Authorities have not yet released the man's name.</p>
<p>When officers arrived at the apartment building that they had been called to, two of the officers opened fire. The man was struck and pronounced dead at the scene by the Los Angeles Fire Department, according to Detective Meghan Aguilar.</p>
<p>"Right now, we aren't exactly sure what transpired between the suspect and the officers," Aguilar said. "What we'll do is we'll be looking at body-worn video and, of course, interviewing those officers and any witnesses."</p>
<p>Sunday's shooting comes just days after an LAPD officer fatally shot a 14-year-old girl Thursday when officers fired on an assault suspect and a bullet went through the wall and struck the girl as she was in a clothing store dressing room.</p>
<p>LAPD Chief Michel Moore promised to release video from the clothing store shooting Monday.</p>
<p>This article's headline has been updated to indicate that the deaths total refers specifically to LAPD-involved shootings.</p>

<a>Donald Trump</a> in 2021 were more likely to receive probation than those whose cases went before judges appointed by former President
<a>Barack Obama</a>, according to data reviewed by Newsweek.
<p>Nearly 60 percent of the 32 Capitol rioters who faced Obama-appointed judges this year received jail time, compared to the 20 percent of 21 Capitol rioters who were sentenced to jail by Trump-appointed judges.</p>
<p>Of the 49 Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, Obama-appointed judges handed down jail sentences in 57 percent of their 28 cases. Trump-appointed judges sentenced 19 percent of the 21 defendants appearing before them to jail.</p>
<p>Chutkan is one of just two judges to sentence defendants to harsher punishments than prosecutors requested and has done so in all but two of her cases. The other is Judge Thomas Hogan, a Reagan-appointee.</p>
<p>He said he was "very torn" on sentencing because he didn't believe the Capitol riot would occur again or that Mish would participate in it if it did, but acknowledged the importance of general deterrence.</p>
<p>Nichols also gave Michael Curzio six months in jail as prosecutors wanted, making him one of two defendants to receive the maximum punishment.</p>
<p>However, judges have warned defendants that haven't pled guilty they won't be as lucky because judges won't be as lenient.</p>
