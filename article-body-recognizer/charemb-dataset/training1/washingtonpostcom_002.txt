<h1>‘Definitely not the results we want’: Facebook staff lamented ‘perverse incentives’ for media </h1>
<h2>In documents, employees fretted about ‘darker, more divisive content’ and boosting far-right sites</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Sarah Ellison</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Elahe Izadi</div></span></div></span></div><div>October 26, 2021 at 12:01 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>In November 2018, the staff of Facebook’s fledgling Civic Integrity department got a look at some eye-opening internal research — presented under an image of two goats locking horns.</p></div></div>
<p>“Outrage gets attention,” surmised the researchers. They ruefully compared the strategy to “feeding users fast food,” an irresistibly effective tactic for hooking an audience that would surely prove harmful down the road.</p>
<div><p>From the election to the riot, nearly a third of Facebook’s top link posts were from right-wing media</p></div>
<b> </b>that some employees had been sounding alarm bells for years over its practices in favoring right-wing publishers
<b> </b>were dismayed that the company did not or could not do more to tamp down on misinformation and divisiveness on its platform.
<div><div><p>A Facebook spokesman said the company has made changes to address troubling content on its site since the time concerns were first raised internally.</p></div></div>
<a>announcing</a> that Facebook would alter its algorithm to encourage what he called “meaningful social interactions” and to
<a>reduce the prominence</a> in users’ feeds of posts that came from “businesses, brands, and media.” Zuckerberg later acknowledged that the overall number of news stories would be reduced but
<a>said</a> Facebook would “prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local.” What counted as trustworthy, he said, would be determined by asking users in quality surveys.

<b> </b>apparent at media sites that had come to rely on social media to find an audience. Traffic plummeted at many news organizations: Mother Jones
<a>reported</a> a 37 percent drop in its Facebook referrals. Slate
<a>noted</a> that its referrals crashed by 81 percent. Vox laid off 50 employees, citing the impact of lost Facebook traffic. Some smaller sites,
<a>noting the effect of the algorithmic shift</a>, shut down completely.

<a>were unfairly hurt by Facebook’s altered approach to news</a>; Tucker Carlson called the algorithm shift “an act of ideological warfare.” Facebook had been a target of conservative ire since the spring of 2016, when a
<a>former employee alleged</a> that the site’s “trending” news section downplayed stories that appealed to conservatives, prompting congressional inquiries and an extensive internal investigation.
<div><p>And yet, some conservative news outlets seemed<a><b> </b>to fare well after Zuckerberg’s algorithm shift</a>. Politico <a>reported in March 2018</a> that both Fox News and National Review saw their interaction rates increase.</p></div>
<a>daily roundup</a> using data from Facebook’s CrowdTangle shows right-wing and conservatives personalities such as Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino consistently garnering the most engagement. (Facebook has long
<a>pushed back on the importance of top 10 lists</a>, saying they offer a skewed view on popularity.)

<div><p>How conservatives learned to wield power inside Facebook</p></div>

<header><div><div>Media</div></div><div><h1>Why your favorite new NPR show might sound a lot like a podcast</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Elahe Izadi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 3, 2021 at 10:06 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>A cabdriver in Tehran helped Ramtin Arablouei crystallize the idea.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People in the West, they don’t remember anything,” the driver had told him, diagnosing the cultural divide between Iran and the United States. “And people in the East don’t forget anything.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And after two years, their bosses decided to take “Throughline” to the larger audience of radio.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Part of the reason the podcasting audience is more racially diverse may be inherent to the format itself, which generally attracts a younger audience, a demographic that is more diverse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And twice as many people listen to NPR content on the radio — an estimated 26.1 million people weekly — than to its 47 podcasts put together. Those two audiences have little overlap, according to internal figures.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NPR may be ‘public’ radio, but it’s feeling the economic pain of the pandemic. More trouble lies ahead.</p></div>
<a>It’s Been a Minute With Sam Sanders</a>” is now carried by 409 stations.
<div><p>“The White folks who are listening in are eavesdropping. They’re not the people who are at the center of the conversation, which I think is a more subtle distinction than people often realize,” co-host Gene Demby said.</p></div>
<a>How I Built This</a>” draws an audience that is just over 19 percent Black and more than 18 percent Hispanic.
<div><div><p>On the flip side, Demby notes, is the opportunity to find more listeners, including people of color who “fortuitously stumble upon us.” That, in turn, could expand the NPR radio audience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is a chance of being pleasantly surprised by people,” he said, “and people being pleasantly surprised by us.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The podcast-to-radio transition has also helped diversify the ranks of on-air hosts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The feedback thus far has been reassuring. Teachers and other new listeners have thanked them for creating compelling historical pieces for the radio.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Abdelfatah considers the success of the show “not just for us, I hope. I think it’s proof that people do want different perspectives on air, and to see a different way of looking at the world.”</p></div></div>
<header><div><div>Media</div></div><div><h1>Meet the reporter who always seems to get a copy of the hottest tell-all Trump book first.</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Farhi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Mark Meadows’s new memoir about his time as Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff was still a week away from its official release date, but reporter Martin Pengelly already had the most eye-opening part.</p></div></div>
<i>first</i> — and beat the world in spilling the most consequential and interesting details.
<div><div><p>All of which has generated a question about Pengelly among authors and publishers: How does he do it?</p></div></div>
<p>He’s hardly the only reporter to get the scoop on a newsy book — for decades, media organizations have set off in chase of hot new releases. But no others in recent memory have consistently scored so many pre-publication coups.</p>
<div><div><p>Another author, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing his employer’s policy, said Pengelly’s article about his book was “disruptive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It caught all involved by surprise,” he said. “Pengelly certainly has some good publishing connections.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The media scramble at the heart of Trump Book Summer</p></div>
<a>The Chief’s Chief</a>,” was published six days before the book’s embargoed sale date of Tuesday, for instance.
<div><div><p>Guardian managers say Pengelly gets the books he writes about without breaching any embargo agreements. Doing so would be unethical and could subject a publication to being blacklisted by book publishers.</p></div></div>
<a>A Higher Loyalty</a>.” The book, he and a colleague
<a>wrote at the time</a>, was “obtained by the Guardian from a bookseller in New York.”
<div><div><p>The mechanics of the book-publishing trade and the timing of Pengelly’s scoops point in this direction, too.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However Pengelly manages it, not all authors are dismayed about being blindsided by his scoops. Some even see it as helpful.</p></div></div>
<a>The Man Who Ran Washington</a>” — a biography of former secretary of state James A. Baker that the New York Times reporter co-authored with his wife, Susan Glasser, of the New Yorker —
<a>got the Pengelly treatment</a> last year.
<div><div><p>“It’s fair to say that stories like these are important buzz-builders setting the table for a book launch, not just with readers but with the whole political-media-books ecosphere.”</p></div></div>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>

<a> a wave of racist violence and harassment</a>
<b> </b>since headlines about a virus from China began appearing in U.S. media a year ago.
<a> shoved to the ground in Flushing, Queens</a>; an Asian woman
<a> punched in the face on a subway platform</a> and a Los Angeles man
<a>beaten with his own cane at a bus stop</a>.
<p>“Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,” he said.</p>
<p>Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never get that far.</p>
<p>Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences, language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is difficult.</p>
<a>the data gap</a>, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own.
<a> Stop AAPI Hate</a> launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and harassment. It received more than 2,808 self-reported incidents from across the country by year’s end.
<p>Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims, most were women and about 126 reported being older than 60.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Negative views of Asian people have risen in both parties</a>]</i> </p>
<p>But some Asian communities suspect the rash of attacks is even worse than data suggests. The tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.</p>
<p>“They’re attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges. They don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.</p>
<p>“I can’t walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,” said Cheng, who added that someone called her “coronavirus” while she was jogging last March in Oakland. “I just feel like that was taken from me.”</p>

<b> </b>And on his way to buying a gun, in the parking lot,
<b> </b>four White men called him and his friend “the coronavirus” and “chinks.”
<p>While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.</p>
<p>But he soon started to worry that his purchase was “playing to fear,” ultimately making his community less safe and decided to sell the firearm back.</p>
<p>“If you show up here … expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame, where you may misread a situation and respond to it with violence.”</p>
<p>Local leaders have made similar pleas, including <a>Oakland Police Department Chief LeRonne Armstrong</a> who expressed concern about civilian gun owners creating “unintended victims.”</p>
<p>He held a<a> news conference Feb. 16 after </a>a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street.</p>
<p>“We don’t want people to fire weapons into our community,” he said. “While we appreciated people’s interest in keeping our community safe, we want them to observe and report.”</p>
<p>“I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not always there to protect us,” Cheng said. “They’re only there to take the report.”</p>
<p> <i>[<a>America on edge: Covid lockdowns, protests and election strife led to record gun sales</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly Asian neighborhoods.</p>

<p>At least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York so far since the attacks began in 2020, Loo said.</p>

<div><p>Suspect charged with killing 8 in Atlanta-area shootings that targeted Asian-run spas</p></div>
<div><div><p>For Asian women, the moment felt particularly threatening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As soon as Crystal Jin Kim heard about the shooting, she reached out to her mother and father, who immigrated to the United States from Korea. In a text, she urged them “to be safe, to be careful, and to pray.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Really, I’m not — I’m very talkative and extroverted,” Kim said. “It’s just people having these assumptions and treating me like a perfect Asian girl. Not even a woman, but a girl.”</p></div>
<div><p>The shootings are not surprising — if you’ve been paying attention, Asian American women say</p></div>
<div><div><p>The shooting made visible the worst-case scenarios many Asians living in the United States had feared. Many sadly expressed a similar sentiment: We knew this was coming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More than 68 percent of documented reports of anti-Asian <a>harassment and violence</a> since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic have been from women.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never been this afraid to be Asian in America,” said Dorothy Kuo, 38, who attempted to explain to her 6-year-old daughter what had happened in their community.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Shootings put focus on year of heightened anti-Asian violence in the West</p></div>
<div><p>“I told her ‘Mommy is having a hard time focusing today because last night there were eight people killed.’ I just told her, honestly, what happened,” said Kuo, who is Korean American, like several of the victims.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Kuo said she felt it was important to tell her daughter so she understands the world she’s stepping into, one in which she might have to be more careful as an Asian woman.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve been refused seating at a restaurant,” Kuo said, “and even then I’ve never felt what I feel now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jane Kim Coloseus, 32, grew angry Wednesday when Atlanta police declared it was too soon to say whether the slayings were racially motivated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Advocates for Asian Americans demand action: ‘Everyone has heard enough words’</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To me the equation is pretty straightforward,” she said of the shooter’s intent. “It is racially motivated.”</p></div></div>

<div><div>Thousands who ‘followed the rules’ are getting covid. They shouldn’t be ashamed.</div></div>
<div><p>The pandemic proves we all should know ‘psychological first aid.’ Here are the basics.</p></div>
<a>Asian American Psychological Association</a>, and it can be difficult to find Asian therapists in some areas of the country, especially the South.
<div><p>Asian Americans see shooting as a culmination of a year of racism</p></div>
<a>2020</a>, the percentage had grown to more than 86 percent. And the
<a> Census Bureau</a> found that in June, during the height of the racial protests, Asian Americans with symptoms of anxiety or depression increased from 28 to 34 percent, a spike that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.
<a>American Psychiatric Association</a>.
<div><div><p>This study cites “feelings of shame, stigmatization, and an unwillingness to burden others” as reasons Asian immigrants and Asian Americans did not seek out therapy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Nobody came, nobody helped’: Fears of anti-Asian violence rattle the community</p></div>
<a>Hollaback</a>, an anti-harassment nonprofit, teamed up with
<a>Asian Mental Health Collective</a>, a nonprofit that seeks to bridge the gap between the Asian community and such resources, created a database of Asian therapists. New grass-roots organization
<a>Stand With Asians</a> recently held a discussion on the new social media platform, Clubhouse, asking community members to take off from work on Friday in solidarity. And the
<a>Asian Mental Health Project</a> has been hosting Instagram Live sessions, including one after the shootings that addressed how to cope with the trauma of hypersexualization in the Asian American experience.
<div><p>It’s race, class and gender together’: Why the Atlanta killings aren’t just about one thing</p></div>
<p>With all of this “ugliness right now,” said Hsu from the <a>Asian American Psychological Association</a>, it’s important for Asians to take steps to feel more in control, whether they’re ready to seek therapy or not. </p>
<div><div><p>She advised turning off the news, getting more sleep and spending more time with family. Another important step is to grant oneself or others the permission to process feelings of trauma. </p></div></div>
<p>When a community feels threatened and under siege, said Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University professor and one of the co-founders of <a>Stop AAPI Hate</a>, it often turns to what he calls the F’s: fighting, fleeing or freezing.</p>
<div><div><p> But the most important “F” that he recommends to his students is flocking to one another to share what they’re feeling. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Storytelling has power,” said Cheah. “It emboldens others to share their stories as well,” she added.</p></div></div>
<p> Sharing her story is what especially helped Kim, the social worker from South Korea. Although she grew up in a culture that did not promote speaking out, she said, the candid conversations she had with her friends were a source of relief.</p>
<div><div><p>It’s created a “ripple effect,” she said. “When we’re able to have this conversation with one person, it gives us the strength to have more.” </p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Chinese Egg Tarts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Storage Notes: </b>The baked tarts are best the day they are made; they do not store well.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ingredients</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>For the filling</b></p></div></div>
<li><span><b>1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1/2 cup (120 milliliters) hot water</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 large egg, at room temperature</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1/4 cup (60 milliliters) evaporated milk</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</b></span></li>
<div><div><p><b>For the butter dough</b></p></div></div>
<div><ul><li><span><b>1 stick (4 ounces/113 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cubed</b></span></li><li><span><b>1/4 cup (30 grams) all-purpose flour</b></span></li><li><span><b>Pinch of salt</b></span></li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>For the egg dough</b></p></div></div>
<li><span><b>3/4 cup (85 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 tablespoon water, at room temperature</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>Pinch of salt</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>Cooking spray or vegetable oil, for greasing the tins</b></span></li>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 1</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make the filling:</b> In a medium bowl, dissolve the sugar in the hot water, then refrigerate until the syrup is cool to the touch, 30 to 45 minutes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 2</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 3</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 4</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unwrap the butter dough and place it in the middle of the egg dough. Wrap the butter dough in the egg dough — first folding top and bottom and then right and left — as if wrapping a present.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Repeat rolling out, folding and chilling of the dough two more times. Try to keep the dough in a neat rectangle as you roll and re-roll it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 5</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Once the dough has chilled for the last hour, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the tins on top. Fill each tin to about two-thirds of the way with the filling, about 2 tablespoons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 7</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Transfer the egg tart tins to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 20 minutes. Remove the cooled tarts from the tins and serve at room temperature.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>One of the bloodiest anti-Asian massacres in U.S. history, now a podcast</h1></div>

<div><div><p><b>What led to this massacre?</b></p></div></div>
