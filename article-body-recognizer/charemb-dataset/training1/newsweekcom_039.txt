<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>'The Book of Boba Fett' Explains a Major 'Return of the Jedi' Plot Hole</h1><div> By Roxy Simons <time>On 12/29/21 at 4:48 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>The Book of Boba Fett landed on Disney+ on Wednesday, December 29, providing the next chapter in the Star Wars franchise.</p>
<p>Following the character's re-introduction in The Mandalorian Season 2, the TV show finds the character (played by Temuera Morrison) starting his own criminal empire in Tatooine after taking over Jabba the Hutt's throne.</p>
<p>But that's not all the first episode in the new drama did, as it also explained a major plot hole from Return of the Jedi that fans were no doubt curious about: How did Boba Fett survive being dropped into the Sarlacc Pit?</p>
<p>**Warning: This article contains minor spoilers for The Book of Boba Fett Episode 1**</p>
<h2>How did Boba Fett survive the Sarlacc Pit?</h2>
<p>However, his appearance in The Mandalorian confirmed what fans had hoped for for many years, that the bounty hunter had somehow survived the ordeal.</p>
<p>The manner in which he survived was first explained in the short story "A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett" from Star Wars Legends novel Tales from Jabba's Palace.</p>
<p>In the book, which is no longer considered canon following <a>Disney</a>'s takeover of Lucasfilm, it was revealed that the bounty hunter got out of the creature's belly by making an explosion using his jetpack.</p>
<p>After the jetpack created a tear in the Sarlacc's side, Boba Fett set off a number of grenades to blast a hole big enough for him to escape out of.</p>
<p>The Book of Boba Fett takes inspiration from this short story, it seems, as the episode opens with the bounty hunter dreaming of the moment he escaped.</p>
<p>In the memory, Boba Fett wakes up after falling into the Sarlacc Pit and he finds himself in the creature's body and is unable to pull himself out.</p>
<p>Using his torch, the bounty hunter discovers a nearby stormtrooper's body that also fell into the Sarlacc, and after making his way to the person he frees a tube from their helmet to help himself breathe.</p>
<p>In one swift movement Boba Fett punches into the Sarlacc's side, his fist tearing its stomach and, once his arm is on the other side, he uses his flamethrower to make swift work of the creature and escape.</p>
<p>The character was then seen pulling himself out of the sand near the Sarlacc Pit, fainting from the effort and later being discovered first by Jawas and then by Tusken Raiders.</p>
<p>The Book of Boba Fett airs every Wednesday on Disney+.</p>

<p>Netflix has launched a website that reveals exactly how many hours of TV its viewers are watching, meaning we now have a good idea of what the most-watched series on the streamer are.</p>
<p>None of these shows, however, were able to reach the top spot, with Netflix viewers watching over 466 million hours in December.</p>
<h2>The 10 most-watched TV shows on Netflix in December 2021</h2>

<a>K-dramas</a>. Over three months since the survival horror series dropped on the streaming service, viewers spent nearly 70 million hours watching the show's many brutal challenges.
<p>Though it streams on <a>HBO</a> Max in the U.S., this DC Comics series is a Netflix original in most other territories around the world. 72 million hours of the superhero drama were viewed over the course of this month.</p>
<a>Emily in Paris</a>, but one thing is for certain: People are watching it. In fact, they spend 125 million hours doing that in December, as Season 2 of the Lily Collins-starring comedy-drama dropped.
<p>Lost in Space has found a place in viewers' hearts. Across the last four weeks, 185 million hours of the sci-fi series have aired. Despite this, the recent Season 3 is confirmed to be the <a>last ever season</a> of the Netflix original.</p>

<a>Geralt of Rivia</a> – and once they got them, they devoured them much in the same way as Geralt may devour a roast bird after a long day's questing. To be exact, users logged nearly 435 million hours of the story so far.
<a>Money Heist</a> came to an end, with millions of viewers watching over 466 million hours of those final episodes.

<p>The Book of Boba Fett began streaming on Disney+ on Wednesday, December 29 and revealed the next chapter in its titular bounty hunter's life.</p>
<p>Following the events of The Mandalorian Season 2, Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) has taken over Jabba the Hutt's former throne and the episode follows him as he starts out his journey as the head of Tatooine's criminal underworld.</p>
<p>The episode, directed by Robert Rodriguez, also looks back on the character's past and what happened to him between Return of the Jedi and The Mandalorian.</p>
<h2>The Book of Boba Fett Episode 1 recap</h2>
<p>Episode 1 of the new Disney+ show opens with Boba Fett in a healing tank, dreaming of the past and reliving key moments from the iconic sci-fi franchise.</p>
<p>There are flashes of his childhood, like when he finds his father Jango's head in its helmet in Attack of the Clones, as well as the moment he fell into the <a>Sarlacc Pit</a> in Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>The episode lingers on the latter, explaining how the character made it out of the creature's stomach, only for his armor to get stolen by Jawas and for him to be taken captive by Tusken Raiders.</p>
<p>The Sand People don't treat their prisoner kindly and Boba Fett is beaten and tied up. But the bounty hunter shows his tenacity by managing to break his bonds and escaping, although it doesn't last for long.</p>
<p>Boba Fett goes up against one of the Tusken Raiders in one-on-one combat when they catch up with him, but despite his skills as a fighter the character is eventually overpowered and put back in chains.</p>
<p>It is at this point that Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) wakes him up so he can meet with the heads of different criminal factions and exert his dominance over them.</p>
<p>Menacing in his Mandalorian armor, the bounty hunter is referred to as a Daimyo—the name given to feudal lords in Japan from the 10th to the 19th century—and he accepts gifts and confers with various criminals.</p>
<p>Boba Fett chooses to spare two Gamorrean guards who were in Jabba the Hutt's employment, taking them under his wing despite Fennec's warnings not to do so (more on that later).</p>
<p>The pair then journey to The Sanctuary, a cantina run by Twi'lek Madam Garsa Fwip (Jennifer Beals), who gifts Boba Fett with a helmet full of coins as tribute.</p>
<p>But while things appear to be going swimmingly for the bounty hunter, they soon take a turn for the worst outside the cantina.</p>
<p>Fennec goes after their attackers and takes one captive, while the guards bring an injured Boba Fett back to Jabba's palace where he is put into his healing tank and thrown back into his memories of the past.</p>
<p>Following on from where the flashbacks left him, Boba Fett is still a prisoner of the Tusken Raiders and is taken by a youngling to the desert to collect jugs of water that they buried out in the sand.</p>
<p>The bounty hunter tells his fellow captive, who ratted him out the first time he tried to escape, that he can get them both off-world if the other keeps his mouth shut, but that plan is short-lived when they're attacked by a desert creature.</p>
<p>The creature makes short work of Boba Fett's fellow captive, and goes after the Tusken Raider after they stopped it from killing the bounty hunter.</p>
<p>Returning the favor, Boba Fett attacks the creature before it can kill the Sand Person and takes its head, an act which earns him the respect of the whole camp and a drink of precious water before the episode comes to an end.</p>
<p>The Book of Boba Fett airs Wednesdays on Disney+.</p>

<p>Porn star and former TV actress Maitland Ward has criticized Billie Eilish and her parents after the singer spoke out about her opinions on pornography.</p>
<p>"Porn isn't something that's supposed to be sex education for people. It's entertainment for adults and that's what we do." Ward continued, "Also I think she's too young to make that kind of assessment about porn, sex and everything."</p>
<p>Ward was an actress across TV and movies early in her career, appearing in soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, Boy Meets World and later White Chicks. In 2019 she signed with an adult talent agency and started shooting pornographic scenes.</p>
<p>Eilish appeared on The Howard Stern Show in December 2021 and discussed her personal experience with porn, stating up front, "As a woman, I think porn is a disgrace."</p>
<p>She admitted that because she watched it at such a young age, it has had long term effects on her. She told Howard Stern, "I think it really destroyed by brain, and I feel incredibly devastated that I was exposed to so much porn."</p>
<p>After Eilish shared her feelings, retired porn star Randy Spears applauded the 20-year-old singer for sharing her experience and agreed that watching mature content at such a young age can be damaging.</p>
<p>On December 20 in an interview with TMZ, Spears said: "When we're that young, our brains don't have the capacity to digest [hardcore porn]." He continued, "It's pretty despicable stuff."</p>
<p>"I applaud her for it [speaking out]. Maybe it will do some good, somewhere down the line," Spears said.</p>

<p>Read on for our guide to these films and many more.</p>
<h2>40 movies coming out in 2022</h2>
<p>Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz, Lupita Nyong'o and Diane Kruger team up for this globe-trotting action adventure. Each star is an international agent aiming to outperform their rivals and recover a top-secret weapon.</p>
<h2>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania - January 14</h2>
<h2>The Tragedy of Macbeth - January 14</h2>
<h2>Jackass Forever - February 4</h2>

<h2>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent - April 22</h2>
<p>Nicolas Cage has been in great movies and he's been in awful ones, but he's never anything less than hugely watchable. Now, he's playing himself in a berserk-looking movie that sees the Oscar winner get involved with a cartel.</p>
<h2>Legally Blonde 3 - May 20</h2>

<p>New York shortened the isolation time for essential workers that test positive for COVID-19 on Friday in an effort to combat possible staffing shortages in hospitals across the state.</p>
<p>"When they come back to work they have to wear a mask," Hochul said.</p>
<p>During the press conference on Friday, Hochul said that the updated isolation time can help "get people back to work so these critical services that New Yorkers need...as soon as it is safe to do so."</p>

<div> U.S. Eyes <a>Vision</a> <a>FDA</a></div>
<p>Approximately 128 million Americans may be able to ditch reading glasses thanks to newly approved eye drops.</p>
<p>The term "presbyopia" comes from a Greek word meaning "old eye." <a>The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) calls it</a> a normal part of aging.</p>
<p>Presbyopia cannot be reversed and is often corrected by the use of eyeglasses, contacts or surgery. If left uncorrected, headaches and eye strain could become more routine, according to the AAO.</p>
<p>The condition can be diagnosed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist via a basic eye exam. The newly-approved eye drops are currently available by prescription in nationwide pharmacies.</p>
<p>Most participants experienced no serious adverse effects, the company added. The most common reactions occurred in less than 5 percent of subjects, notably headaches and eye redness.</p>
<p>Allergan stated that clinical studies of VUITY did not include subjects aged 65 years or older to determine response compared to younger subjects.</p>
<p>The U.S. population grew by only 0.1 percent, or 392,665 people, from July of 2020 to July of 2021, the lowest percentage increase since 1937, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, 33 states saw population increases, primarily through domestic migration, while 17 states and the District of Columbia lost population.</p>
<p>California remains the most populous state with 39,237,836 people, followed by Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan.</p>
<p>The population estimates are derived from calculating the number of births, deaths and migration. There was a net increase of nearly 245,000 residents from international migration but only about 148,000 from natural increase.</p>
