<h1> 5 Signs It's Time to Seek Therapy </h1>
<h2> Most people can benefit from therapy at some point in their lives. </h2>

<a>therapy</a>. At the same time, therapy isn’t usually necessary for every little struggle life throws your way, especially if you have a strong support system of friends and family. So how do you know when it’s time to see a therapist?
<p>1. Feeling sad, angry, or otherwise “not yourself.”</p>
<a>anger</a>, or hopelessness may be signs of a mental health issue that can improve with treatment. If you’re eating or
<a>suicide</a>, reach out for help right away.
<a>compulsive behavior</a> that requires treatment.
<p>3. You’ve lost someone or something important to you.</p>
<a>Grief</a> can be a long and difficult process to endure without the support of an expert. While not everyone needs counseling during these times, there is no
<a>shame</a> in needing a little help to get through the loss of a loved one, a
<a>divorce</a>, or significant breakup, or the loss of a job, especially if you’ve experienced multiple losses in a short period of time.
<p>4. Something <a>traumatic</a> has happened.</p>
<a>chronic illness</a>, or some other traumatic event, the earlier you talk to someone, the faster you can learn healthy ways to cope.
<p>5. You can’t do the things you like to do.</p>
<p>Have you stopped doing the activities you ordinarily enjoy? If so, why? Many people find that painful emotions and experiences keep them from getting out, having fun, and meeting new people. This is a red flag that something is amiss in your life.</p>
<a>fear</a> of judgment or repercussions can be life-changing.

<div> <div> <h1>Sleep Apnea</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>This potentially serious condition is quite common. In its first description in 1965, this breathing disorder was characterized by short disturbances in breathing while sleeping. In Greek, apnea means "want of breath."</p>
<p>These interruptions can result in morning headaches and daytime sleepiness, and are associated with high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and even stroke or heart attack.</p>
<p>Symptoms of sleep apnea as catalogued by sleepapnea.org:</p>
<li>Not breathing for periods (apnea)</li>
<li>Hypersomnia, falling asleep during the day</li>
<li>Problems staying asleep, <a>insomnia</a></li>
<li>Cannot focus attention during daytime</li>
<li>Leg swelling for severe apnea</li>
<li>Rote reactions, automatic behavior</li>

<a>concentration</a> and cognitive function, irritability,
<a>depression</a>, falling asleep during the day,
<a>sexual</a> dysfunction, and high blood pressure. Sleep apnea also increases risk for heart attack and stroke. And in some cases, sudden infant death syndrome and sleep apnea have been linked.
<p>Spouses are the first to notice the problem, and co-workers and friends may find the person falling asleep at work or other environments, even while driving. The afflicted individual may be the last to learn of the problem.</p>
<a>medication</a> is not effective. Oxygen administration may work for some patients but it doesn’t cure the sleep apnea, and it’s hard to know which patients will respond well. Any treatment should be verified through the polysomnography.
<p>In more extreme cases, surgery may be recommended to correct airway obstruction.</p>
<p>Although several surgical procedures are used to increase the size of the airway, none of them is completely successful or without risks. More than one procedure may need to be tried before the patient realizes any benefits.</p>
<p>Common procedures include removal of adenoids and tonsils, especially in children; nasal polyps, structural deformities, or other growths or tissue obstructing the airway. Younger patients benefit more from these procedures than older patients.</p>
<p>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty removes excess tissue at the back of the throat (tonsils, uvula, and part of the soft palate). Again, it is hard to predict which patients will respond to this procedure.</p>
<p>For morbidly obese patients, surgery to treat obesity is sometimes recommended.</p>

<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms </li> <li> Causes </li> <li> Treatment </li> </ul> </div>
<div> <h3> Does restless legs syndrome run in families? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Restless legs syndrome can be found in families as there is a genetic component, with symptom onset often appearing before the age of 40. The gene variants of PTPRD, BTBD9, and MEIS1 have been associated with RLS.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can massage or a warm bath help? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p> Massage can alleviate the symptoms; likewise, heating pads and ice packs can be helpful. There are also devices such as vibrating pads for the legs as well as wraps that apply pressure to the feet.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can regular sleep hygiene help alleviate restless legs? </h3> </div>
<p>Falling asleep and staying asleep can help improve all types of sleep difficulties. General sleep hygiene is advised.</p>
<p>• Go to sleep and wake up at the same time daily</p>
<p>• If you are awake in bed for more than five to 10 minutes, get up</p>
<p>• Avoid caffeine in the afternoon</p>
<p>• Avoid large meals, especially before bed</p>
<p>• Limit alcohol intake</p>
<p>• Ban screens in the bedroom</p>
<p>• Avoid <a>screen time</a> before bedtime</p>
<p>• Open a window for fresh air</p>
<p>• Keep a comfortable bedroom temperature</p>
<div> <h3> What substances aggravate restless legs? </h3> </div>
<a>diet</a> with plenty of nutrients and less sugar and processed foods is recommended. A diet including iron—found in spinach, seafood, and legumes—as well as
<a>magnesium</a>—found in leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and legumes—may help.
<div> <h3> Does physical activity alleviate restless legs? </h3> </div>
<p>A regular exercise routine improves sleep overall. Simple regimens such as walking, yoga, swimming, jogging, bicycling, or other simple practices are all helpful. And with any physical activity, proper stretching will loosen tight muscles.</p>
<div> <h3> Can everyday medications worsen restless leg symptoms? </h3> </div>
<a>antipsychotics</a> and antidepressants can increase serotonin, which may also aggravate symptoms.

<p>Sexual masochism disorder is a paraphilic disorder, which involves recurrent, intense, sexually arousing <a>fantasies</a>, urges, or behaviors that are distressing or disabling and have the potential to cause harm to oneself or others. </p>
<p>Sexually masochistic behavior is usually evident by early adulthood, and sometimes begins with masochistic or sadistic play during childhood</p>

<a>psychiatric</a> condition marked by a lack of desire for sexual activity over a prolonged period. In the
<a>DSM-5</a>, Sexual Desire Disorder has been broken down into two separate conditions: Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder and Male
<a>Hypoactive Sexual Desire</a> Disorder. Both of these refer to a low level of sexual interest resulting in a failure to initiate or respond to sexual
<a>intimacy</a>. This can include an absence of sexual thoughts or
<a>gender</a>-specific conditions in the DSM-5.
<p>Symptoms for Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder include the following:</p>
<li>Absent or reduced interest in sexual activity</li>
<li>Absent or reduced sexual thoughts or <a>fantasies</a></li>
<li>Reduced or no initiation of sexual activity</li>
<li>Absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure during most sexual activity</li>
<li>Absent or reduced sexual interest or arousal in response to internal or external cues, such as a partner's attempts to initiate sexual activity</li>
<li>Absent or reduced genital or nonessential sensations during sexual activity</li>
<p>To meet criteria for Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, the symptoms must be present for at least six months and cause significant distress to the individual. </p>
<p>Symptoms for Male <a>Hypoactive Sexual Desire</a> Disorder include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Reduced or absent sexual thoughts or fantasies</li> <li>Reduced or absent desire for sexual activity</li> </ul>
<p>Similar to Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, the symptoms must also be present for at least six months and cause significant distress to the individual. </p>
<p>Both of these conditions can be diagnosed as a lifelong problem or an acquired problem that emerged after a period of normal sexual activity. </p>
<p>Some risk factors for developing a sexual desire disorder include:</p>
<li>Negative attitudes about <a>sexuality</a></li>
<li>Relationship difficulties (poor communication, abuse)</li>
<li>Partner sexual functioning </li>
<li><a>Childhood</a> stressors</li>
<li>Medical conditions (diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction)</li>
<li><a>Endocrine</a> disorders (hyperprolactinemia) </li>
<li>History of emotional or physical abuse</li>
<li>Other <a>psychiatric</a> diagnosis (<a>depression</a>, <a>anxiety</a>)</li>
<li><a>Medication</a> side effects</li>
<li>Stressors (job loss, <a>bereavement</a>) </li>
<a>education</a> and assignments they can expand the variety and time devoted to sexual activity.
<p>When problems with sexual arousal or performance are factors, these sexual dysfunctions will need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Reading books or taking courses in couples communication may also encourage feelings of closeness. For some couples, reading novels or viewing movies with romantic or sexual content may also serve to encourage sexual desire.</p>

<a>Hypersexuality</a> becomes problematic when it causes significant distress to an individual, or puts them at risk of harming themselves or someone else.
<p>While the behavior was not included in the <a>DSM-5</a>, the following criteria may be a way of identifying hypersexuality. For a period of at least six months:</p>
<li>Have recurrent, intense <a>sexual fantasies</a>, urges, and or behaviors that consistently interfere with other activities and obligations</li>
<li>Behaviors occur in response to dysphoric mood states (<a>anxiety</a>, <a>depression</a>, <a>boredom</a>, irritability) or <a>stressful</a> life events</li>

<div> <h3> Do people who believe they are "addicted" to sex have more sex than others? </h3> </div>
<a> don’t actually have more sex</a> or different kinds of sex than the rest of the population. People’s classification of their sexual behavior as an addiction may stem from their own beliefs about sex,

<p>It's also important to consider the role culture plays in the concept of hypersexuality. Cultures that view <a>sexuality</a> in a more positive light may have values that don't judge sexual behavior as being "excessive."</p>
<div> <h3> What factors contribute to "sex addiction"? </h3> </div>
<a>"addicted" to sex often have feelings of shame</a> around sex; they may believe that sexual thoughts, fantasies,
<a>porn</a> are wrong, harmful, or evil. Many of these individuals were raised in a deeply religious household, which may have contributed to their beliefs about sex and sex addiction.
<div> <h3> When does hypersexuality develop? </h3> </div>
<a>50 percent of those with hypersexuality</a> report that they experienced dysregulated sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors in
<a>adolescence</a>. About 80 percent report that their symptoms progressed gradually over months or years.
<p>"Sexual addiction" and hypersexuality are not included in the DSM-5, but if a person engages in sexual behaviors that causes distress, specialized counseling is available.</p>
<p>Treatment may involve the following:</p>
<ul><li>Rebuilding relationships</li> <li>Managing stress</li> <li>Identifying triggers for sexual thoughts or compulsive sexual behaviors</li> <li>Finding alternative behaviors that are less destructive</li> </ul>
<p>Common antidepressants may also reduce symptoms of hypersexuality in some cases, although more clinical trials are needed.</p>
<div> <h3> How can therapy treat hypersexuality? </h3> </div>
<a>Therapy</a> can help people better understand their sexual beliefs and behaviors, identify and address sources of distress, and treat any coexisting mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression. For people who have
<a>harmful beliefs about sex</a>—that masturbation is sinful, for example—
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy can be particularly helpful for correcting false beliefs and alleviating distress.
