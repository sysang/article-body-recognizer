<p>A disgruntled hotel worker spectacularly quit her job by leaving a scathing letter on her employer's front desk, saying she would be treated better at McDonald's.</p>
<p>Minimum wage, long hours and unappreciative bosses are just a handful of conditions thousands of workers have to deal with on a daily basis, but it appears as if one hotel worker finally had enough.</p>
<p>The woman, called Milly, <a>seemingly walked out mid-shift</a>, leaving the roughly 500-word-long letter, filled with capital letters and underlined words and ending in the words "I quit" in large, bold font.</p>
<p>A guest discovered the note when seeking help at the front desk after being locked out of their room, thought to be in Iowa.</p>
<a>Reddit</a> on Saturday, where it's been upvoted more than 184,000 times. User Vinboslice420 captioned it: "Got locked out of my hotel room, went to find the front desk lady and this was on the counter."
<p>The contents, directed at someone called Brian, lists various grievances as Milly raged against her bosses for overlooking her for promotions and not appreciating her enough.</p>
<p>She goes on to rage against someone else being hired to fill a vacant management position, instead of her, as well as Brian's reaction when she brought it up.</p>
<a>Google</a>. I have cross trained and LEARNED many different positions to keep this hotel afloat. I have put everything into this, and this is what I get in return?"
<p>She says she even cancelled flights to come in for a shift, saying she was "hurt" at how she'd been overlooked and underappreciated, adding: "I would be treated better at McDonald's."</p>
<p>Milly signs off with: "In conclusion, I QUIT."</p>
<p>While it can't be confirmed the resignation letter is real, numerous people sympathized with the similar position many workers find themselves in.</p>
<p>Zombear33 noted: "People don't quit jobs, they quit managers."</p>
<p>"As a former hotel front desk employee, I salute Milly. It is a hard thankless job, harder than all my jobs as a server," another Reddit-user, Hey-man-Shabozi, wrote.</p>

<p>A company is looking to pay a group of people $1,500 each to smoke weed for an entire monthâ€”and will even provide the cannabis.</p>
<p>Flower and Freedom, which describes itself as a "wellness website," is searching for testers to form a new team of "cannabis effects specialists."</p>
<p>Owner David Rhodes said the company was seeking up to five people to take on the 30-day role and confirmed that the chosen few would have "all cannabis and equipment provided to them." On top of that, they will be paid a $1,500 stipend.</p>
<p>The testers will need to follow <a>strict testing procedures</a> and have a good command of English in order to submit reviews and share their experiences during the study. Feedback will be given via verbal questionnaires as well as video calls.</p>
<p>"Our team of 'cannabis effects specialists' will be putting some of our theories to the test on how cannabis can affect someone's mood, sleep, appetite, motivation and more."</p>
<p>Rhodes explained that he began experimenting with cannabis more than a decade ago after he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the bowel.</p>
<p>"It was one of the only things that was helping with my symptoms. Since then I got into growing my own cannabis and been a huge activist for its medical and recreational benefits ever since," he said.</p>
<p><a>The position is open</a> to anyone in the world over the age of 21, but Flower and Freedom's job description stresses that recreational cannabis use must be legal in applicants' home jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In other states, such as Louisiana, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, cannabis use is only permitted for medicinal purposes, or in other forms such as cannabidiol (CBD) oil.</p>
<p>Cannabis use remains illegal in Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming.</p>
<p>To apply to become one of the Flower and Freedom weed testers, fill in the form <a>here</a> by October 1, detailing why you'd be the perfect candidate.</p>

<p>An Alabama pizzeria has posted a novel job ad in a bid to entice people to join their staff, saying "we will literally hire anyone."</p>
<a>Facebook</a> page, advertising positions were available. The post, uploaded last Wednesday, simply says: "We will literally hire anyone. If you're on unemployment and can't find a job, call us; we'll hire you."
<p>The post has attracted a lot of attention amid the current job climate, as the U.S. grapples with wages, employment and benefits in the wake of the pandemic, with small businesses struggling to find workers.</p>
<a>revealed</a> nearly half of small businesses were finding it difficult to recruit staff. Some 44 percent were struggling to fill vacancies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report showed.
<a>according</a> to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in June. Some 559,000 new jobs were advertised in May, up from 278,000 added the previous month, as the economy recovered.
<a>report,</a> released on August 12, showed the previous week's unemployment claims dropped to 375,000, down from 387,000 one week prior.
<p>It's a steep decline from the high of more than 900,000 applications <a>seen</a> in early January, but current figures are still above pre-pandemic levels, of around 220,000 claims per week.</p>
<a>White Castle to Wendy's have upped their minimum wage offer</a>, handing out pizzas at interviews as well as giving out signing-up bonuses. McDonald's went as far as to
<a>offer free iPhones to new employees</a>, while
<a>offered</a> workers a $1,000 hiring bonus.
<p>The perks echo Marc Perrone'sâ€”the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW)â€”assertion that there's an overall wage shortage, rather than a labor one.</p>
<p>He refuted <a>claims</a> Americans were choosing to live off their stimulus packages and increased unemployment checks rather than work, although he noted it did "further exacerbate the problem."</p>
<p>In a bid to help struggling Americans at the start of the pandemic, amid record job losses and business closures, unemployment benefits were increased by $600 a week, and later $300 a week.</p>
<a>22 states had put an end to the monetary boost</a>, with the higher rate set to expire nationally on September 6.

<p>Back at Dave's, which describes itself as "a family with a great passion for pizza, good beer and music, but mostly for our loyal and crazy local community," one former worker raved about the outlet.</p>
<p>Cox, who took his 2-and-a-half-year-old son, Thomas Blair Cox IV, to the outlet for his very first trip to a restaurant when he was 2 months old, said many places in his home state appeared to be in the same position.</p>

<p>A man who confronted a group of bikini-clad girls at the beach over their bathing suits, comparing them to "pornography," has been fired from his job.</p>
<p>A video of Logan Dorn approaching the nine women at a beach in Fort Collins, Colorado, earlier this week went viral on social media.</p>
<p>The original clip, posted to the 18-year-old's TikTok account @ggarbagefairy, amassed nearly 2.5 million views, and can be seen <a>here</a>. A follow-up was watched more than a million times.</p>
<p>After the <a>clip was widely circulated</a>, Dorn shared his own version of events, but confirmed he wasn't "going to apologize."</p>
<p>As a result it appears he has now been let go by his employer, Mighty Hand Construction, based in Fort Collins. The post stated: "Mighty Hand Construction does not condone Logan's behavior in the videos."</p>
<p>The company's <a>Facebook</a> group shared an update on Thursday, saying it began an investigation after the allegations of harassment surfaced.</p>
<a> harassing a group of individuals</a> over the weekend in Northern Colorado. We began an investigation this morning which has resulted in the immediate termination of Mr. Dorn.
<p>While not referencing the apparent loss of his job, Dorn has shared another two clips to his TikTok page, @loganvandorn, following his initial one addressing Mia's video, which can be seen <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>"Those are these far-from-the-truth lies that have come out about me." He categorically denied all the points, adding he did not have children and was not married, although he did have a fiancÃ©.</p>
<p>A follow-up clip, shared straight after and watched 143,000 times, sees Dorn go into further detail, saying: "I'm sorry you guys feel the need to come on my page and try to humiliate me and berate me and make me look bad...</p>
<p>"Our society is on such a downcline of morality because of our pain and our hurt, that we've gone to things like pornography and lust and alcohol and drugs...</p>
<p>"Last but not least guys I have nothing to apologize for. There needs to be more men of God to speak and stand on the truth, and especially with women too. I mean if this is my calling and if my calling with that comes persecution then let it be.</p>
<p>"If it comes, humiliation and losing my reputation then let it be. Jesus is worthy of it. I will continue to speak truth."</p>

<div> U.S. Career <a>Career Advice</a> <a>Jobs</a></div>
<p>The survey asked two simple questions:</p>
<ul><li>On average, what percentage of your skills became obsolete or outdated during the pandemic?</li><li>On average, what percentage of your skills became obsolete or outdated on a yearly basis before the pandemic?</li></ul>
<p>We compared the mean responses for each question and found that the perceived rate of skill obsolescence increased by 71.7 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A Belgian CEO concurred, "Many interpersonal skills used in informal settings were simply wait-listed."</p>
<p>Communication challenges dominated the conversation around skills lost or gained. Executives had to learn rapidly how to transition their communication and leadership skills to virtual platforms.</p>
<h3>Three Ways to Keep Skills Current</h3>
<p>Executives reported different strategies for keeping their skills relevant that typically fell into one of three categories.</p>
<p>In order to sharpen digital skills, a Spanish consulting executive explained, "I have expanded my network and conversations with people with strong digital experience."</p>
<p>We believe a lasting implication of the pandemic will be the focus on well-being and the expectation that leaders do their part to care for the wellbeing of their employees and themselves.</p>

<p>From buying expensive lattes on the commute to online shopping, we all have a bad habit that costs us more than we think.</p>
<p>Cents add up, and you could unwittingly be shelling out hundreds, or thousands, a year on frivolous purchases. But if you want to get a handle on your splurges, and save money in the process, a dream job has just come up.</p>
<p>A company is looking to pay someone a whopping $5,000 to ditch a pricey addiction for a month. So as well as the money you'll save by making lunches at home, or heading to thrift stores, you'll also be rolling in cash if you manage to last 30 days.</p>
<p>Website The Penny Hoarder is looking for its very own protÃ©gÃ©, who needs help curbing spending in any area of their life, be it takeout food, fancy shoes or numerous subscriptions.</p>
<p>Explaining more about the role, the job ad says: "The challenge could be as simple as spending less on something by staying home or replacing one habit with another, more frugal one.</p>
<p>"After being selected for the job, you'll cut out one costly habit for 30 days and funnel that money into savings, tracking your progress each week during the challenge. We'll also want you to keep notes of how you're feeling about the experience."</p>
<a>reveal exactly how much you managed to save</a>. But be warned, you'll need to stick to the conditions in order to qualify for the $5,000 prize.
<p>In order to apply for the dream job, you'll need to fill in an application form, available <a>here</a>, by September 19. The winner will be announced on the 30th of the month.</p>
<a> need to tell the team about your current budget</a>, and which habit you'd like to cut back on. They're also keen to hear how your spending habits changed during the COVID pandemic, including any savings goals.
<p>A boss' eye-opening post revealing exactly what she does and doesn't care about from her employees has struck a chord with workers, particularly parents.</p>
<p>Megan Witherspoon, the vice-president of communications at Altria, shared the list on her LinkedIn page, which has amassed more than 100,000 reactions.</p>
<p>In it she details her expectations, addressing the new work-life balance many have had to adjust to, since <a>working from home became the norm</a> due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The mom-of-two's lengthy post has been widely praised, after she shared it on the networking site last week.</p>
<p>Witherpsoon, from Virginia, said: "I DO care about YOU and the things you care about. I DO care that you deliver quality work and perform at your best. I DO NOT care when, where or how you get your work done.</p>
<p>"I DO care that your daughter is home with yet another ear infection. I DO NOT care that you'll be offline for 2 hours this afternoon for her doctor's appointment.</p>
<p>"I DO care that your ailing mom needs hands-on care and her facility is understaffed. I DO NOT care if you need to work asynch this week between meals, medications and visiting hours.</p>
<p>"I DO care that a bus driver shortage means you don't have reliable transportation for your son. I DO NOT care if you need to get back to me in an hour after picking him up from school.</p>
<p>"I DO care that your dog is puking all over your rug right now. I DO NOT care if you need to jump off our call to rush him outside and clean up the mess.</p>
<p>"I DO care that you desperately need to get out of your house because you've been cooped up far too long. I DO NOT care if you'd like to work from the office for a few days, or from Florida for a week.</p>
<p>"I DO care that you haven't taken your vacation time, because I know you need a break. I DO NOT care if that means asking for help so you can disconnect without missing a deadline.</p>
<p>"In short...I DO care about YOU and the things you care about. I DO care that you deliver quality work and perform at your best. I DO NOT care when, where or how you get your work done."</p>
<p>She added the hashtags "flexible working," "balance" and "pandemic life," with her bio explaining more, saying: "I'm passionate about building culture, bringing humanity into business, work/life harmony, and pushing for positive change."</p>
<p>"I never expected my post to get this much attentionâ€”I've had a huge outpouring of support, both from inside my company and on LinkedIn. It's reaffirmed that this matters so much to so many people."</p>
<p>Witherspoon, who's been with the company for 17 years, also clarified her position in the comment section of the post, after some misconstrued her words as negative.</p>
<a>important that our relationships are more than just transactional</a>. I do actually care about the people I work with.
<p>Numerous people praised her stance, with Anthony Grillo writing: "Megan Witherspoon I don't know you personally but I would 100% work for any organization in which you were a leader or manager.</p>
<p>"Cheers to you and the team that get to work with you. I would bet you have a highly productive team that gets things done."</p>
<p>Carrie Duke thought: "Refreshing! Having started my working career in the late 80's, we did not have this kind of understanding care back then. Zero flexibility. Happy to see flex work taking hold. We will all be more healthy."</p>
<p>The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) noted flexible working was thrust into the spotlight due to the pandemic, and "employee requests for flexible hours and remote-work arrangements will be part of the new normal."</p>
<p>SHRM cited a 2020 survey by FlexJobs, who stated 81 percent of employees would be "more loyal" to their boss if they had flexible working options.</p>
<p>"Many U.S. workers now consider work/life balance and flexibility to be the most important factors in considering job offers," the site added.</p>

<p>Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak has started to consider when he will leave the game show, as he approaches a remarkable 40 years at the helm.</p>
<p>Ahead of the show's latest season, which began this month, Sajak and co-host Vanna White signed new contracts that lock them in until 2023-24.</p>
<p>However, the host has admitted that he has started to think about when he might retire.</p>
<p>"We're certainly closer to the end than the beginning," Sajak said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. "I'd like to leave before people tune in and look at me and say, 'Ooh, what happened to him?'"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't bet on seeing us in, like, 10 years, I would say," Sajak added. He then asked White, who was also present for the ET interview: "Is that fair?"</p>
<p>White, who has been on the show since 1982, responded: "Probably, yes."</p>
<p>Over the decades, the pair have developed the kind of partnership rarely seen in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>"We've been together for 38 years and he's like my brother," White, 64, said of Sajak, 74. "He's funny. I mean, we could finish each other's sentences if we wanted to. We know each other that well."</p>
<p>For now, Sajak and White are gearing up for the Season 2 premiere of Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, which airs on September 26.</p>
<p>The celebrity guests taking part in the first episode are Jason Alexander, Dancing with the Stars' Cheryl Burke and wrestler Michael "The Miz" Mizaninâ€”but Sajak has an ultimate dream contestant.</p>
<p>"I would pick Meryl Streep. Because I just want to have Meryl Streep standing there and saying, 'Come on, big money!'" the host told Entertainment Tonight. "That's my dream."</p>
<p>Sajak's run on Wheel of Fortune, which began in December 1981, has not been unbroken. Most recently, he took a break in 2019 to undergo surgery for a blocked intestine.</p>
<p>As he recovered, White stepped up to host the game show for three weeks.</p>
<p>After she took on the hosting role, White admitted to <a>ABC</a> News that the experience "felt weird" without Sajak on the Los Angeles set.</p>
<p>"We've been together 37 years, and it's not the sameâ€”we are a team. We're together," she said. "Those three weeks without him were very hard.</p>
<p>"I really missed him. I just can't imagine doing this show without him, you know? And I hope he feels the same with me."</p>
<div> News Britney Spears <a>Lawyers</a> <a>Career</a></div>
<p>Jamie Spears helped "revive" his daughter Britney's career, and the judge's ruling to suspend him from the conservatorship that has had massive control over her life is "a loss" for the singer, his attorney said Thursday.</p>
<p>Vivian Thoreen, Jamie Spears' attorney, wrote a statement to the Associated Press that said Spears loves his daughter unconditionally and has tried "to do what is in her best interests, whether as a conservator or her father."</p>
<p>Thoreen called the ruling by a Los Angeles court that suspended Jamie Spears as conservator "disappointing, and frankly, a loss for Britney."</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>The suspension is technically temporary but practically permanent, as the entire conservatorship appears likely to end in the coming months.</p>
<p>"The current situation is untenable," Judge Brenda Penny said at Wednesday's hearing. "It reflects a toxic environment which requires the suspension of James Spears."</p>
<p>Britney Spears' attorney, Mathew Rosengart, delivered a long and scathing attack on her father at the hearing, continuing a campaign to have him removed that included a pair of dramatic court speeches from the singer in June and July.</p>
<p>"According to Britney Spears, his service has been abusive, has been toxic, has been cruel," Rosengart told the judge.</p>
<p>Thoreen responded in court that the allegations were unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>After years of acting as the conservatorship's biggest champion and defender, James Spears reversed course in recent weeks and petitioned to have the arrangement scrapped altogether. The judge rejected that request.</p>

<p>Having a bubble bath is one of the best ways to relax and soak away your worries.</p>
<p>But wouldn't it be an even better experience if you could be paid $5,000 to lie horizontally in a tub?</p>
<p>Hotels.com is advertising for the position of "Bath Boss," which involves a stay in three luxurious hotel properties in New York City to sample the baths in a journey hilariously dubbed "Tour de Tub."</p>
<p>According to the booking site, the tub is fast becoming an "endangered species" in hotel rooms and in order to combat this the company is offering the chance to bathe at The Dominick, The Langham and Mr C. Seaport.</p>
<p>Aside from the $5,000 "salary," the role also comes with "a $1,000 travel stipend, plush bath accessories, custom robe, slippers and eye mask to set the tone for the ultimate hotel experience"â€”sounds good to us!</p>
<p>The advert for the appealing job reads: "Imagine that you check in to a hotel room and *gasp* there is no bathtub! (the horror).</p>
<p>"The hotel bath amenity is quickly becoming an endangered species and we CANNOT let that happen!</p>
<p>"Because we're passionate about saving one of the best hotel amenities, Hotels.com has created the coveted position of "Bath Boss" to bring awareness to the cause of doing absolutely nothing but relaxing in water for questionable amounts of time.</p>
<p>"If you're ready to soak to the point of prune, we need YOU, a self-proclaimed claw-foot connoisseur, to embark on a trip to three luxurious hotel properties in New York City to experience the ultimate Tour de Tub."</p>
<p>To be in with a chance of bathing for money, all you have to do is fill out the questionnaire on the Hotels.com website.</p>
<p>The questions include explaining which is your "favorite hotel bath" and listing some "non-negotiable bath accessories."</p>
<p>The company also asks applicants to write about what they believe makes them qualified for the role.</p>
<p>The Tour de Tub will be held between November 9 and November 15, in accordance with the current travel guidelines.</p>
<p>Additionally, this relaxing role is only available to those over the age of 21.</p>
<p>In other washing-related news, a woman on TikTok recently<a> shared her "hellscape" of a bathroom in her home in Glasgow, Scotland.</a></p>
<p>The space was only 33 inches wide, yet still managed to fit a small tub, toilet and sink.</p>
<p>However, <a>Amber Milne</a> did manage to get the tiny space renovated and the result is astounding.</p>
<p>Delivery drivers are hailed as heroes of the modern age, battling the elements and road closure to get our Prime packages to us in time.</p>
<p>But a man claiming to be an <a>Amazon</a> worker joked he nearly quit his job after taking nearly two hours to deliver more than 300 packages to one address.</p>
<p>Willy Ngoran shared a clip to his TikTok account, @willy.ngoran, as he filmed a mountain of boxes outside a woman's house. <a>The parcel pile is nearly as tall as him</a>, while there's a stack almost blocking the front door.</p>
<p>Ngoran, from Maryland, said in the on-screen captions: "The day I quitted Amazon deliveries. Note that she is opening the boxes as I deliver due to limited space.</p>
<p>"It took one hour 47 minutes to deliver 314 heavy packages to this single home."</p>
<p>Speaking to Newsweek, Ngoran says he works for the company as: "...a delivery driver whose primary responsibility is to manage the rest of the team."</p>
<p>"It was my responsibility to find a way to deliver it. None of the drivers in the same delivery area could take these as all the vehicles were full. I had to suspend my task to find a van and deliver it myself."</p>
<p>Ngoran says it took two round trips from the warehouse, in Hanover, to the recipient, in Laurel. "There was a lot of physical effort required to lift these boxes and unload them," he added.</p>
<p>But there was a reason the shipment was so large, adding to the headache of the delivery.</p>
<p>After the fiasco, he vowed never again, adding: "The whole time I was like, ain't no way I am doing this again. Delivering the packages is not even the hard part? It's all the paperwork behind it that bothers me."</p>
<p>He did confirm <a>the recipient offered the workers drinks and snacks</a> as they unloaded the parcels.</p>
<p>The clip has amassed more than 11 million views since being shared last month, and can be seen <a>here</a>, with Christy LaRose saying: "A tip is absolutely necessary at this point."</p>
<p>While @thefloatwitch joked: "When did ppl start using Amazon for moving day?"</p>
<p>K joked: "When I get rich rich I'll be ordering from Amazon like this."</p>
<p>"Probably because they put one small thing in every single box instead of putting five things in one box lol," KLH reckoned.</p>
<p>While Mackenize Stith commenting: "Are you kidding this is the most ideal delivery. One stop. A house not an apartment. Wow."</p>

<p>A man quit his job in a spectacular fashion by texting his boss "have a good life" after being berated for sitting down.</p>
<p>The worker did what most of us dream doing; giving our superiors a piece of our mind after getting a grilling.</p>
<p>The man shared a screengrab of the exchange to the /r/antiwork subreddit, under the username @Hestolemysmile, on Thursday.</p>
<p>He explained: "Quit my job last night, it was nice to be home to make the kids breakfast and take them to school today! Off to hunt for a new opportunity, wish me luck."</p>
<p>The texts are between himself and someone saved as "boss," and appear to berate the worker, whose other posts indicate he was employed at a fulfillment center.</p>
<p>A post uploaded last month said: "<a>Working at a fulfillment center is one of the least fulfilling jobs you can have</a>."</p>
<p>He replied, not only explaining there was a medical reason for why he was sat down, but pointed out he still managed to be the top-performing worker that day.</p>
<p>"So just to be clearâ€”my impressive performance was overshadowed by the fact that I wasn't uncomfortable enough while doing it?"</p>
<p>Seemingly faced with losing one of their best workers, the manager replied: "We don't need to rush to you leaving. Let's talk in the morning and we can sort this out."</p>
<p>But the man had enough, and signed off with a satisfactory: "No thanks. Have a good life."</p>
<p>Since being shared the messages have received 217,000 upvotes, as people overwhelmingly backed the man's decision. While it's not clear where he's based, previous posts indicate he's based in the U.S.</p>
<a>I'm sure I'll find a new job in no time</a>."
<p>Numerous people praised his decision, and were impressed at how he handled the situation.</p>
<p>RiceThrowaway913 commented: "Power to you! I'm glad you're looking for somewhere that's going to give you the respect you deserve."</p>
<p>CooterSlam3000 raved: "Epic. This internet stranger is so damn proud of you. Let's not put up with this s*** anymore!"</p>
<p>Far_Pianist2707 reckoned: "Like an abusive partner. Good job quitting, OP."</p>
<p>Sirius4778 commented: "OP, you kick ass."</p>
<p>"This is truly inspiring. Thank you for sharing. And congratulations!!" Aylwin4now added.</p>
<p>There have been reports of a labor shortage across the U.S., as businesses and offices reopen following COVD-19 measures being eased.</p>
<p>These figures were higher in the South and Midwest, parts of the country hit the hardest by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Employers are posting near-record job openings, as further figures showed 3<a> million citizens who were laid off at the height of the pandemic</a> stopped looking for work, and have yet to resume a job search.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Hestolemysmile for comment.</p>
<p>Health insurance, along with paying bills and keeping a roof over your head, is one of the chief benefits of having a job in America.</p>
<p>Even with insurance, many citizens find themselves out of pocket.</p>
<p>Quitting may not be an option for those with pre-existing or underlying health conditions, but even with insurance many citizens find themselves out of pocket.</p>
<p>Statistics show that nearly 50 percent of U.S. citizens are insured through their employer, just like Redditor Bluepiehax.</p>
<p>Their boss wielded this cover as a weapon, demanding an employee forgo their day off due to the company being short-staffed.</p>
<p>Bluepiehax shared a text chain with their superior to r/antiwork, revealing they worked at a bar in the U.S., although they didn't confirm the location.</p>
<p>The initial message from the employer says: "Hey, Becky canceled on Saturday, I'll need you to come in and cover for her."</p>
<p>Unimpressed, the staff member replied bluntly: "That's not my problem. Saturday is my day off and I've been working eight days straight and really need it."</p>
<p>The boss refused to budge, responding: "I'm sorry, we're short staffed, I need you." But the worker also didn't back down, simply stating: "I'm not coming in so."</p>
<p>Seemingly trying to end the conversation, the boss snapped back: "You have to. I'll see you Saturday."</p>
<p>But Bluepiehax stuck to their guns, and told their boss they wouldn't be at work, pointing out "you can't make me."</p>
<p>Things escalated when the employee then dangled health insurance as a threat, or incentive, saying: "You sure you want to do this? You really want to put your health insurance on the line."</p>
<p>Seemingly having enough, Bluepiehax asked: "What are you going to do, fire me?" They acknowledged <a>the establishment had recently lost two members of staff</a> in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The boss typed: "I don't accept that type of attitude. Last chance. I'll see you Saturday or I won't see you again."</p>
<a>Did you really just threaten me with health insurance?</a> Whatever I'm done with this. You can consider this my notice. I've had enough of your bulls***."
<p>Despite losing their cover, Bluepiehax stuck by their decision, writing in their post: "This sub gave me the motivation to finally quit my abusive job. I may not have health insurance, but I feel so free!"</p>
<p>Since being shared on Tuesday the messages have been upvoted 100,000 times, and sparked a debate over health care in the U.S.</p>
<p>Bluepiehax called for reform, saying the issue of healthcare kept them "hostage for so long" in their job, and the messages were "the last straw."</p>
<p>They added they were "so glad to be out," and confirmed they'd contacted a lawyer about the events.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment about toxic managers, Bluepiehax wrote: "This is the unfortunate reality for so many people, especially during these crazy times. You're lucky to have not had a toxic manager. Many are not."</p>
<p>Lyzerene suggested: "Take this to your local labor relations office. Employers can't make threats like that. Go win some money for yourself and get another job. There's still like 10 million open positions."</p>
<p>Potat_Eatr raved: "Good for you! And good luck!"</p>
<p>Intelligent_Ask_6337 pointed out: "If you have any health issues that depend on insurance like insulin. It's a slam dunk."</p>
<p>Bumblebe86 commented: "To hold health insurance over your head like that is actually horrific."</p>
<p>Ferninja added: "Considering lack of health insurance can actually be life threatening in some situations this is truly awful."</p>
<p>3DCatFancy thought: "Gatekeeping access to medical care is just another form of slavery."</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to Bluepiehax for comment.</p>
<p>Calling all big kids and gamers alike, the dream job really does exist after a company put out an advert for a toy tester.</p>
<p>The Toy Zone is looking to pay one lucky person a whopping $1,170 just to play with Halo Nerf blasters, and you'll get to keep all the swag too.</p>
<p>The brand is looking for a fan to give the new range a test drive and provide an in-depth review of the gear.</p>
<a>hotly anticipated release of Xbox's powerhouse Halo Infinite</a>. The ammunition may be made out of foam, but this is most definitely war," they said.
<p>The person getting to live out their childhood fantasy will be sent a Nerf Halo bulldog SG blaster, a Master Chief helmet, and a Nerf Halo mangler, all valued at roughly $125.</p>
<p>You'll get to keep the lot and get a tidy sum for it, which even The Toy Zone reckoned was "ridiculous."</p>
<p>But it won't just be shooting your kids or spouse around the house, as you'll need to document every part of the mission.</p>
<p>You'll need to film an unboxing video, as well as do a photoshoot of the kit (close-ups required). And you'll need to record your epic home warfare as you test out the swag.</p>
<p>Now comes the hard part, as you'll also be expected to give an in-depth review of each piece of kit, telling people what you love and don't love, and what your overall verdict is.</p>
<p>And it goes without saying you'll need to "rigorously test these toys (aka play with them.)"</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is November 12, with the winner announced on the 29th. In order to be in with a shot of clinching the job, you'll need to tell the team in 100 words or less why you're perfect for the position.</p>
<p><a>Toys will be shipped via Amazon</a>, and you'll be expected to submit your reviews no later than three weeks after receiving the merchandise.</p>
<p>You need to be over 18, and based in the U.K. or U.S.A to apply, which can be done by clicking<a> here</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone needs food and sleep, but the specific damage a "Hungry Night" does depends on each individual's circumstances and resources.</p>
<p>Consider three different people:</p>
<p>Miguel is a 22-year-old immigrant working in a meat-processing plant to support his family back home. This has been his nightly routine for the past year. He has no health coverage and his English is poor.</p>
<p>Sandra is a 42-year-old attorney coming home from a night on the town with colleagues celebrating a big win in court. She is divorced with no children and earns a six-figure salary with excellent health benefits.</p>
<p>This requires investing our personal resources, which Hobfoll divides into four categories:</p>
<p>Personal characteristics, including education; self-esteem; health; a sense of humor; optimism; stamina; ability to organize tasks; self-discipline; the feelings of accomplishing goals and being valued by others.</p>
<p>Energies, such as the time to spend maintaining one's health, relationships, and possessions; good credit; continuing education and training; practical help at work and home.</p>
<p>Conditions, including a loving and supportive family in good health; status at work; at least one close friend; a good boss and colleagues; involvement in a supportive community group.</p>
<p>Practical Help for Yourself and Others</p>
<p>As the last example indicates, COR is not a zero-sum gameâ€”improving one person's resources benefits everyone around them.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to put the theory into practice:</p>

<p>Shared on Beech's TikTok account earlier this month, the video features a revamped version of Gloria Gaynor's 1978 disco hit, I Will Surviveâ€“except in his version, the lyrics have been humorously rewritten to entice potential employers.</p>
<p>"Been made redundant twice this year/My spirit could have died," sings Beech in the highly-stylized clip. "But that's the times we're living in/and, hey, I did choose Marketing/So I stand strong/as I look for another job."</p>
<p>"And so I'm back/Back to LinkedIn," continue the lyrics. "I've got a fire for marketing/and I'd love to keep that going strong."</p>
<p>The 70s-inspired clip features dance moves, creative camera shots, and eye-catching editing. In the final moments of the video, a hashtag appears onscreen: #HireJayBeech.</p>
<a>The rest of the song and video</a>, posted in May, soon followed.
<p>"Once it went out, things went crazy. The video received 1 million views on LinkedIn and I was inundated with interview offers. I [two] weeks later accepted a new position," he said.</p>
<p>"After being made redundant for a second time this year, I knew a new video had to be created," said Beech on his I Will Survive cover, adding, "I don't think I can ever go back to traditional recruitment."</p>
<p>The video clearly resonated with the TikTok community, as its comments section became flooded with supportive messages from viewers (and potential employers).</p>
<p>"Awesome video," read one comment. "I own a marketing company and would love the opportunity to discuss ... if we're both a good fit!"</p>
<p>"Sorry to hear you lost your job again," wrote another viewer, "but I'm glad we got another [one] of these videos."</p>
<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>Internet Overwhelmingly Supports Man Who Fired Employee Over 'Pattern' of Lateness</h1><div> By Anabelle Doliner <time>On 11/3/21 at 11:45 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<a>The post</a>, in Reddit's "Am I the A**hole" (AITA) forum, has received significant levels of engagement, with over 10,000 upvotes and 1,100 comments at the time of writing.
<p>"These guys work on call, so even the most diligent guys are occasionally [five to ten] minutes late," he added, noting that most will call and give him a heads up.</p>
<p>The next time the employee was supposed to be on duty, he arrived "25 minutes late" with "no call."</p>
<p>"I find him...and let him [know] that he is getting a 'formal reprimand' and the next time he is late it will be a 10 day suspension. [That's] the standard procedure," explained the Redditor. "He tells me he is sorry, and it [won't] happen again."</p>
<p>In response, HR reinstated the formal reprimand, but the Redditor wanted to take things one step further. He decided to "go after [the employee] for dishonesty and insubordination"â€”both of which are fireable offenses.</p>
<p>"So, unless I withdraw those claims against him in the next [seven] days he will remain fired," concluded the Redditor. "I am secure in my decision, but [I've] heard some other guys whispering about me being a 'harda**.'"</p>
<p>Despite the Redditor's uncertainty, readers readily offered him their support. "Instead of taking the punishment, he tried to have YOU reprimanded," wrote u/holy_roman_emperor.</p>
<p>Echoed u/hello_friendss: "Chronic lateness will get you terminated in most places."</p>
<p>Others noted that the Redditor gave his employee "a lot of leeway" by simply asking him to call and warn him when he was running late.</p>
<p>A handful of commenters, however, were not so quick to agree. Many pointed out that with conditions like ADHD, "time blindness" can cause issues with time management that are not so easily controlled.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no indication in the post that the employee in question suffers from ADHD or a similar condition.</p>

<h1>How to Switch Industries in a Shifting Economy</h1>
<h2>Before you even think about how to go about upskilling or filling out online job applications, you need to make sure that you've selected the right industry to switch into in the first place.</h2>
<div> Tim Madden , <a>Founder CEO, Executive Career Upgrades</a> <time> On 11/11/21 at 10:06 AM EST </time></div>
<div> Experts Career <a>Hiring</a></div>
<p>It's almost impossible to not notice the economic changes that have taken place over the last few years. Some sectors have emerged, some have died and others are just about treading water.</p>
<p>If that's the situation you find yourself in, here's a guide to making the shift you've been dreaming of.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Sector</h3>
<p>Before you even think about how to go about upskilling or filling out online job applications, you need to make sure you've selected the right industry to switch into in the first place.</p>
<p>This year, there have been <a>more job openings than at any time in history</a>. The best part is that there are both technical and non-technical positions available, and solid training in IT will stand you in good stead to go far.</p>
<p>Another good bet is apps related to the sharing economy. You might think that the likes of <a>Uber</a> and <a>Airbnb</a> already have market dominance, but expect people to share far more than just car journeys and houses in the future.</p>
<p>Although it's helpful to weigh up the prospects offered by different careers, beware of closing yourself up from new opportunities. The job market is dynamic, and casting a wide net can increase your chances of success.</p>
<p>Besides, you never know â€” you might end up enjoying your consulting or contracting work so much that you decide to continue working for yourself.</p>
<h3>Ready to Make the Switch?</h3>
<p>Reality TV fans, rejoice. Netflix's <a>Selling Sunset</a> is back for season 4 next month.</p>
<p>The luxurious homes of Los Angeles are set to be the backdrop to top-tier <a>drama between the women that sell them</a>.</p>
<p>With those big price tags come big commissions, which perhaps explains <a>Christine Quinn's</a> fabulously expensive wardrobe.</p>
<p>Thinking of emulating the Selling Sunset stars and pursuing a career as a realtor in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>This is what you need to know.</p>
<h2>What Is the Difference Between a Real Estate Agent and a Realtor?</h2>
<p>While some may use the terms interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between real estate agents and realtorsâ€”and it comes down to certification.</p>
<p>Realtors are agents who are active members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</p>
<p>To become a realtor, agents must already have a valid real estate license and abide by its code of ethics, which covers a realtor's duty of care to their clients, to the public and other real estate agents.</p>
<h2>How to Become a Real Estate Agent in Los Angeles</h2>
<p>Each state has different requirements to get a real estate license</p>
<p>To get a real estate salesperson license in the state of California, you must be aged over 18 and have the necessary qualifications.</p>
<p>What qualifications do I need to become a real estate agent in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>In California, you must successfully complete three college-level courses.</p>
<p>The first two are Real Estate Principles, and Real Estate Practice.</p>
<p>These courses are a minimum of 45 hours in length and members of the California State Bar don't need to take these.</p>
<p>To pass, you must complete a final exam and get a score of at least 70 percent and you may have two attempts at each.</p>
<p>After that, there is a written exam that takes 3 hours and comprises 150 multiple-choice questions. Again, the pass mark is 70 percent.</p>
<p>To begin your career, you must be sponsored by a real estate broker, like Jason Oppenheim.</p>
<p>Once you have passed, you will be sent a Salesperson License Application (RE 202).</p>
<h2>How Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid?</h2>
<p>You have to be a confident salesperson to pursue a career in real estate as this job is commission-only.</p>
<p>Star of the show Mary Fitzgerald previously told the Daily Express: "I think the hardest thing in real estate is working for commission only.</p>
<p>"Spending months sometimes with a client and then they change their minds.</p>
<p>"The best part can also be when a client finds something they love immediately and I make a huge commission with very little effort.</p>
<p>"This unfortunately is not normally the case, but I have double-ended deals represented the buyer as well on my own listing, so this is the best scenario for an agent."</p>
<p>Working for commission only also can mean going for long periods of time without earning any income.</p>
<p>Season 3 saw Davina Potratz struggle to sell a sprawling mansion listed for $75 million.</p>
<p>Some of the commission made on sales also has to go to the broker.</p>
<p>"But if you get, say, 2.5 percent commission of the purchase price then that share goes to the broker and then the salesperson who did the transaction, if it was their client, they have a split with the broker."</p>
<div> Culture Career <a>Reddit</a> <a>Email</a></div>
<p>One Redditor is asking the internet for advice over a recent possible work faux pas and the internet is divided.</p>
<p>The Redditor, who posted to the "Am I The A**hole" thread under the username Born-Replacement-366 said he's not sure if he did the right thing when handling a defiant colleague, in a post that has more than 12,000 votes.</p>
<p>The poster explained that he works as an in-house lawyer at a Multinational company. He said that someone in the sales department continues to copy him on email chains with "external affiliated companies" asking for legal advice.</p>
<p>"He does this without any courtesy heads-up beforehand, or any context provided," the Redditor wrote.</p>
<p>"I would also be sacrificing privilege," Born-Replacement-366 wrote. "He said he understood, but after a few weeks would do the same thing."</p>
<p>He said "Bill" did not respond, though mutual colleagues said he had gone too far.</p>
<p>"I understand that I could have been more civil, but I was frustrated because Bill has been doing this consistently and had not appeared to internalize my more polite previous warnings."</p>
<p>Commenters on the thread were divided over if the Redditor was within reason to go to such measures with his colleague.</p>
<p>"NTA [well, NTA beyond being a lawyer]â€”I'm a lawyer too," one person chimed in. "You told him once. He kept doing it. There's completely valid reasons that he needs to stop doing it."</p>
<p>Another commenter started by saying "ESH"â€”or, "everyone sucks here"</p>
<p>The original Redditor said he overheard some of his subordinates mimicking the email "with relish" and found out they had experienced similar things with Bill.</p>
<p>A cafÃ© sign advertising vacant positions has been slammed online, after the chain claimed they were looking for staff members who don't cry, are never late and have "no excuses."</p>
<p>A snap of the note, which has the branding for the popular juice chain Kreation, was shared to Twitter by Jenson Titus on Monday, where it amassed more than 34,000 likes.</p>
<p>The full text, under the company's logo, says: "Still looking for that special person. You know the one...</p>
<p>"Actually available, has an open schedule, doesn't cry, is never late, has no excuses, works hard, has no bulls***, smiles no matter what.</p>
<p>"That one! Think you might be the one? We're hiring."</p>
<p>Titus later tweeted an update, saying: "They <a>took the sign down</a> lol."</p>
<p>It causes quite a stir online, as SpencerMagne wrote: "Am I crazy or did they just write a job requirement for a slave?"</p>
<p>Dez commented: "This is wholly unsurprising. Whoever wrote that sign does not value other human beings, PARTICULARLY anyone ignorant enough to work for them."</p>
<p>Maureen Sklaroff thought: "Sounds like a toxic work environment (smiles no matter what?!?!). If I lived in the area, I would not solicit their business after this."</p>
<p>Greg Turner joked: "So looking for a person with no family commitments, no education commitments, no hobbies, no medical appointments, who won't ever stand up for themselves to make minimum wage."</p>
<p>A snap of the note was then shared to <a>Reddit</a> by Djmattyd, who captioned the post: "Local 'juicery' seems like a real garbage place to work." It was upvoted 6,000 times since being shared on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company's website indicates the brand, set up in 2007 by Marjan Sarshar, has 19 locations throughout L.A.,. Titus told Newsweek he saw the sign at the branch on 3501 Sunset Boulevard.</p>
<p>The QR code takes users to the HR portal, where there are eight vacant positions for "barista/smoothie production" listed across California.</p>
<p>The job pays $15 an hour plus tips, with prospective employees required to "be able to stand during entire shift, often up to 8 hours with frequent bending, squatting, and lifting plates, boxes, and objects up to 30 pounds up to 5 times per shift.</p>
<p>"Champions Kreation Service with energetic, friendly, and prompt greetings immediately upon making eye contact with guests."</p>
<p>As well as being able to work evenings and weekends, the ideal candidate is "energetic, fun, and friendly."</p>
<p>The chain also has cooks, cashier/customer service, juicery manager and production warehouse positions available.</p>
<p>Following the backlash, the company's Twitter page uploaded an apology on Thursday, admitting the language was "way too harsh."</p>
<p>It said: "Thank you for bringing the posted hiring signage to our attention. As you know, we took the sign down right away.</p>
<p>"The sign was created by our HR-hiring manager and did not go through the normal approval process for marketing materials (through the COO, marketing manager, or owner) before print...</p>
<p>"From a newly-hired HR perspective, their explanation was that they are in a very frustrating position given the current climate with the job market and difficulty retaining good employees.</p>
<p>"While their intentions with the sign were good and light-hearted, we absolutely agree that the wording on the signage was way too harsh."</p>
<p>The hospitality sector appears to be struggling to bounce back to its pre-pandemic heights, amid the labor shortage gripping America.</p>
<p>Some <a>42 states have more job openings than people looking for work</a>, a Stateline review of labor statistics from August, the latest data available, found.</p>
<p>Several factors have been mooted for the low uptake in jobs, particularly in low-paying sectors, including generous unemployment benefits, COVID-19 fears and an unwillingness to accept low hourly wages.</p>
<p>Companies have been offering prospective workers incentives and perks to entice staff, including <a>free pizza and up to $4,000 signing bonuses.</a></p>
<p>In a move that could partly address the shortage, some statesâ€”including Californiaâ€”have pledged to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to Forbes, what Kreation is currently offering.</p>

<p>A young actor and filmmaker is receiving praise after showing her followers a glimpse of an interaction with a man on a recent call for an upcoming project.</p>
<p>In the TikTok video, now viewed over 10 million times, @directedbybrini, 20, is heard shutting down the man who "kept" speaking over her while presenting.</p>
<p>In writing over the video she wrote that the man had started presenting her ideas as his own.</p>
<p>"And he said 'the problem with you women is' so I cut him off right back," she wrote. "I have no tolerance for this anymore."</p>
<p>There has long been a disparity between men and women in Hollywood in everything from front-of-the-camera roles to positions behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"Please keep yourself on mute," Sabrina is heard saying at the start of the video seemingly cutting off the man who interrupted her.</p>
<p>The video received numerous comments from people supporting and applauding Sabrina's handling of the situation.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, I've been in video production for over 20 years now," one commenter wrote. "This happens daily! I have my own company now and only work with women."</p>
<p>"This is seriously so inspirational. You handled this so well. I would have been yelling," another person wrote.</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, Sabrina gave a bit more background into her experience owning a production company from the age of 18.</p>
<p>She said she initially started filming for her "close friends" <a>Instagram</a> story but her friends encouraged her to post it for a wider audience.</p>

<p>In a brief but fruitful post on the subreddit r/anitwork, one Redditor shared a strange incident that happened at work.</p>
<p>In the post, which has now been voted on over 23,000 times, user <a>bunnybunbun777</a> wrote that upon returning from a bathroom break at work, she found her lunchbox open and half of her meal gone.</p>
<p>"Confused, I asked about what happened from an older lady who sits next to me. She responded that our boss came in, noticed the food on the table, took half of it on a plate, and left for a meeting.</p>
<p>Commenters jumped on the thread to share confusion about how the employee should handle the situation.</p>
<p>In 2015, Inc. published a list of workplace lunchtime dos and don'ts and while "eating someone else's lunch" didn't make the list, the publication says there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>One tip noted by Diane Gottsman, owner of the Protocol School of Texas is that rather than eating at a desk, lunchtime can be a good time to socialize with coworkers. "An isolated coworker is generally not a happy coworker," she writes.</p>
<p>As <a>CNN</a> noted in an article from July 2020, the coronavirus pandemic also changed lunchtime customs in the workplace â€” for those still working from an office.</p>
<p>Some commenters on the viral <a>Reddit</a> post noted the pandemic as one of a few reasons that no one else should be touching her food.</p>
<p>One commenter wrote, "In the middle of a pandemic? lol WTF."</p>
<p>Others say that someone "owes" her lunch.</p>
<p>"Definitely report them to a higher up thats genuinely [f***ed] up," one person said. "Id be [pi**ed] ... 100% angry as [h**l]."</p>
<p>The Redditor continued in her post that when she got angry and said how "unacceptable" it was, her coworker told her "to just shrug it off" and that it's "to be expected."</p>
<p>Another comment, which has garnered over 4,000 upvotes, suggests another theory: "I would calmly ask the boss. It could have been the coworker covering her own [a**]," they wrote.</p>
<p>A former employee took to Reddit to share their recent experience with a now-former boss after handing in their two weeks' notice.</p>
<a>a post</a> that has now been voted on over 17,000 times. The post explained that upon finding out they'd got a new job that would offer more money and a shorter commute they knew it was time to give in their two-weeks notice.
<p>At the end of what would be their final shift, the Redditor shared the news with their boss which went less than smoothly.</p>
<p>"After a few minutes of silence, he states 'I fell[sic] like you're stabbing me in the back right now,'" the Redditor wrote.</p>
<p>The Redditor said they felt the response was "hypocritical" given that two weeks prior, when they had to call out sick for exhibiting COVID symptoms, the boss was interviewing other people to fill the position.</p>
<p>Commenters on the thread suggested that the Redditor should apply for unemployment benefits so that while they would not receive a paycheck from their old employer they'd have an income of some kind until the new job picked up.</p>
<p>One commenter, _distortedmorals, explained in an edit to the post that they have a work permit through the DACA program so they are "not eligible for unemployment benefits."</p>
<p>According to a document published to the website of U.S. Congressman Joe Neguse of Coloradoâ€”where the Redditor claims to resideâ€”DACA recipients are in fact eligible to apply for unemployment.</p>
<p>Unemployment assistance, or unemployment insurance, gives individuals who have lost their jobs at no fault of their own a way to continue to receive an income while searching for another job.</p>
<p>Newsweek contacted _distortedmorals for comment.</p>
<p>A man claiming to be a former Air Force worker has regaled the internet with the story of how he was able to exact brilliantly petty revenge on an overbearing boss.</p>
<p>Having a bad boss makes a huge difference whatever your line of work. In fact, research shows it can be the difference between staying with one employer or seeking new opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>According to a poll by global staffing firm Robert Half, around 49 percent of the professionals they polled admitted to leaving a job due to a bad boss.</p>
<p>Social media is awash with stories about difficult employers. <a>From bosses gifting terrible presents in the annual secret Santa</a> to <a>managers texting workers demanding they cover shifts at the last minute</a>.</p>
<p>Inattentive bosses can be a nightmare - but so are overattentive ones as the story shared to <a>Reddit</a> by a user posting as WaveLindsay demonstrates.</p>
<p>According to the post, WaveLindsay spent many happy years working for the Air Force in communications security. It wasn't exactly your run-of-the-mill office job, as he explains in the post.</p>
<p>"We had Top Secret clearances, and handled collateral secret equipment and sensitive encryption key material on a regular basis," he wrote. "They assumed we were adults and generally treated us as such."</p>
<p>Things ran smoothly enough in the role, save for an incident he remembered from when they were working out of a temporary facility. He was sharing an office with his supervisor, while his manager was in a room nearby.</p>
<p>"One day, I did what all civilized humans do at least once a day, and went to use the restroom," he said. "I came back, my supervisor said Sergeant Smith [his manager] was looking for you."</p>
<p>He then found himself facing an interrogation of sorts with his manager asking: "Why weren't you at your desk?"</p>
<h2>Doing Just as He Was Ordered</h2>
<p>The final straw came when he told her he was grabbing a form from the printer.</p>
<p>"Why are you using a printer in a different room?" she asked. "I'm not," he replied. "But I have to leave my desk to retrieve it."</p>
<p>After that she ordered him to stop telling her when he left his desk except for when he was on lunch. A small, but important victory, the man earned plenty of praise from his fellow Redditors.</p>
<p>"Haha I love seeing stuff like this," chiparrific wrote. Tomtarnowski added: "Thanks for the chuckle."</p>
<p>"This is gold. Well done," Njb42 commented.</p>
<p>For others, like RedBenzo, the story brought back painful memories.</p>
<p>"My manager took it a step further and said I need to ask permission before I go," they wrote. "To this day I still beat myself up for not recording that interaction and getting a slam-dunk lawsuit."</p>
<p>Akiba89 responded: "I wish I did this when my supervisor was straight up harassing me at my old job. She would regularly and loudly tell me how long I was in the bathroom in front of people. She did this even after I told her I had stomach issues."</p>
<p>Zeraphyre concluded that while only a minor win, the story nevertheless made for "pretty satisfying" reading for anyone who has ever had a boss like that.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to WaveLindsay for comment.</p>
<p>Thousands weighed in on a Reddit post asking about aspects of everyday life that are accepted as OK when in actuality they are not.</p>
<a>a post</a> voted on over 19,000 times, with over 15,000 comments, user
<a>u/BigCook8220</a> asked the internet: "What is so normalized in today's society but isn't ok?" Though the post in its entirety has been removed from the platform, that did not stop users from giving their two cents.
<p>Commenters noted everything from "unskippable ads" to "working when sick." Given that Reddit is a platform used globally, the answers came from users all around the world.</p>
<a>BBC</a> published a piece titled "The psychology behind the subtle pressure to work when sick," which cites research that suggests that "if you work while sick you will perform more poorly, you're more likely to make errors and you'll be less vigilant."
<p>Of course, this was written before the COVID-19 pandemic, when staying home while sick is necessary for those infected by the virus.</p>
<p>One commenter on the thread recalled a time when they were working at Sam's Club making rotisserie chickens and felt forced to work despite illness.</p>
<p>Other norms noted were viewing "celebrities or the ultra wealthy as role models," "Taking videos of others without their consent," "Children beauty pageants" and "Tossing cigarettes on the ground."</p>
<a>NBC</a> news reported at the time. The law said that anyone who entered a child into a pageant would face up to two years in prison and 30,000 euros in fines.
<p>In 2009, it was estimated that around 5,000 child pageants occurred across the United States with 250,000 kids entering each year, <a>ABC</a> News reported with babies as young as a few weeks old competing.</p>
