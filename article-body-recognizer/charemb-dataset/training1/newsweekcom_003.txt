<div> U.S. Tiktok <a>Viral video</a> <a>Economy</a></div>
<p>A TikToker went viral after sharing a series of videos explaining how Dollar Tree's 25 cent increase heavily affects low-income shoppers.</p>
<p>In a video that has amassed more than 125,000 views, TikTok user @lilloworldwide drove to a Dollar Tree and showed how the 25 cent price increase quickly adds up as customers purchase more items.</p>
<p>"Let's see what it would have cost for what I'm gonna get and what it's gonna cost now," the TikToker said in the video.</p>
<p>She began tossing items into her cart, including batteries, plastic cups, gift bags, and various other random items. She then checked out and laid out all of the purchased items on a table.</p>
<p>"So when laid out like this, and you can count them if you want, I have 19 items," @lilloworldwide said. "Did you see how much I paid? $25 if I'm rounding down."</p>
<p>She explained in the video that before the 25 cent increase, all of the items would have cost her $19.</p>
<p>"That means that $5 that could have gone to food or utensils or anything else, school supplies, I can now not spend at the Dollar Tree."</p>
<p>She also said that while she was shopping for her items, she witnessed a customer having to put back the food he was trying to purchase because he did not have enough money due to the new prices.</p>
<p>"So while you think it's not a big f*cking deal, it's a huge f*cking deal," she explained.</p>
<p>Late last month, the retail chain announced the price rise, citing increased supply chain and freight costs.</p>
<p>Dollar Tree announced that it tested the price change at 100 various stores and found that about 91 percent of customers said they would still shop at Dollar Tree regardless of the 25 percent price increase.</p>
<p>The 25 cent price increase will be rolled out at Dollar Trees across the nation by the end of the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>But many customers are angry about the price increase, stating that although inflation is at a high, the company has not yet announced plans to raise employee wages.</p>
<p>"They saying 25 cent isn't a lot but if that's the case why employers won't give people a 25 cent raise..." one user mentioned in the comments.</p>
<p>Others mentioned that a 25 percent price increase is unheard of for many retail stores, regardless of the fact that the markup is only 25 cents.</p>
<p>"Use to be you could spend $21 and get 20 items," another user commented. "Now you can get 15 items for $21. That matters. So much."</p>
<p>In another <a>video viewed more than 2 million times</a>, @lilloworldwide called out Dollar Tree for announcing the price increase without "easing" customers into it.</p>
<p>"You really just went for the gold, like d*mn you could have warned a b*tch," she said in front of a sign announcing the new $1.25 sign.</p>
<p>In the comments of the video, many users mentioned that although 25 cents didn't sound like a lot, for many individuals it becomes a problem of not being able to afford groceries and other goods like they used to.</p>
<p>"That's a 25% increase in their prices meaning people who live off that also lose 25% of their budget stretch," one user commented.</p>
<p>Many mentioned that now that Dollar Tree plans on raising all item's prices to $1.25, it is potentially cheaper to purchase the items at <a>Walmart</a>.</p>
<p>"I mean y'all do realize that low-income people exist right?" @lilloworldwide replied to one comment calling her cheap for talking about the 25 cent price increase.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not about people being cheap, it's about people need these things to survive."</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Dollar Tree for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.</p>
<p>A video showing a rat scampering across a display of frozen turkeys yielded more than five million views on TikTok since it was posted last week.</p>
<p>In @dblack15's video, the rat is seen running across the turkeys before it jumps and runs on the display case. A person off-camera was holding a large garbage can near the display case.</p>
<p>"It's the big a** rats in Kroger tho," the caption on the video reads as Nardo Wick's song "Who Want Smoke??" plays in the background.</p>
<p>The piece listed some of the consequences that may occur as a result of a rodent infestation, including contaminated food, surfaces or equipment, chewed or gnawed wiring and structural damage.</p>
<p>"Health department need to come through," a TikTok commenter wrote.</p>
<p>Another posed the idea of what the store might be like when it is closed and empty.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving all the groceries," a viewer wrote. "I don't even feel like cooking anymore."</p>
<p>One suggested that this type of incident may be more common in stores than people would imagine.</p>
<p>Other viewers poked jokes at the situation.</p>
<p>"Are they vaccinated?" one asked.</p>
<p>A different commenter supposed the rodent was doing some holiday shopping.</p>
<p>"Nah he works there, just inspecting the turkey to make sure they haven't expired...He should get a raise...," another viewer commented.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to @dblack15 for further comment but did not hear back by press time.</p>
<p>"This video is disturbing, and we have taken quick action to remediate the situation, including thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the store and partnering with a local pest company," a Kroger spokesperson told Newsweek.</p>
<p>This is not the only rat that turned up in an unexpected spot.</p>
<p><a>Newsweek reported in November</a> about a viral TikTok video that shows a rat in a toilet bowl. The video was posted to @whatisnewyorkofficial's TikTok account, which features videos that were taken around New York City.</p>
<p>People near the toilet laughed while calling the rat "sir" and a "distinguished gentleman."</p>

<p>Up to 400 people with positive COVID-19 samples were mistakenly told they tested negative for the coronavirus just days before Christmas, as cases continue to surge due to the highly contagious Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The lab mistake comes as the COVID cases are skyrocketing in the U.S. and around the world during the holiday season, causing long testing lines and delays for those waiting to get their results.</p>
<p>SydPath medical director Anthony Dodds told local media the issue was due to a large volume of tests that the lab was working to process in the days leading up to the holiday.</p>
<a>reach as high as 1 million. </a>
<p>As both cases and testing rates surge, experts have warned individuals to continue exercising caution even when given a negative COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Juni, director of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Table, said people should be careful as they gather for the holiday season because the Omicron variant has proven to be "very dynamic."</p>
<a>experts have told Newsweek</a> that testing results can very depending on whether you are showing symptoms at the time.
<p>"Most of us think that repeated testing improves the performance of the test," she said. "Test the day before a gathering and the morning of the gathering. Having sequential negatives is better than one alone."</p>
<div> U.S. Omicron <a>Coronavirus</a></div>
<p>People under 30 years old are being hospitalized at higher rates than they were at this time last year and pediatric hospitals are seeing an influx in patients this winter.</p>
<p>None of the hospitalized patients in the week beginning on December 19 who were between the ages of 5 and 11 were fully vaccinated and only 23 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds who were hospitalized were fully vaccinated.</p>
<a>ABC</a> News that even if severe infection from COVID-19 remains rare in children, if cases among children increase, so will pediatric hospitalizations.
<p>Omicron has shown to be extremely infectious, reaching both the vaccinated and unvaccinated. However, experts believe that even if it is generally mild, it'll be much more likely to put unvaccinated people in the hospital.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>
<div> U.S. Vaccine <a>New York City</a> <a>Omicron</a></div>
<a>vaccine health order</a> goes into effect on Monday, meaning private sector businesses will require their workers to be
<a>fully vaccinated</a>. The mandate is expected to apply to roughly 184,000 businesses — here's what employers should know.
<p><a>According to the New York City's Department of Health</a>, businesses will need to verify their workers' proof of vaccination by the December 27 deadline.</p>
<p>Acceptable proof of vaccination includes:</p>
<li>a photo or hard copy of a <a>CDC</a> Vaccination Card</li>
<li>an NYC Vaccination Record; any other official immunization record (e.g. from a healthcare provider)</li>
<li>a CLEAR Digital Vaccine Card or CLEAR Health Pass</li>
<li>the New York State Excelsior Pass</li>
<li>a photo or hard copy of an official vaccination record of a vaccine administered outside the U.S.</li>
<p><a>Employees who cannot get vaccinated</a> due to a medical condition or sincerely held religious beliefs must apply for reasonable accommodation by Monday.</p>
<p>Businesses can also create their own paper or electronic vaccination records for employees, which includes their names and whether they are fully vaccinated, or a record of reasonable accommodation with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>For workers who have only had the first of a two-dose vaccine, the document will include the date by which they can provide proof of a second dose, which cannot be any later than 45 days after submitting proof of the first dose.</p>
<p>Businesses can also conduct daily checks of each employee's proof of vaccination prior to their entry into the workplace. Records of each verification must be kept.</p>
<p>Non-employee workers (e.g. contractors) will also need to provide vaccination proof to their employers. Businesses can ask these employers to provide their workers' proof of vaccination, and must keep records of requests and confirmations.</p>
<p>Employees who do not provide required documentation cannot be admitted into their workplace. Workers can enter a place of work for a "quick and limited time" without needing to show proof of vaccination (e.g. to use the bathroom or make a delivery.)</p>
<p>Employers should also be prepared to make the records outlined in the order available for inspection, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<a>Also starting December 27,</a> people 12 years old and older participating in certain indoor activities will be required to show proof they have received two vaccine doses, except for people who were vaccinated with a single dose of Johnson Johnson.
<p>Children aged five to 11 will need to show proof of full vaccination starting January 29, 2022.</p>
<p>On December 17, New York state <a>recorded the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic</a>, with more than 21,000 new cases reported.</p>
<p>In New York City — which saw rising Omicron-related cases — the number of children hospitalized due to COVID-19 has <a>quadrupled over the past three weeks.</a></p>

<div> <div><div> <a> <time>59 hr ago 17:58 PM EST</time> </a></div><div><h3>Live Updates Have Ended</h3> </div></div></div>
<h3>France to impose new restrictions as cases soar</h3>
<p>France will impose new restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19, French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced Monday.</p>
<p>Beginning next week, public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people indoors and 5,000 people outdoors.</p>
<p>Castex said working from home will be mandatory at least three day a week, when possible.</p>
<p>Concert-goers will be asked to sit during shows and customers will not be allowed to stand up in bars.</p>
<p>In addition, eating and drinking will not be allowed in cinemas, theaters, sport facilities and public transportation.</p>
<p>Schools will reopen on January 3, as scheduled.</p>
<p>The change comes after 100,000 COVID-19 cases were recorded in a single day across the country.</p>
<h3>FEMA made disaster assistance available for COVID-19 testing</h3>
<p>According to a White House issued memorandum, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has made available emergency and disaster assistance to get COVID-19 testing to the places that need it most.</p>
<p>The memorandum stated, the Administrator of FEMA shall issue a mission assignment to the Department of Health and Human Services on a fully reimbursable basis, to provide testing sites.</p>
<p>FEMA will also fund 100 percent of the cost of activities associated with the mission assignment.</p>
<h3>CDC shortens quarantine, isolation times</h3>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) revised its recommended isolation and quarantine periods regarding COVID-19, the agency announced Monday.</p>
<p>The CDC is reducing the recommended isolation time from 10 to 5 days for those who test positive for COVID-19, if the individual has no symptoms, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask around others.</p>
<p>The CDC is also reducing its quarantine recommendations for those who are exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<p>For individuals who are unvaccinated or not boosted, CDC recommends a 5 day quarantine followed by strict mask use for 10 additional days. Those who have received a booster shot do not need to quarantine, but should wear a mask for 10 days.</p>
<p>"CDC's updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and protection provided by vaccination and booster doses," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.</p>
<h3>Connecticut to distribute millions of at-home tests, N95 masks</h3>
<p>Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced Monday that the state will distribute 3 million at-home COVID-19 tests and 6 million N95 facemasks to residents.</p>
<p>Lamont said he expects cases to surge between Christmas and New Year's Day. According to state data, the COVID test positivity rate in Connecticut is up to 10.71 percent.</p>
<p>The first 500,000 iHealth test kits are expected to take two weeks to distribute. An additional one million test kits will be distributed to K-12 schools across Connecticut.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Department of Public Health, Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and Connecticut National Guard will oversee the distribution in coordination with local officials. Each kit contains two tests.</p>
<h3>Economists warn of global economic downturn in early 2022</h3>
<p>World economists have downgraded U.S. global growth expectations for the early part of 2022 as COVID-19 cases continue to rise.</p>
<p>With COVID raging across the world consumers are staying home to avoid getting sick causing businesses to struggle.</p>
<p>The U.K. government decided not to enforce strict restrictions after reviewing hospitalization data.</p>
<p>Health Minister Sajid Javid encouraged people to celebrated New Year's Eve outdoors if possible.</p>
<h3>U.S. health officials consider reduced quarantine times</h3>
<p>U.S. health officials are considering shorter quarantine and isolation periods for workers outside of healthcare who test positive for COVID-19, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Monday.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people in society that are essential for the smooth running of the infrastructure of our society," Dr. Fauci told ''New Day.''</p>
<p>"So the idea about cutting down the period of quarantine for people who have been exposed, and perhaps the period of isolation for people who have been infected, is something that is under, I would say, serious consideration."</p>
<p>Last week, the Centers for Disease Control <a>revised its guidance</a> for health care workers who test positive for COVID-19. Now, workers with no or mild symptoms can return to work after seven days.</p>
