<p> My mental illness (perhaps like some other people’s) is a big yarn ball of psychotic and spiritual experiences. I’m trying to tease them apart; make sense of them. </p>

<h1> Fear, Dread, and Depression Melt If You Do This </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Willingness is helping me through. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Oleg Gospodarec / Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This was a holiday with a lot of firsts and a few lasts for me and with lots of different ‘feels’.</p>
<h3>‘Firsts’ and ‘Lasts’ Bring Fear and Fun</h3>
<h3>Lessons to Keep a Snow Laden House Healthy – From a Newbie</h3>
<p>It’s the first time being on my own during a big dump of snow (the biggest British Columbia has seen in decades) and taking care of snow and icicle-laden house. Daunting only begins to capture it. But self-confidence is what has resulted.</p>
<p>The first of many practical snow lessons have been had. I learned you can:</p>
<li>prevent pipes from freezing by turning a tap on to a slow trickle</li>
<li>save your windshield wipers by raising them off the windshield before the snow comes</li>
<li>make the most of your salt by shoveling first, then sprinkling the salt</li>
<li>drive in the snow and not get stuck if you go slow, and take the long way (and you don’t even need to strangle the steering wheel with a death grip to do it)</li>
<a>attention</a> to and never needed to pay attention to these things before because my husband used to do it.
<h3>Lessening Fear and Dread By Using Gratitude</h3>
<a>anxious</a>, worried, grateful, joyful, scared, proud, loving, and loved.
<p>Today and for the past couple of days, I've been waking up with an uncomfortable amount of anxiety and <a>depression</a>. I don’t know if there ever is a ‘comfortable’ amount of anxiety.</p>
<a>fear</a>. This is a sure-fire way to help keep them alive and increase them even.
<p>I was ‘trying’ to feel them, trying to work with them. But it wasn’t until I watched <a>this video</a> by Emma McAdam, a licensed <a>Marriage</a> and Family Therapist, that I was missing a key initial ingredient: willingness.</p>
<h3>Opening to My Fear Helped Bring Calm</h3>
<p>The paradox: The more willing I am to feel and be gently curious about my unpleasant feelings, the more like they will settle and calm a bit. Not always, but often.</p>
<p>As much as I thought I was feeling my feelings, I was actually avoiding them. I’d check in with myself, in a rabid sort of way: “How’s my anxiety today? How’s my depression now? Are they worse than an hour ago?”</p>
<h3>Engage in Valued Activities that Bring Joy, Peace, and Love</h3>
<p>Engaging in those activities helps redirect my focus into positive steps and back into my life instead of my head and letting my emotions run my life.</p>
<p>Tonight, barring a power outage from heavy snow taking down electrical wires, I will do some cooking. I value <a>creativity</a> and cooking for me is creative. I’m gonna make myself a big pot of soup, a soup I’ve never made before.</p>

<a>traumas</a> they suffered, might affect our well-being.
<p>In the ancient world, when a tragedy recurred in a family line—sons murdering their fathers, suicides, madness—the cause was thought to be the workings of a curse, or fate, or the actions of punishing, vengeful gods.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The Remorse of Orestes or Orestes Pursued by the Furies (1862) by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905)</div> <div>Source: Chrysler Museum of Art/Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<blockquote> <p>“How many miseries our father caused! And is there one of them that does not fall on us while yet we live?”</p> </blockquote>
<a>depression</a>? Were there suicides? Violent behavior? Exile and
<a>anxiety</a>, depression, physical illness, or other afflictions.
<a>grief</a> I carried did not originate with me. While researching my second novel, I discovered that one of my grandmothers died in a state mental asylum. She was never mentioned during my
<a>childhood</a>, and I assume she was a source of pain and great
<a>shame</a>. No one is alive now to tell me her story, but I believe that her presence has always been with me. A character in my second novel is loosely based on her story, and through workings of my
<a>imagination</a>, grandma has been returned to her glory!

<p>During the years writing this novel, I began a period of searching and seeking, hoping to uncover, face, and resolve the hurt in my lineage. Toward the end of this time, I discovered the work of <a>Rabbi Dr. Tirzah Firestone.</a></p>
<p>As the saying goes: when the student is ready, the teacher appears.</p>
<a>career</a> investigating intergenerational trauma from
<a>spiritual</a> and psychological perspectives. She offers insight into the manifestations of inherited trauma and supplies stories and healing practices from many traditions in her online teachings. Her most recent book, Wounds into
<a>Wisdom</a>, is a guide into deep inner excavations and explorations. In a world so harshly and painfully broken, her encouragement for us to heal as individuals expands the hope that we can also heal globally.
<p>It brings me pleasure to introduce Tirzah Firestone to you in this two-part interview series.</p>
<p>Dale Kushner: Briefly, what is ancestral healing?</p>
<p>DK: Is ancestral trauma, inherited, transgenerational, and intergenerational trauma the same thing? If not, how are they different? Please clarify collective trauma.</p>
<p>TF: All of these terms are related.</p>

<a>stress</a>, anxiety, and psycho-emotional issues. The term transgenerational trauma is much the same as intergenerational trauma, used more widely in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere.

<p>Braiding memory and imagination to craft your story.</p>
<div> <h2>Writing After a Loved One Dies</h2> <p>If you’re wary of opening up a topic, such as grief, it can help to write about it. And if you place boundaries around it in your writing practice, it's less likely to leak into your day.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Working with Clay: You Can Erase Mistakes</a></h2> <p>Clay is plastic, like skin.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Do You Remember Your First Kiss?</a></h2> <p>A Personal Perspective: As he walked me home across frost-covered fields, he asked if he could kiss me. I still remember his runny nose, his red-rimmed eyes.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Creativity Doesn't Flow</a></h2> <p>Are there times creativity doesn't flow?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Meditation: In a Heartbeat</a></h2> <p>Through a stethoscope, I hear the beat. But when I am sitting quietly alone, it is more a feeling than a sound. A steady pulsing in my chest, in and out, in and out. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Calling Yourself Quirky Instead of Defective</a></h2> <p>A Personal Perspective: It's less stressful for people to view themselves as unique and quirky than defective or as if something is wrong.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Importance of Education</a></h2> <p>Good schools, good jobs. I looked good, had climbed to the top of the ladder. Too bad it was the wrong ladder. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Sitting Shiva: My Mother's Friends Loved Her Despite Her Personality</a></h2> <p>If I hadn’t written it down in real-time, I doubt that I could recall her words, the anxious, high-pitched tone that made us jump.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Nerve Endings Outside My Skin</a></h2> <p>I was born with nerve endings on the outside of my skin. But I was born into a world where most successful people seem to have nerves internally or not at all.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Walking and Musing</a></h2> <p>When musing, I sometimes think of new ways to say things.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Does Being in Nature Really Restore You?</a></h2> <p>A cornucopia of writing about gardens will help you "feel" the garden.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>He Said, She Said</a></h2> <p>Writers develop the ability to know when a line is a winner. As soon as you hear one, write it down. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Remodeling?</a></h2> <p>My home was having an identity crisis. California Japonesque meets the south of France.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Body</a></h2> <p>Artist Susan Hall espoused the virtues of clay: You can make mistakes and get rid of them. Above all, she promises “working with clay gets you out of your head.” </p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Does Water Relax You?</a></h2> <p>In the warm indoor pool, I focused on how it felt to move through the water. How would I describe the feeling? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Corporal Punishment</a></h2> <p>Do you remember a time you were spanked as a child?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>We Can Feel the Movement</a></h2> <p>We describe great settings; then, the characters move. Their actions and behaviors can convey their emotions. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Succulence</a></h2> <p>Just say a word like succulence and you move to a sensory realm. Whether you’re describing plants, food, or people, your subjects are juicy and full of life. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Rituals and Altars</a></h2> <p>I had a corner of serenity in my home. What would you put on your altar or what rituals help you start your day?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Time to Grow</a></h2> <p>Writing outside or in a garden can conjure memories.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Odors of Time and Place</a></h2> <p>The news reports that COVID-19 can eliminate taste and smell. What difference can this make in your life?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sight: A Writer's Default</a></h2> <p>Sight—visual description—is the sense to which most writers default. Asked to describe my surroundings, I write what I see, then I move into the story.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Connecting Smell and Taste</a></h2> <p>Taste may be sweet or acrid, but it’s always influenced by smell, the connection of nose and tongue. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> Writing After a Loved One Dies </h1>
<h2> Processing grief, one day at a time. </h2>
<p>Before the funeral service began, my brother, sister, and I went into the chapel to say goodbye to Dad, who lay silent in his casket.</p>
<p>“Did I make a good choice?” my brother asked. He, the child who lived closest to my parents, had had to make the arrangements. The pine box was elegant in its simplicity.</p>
<p>“It’s just what Dad would have chosen,” I said.</p>
<p>We looked over the lip of the casket, but Dad wasn’t there. Instead, we saw a hollow shell of our father in a handsome dark suit, pressed shirt and tie, his skin waxen, pumped up, and embalmed.</p>
<p>The idea of writing about a corpse may sound ghoulish or sad, but it can result in beautiful, moving writing. In this somber scene in California’s Central Valley, Jan Westerman describes the clothes they chose for her father: </p>
<p>Her thrifty father liked comfortable, practical clothes. I can see Alice rubbing the thick brown polish into the Red Wing work shoes from a round metal tin.</p>
<a>childhood</a> memories, and sometimes we don't want to write about these subjects for
<a>fear</a> of where it will take us. But if a subject comes up in your writing—whether free-flowing journaling or more formal writing—it may be time for you to work with it. When struggling with grief,
<a>trauma</a>, or painful memories, you may want to consider
<a>getting professional help</a> if it feels too big for you to deal with on your own—or you may find that writing about it actually helps you heal.

<h1>Our Emotional Footprint</h1>
<p>Celebrating the human experience.</p>
<div> <h2>Are You Religious or Spiritual? Both or Neither?</h2> <p>Archeological evidence has shown that humans have always been on a quest to understand our origins and the meanings attached to our complicated lives, just as we are now.. </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Is it Loneliness or "Only-ness"?</a></h2> <p>As a little girl, our daughter said she felt "only," as she felt this word better described her feelings than the word "lonely," to convey its isolation, sadness and solitude.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Delights and Disturbances of Dreams</a></h2> <p>We often try to interpret the meanings of our dreams. Dreams can be vivid and memorable, delightful or disturbing—and can enrich our lives.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Stories of Our Lives and 'The Human Condition' </a></h2> <p>Is "the human condition" a curse that bedevils us or a blessing bestowed upon us? Humans have considerable say in how their life stories unfold, but we need each other. </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>How to Live With Uncertainty</a></h2> <p>We live with uncertainties about our health and futures personally and with severe global crises. We have the need and intelligence to overcome, we need the impetus and motivation.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Cognitive Dissonance: True Lies and False Truths</a></h2>
<p>In addition to pandemic and global warming, people are psychologically pressured by intense conflicts about what is true or factual versus what is based on disinformation and lies.</p>
<h2><a>It Is The Best of Times, It Is The Worst of Times</a></h2>
<p>In spite of psychological stressors and social challenges, we have capacities to achieve senses of Being, Belonging, Believing and Benevolence, and a Positive Emotional Footprint.</p>
<h2><a>A Domestic Corps: Inspiring Our Youth, Enhancing Our Country</a></h2>
<p>A year-long Domestic Corps experience could be a "win-win" for post-high school adolescents and young adults while contributing to the social and infrastructure of the country.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>A Sense of Awe, and "Peak Experiences"</a></h2> <p>Most people can recall at least one extremely intense event in their lives that involved transitory but profound emotional, perceptual, and cognitive alterations.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>The Arc of Humanity Bends to Benevolence, or Belligerence? </a></h2>
<p>Our social species has advanced communally and benevolently, but we have not controlled our propensities to anger, hate, and violence: benevolence or belligerence, our yin and yang.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Pandemic Woes and Worries, Yet Wonderment</a></h2> <p>Despite the imposed hardships of the pandemic inflicted on all of us and our troubled political times, there are glimmers of optimism evinced by human creativity and resilience.</p> </div>
<h2><a>Resilience Revisited: Help Often Plays a Key Role</a></h2>
<p>I've known people who overcame severe adversities and thrived in their lives. Their stories are of pain and setbacks, courage and perseverance, but help from others was crucial.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Pleasures and Pains of Writing</a></h2> <p>Writers of opinion columns and articles have long received respectful praise or criticism, but the internet has brought forth vile personal attacks. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Gratitude for Grandparents</a></h2> <p>Grandparents are adored by grandchildren whom they can love and spoil, but they also often play crucial roles in raising children.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Canada and the United States: Different Peas in a Pod</a></h2>
<p>Canada and the U.S. share the longest peaceful border in the world, but there are differences and tensions between the two nations in the way they see society and the world.</p>
<h2><a>The Appeal of Authoritarians to Malcontents and Militants </a></h2>
<p>During times of social unrest, intense pressures, and uncertainties, many are drawn to authoritarian leaders who promise stability, security, and exclusion of unwanted others.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The 'Positive Emotional Footprint' of Mike</a></h2> <p>My father Mike's life as a child was marked by poverty and dangerous anti-Semitism. As an adult, however, he was benevolent, warm, and resilient.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>The Coronavirus Pandemic: A Needed "Course Correction?"</a></h2>
<p>When the pandemic is over, will we return to the past? Will we be unprepared for other disasters, revert to human selfishness and aggression, or will we strive to live in harmony?</p>
<div> <h2><a>The Enigma and Metaphor of Face Masks</a></h2> <p>In the midst of a pandemic, evidence that face masks are effective, and the urging of scientists, many still refuse to utilize them. Wearing them is a metaphor for civility, </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>True Believers and Conspiracy Theories</a></h2> <p>Invalid Conspiracy Theories abound now, as they have throughout history, attracting fervent True Believers. They can be transient and harmless, or deeply entrenched and dangerous. </p> </div>
<h2><a>'You Don't Know What You've Got 'Til It's Gone'</a></h2>
<p>We often felt stressed by life's pressures, even before COVID-19 inflicted dramatic losses. When we finally vanquish that viral menace, will we better appreciate our lives? </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Paradox of Quarantine: Humans Are Coming Together</a></h2> <p>An opportunity for our species? The virus has wreaked havoc, destruction, and pain, but humans are coming together to communicate, care, and commune.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a> Is Truth Trustworthy, Fact or Fake, Accurate or False? </a></h2>
<p>In our roiling world people are increasingly confused, not knowing what or whom to believe, what or who is trustworthy. Those with simplistic answers often attract true believers. </p>
<h2><a>The Complexities of Our Lives: The Past Is Prologue</a></h2>
<p>One might think that after years of diverse experiences, personal introspection, and even therapies, we would be free of old insecurities, but under duress, they can return unbidden.</p>
<h2><a>Have You Ever "Fallen in Love?" Why Isn't It Simple?</a></h2>
<p>Just about everyone has craved the experience of "falling in love," most of us have reveled in the thrill of "being in love," and many of us have endured the loss of love.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>America's Gun Culture: Infatuation, Fetish, or Curse?</a></h2> <p>Gun ownership and related deaths and injuries are stratospheric here compared to any other developed country.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Thanksgiving: For What? To Whom?</a></h2> <p>Even in times of turmoil, the symbolism of Thanksgiving—gratitude for our lives, families and friends, achievements and freedoms—is particularly meaningful.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Young True Believers: Cults or Constructive Contributions? </a></h2>
<p>Years ago youth captivated by promises of fulfillment left their families to join religious cults. Can society channel their idealism for personal growth and social betterment? </p>
<div> <h2><a>If We Humans Are So Good, Why Are We So Bad?</a></h2> <p>We humans have achieved greatly in the arts, sciences, medicine, and architecture, and in acts of communality and benevolence. We have also, however, been hateful and brutal.</p> </div>
<h2><a>My Brother Stevie: Lessons Learned from a Life in Autism</a></h2>

<h1> It Is Impossible Not to Be Judgmental </h1>
<h2> Suppressing thoughts fires up our fight-or-flight mode. </h2>
<li>Human consciousness precludes suppressing thoughts and emotions without experiencing physiological consequences.</li>
<li>You may understand that being judgmental is unkind, but it is universal and embedded in our existence.</li>
<li>Becoming “enlightened” or non-judgmental makes the problem worse, as thought suppression activates your nervous system. </li>

<sup>1</sup> Our ideals and life outlook are our version of reality.
<a>hormones</a> (adrenalin, cortisol, histamine) become elevated, you consume your body’s fuel supply to survive, and inflammatory markers become elevated. You feel agitated, but your body is under attack, and eventually, people become seriously ill.
<p>The essence of healing is learning strategies to create a state of safety, making the opposite physiology. Only in this state can you build up your reserves and heal.</p>
<p>I had my first personal insight into this phenomenon a few years ago, after emerging from severe <a>depression</a> and <a>burnout</a>. While I was deep in the abyss, I experienced an endless barrage of negative self-judgments.</p>
<a>identity</a>. My assessments of everyone else were negative, and my personal life fell apart. Of course, I blamed everyone but me. All I wanted was to have a few positive thoughts about myself—any would do.
<a>negative thinking</a>, it prevented me from experiencing the present moment.
<p>That realization was a significant shift for me. After I worked so hard to be successful and acquire things that would allow me to view myself more positively, I realized that any judgment is still judgment. They are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Yet, judgment has always been necessary for our survival to assess safety versus danger. It is impossible to stop judging. </p>
