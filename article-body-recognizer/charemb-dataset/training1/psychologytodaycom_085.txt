<h2> What Are Antioxidants? </h2>
<div> <h3> How do antioxidants work? </h3> </div>
<a>The purpose of taking antioxidants</a> is to prevent oxidation, a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals. These free radicals can damage the fats, proteins, and even
<a>DNA</a> in someone’s body, leading to severe cell damage and a host of associated problems. An antioxidant may be either produced naturally in the body or taken as a supplement.
<div> <h3> What are natural antioxidants? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Practically every cell in the human body produces Co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10), <a>a natural antioxidant,</a> also known as Ubiquinone. Other antioxidants produced internally include uric acid and glutathione.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What are flavonoids? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What food and drink contains antioxidants? </h3> </div>
<a>Chocolate is a powerful antioxidant</a>; its cocoa flavanols possess anti-inflammatory properties and help improve cognitive health.
<a>The flavonoids in red wine</a> can protect against skin damage caused by too much exposure to the sun, as well as assisting with healthy lung function.
<a>Cinnamon can protect the brain;</a> it converts to sodium benzoate in the body, assists with
<a>memory</a>, and reduces the harmful effects of aging.

<a>that taking vitamin or mineral supplements will help prevent or reduce dementia</a>.
<div> <h3> Do antioxidants fight viruses? </h3> </div>

<h3>Depression and Anxiety</h3>
<a>Depression</a> and anxiety are among the most common issues mental health practitioners encounter. Depression often presents as low mood or reduced interest and/or pleasure in doing things. Associated symptoms can include
<a>appetite</a> and/or sleep disturbance, weight change, fatigue,
<a>concentration</a> issues, hopelessness or helplessness, and
<a>suicidal</a> ideation. These symptoms have been shown to drastically impact aspects of the family such as
<a>child development</a> and the quality of the spousal relationship.
<a>socioemotional development</a>, including prosocial behaviors,
<a>self-control</a>. In other words, when a father is depressed, their child is more likely to exhibit issues with social interaction and control of their behaviors and emotions. Further, depressed men are more likely to increase
<a>family arguments</a> over time, which can exacerbate the depression. However, the research is not all doom and gloom: Generally, marital relationships have

<p>Acute trauma reflects intense distress in the immediate aftermath of a one-time event and the reaction is of short duration. Common examples include a car crash, physical or sexual assault, or the sudden death of a loved one.</p>
<p>Chronic trauma can arise from harmful events that are repeated or prolonged. It can develop in response to persistent bullying, neglect, abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual), and domestic violence.</p>

<h2> Treatment for Trauma </h2>
<p>Left unaddressed or untreated, trauma can undermine relationships and wreak havoc on personal and professional lives. There are multiple avenues of treatment available for people experiencing from short- or long-term trauma symptoms. </p>
<p>Lifestyle changes are an early treatment option to consider. Eating healthy, exercising, avoiding alcohol and drugs, getting enough sleep, seeing loved ones regularly, and emphasizing self-care can help relieve trauma symptoms.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help a person build resilience, develop coping skills, and address unresolved feelings that are keeping them stuck. Exposure therapy and cognitive reappraisal therapy are two of the more reliable treatments for trauma and PTSD. </p>
<p>Ketamine (special K) may also be used to expedite recovery. It is injected under a therapist’s supervision prior to a talk therapy session. Research has shown it to be effective. </p>

<h1> Beyond New Year’s Resolutions: Power in Pursuit </h1>
<h2> Focusing on each leg of the journey. </h2>
<li>The power of pursuit taps the power of tools in your journey rather than outcome goals set too far on the horizon.</li>
<li>Tap your fuel, or motivation, for steady pursuit and use specificity in daily action targets to stay on your path.</li>
<li>The balanced critique offers you powerful, nonjudgmental guidance to keep you from running off the road.</li>
<p>We all know the drill. On January 1st, the resolutions get trotted out: a healthier lifestyle, a better job, a new relationship. We declare our biggest goals for the future. It’s just what we do at the top of the year, right?</p>
<p>So at the top of this year, I want to continue that metaphor of a road trip to talk about a slightly different way of setting off on that journey.</p>
<p>1. The Fuel—Tapping Into Your <a>Motivation</a></p>
<p>First off, we need to take your big vision and find the smaller motivation to tap into each day. You can think of this as the fuel for your journey.</p>
<a>meditation</a>, music, imagery, journaling—all that matters is that they are making contact with that larger dream.
<p>These small check-ins are the fueling stops we need to make it to the indicator on our journey…</p>
<p>2. The Road Signs—Your Two Actions For the Day</p>
<p>How you decide on those actions is the third step of the process.</p>
<p>3. The Steering—A Non-Judgmental <a>Balanced Critique</a></p>
<p>A balanced critique is designed to be non-judgmental. It asks you to consider only two elements of that day’s pursuit:</p>
<p>What is one specific thing you did and want to keep doing?</p>
<p>What is one specific thing you want to do differently?</p>
<p>One thing to keep doing: prepare three snacks for after my runs on Sunday.</p>
<p>One thing to do differently: add another five minutes of stretching after my run.</p>
<p>These two actions then “steer” them into their journey for the following day. This loop can be repeated for as long as you’re in pursuit of a larger goal.</p>
<p>As E.L. Doctorow said about the writing process, “Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” The same is true for your own big 2022 goals.</p>

<p>Punishment has its place—but the ability to rise above baser instincts and judge each situation objectively, and with an eye toward fairness, is one of the highest achievements of humanity and of civilization.</p>
<h2> Disciplining Children </h2>
<p>In February 2019, the American Psychological Association (APA) published a statement against spanking and other corporal punishment for children, citing these very reasons.</p>
<div> <h3> Can I spank my child to discipline them? </h3> </div>
<a>When parents spank kids,</a> they risk contributing to long-term problems such as antisocial behavior and
<a>anxiety</a>. Spanking undermines the parent-child bond and can increase aggression. It may also make someone more likely to use physical punishment on their own kids one day.
<div> <h3> Why is physical punishment bad for children? </h3> </div>
<a>self-esteem</a>, poor relationships with parents, and cognitive issues.
<div> <h3> What are some better discipline alternatives to physical punishment? </h3> </div>

<h2> Deterrence and Crime </h2>
<a>crime</a>” position that favors punishment over rehabilitation, for instance, has arguably contributed to an overpopulated prison system with high rates of recidivism.
<div> <h3> Why does punishment exist? </h3> </div>
<a>punishing others</a> you observe committing a violation, even if it was not against you—also helps to reinforce moral norms.
<div> <h3> What are the four primary theories of punishment? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is punishment effective against crime? </h3> </div>
<a>punishment doesn’t necessarily stop crime.</a> Many people who commit crimes are struggling with poverty,
<a>addiction</a>, or mental illnesses that cannot be treated with bigger jails and harsher sentences. In fact, approximately 70 percent of offenders are arrested again within five years of their release from prison.
<h2> The Difference Between Punishment and Revenge </h2>
<p>The distinction between punishment and revenge often lies in the methods or motivations behind people's actions, or in the perceived similarity between the inciting offense and the resulting consequence.</p>
<div> <h3> If you wrong someone, are they likely to seek revenge? </h3> </div>
<a>will never forgive you.</a> Even then, most people are not inclined to actively seek vengeance. However, if someone is high in Dark Triad traits (i.e.,
<a>Machiavellianism</a>), then they are more likely to plot and pursue revenge.
<div> <h3> Can revenge be just or otherwise justified? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do you punish a cheating partner? </h3> </div>
