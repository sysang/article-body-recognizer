<a>anxious</a> and defensive because you reinforce an atmosphere of
<a>openness</a> and mutual respect by showing that you hear them. Your partner doesn’t have to be afraid of saying the wrong thing because you show that you won’t commit a rush to judgment.
<h3>10 Qualities of the Good Listener</h3>
<p>All of this is well and good, you may think, but what exactly are the markers of a good listener? Can you think of the behaviors that signify you’re being understood, validated, and cared for by someone you consider a good listener?</p>
<p>These ten qualities fall into the two categories of verbal and nonverbal behaviors and are as follows along with explanations of each: </p>
<p>Verbal: Showing that you understand what the person is saying.</p>
<li>Reflections: Paraphrase what the other person is saying to show you get the meaning.</li>
<li>Open question: Ask questions that don’t have a simple “yes” or “no” answer to keep the conversation flowing.</li>
<li>Validation: Reinforce what the person is saying by indicating you understand.</li>
<li>Utterances: Use simple words that encourage the other person to keep speaking (e.g., uh-huh, okay).</li>
<li>Use the speaker’s name: help the person feel more valued by repeating their name at various points in the conversation or when you want to show you hear them.</li>
<p>Nonverbal: Behaviors that indicate you’re paying <a>attention</a>.</p>
<li>Facial expressions: Allow your face to convey interest, empathy, and curiosity.</li>
<li>Head nodding: Occasionally nod along with what the person is saying, especially at important points in the conversation.</li>
<li>Body posture: Orient your position to show you’re paying attention by allowing your body to turn towards the other person.</li>
<li>Gaze: Maintain eye contact with the speaker and don't look distractedly elsewhere.</li>
<li>Silence: Stay quiet and don't interrupt the other person or seem too eager to break in.</li>
<p>It’s pretty easy to nod your head and even easier to use the other person’s name. However, showing that you are not only paying attention but also comprehending may take some practice.</p>

<h1> There’s a Problem With Deception in Psychology </h1>
<h2> Thought-provoking paper shines light on the darker side of psychology research. </h2>
<li>Those who like reading about psychological research may be surprised to find out how many studies don't adhere to ethical standards.</li>
<li>The Milgram experiments were only the first of hundreds of psychological studies that used deception to obtain their findings.</li>
<li>According to a 2021 paper, deception should only be used when there is no alternative according to basic psychological ethics.</li>

<a>deception</a> could have long-lasting consequences for those who thought they were enacting cruel and almost inhumane
<h3>Deception and the Ethics Codes of Psychological Research</h3>
<h3>How Often Is Deception Used in Psychology, and Why?</h3>
<p>Consider cheating. In a study involving deception, participants believed they were interacting with a real person but were instead paired up against a pre-set computerized program that presented them with an opportunity to lie but not get caught.</p>
<p>In a study of prosocial behavior, similarly, a person had an opportunity to act cooperatively or competitively with a simulated person or a person acting in accordance with the experimenter's instructions. </p>
<h3>What Does This Mean for the Consumer of Research on Psychology?</h3>
<p>To sum up, there’s a great deal of value in learning about deception as it affects your own personal life. In addition, learning how the field can more responsibly deal with research on this fascinating topic can only add to that value.</p>

<h1> Four Ways to Take Your Happiness to the Next Level </h1>
<h2> New research tests a four-pronged approach to dialing up your happiness. </h2>
<li>People often restrict their ability to get the most out of even the most positive experiences in life.</li>
<li>New research tests a four-step model for learning how to change the way you process events that have the potential to make you happier.</li>
<li>Try going through the four steps of experiencing, enriching, absorbing, and maximizing the next time something good happens to you.</li>
<p>Even if you’re not given to chronic fretting, it’s possible to drift away from a pleasant experience by being unable to jump deeply enough into it. Once the drifting begins, it may seem almost impossible to stop. Or is it?</p>

<a>psychotherapy</a> and personal growth programs that can help people to become active agents in building “durable inner resources.”
<p>Hanson maintained that the kind of learning that takes place is based on changes occurring at the <a>neural</a> level; in other words, your brain literally changes as it gains information from the positive experience.</p>
<p>The HEAL model breaks down into these four steps:</p>
<p>Step One: Have the enjoyable experience. You can do this by actually going through the experience or by mentally conjuring it up such as thinking about someone who cares about you.</p>
<p>Step Two: Enrich the experience through these sub-steps:</p>
<li>Make the experience as long-lasting as possible, keeping it active in your consciousness by staying with it.</li>
<li>Intensify the experience through “up-regulating” your emotions, or reliving the parts that feel good.</li>
<li>Focus on multiple aspects of the experience, including its meaning, your perceptions and sensations, the way it feels, and taking action such as closing your eyes or sitting in a relaxed posture.</li>
<li>Increase the novelty of the experience so that it sticks out more in your mind- this might include having a "new" thought, such as noticing that someone cares about you.</li>
<li>Heighten the personal relevance of the experience by delving into your feelings about it.</li>
<p>Step Three: Absorb the experience, a process involving these sub-steps:</p>
<ul><li>Make a deliberate effort to internalize it so that it feels like a part of you.</li> <li>Turn <a>attention</a> inward to your emotional state.</li> <li>Highlight the reward value of the experience.</li> </ul>
<p>Step Four: Link positive and negative material.</p>

<p>Additionally, as the authors pointed out, the course may have moved too quickly at the beginning of each session when participants were at the point of switching gears from their everyday lives.</p>

<a>gender</a>. They were instructed to recall a time they offended someone and provide basic information about them.
<p>All participants completed an 11-item empathy measure assessing how they felt while writing their apology. Undergraduate research assistants rated the comprehensiveness and defensiveness of the apologies.</p>
<h3>How to Offer an Apology That Will Work</h3>
<p>The first conclusion you can draw from the University of Pittsburgh study is that the best way to make sure your apology works is to put yourself directly into the place of the person you offended.</p>
<p>The specific instructions in the high empathy condition of Study 3 can provide a guide (“RD” in this case, is the hypothetical offended party):</p>
<p>When thinking about what you would say, we would again like you to try to focus on how RD feels about the event. Try to put yourself in RD’s shoes, imagining how this event has affected RD and how he or she feels as a result.</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple exercise, only requiring you to pause and reflect on the other person’s inner state.</p>
<p>Next, looking at the qualities included in ratings of state empathy in these studies here is a range of emotions you can try to generate: warm, compassionate, softhearted, and concerned. See if you can come up with these feelings.</p>
<p>Finally, see if your apology covers the full range of qualities that will make it comprehensive using these criteria: remorse, accepting responsibility, admitting wrongdoing, requesting forgiveness, desire for repair, and acknowledging harm.</p>

<a>ADHD</a> appears early in life. It is estimated that 5 percent of school-age children and 2.5 percent of the adult population are diagnosed with ADHD, according to the
<a>DSM-5</a>. Boys are diagnosed twice as often as girls. Teens with ADHD have difficulty sitting still and paying attention in class and may not do well in school, even when they have normal or above average
<a>intelligence</a>. More than half of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to have symptoms during
<a>adolescence</a> and adulthood. Symptoms of ADHD can be treated effectively with a combination of
<a>therapy</a>. When left untreated, however, ADHD can have long-term adverse effects on academic performance, vocational success, relationships, and social-emotional development.
<a>personality disorder</a>. The teen should have exhibited several of these symptoms prior to age 12.
<p>Symptoms of inattention include:</p>
<li>Making careless mistakes, overlooking details</li>
<li>Difficulty remaining focused on tasks or conversations</li>
<li>Being easily distractible</li>
<li>Difficulty following through on instructions or assignments</li>
<li>Difficulty organizing tasks and activities</li>
<li>Avoidance or refusal of activities that require sustained <a>attention</a> (reports, forms, papers)</li>
<li>Losing things frequently</li>
<li>Being forgetful of daily activities (appointments, chores)</li>
<p>Children with the inattentive type of ADHD, characterized by the symptoms above, are less disruptive and are often not diagnosed.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Hyperactivity and Impulsivity include:</p>
<li>Frequent fighting, squirming, tapping</li>
<li>Often leaving seat when remaining seated is expected</li>
<li>Feeling overly restless</li>
<li>Difficulty being still for an extended period of time</li>
<li>Difficulty engaging in leisure activities </li>
<li>Preemptively blurting out answers to questions</li>
<li>Difficulty waiting for a turn</li>
<li>Intruding or interrupting others</li>
<p>The combined inattentive/hyperactivity type of ADHD displays equal, predominant symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. This is the most common type of ADHD among children and adolescents.</p>
<p>The predominantly inattentive type displays symptoms of inattention but fewer than six hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.</p>
<p>The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type displays criteria for hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms but fewer than six inattentive symptoms.</p>
<a>intelligence</a> tests, measures of attention span, and parent and teacher rating scales. A medical exam by a physician is also important. A doctor may look for allergies or
<a>nutrition</a> problems like chronic caffeine highs that might make the teen seem overly active. The assessment may also include interviews with the teen's teachers, parents, and other people who know the teen well.
<p>Behavior during free play or while getting individual attention is given less importance in the evaluation. In such situations, most teens with ADHD are able to control their behavior and perform well.</p>

<a>substance abuse</a>, conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, found that
<a>teenagers</a> with ADHD who remained on their medication as teens had a lower likelihood of substance use or abuse than did adolescents with ADHD who were not taking medications.
<a>Antidepressants</a> and other medications can help control accompanying depression or anxiety.
<p>Side Effects of the Medications</p>
<a>insomnia</a>, increased anxiety, and/or irritability. Some report mild stomachaches or headaches.
<p>Appetite seems to fluctuate, usually being low during the middle of the day and more normal by suppertime. Adequate amounts of nutritional food should be available for the teen, especially at peak appetite times.</p>
<p>A few develop tics during treatment. Changing the medication dosage can often lessen these.</p>
<p>A very few cannot tolerate any stimulant, no matter how low the dosage. In such cases, the teen is often given an antidepressant instead of the stimulant.</p>
<p>Behavioral therapy, emotional counseling, and practical support will help ADHD teens cope with everyday problems and feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>Facts to Remember About Medication for ADHD</p>
<li>Medications for ADHD help many children and teens focus and be more successful at school, home, and play. Avoiding negative experiences now may actually help prevent addictions and other emotional problems later.</li>
<li>About 80 percent of children who need medication for ADHD still need it as teenagers.</li>
<li>Over 50 percent need medication as adults.</li>
<p>Several intervention approaches are available.</p>
<p>Structured situations may help teens with ADHD:</p>
<li>Limiting distractions in the environment</li>

<li>Helping the teen divide a large task into small steps if the teen has trouble completing tasks, and then praising the teen as each step is completed</li>
<p>It is beneficial for parents to use <a>stress</a> management methods, such as <a>meditation</a>, relaxation techniques, and exercise to increase their own tolerance for frustration so that they can respond more calmly to their teen's behavior.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has provided guidelines for treating children and teens with ADHD.</p>
<li>Set specific target <a>goals</a> to guide therapy</li>
<li>Medication and/or behavior therapy should be started</li>
<li>When treatment plan has not met target goal, re-evaluate the original diagnosis, the possibility of other conditions, and how well the treatment plan has been implemented</li>
<li>Systematically follow up; regularly reassess target goals, results, and any side effects of medications. Information should be gathered from parents, teachers, and the child/teen.</li>
<p>You are your teen's best advocate. To advocate for your teen, learn as much as you can about ADHD and how it affects your teen at home, in school, and in social situations.</p>
<p>ADHD Teens: Right to a Free Public Education</p>
<li>The student must be diagnosed with ADHD by either the school district or a qualified professional</li>
<li>The severity of ADHD must increase the student's sensitivity to his or her surroundings and impair alertness to academic tasks</li>
<li>The effects of ADHD must have a significant impact and/or be a long-standing condition</li>
<li>ADHD must impair educational achievement in a manner that requires special educational services</li>
<p>Private schools are required to facilitate participation in educational and other activities. However, they are not required to provide remedial services to improve skills in an area of disability.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Learning Disability</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions that can affect one's experience at school or work or in social situations. Multiple learning disabilities overlap in some people.</p>
<p>Some specific categories of learning disabilities include:</p>
<li>Dyslexia, which causes difficulties with word recognition, spelling, and comprehension</li>
<li>Dysgraphia, which results in impaired handwriting, impaired spelling, or both</li>
<li>Dyscalculia, which affects the ability to learn arithmetic and mathematics</li>
<li><a>Nonverbal Learning Disorder</a>, marked by trouble receiving and interpreting nonverbal forms of communication such as <a>body language</a> and facial expressions</li>
<li>Apraxia of speech, which involves difficulty saying what one intends to say</li>
<li>Central Auditory Processing Disorder, which involves difficulty with recognizing and interpreting sounds</li>
<a>memory</a> of such information.
<p>Language-related learning disabilities are problems that interfere with age-appropriate communication, including speaking, listening, reading, spelling, and writing.</p>
<a>DSM-5</a>, Specific Learning Disorder is characterized by one or more difficulties in learning and using academic skills. The difficulty lasts at least six months despite interventions aimed at addressing it and can include difficulty with:
<li>Reading (the individual may read inaccurately or slowly and with effort)</li>
<li>Understanding the meaning of what is read</li>
<li>Understanding numbers or calculation</li>
<li>Mathematical reasoning</li>
<a>intelligence</a>—and are also not accounted for by other disorders, uncorrected vision or hearing, psychological adversity, or inadequate instruction or knowledge of the language used to teach.
<p>Symptoms can range from mild—involving difficulty in one or two domains that is responsive to accommodations or support—to severe, where an individual is unlikely to learn the affected skills without intensive, individualized teaching.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the prevalence of learning disabilities? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>According to the DSM-5, 5 to 15 percent of school-age children across different cultures are affected by a learning disorder limiting them in reading, writing, or mathematics.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>While the causes of learning disabilities are not fully understood, a number of risk factors have been identified. </p>
<a>sibling</a> has one. The increased risk is four to eight times greater for a reading disorder and five to 10 times greater for a math-related disorder, according to the DSM-5.
<div> <h3> Are there other factors that can increase the risk of learning disabilities? </h3> </div>
<a>pregnancy</a>, and severe deficits in
<a>nutrition</a> or exposure to lead during infancy.
<p>Treatment may also involve the services of therapists who specialize in particular domains, such as speech and language. In some cases, medications may be used to increase a child's ability to focus.</p>

<a>goals</a> or responsibilities, and can set them on a downward spiral of negative emotions that further deter future effort.
<p>Procrastination also involves a degree of <a>self-deception</a>: At some level, procrastinators are aware of their actions and the consequences, but changing their habits requires even greater effort than completing the task in front of them.</p>
<h2> Understanding Procrastination </h2>
<div> <h3> Why do I procrastinate? </h3> </div>
<a>we do not believe we’ll enjoy doing them</a>, and want to avoid making ourselves unhappy, or we
<a>fear</a> that we won’t do them well. People may also procrastinate when they are confused by the complexity of a task (such as filing one’s taxes) or when they’re overly distracted or fatigued.
<div> <h3> What are the psychological roots of procrastination? </h3> </div>
<a>anxiety</a>, a lack of structure, and, simply,
<a>an inability to motivate oneself</a> to complete unpleasant tasks. Research has also shown that procrastination is
<a>closely linked to rumination</a>, or becoming fixated on negative thoughts.
<div> <h3> Does procrastination serve any purpose? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are we so sure we’ll actually do something later? </h3> </div>
<a>affective forecasting</a>, and people tend be fairly bad at it. For example, procrastinators may feel bad about not having exercised today, but they may raise their mood by
<a>predicting they will do it tomorrow</a>. Thus, they avoid feeling negative emotions in the moment, but make the cycle more likely to repeat.
<div> <h3> Who is most likely to procrastinate? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do teens procrastinate? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> The Consequences of Procrastination </h2>
<a>insomnia</a> or immune system and gastrointestinal disturbance. Procrastination can also jeopardize both personal and professional relationships.
<div> <h3> Is procrastination bad for my health? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is there a link between procrastination and depression? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>. People with depression may struggle to plan ahead, lose confidence in their ability to follow through, and adopt
<a>“what’s the point” thinking</a>. The treatment approach known as behavioral activation, in which one schedules enjoyable activities that provide a sense of mastery or accomplishment, may help alleviate some of these effects.
<div> <h3> Can procrastinators have successful relationships with non-procrastinators? </h3> </div>
<h2> How to Beat Procrastination </h2>
<a>therapy</a> is one approach that has worked for many. In the short term, some cognitive tricks can help people complete discrete tasks.
<div> <h3> How can I stop procrastinating? </h3> </div>
<a>build in time for delay, but not too much</a>; making a personal challenge out of mundane tasks; breaking large jobs into achievable chunks you can celebrate completing; and limiting your access to online news and social media.
<div> <h3> How can a procrastinator change their mindset? </h3> </div>
<a>empathy for one’s future self</a> as one would for a close friend, then, can be an important first step to ending the habit, because we’re less willing to put a good friend in such a disadvantaged position.
<div> <h3> How can I stop putting off important decisions? </h3> </div>
<a>decision-making</a> rules, or
<a>outsourcing some decisions</a> to a partner, friend, or co-worker may help overcome decision fatigue.
<div> New research identifies a key brain region involved with procrastination and suggests how to manage emotions to reduce procrastination and cope when we do put things off. </div>
