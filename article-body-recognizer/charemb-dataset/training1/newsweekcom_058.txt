<header><div> <a>Analysis</a></div><h1>Fourth Stimulus Check: 3 Reasons Why it Won't Happen</h1><div> By Jacob Jarvis <time>On 7/7/21 at 10:11 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>While there is plenty of public desire for further stimulus check payments, economic circumstances and the state of the fight against COVID-19 make the prospect of another round increasingly unlikely.</p>
<a>has hit 2.5 million signatures</a>, and previously there has been
<a>support from some lawmakers</a>—
<a>including Vice President Kamala Harris herself</a> when she was a senator—for recurring payments.
<p>However, though some lawmakers have backed more stimulus checks there is also major hesitance from others—particularly among the GOP—over mounting spending.</p>
<p>The last round of stimulus checks, for example, was part of the American Rescue Plan which only passed through reconciliation. <a>No Republican lawmakers voted for its passage</a>.</p>
<p>Below, Newsweek looks at three key reasons why further checks may not be sent.</p>
<p>The unprecedented levels of spending through previous packages have been made in the face of a similarly unprecedented economic situation. Lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic saw businesses suffer massively, with job numbers plummeting as a result.</p>
<a>June jobs report</a>, for example, showed nonfarm payrolls rising by 850,000, though the unemployment rate did rise to 5.9 percent. That is still well down from the 14.7 percent at its pandemic peak.
<p>Economists have also predicted a "hiring boom," <a>as previously reported by Newsweek</a>.</p>
<p>Such a prospect weakens the arguments for another round of checks, as do the various economic forecasts of a formidable run of U.S. GDP growth as it exits the pandemic. The economy is going in the right direction again.</p>
<p>The major factor in the steady return to normalcy has been the vaccine rollout. President <a>Joe Biden</a> harked to this while commenting on June's jobs report.</p>
<p>"This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic," he said last Friday.</p>
<p><a>Biden missed his target</a> of 70 percent of adults having received one vaccine dose by July 4. Still, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures show that 67.1 percent of those over 18 in the United States have had one dose.</p>
<p>The nation continues to proceed with some caution as <a>variants are prompting a rise in cases in some areas</a>. But vaccinating more than two-thirds of American adults marks a major step in the return to life as it was pre-pandemic.</p>
<a>Pfizer vaccine</a>, in particular, may be less effective at preventing people from catching the Delta variant. But it also appears to remain largely effective at preventing serious symptoms or hospitalizations from it.
<p>July Fourth celebrations, for example, were a clear contrast to last year—with people able to gather in a way that was not possible during the worst moments of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Biden used this example of people coming back together as a means to <a>encourage more people to get vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>Such a shift back to life as it was is likely to see the nation's, and thus individuals', economic fortunes improve—in contrast to the previous plunges which saw lawmakers rally behind relief measures.</p>
<p>The composition of the <a>Senate</a> also presents another hurdle to <a>more stimulus checks</a>. Democratic lawmakers have been <a>the main advocates</a> of new checks, while <a>Republicans</a> have largely been hesitant of more federal outlays.</p>
<p>The <a>Democratic</a> majority in the House is slim but it would feasibly be strong enough for legislation proposing a fourth round of stimulus checks to pass the lower chamber.</p>
<p>However, the Senate is much trickier. The upper chamber is split 50-50, with Democrats able to produce a majority in tie-break situations with the vice president's deciding vote.</p>
<p>But to avoid a filibuster effort from the Republicans, 60 votes in the upper chamber are needed. While some Democrats have suggested eliminating the filibuster, there is firm <a>resistance to this within their own caucus</a>.</p>
<p>Given the backlash against the Democrats' desired spending last time out, it looks unlikely 10 Republicans in the upper chamber would get on board with another round of checks.</p>
<a>questioned the breadth of eligibility for the checks</a> in the past.
<p>The Democrats were only able to avoid the filibuster by using reconciliation last time out, an act that enraged the GOP who bemoaned such a move following Biden's calls for bipartisanship.</p>
<p>Reconciliation—which the Democrats cannot use limitlessly—still requires a majority vote and, after Manchin's earlier reluctance over the previous round of checks, it is not clear that the Democratic caucus is unanimous on a fourth payment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Democratic priority is currently infrastructure. They may end up using the reconciliation process this year on Biden's vast infrastructure package, which currently does not include spending on a fourth stimulus check.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's full-throated support for large anti-government protests in Cuba appears to have scuppered Havana's hopes of an Obama-style detente between the two nations.</p>
<p>The Biden Administration is also maintaining its predecessor <a>Donald Trump</a>'s confrontational stance on Venezuela and China, two of Cuba's closest allies.</p>
<p>The president broke his silence on the Cuba protests on Monday after criticism from pro-regime change <a>Republicans</a> suggesting the president and his top officials had been too slow to comment on the wave of demonstrations sweeping the island.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Biden said he would reverse policies on Cuba that "have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights."</p>
<p>Cuban leaders have dismissed the protests as a foreign plot to undermine the government. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a televised address Monday that protesters were "counter-revolutionaries" and "completely vulgar" in their demonstrations.</p>
<p>"The approach wasn't peaceful yesterday," Diaz-Canel said, though acknowledged "it's legitimate to feel dissatisfaction" given recent food shortages and blackouts—which he blamed on the U.S. blockade—and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>All three also have ties to Russia and Iran, two nations whose foreign policy ambitions unsettle Americans on both sides of the aisle. Both Beijing and Caracas had hoped that Biden's election would ease Trump-era tensions.</p>
<p>Top Chinese officials warned the incoming Biden team that conflict between the world's two largest economies would be a "disaster," and urged cooperation while warning the White House to stay out of Chinese domestic affairs.</p>
<p>But a fractious summit between the top American and Chinese diplomats in Anchorage, Alaska in March set the tone for the Biden Administration's approach to Beijing.</p>
<p>National security adviser <a>Jake Sullivan</a> added: "We do not seek conflict but we welcome stiff competition, and we will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."</p>
<p>Chinese officials dismissed the criticism. "It was the United States who provoked and provoked the dispute first," said China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian.</p>
<p>"When the members of the Chinese delegation arrived in Alaska, they not only felt the cold weather in Alaska, but also felt the hospitality of the American host," he added.</p>
<p>"Under your leadership and in coalition with civil society leaders you are preserving those ideals of freedom, democracy and sovereignty," Biden wrote in the letter addressed sent through the Office of Venezuelan Affairs in Colombia, AFP reported.</p>
<p>A senior White House official told Reuters in May that Maduro had been "sending signals" to the new administration, hoping to ease crippling sanctions.</p>
<p>"We are monitoring those developments very closely," the official said. "We are seeing that Maduro is sending signals but again we're going to act based on really concrete actions."</p>
<p>In February, a White House official told Reuters the administration was in "no rush" to relax Trump's tough sanctions on Venezuela.</p>
<p>In June, Maduro appealed directly to Biden to end the "demonization of Venezuela" and lift sanctions.</p>
<p>But a State Department spokesperson later told <a>Bloomberg</a> that the pressure would not be eased as long as "repression and corrupt practices" by Maduro and his supporters continue.</p>
<p>With Cuba as with Venezuela and China, Biden appears in no hurry to break from Trump's hawkish and sanctions-led foreign policy playbook.</p>
