<p>Study 1: A sample of 95 German participants; 38% female; average age of 42 years (range of 20 to 69 years); over half with 12/13 years of schooling.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate, on a personality measure created for this investigation, their own personality traits and the traits of an ideal politician to “lead the country and ensure that the population is doing well.”</p>
<p>Study 2: A sample of 631 Austrians (91% citizens); 50% female; average age of 42 years (16 to 74 years); 28% with college degrees.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to rate their own personality and the personality of an ideal politician. The personality measure used was a version of the <a>Big Five </a>(<a>five-factor model</a> of personality).</p>
<p>Ideology was also assessed in terms of <a>right-wing authoritarianism</a> (e.g., <a>openness</a> vs. resistance to change) and social dominance orientation (e.g., acceptance vs. rejection of social inequality).</p>

<h2> How Motivated Reasoning Works </h2>
<div> <h3> What causes motivated reasoning? </h3> </div>
<a>motivation</a>; there is an intended purpose underlying those decisions. Yet those goals sometimes conflict with each other. The process of balancing and prioritizing competing goals can determine the reasoning we use, which often
<a>results in motivated reasoning</a>.
<div> <h3> Which biases can affect decision making? </h3> </div>
<a>bias</a> refers to a systematic error in the thinking process, of which there are many. For example, confirmation bias involves favoring ideas that confirm preexisting beliefs. The
<p><a>Other common biases</a> <a>include the hindsight bias, the negativity bias, the sunk cost fallacy, the decline bias, the backfire effect, the fundamental attribution error, the in-group bias, and the Barnum effect.</a></p>
<div> <h3> What is confirmation bias? </h3> </div>
<p>An example of <a>confirmation bias</a> can sometimes be found in <a>anxious</a> individuals; someone highly sensitive to rejection may interpret ambiguous social cues as confirming their belief that no one likes them.</p>
<div> <h3> What is cognitive dissonance? </h3> </div>
<a>cheat on</a> a test, that would
<a>create cognitive dissonance</a> that you might then try to reason your way out of. Motivated reasoning can function to reduce cognitive dissonance. 
<div> <h3> Why do people believe in conspiracy theories? </h3> </div>
<a>psychological factors that drive conspiracy theories</a> include the desire for understanding and certainty, the desire to maintain a positive self-image, the desire for control and security.
<a>global warming</a> is a hoax, I can maintain my current way of living.” This is an example of motivated reasoning.

<h2> How to Think Critically </h2>
<div> <h3> Can I counteract motivated reasoning? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I improve my critical thinking skills? </h3> </div>
<p>Several <a>tips can help you cultivate critical thinking</a> daily: </p>
<p>1. Save critical thinking for things that matter—prioritize the investment in time and effort for decisions with important consequences.</p>
<p>2. Think critically in the morning—otherwise, decision fatigue can set in.</p>
<p>3. Take a step back—take time to reflect on your knowledge and its limits.</p>
<p>4. Play devil’s advocate—identify four compelling points for and against a given position.</p>
<p>5. Remove your emotions—strong emotions can be persuasive.</p>
<div> <h3> How can society combat misinformation? </h3> </div>
<a>falling prey to conspiracy theories</a>.
<div> <h3> Can we prevent artificial intelligence from developing biases? </h3> </div>
<a>reduce biases in artificial intelligence.</a> One recent model, for example, incorporates steps to detect, audit, and eliminate algorithmic biases.

<h2> We all negotiate, whether with our political opponents, friends, or family. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Free-Photos, heblo, Chickenonline/Pixabay (Modifications: Arash Emamzadeh)</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Negotiation is a big part of life. </p>
<p>For instance, you negotiate with your boss for a higher salary or more fair distribution of the workload, with a car dealer or home seller for a better price, and—the most difficult of all—with your little one about eating broccoli.</p>
<a>tweeted</a>, “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” Is that true? Is it possible to win every negotiation? In today’s post, I look at the psychology of negotiation.
<a>joint decision making process involving interactive communication</a>” (p. 1080).
<p>To negotiate is to choose the path of communication (not violence or war) to reach an agreement and get what you want. </p>
<p>When faced with interpersonal conflict, we may, depending on our conflict <a>management</a> style, choose one of<a> five approaches to negotiation</a> (see Figure 1):<sup>2</sup></p>
<li><a>Competition</a> or domination of the other side (I win, you lose).</li>
<li>Avoidance (you and I both lose).</li>
<li>Accommodating or obliging the other (I lose, you win).</li>
<li><a>Collaboration</a> or integration (you win and I win).</li>
<li>Compromise (we both win some and lose some).</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Rahim, 1983)</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We are more likely to choose accommodation and collaboration when we value a relationship highly; we choose avoidance and competition when we do not.</p>
<p>So, how can we increase the likelihood that we negotiate successfully?</p>
<p>Research on the psychology of negotiation has uncovered some important principles. According to Fisher and Ury, a <a>successful negotiation</a> occurs when we focus on interests, problems, produce many options, and utilize objective criteria:</p>
<a>anger</a> and resentment. The real issues are often related not to positions but to the conflicts “between each side's needs, desires, concerns, and fears” (p. 40).
<sup>4</sup> For instance, a complex conflict between you and a real estate developer next door might really be about your need for quiet and the developer’s need for money.
<a>respect their autonomy and status</a>, and be
<a>mindful</a> of the roles they (and you) are playing in the negotiations.
<a>creativity</a>, set aside some time to come up with a variety of mutually beneficial solutions before working on reaching an agreement.
<p>4. Use objective criteria: To prevent a negotiator from getting advantageous results by simply being very stubborn, make sure the final agreement reflects an objective standard that does not depend only on the will of the parties.<sup>4</sup></p>
<a>friendship</a> vs. hostility). Instead, principled negotiation encourages the participants to see themselves as collaborating problem-solvers who are trying to pick solutions from many mutually beneficial options.
<a>second favorite book, after the Bible</a>—Trump claims he loves to make deals and is very good at it. But Trump appears to be a
<a> win-lose negotiator</a>, and so far his aggressive tactics have failed to bring Iran to the negotiating table and may have made things worse. Biden may have better chances.
<a>conflict is not an inevitable outcome</a> of a clash of interests.”
<p>The same is true in non-political negotiations. You do not need to ignore your interests in order to avoid a high-conflict relationship. You simply need to learn how to negotiate successfully and put your knowledge into practice.</p>

<h2> The most carefully crafted incentives, from cash rewards to social props, routinely backfire. What does it really take to get people to do the "right" thing? </h2>

<h2> What Is Environmental Psychology? </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the “environment” in environmental psychology? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some key topics in environmental psychology? </h3> </div>
<a>well-being, performance, or other measures</a> in places like offices, homes, schools, and neighborhoods. Environmental psychologists also study
<a>personal space</a>, privacy, and
<a>the sense of ownership of spaces,</a> how people can better navigate environments, why certain environments are preferred to others, and what motivates concern for the environment and environmentally friendly behaviors.
<div> <h3> Why is environmental psychology important? </h3> </div>

<h2> The Benefits of Nature </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some psychological benefits of spending time in nature? </h3> </div>
<a>hormone</a> cortisol. Some informally
<a>refer to “nature therapy”</a> or “vitamin N” to highlight nature’s potential benefits.
<div> <h3> How much time outdoors do you need to feel better? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does nature inspire awe? </h3> </div>
<a>positive feelings of awe.</a> While many aspects of nature can instill wonder, psychologists have theorized that a
<div> <h3> What is “forest bathing”? </h3> </div>
<a>mindful</a> experience in nature. Those who traverse forest environments as part of this practice are encouraged to attend to them with each of the five senses. As with other forms of nature exposure,
<a>forest bathing has been studied for its potential effects on well-being</a>, such as reduced feelings of anxiety and improved mood.
<div> <h3> Why are we drawn to natural environments? </h3> </div>
<a>present-day environmental preferences have been shaped by human evolution</a> and reflect the natural surroundings in which our ancient ancestors thrived. There’s even a term for humans’
<a>attraction</a> to the natural world:
<div> <h3> How can human-made spaces be designed to increase well-being? </h3> </div>
<a>more likely to make us miserable.</a>
<h2> Psychology and Climate Change </h2>
<div> <h3> Can psychology help reduce the impact of climate change? </h3> </div>
<a>attention</a> to climate change impacts that are already evident.
<div> <h3> How might climate change affect mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>may also pose threats to mental health.</a>
<div> <h3> Does psychology explain climate change denial? </h3> </div>
<a>a motivated bias against evidence</a> supporting a possibility that one would rather not be true. The magnitude of the threat posed by climate change may be another psychological reason for
<a>Ideology and social identity</a> likely
<a>bias</a> individuals toward viewpoints on climate change—including the view that it’s a hoax—that are held by others in their political and social in-groups.
<div> <h3> Why do people avoid thinking about climate change? </h3> </div>
<a>data suggest</a> that in the past decade, the portion of Americans who acknowledge climate change and feel worried about it has increased substantially and now includes a majority of the population.
<div> <h3> How can I talk to someone who denies the threat of climate change? </h3> </div>
<a>highlight short-term problems</a> with sources of greenhouse gas emissions (such as air pollution or health risks). It may help to follow general guidelines for
<a>talking to someone with whom you disagree</a>—such as avoiding personal attacks, sarcasm, and condescension, expressing basic respect, and not assuming suspect motives.

<h1> How to Win an Election </h1>
<h2> The high-stakes science of campaign messaging reveals that success at the ballot box hinges more on how you feel about things than on what you think about them. Is anyone getting it right? </h2>

<p>Do you care about the unemployed, Medicaid recipients, and DREAMers? Whether you do or not, you’re likely going to be hearing a lot about them in the coming months, as America heads into a heated presidential election.</p>
<p>And if you do care, you should wipe every one of those phrases out of your vocabulary.</p>
<a>rationalization</a> that eliminated the problem.
<a>dopamine</a> activity in reward circuits. I came to understand that it is hard to change the partisan brain because we get rewarded for
<p>In <a>politics</a> as in the rest of life, we think because we feel.</p>
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic, but you’re likely to feel comfortable with the decisions of leaders who share your values and care about people like you.
<p>Funny, I don’t remember Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Plan” speech. But there are reasons rooted in human psychology and evolution that we all remember his dream.</p>
<h3>Three Principles of Effective Messaging</h3>
<p>Studying voters’ responses over the last several years has allowed me to distill three basic principles central to effective political messaging, all rooted in the way our minds and brains work.</p>
<a>unconscious</a>, always whirring in the background, directing our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
<p>Nothing could be more important in political communication than knowing which neural wires we are inadvertently tripping, which networks we want to activate or connect, and which ones we want to deactivate.</p>
<p>Consider this phrase: the unemployed. What’s wrong with that? Just about everything, because it trips some inadvertent wires.</p>
<a>prejudice</a>, as most white people who hear Medicaid recipient picture poor people of color, with all the conscious and unconscious bias it entails.
<p>The alternative, once again, is to turn people into people: People who rely on Medicaid for their health care. They are not recipients. They are not on anything.</p>
<a>identity</a> politics. It is about all of us, and it doesn’t matter what color we are.
<p>So who are DREAMers? Try this: children who have never pledged allegiance to any flag other than ours.</p>
<a>anger</a>, and disgust on the other, move people, first of all to vote, then to vote for one party or candidate versus another.
<h3>A Family Doctor for Every Family</h3>
<p>In 2020, high-quality affordable healthcare for all Americans is one of the top priorities for voters, as it has been for three decades. Illness doesn’t come in red or blue. Lack of insurance harms people on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<a>education</a>, No Child Left Behind—it would have activated entirely different neural networks, connoting a personal connection with their doctor, high-quality care they have chosen, and coverage for everyone.
<p>Given that roughly 40 percent of voters support or oppose any given policy from the start because of their partisan affiliation, the associative networks of swing voters are instructive (see the diagram on page 69).</p>
<p>The evidence points to fixing the program begun by Obama. How to talk about it? Incorporating the principles of messaging, a winning campaign might sound like this:</p>
<a>competition</a> by letting people of any age choose Medicare if they prefer it. Let’s finish the job so no Americans will ever again have to choose between taking their child to the doctor and putting food on the table for their family.
<p>That would leave only the question of what to call it. Democrats might do well with “A Family Doctor for Every Family.” That’s a clinic Americans would be happy to visit.</p>
<p>Networks of associations are always active.</p>
<p>Because so much is at stake in political messages, it’s important for candidates to capitalize on the associative power of words and phrases. Here is a glimpse into the minds of people when they hear the words healthcare reform.</p>

<h1> Leaders: Born or Made? </h1>
<h2> The most often-asked question about leadership, and the answer. </h2>
<p>This is the most basic and most often-asked question about leadership. To cut to the chase, the answer is: mostly made.</p>
<a>extraversion</a> is consistently associated with obtaining leadership positions and leader effectiveness. There is also some evidence that being bold,
<a>risk-taking</a> can be advantageous for leaders. Leaders also need to be able to analyze situations and figure out courses of action, and so
<a>introverts</a>, persons of average social intelligence, or those of us who are not particularly
<a>empathic</a> will not make good leaders? Certainly not. Remember: Most of leadership is made, not born. So if you aspire to positions of leadership, the best course is to embark on a leader self-development plan.

<h2> Why Assertiveness Is Important </h2>
<a>anxious</a> thoughts, even when under
<a>stress</a>. From a behavioral standpoint, assertive people are firm without being rude. They react to positive and negative emotions without becoming aggressive or resorting to passivity.
<div> <h3> What are some benefits of being assertive? </h3> </div>
<a>greater sense of agency</a> and better relationships. Assertiveness is often associated with higher 
<a>self-esteem</a> and 
<div> <h3> What are some dangers of not asserting yourself? </h3> </div>
<a>extreme passivity,</a> insecurity, anxiety, or even low self-esteem. They may be treated like emotional doormats whose needs always come second. In extreme cases, they may completely lose sight of what they need and want in life.
<div> <h3> Why are some people not assertive? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> of the consequences. They frequently avoid trying new things and tend to
<a>let other people’s desires determine their goals.</a> 
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<a>body language</a> effectively. They are able to express their thoughts and beliefs honestly and reasonably—and they encourage other people to do the same.
<p>Being assertive means speaking up for one’s rights without disrespecting anyone else’s. It involves managing stress, solving problems as they arise, and staying calm no matter how the other person reacts.</p>
<div> <h3> What are assertive behaviors? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> What’s the difference between assertiveness and passiveness? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between assertiveness and aggression? </h3> </div>
<a>trying to shame the other person</a> into submission. Aggressive people need to win at all costs, often resulting in a pushy attitude and
<a>bullying</a>. They can seem superior, intimidating, and even physically threatening.
