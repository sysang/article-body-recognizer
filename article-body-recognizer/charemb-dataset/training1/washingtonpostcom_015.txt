<div><h1>For Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom, the good old days are getting older and older</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Barry Svrluga</div></div>Sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>September 25, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<a>his five-year, $46 million contract</a> ends after the 2024-25 season, Backstrom will be 37. When Ovechkin’s
<a>five-year, $47.5 million deal</a> ends after the 2025-26 season, he will be 40.
<div><div><p>Okay, that was fun. Now the important part: Can two guys in their mid-30s be central pieces of a Stanley Cup-contending team? Can they remain that as they push closer to 40?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s the bet made not just by General Manager Brian MacLellan but by his boss, owner Ted Leonsis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Capitals are without Nicklas Backstrom as they open training camp</p></div>
<div><div><p>“They do the right things. They play the right way. I think we can finish their careers up in the right way — as a winning organization.”</p></div></div>
<a>hockey-reference.com</a>. Take away shootouts, and no team has more than the Caps’ 572 victories in that time.
<div><div><p>What a partnership. What a run. That the span finally included a Cup means Ovechkin and Backstrom don’t have to listen to paeans followed by, “Yeah, but …”</p></div></div>
<a>in seven games to Carolina</a> in 2019,
<a>in five to the New York Islanders</a> (and former coach Barry Trotz) in the pandemic-bubble of 2020 — a regression that
<a>cost then-coach Todd Reirden his job</a> — and
<a>then in five again to Boston this year</a>.
<div><div><p>“We just move forward,” Ovechkin said. “What happened a year ago, two years ago, you can’t change it, right? You just move on and try to get better next year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And they’re not the only ones to watch. T.J. Oshie turns 35 in December. Carl Hagelin is 33. Lars Eller is 32. Shoot, even John Carlson is 31. Each is a central piece expected to contribute.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Five things to watch as Capitals training camp begins</p></div>
<p>Except that’s not where Backstrom opens his training camp. MacLellan said there’s no expectation that the Swede will need surgery. But the fact of the matter is that a hip injury at 33 sounds weightier than a hip injury at, say, 23.</p>
<div><div><p>“I think it’s important, especially if you’re an older player, that you take the time to get it healed properly and don’t insert the player in the lineup too early,” MacLellan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those pieces are all paramount. But until they retire, this team will belong to Backstrom and Ovechkin, who must drive it forward even when they should be winding down.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They can accomplish team goals, individual goals,” MacLellan said, “and hopefully both finish healthy and it’s a good ending.”</p></div></div>

<a>15 women accuse former Washington employees of sexual harassment and verbal abuse</a>

<div> <div> <h1>From dream job to nightmare</h1> <div>More than a dozen women allege sexual harassment and verbal abuse by former team employees at Redskins Park</div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Will Hobson, Liz Clarke </div> <div>July 16, 2020</div> </div>
<p>In a statement, the team said it had hired D.C. attorney Beth Wilkinson and her firm, Wilkinson Walsh, “to conduct a thorough independent review of this entire matter and help the team set new employee standards for the future.” </p>
<div> Alex Santos was fired as director of pro personnel last week. (Associated Press) </div>
<p>Gershman, in a phone interview, denied Applegate’s allegations.</p>

<p>“I barely even remember who she is,” Gershman said. “I thought the Redskins was a great place to work. … I would apologize to anyone who thought that I was verbally abusive.”</p>
<p>None of the women accused Snyder or former longtime team president Bruce Allen of inappropriate behavior with women, but they expressed skepticism that the men were unaware of the behavior they allege.</p>
<p>“I would assume Bruce [Allen] knew because he sat 30 feet away from me … and saw me sobbing at my desk several times every week,” Applegate said.</p>
<p>Allen, who was fired at the end of last year, did not reply to interview requests.</p>
<p>Payne did not witness or endure sexual harassment, she said, but she supported what many other former employees said about the culture under Snyder.</p>
<p>“With such a toxic, mood-driven environment and the owner behaving like he does,” Payne said, “how could anyone think these women would go to HR?”</p>

<p>On the first day of working for the team, new employees are given a manual that describes the organization’s core values.</p>
<p>While there is a section discussing sexual harassment, many former employees said, if there is a process for handling sexual harassment complaints, it’s never discussed in the club’s brief onboarding process. </p>
<div>It was the most miserable experience of my life. And we all tolerated it, because we knew if we complained — and they reminded us of this — there were 1,000 people out there who would take our job in a heartbeat.</div>
<div>Emily Applegate, Redskins employee in 2014 to 2015</div>
<p>The team’s human resources staff consists of one full-time staffer — who also performs administrative duties at team headquarters — responsible for more than 220 full-time employees, according to several former employees.</p>
<p>“There’s no HR,” said one former veteran female employee who left in 2019. “And there was never a reporting process, nor was one explained to new employees about how you should report something.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the Redskins pointed out the team hired a new human resources manager in 2019 and this employee works with the team’s legal department on any issues involving employee conduct.</p>
<p>Lined at the top with transparent plexiglass, the stairs descend from the lobby to the locker room and training area, and someone standing at the bottom can look up the skirt of a woman standing at the top.</p>
<p>One former female member of the executive staff learned this lesson early in her tenure, she said, when she looked down to see a male trainer, two floors down, staring right back up, walking step for step with her.</p>
<p>“He even leaned to get a better angle,” the woman said. “He wasn’t even trying to hide it.”</p>
<p>“It was my first job, so I kind of normalized it,” said a woman who worked for the club for several years and departed in 2019. “And it was happening to every single one of my female co-workers under the age of 40.”</p>
<p>Training camp in Richmond in August was a hotbed of improper activity, several women said. Some encouraged younger female staffers to avoid the Tobacco Company, a bar and restaurant in a stately brick building frequented by team officials.</p>
<div>Julia Payne, former assistant press secretary in the Clinton administration who briefly served as vice president of communications for the Redskins in 2003.</div>
<p>“I told him that I do have a girlfriend and he does have a wife, so we don’t need to play hypotheticals here,” Walker said. “I was pretty blunt.”</p>
<p>“It felt like pretty much the worst thing in the world,” Walker said. “He didn’t care. He thought it was funny.”</p>
<p>Walker later filed a complaint with the team. In a statement, the Athletic supported her account and confirmed the company’s attorneys spoke with Redskins management about Walker’s allegations.</p>
<p>“The Athletic unequivocally stands by Rhiannon Walker’s account of the harassment she endured from Mr. Santos,” the company said.</p>
<p>Soon after her incident with Santos, Walker said, she learned of another reporter who alleged she had endured similar harassment: Nora Princiotti, who covered the team for the Washington Times in 2017.</p>
<p>Princiotti, in a phone interview, said on two or three occasions, Santos pulled his SUV alongside her as she was walking out of Redskins Park and offered commentary on her body and wardrobe.</p>
<p>“He told me I had a great ass for a little white girl,” Princiotti said. “The general sentiment was that I should wear less clothing.”</p>
<p>“It was gross and also just a terrible pun,” she said. “There was an overwhelming sense that no one would ever do anything about this stuff.”</p>
<p>“I am done with the NFL,” the woman said. Her experience with the Redskins “has killed any dream of a career in pro sports.”</p>
<h4>Conversation between Richard Mann II and a former female Redskins employee</h4>
<p>Santos was fired along with his top scouting assistant, Richard Mann II, who sent flirtatious, sexual texts to two former female employees that they provided to The Post.</p>
<p>“If I bring that I want to squeeze your butt,” Mann texted.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately that was (is?) the culture,” one of these women texted a reporter after forwarding the messages. “So we felt like we had to roll with it.”</p>
<p>In a phone interview, new team coach Ron Rivera declined to discuss why Santos and Mann were dismissed.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to create a new culture here,” Rivera said. “We’re hoping to get people to understand that they need to judge us on where we are and where we’re going as opposed to where we’ve been.”</p>
<h2>‘Voice of the Redskins’</h2>
<p>But among his mostly male staff on the video and digital teams, Michael for years had become a growing source of discomfort, according to four former employees, because of his penchant for off-color commentary about female colleagues.</p>
<p>During training camp in 2017, Michael saw a young woman from the sponsorship staff walk by, turned to one of his staffers and commented on her “tight ass” before adding a remark about her social life, the staffer said.</p>
<p>“He said you can’t mess with her, though … because you know she’s f---ing every guy on the team, right?” said this staffer, who afterward mentioned the comment to four colleagues, including a veteran female employee.</p>
<p>“I was mortified but not surprised,” the female employee said. Years earlier, Michael had squeezed this woman’s face after a late-night taping of a team program and told her she “was so cute,” she said.</p>
<p>Another comment, recalled by two former male employees, involved another female colleague.</p>
<p>“He said it looked like she definitely had a little Greek in her because of her lighter skin complexion, as well as that ass,” one former male employee said.</p>
<p>None of these employees filed formal complaints, they said, because they never thought anything would come of it.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to get rid of ‘The Voice of the Redskins’ … over a $30,000-a-year marketing manager,” one former male staffer said.</p>
<p>Former team employees who heard the video had different recollections of the precise wording but agreed Michael remarked about how attractive he found the intern, who was in college.</p>
<p>“It was disgusting,” said one former female employee who heard the audio. “This is a grown man who could be my grandfather, and he’s talking about someone younger than me.”</p>
<p>“The club’s legal department removed the file from the hard drive and maintained the file in the organization’s confidential HR/Legal records where it still resides,” the team said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, The Post requested an interview with Michael and informed club officials about comments attributed to Michael by his former employees and the “hot mic” incident.</p>
<p>Hours later, Michael announced his retirement.</p>
<p>“After 16 great years my time with the organization is over,” Michael said in a statement. “On to the next chapter.”</p>
<p>“I guess I was lucky enough to be more his type,” Applegate said.</p>
<p>Gershman often commented on her body or appearance, she said, in tandem with insults about her work performance. </p>
<p>“He would tell me I was stupid for not being able to print something out the way he wanted and directly follow with: ‘Oh, did you run extra yesterday? You look really good,’ ” Applegate said.</p>
<p>“Not part of it. No worries. Go find a dude!!” he replied.</p>
<p>There were also routine outbursts of rage, Applegate said, such as when Gershman got lost on the way to Joe Theismann’s Restaurant in Alexandria after he asked her to print out directions for him.</p>
<p>“All he had to do was type it in a GPS, and he spent 20 minutes screaming at how f---ing incompetent I was for not giving him proper directions,” she said. “I would leave work crying probably four days out of the week.”</p>
<p>Gershman, in a brief phone interview, alternately denied and said he didn’t recall conversations referenced by Applegate.</p>
<p>“I can’t comment on something that I can’t remember,” he said.</p>
<h4>Conversation between Mitch Gershman and Emily Applegate</h4>
<p>One other team executive repeatedly commented on Applegate’s appearance, she said: Dennis Greene, who held the high-pressure job of overseeing sales of luxury seating and premium suites at FedEx Field.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Applegate said, Greene complimented her on leggings she was wearing.</p>
<p>“Reducing a young woman to thinking that she can only do her job well if she wears a certain thing or exposes part of her body is demeaning,” this former saleswoman said. “It puts women in their place.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see what I have to be afraid of,” she said. “I’m just telling the truth.”</p>
<div>I barely even remember who she is. I thought the Redskins was a great place to work … I would apologize to anyone who thought that I was verbally abusive.</div>
<div>MItch Gershman, former chief operating officer, who left the organization in 2015</div>
<p>Schaffer declined to comment. Applegate said she understands why he didn’t make an issue of her treatment in 2015. It’s the same reason she never filed a complaint.</p>
<p>“I needed to keep my job,” she said. “When it comes down to it, 98 percent of people make decisions on stuff like this based on needing to keep their jobs … which is why this stuff goes on for so long.”</p>

<div><h1>Becky Hammon is a coaching trailblazer, but the NBA’s glass ceiling wouldn’t break</h1></div>

<div><div><p>Becky Hammon finally will be a head coach. The Las Vegas Aces, an organization in the WNBA, gave her an overdue opportunity, and she will have the control and the support needed to build a championship contender.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The glass ceiling remains intact, and any small cracks made over the past 7½ years are now just sad, visible reminders that a historic first remains a distant vision.</p></div></div>

<a>six women</a> on NBA coaching staffs, a statistic moving in the wrong direction after

<a>knocks against her</a> — as if spending all those years learning from the greatest NBA coach of the modern era somehow makes a candidate less qualified.

<div><p>“I feel like I’m ready to have my own team. And this is the organization that made it very, very obvious they wanted me really, really bad,” Hammon said Monday. “And so it’s always good to be wanted.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Here are some of the questions I addressed:</p></div></div>
<ul><li>How do opposing fans get 50 percent of the seats at FedEx Field?</li><li>With the old moniker gone, is there any reason the city of Washington doesn’t want its team back?</li><li>Why won’t Daniel Snyder sell the team?</li></ul>

<p>The season was destined to make the Nets reconsider. And the shortsighted, competitive nature of pro teams made it easy to predict that Part-time Kyrie would be a thing this season. Irving is expected to make his season debut Wednesday at Indiana.</p>

<div><div><p>“As far as the energy, you got to bring your own energy as an individual and bring that to the collective, and we’ll see what happens but just keep building,” Durant said.</p></div></div>
