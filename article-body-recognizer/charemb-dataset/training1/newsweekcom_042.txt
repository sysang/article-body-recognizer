<div> Opinion <a>Donald Trump</a> Joe Biden <a>2020 Election</a> <a>2020 Presidential Election</a></div>
<p>The pundits and consultants would have you believe November's presidential election is a choice between President Donald Trump's disruptive populism and former Vice President Joe Biden's safe politics-as-usual.</p>
<p>It is a self-serving narrative pushed by those who profit from the status quo. To protect that system, they must hide Biden's complicity in the sweeping destruction of our nation's productive capacity.</p>
<p>And just last year, Biden made clear he doesn't view China as a threat to overtake America, telling supporters, "China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. ...They're not competition for us."</p>
<p>This is Biden's legacy, and it is the reason Americans in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio voted for President Trump in 2016.</p>
<p>They could not be more wrong.</p>
<p>Fortunately, President Trump and the Republican Party are focused on what matters: restoring America's productive capacity and regaining our nation's role as a leader in industrial prowess.</p>
<p>Today, our country cannot even make enough facemasks and other personal protective equipment to keep our citizens and medical professionals safe in the face of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Not only did the decline in manufacturing make us vulnerable to shortages‚Äîsomething more reminiscent of communist regimes in Latin America‚Äîbut it also hollowed out entire cities and communities that were once home to a vibrant middle class.</p>
<p>And it has had a destructive, devastating impact on hard-working American families, where the dignity of work has been replaced by food stamps, opioid abuse and disability checks.</p>
<p>It also highlights the stunning naivet√© of the Biden-era consensus, and should alarm every American who thinks the industrial capacity of a country still matters.</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to be this way if President <a>Joe Biden</a> is actually willing to work with Republicans.</p>
<p>I offer my colleagues some ideas of where we could start.</p>
<a>before</a> President Biden's inauguration, I have repeatedly advocated this as a starting point for cooperation.
<p>Second, the package must include urgent funds necessary for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, as I said <a>last month</a> and the House's Blue Dog Coalition urged just last week.</p>
<a>must not penalize at-home caregivers</a> or
<a>undermine the work, training and child support requirements of parents receiving welfare benefits</a>.
<p>Fifth, we should make sure that our manufacturers, health care providers and businesses are not subjected to frivolous lawsuits if they follow best practices.</p>
<a>accountability for school systems</a> that are not making our children's education their top priority.

<p>The CCP will say or do anything to expand its power. Nothing is off limits, and nothing is sacred. This has been clear from the very beginning, and yet all these years later, the world still struggles to grasp its implications.</p>
<p>Once the CCP successfully took charge, it attacked virtually anyone with ties to the former Nationalist government. At least 5 million civilians met an early grave during the CCP's first tyrannical decade.</p>
<p>The result was the worst famine in history. As one historian put it, "China descended into hell." At least 45 million people died, with starvation so widespread that many resorted to cannibalism.</p>
<p>The CCP knew exactly what was happening. Mao rebuffed reports of famine, purged officials who raised concerns and ordered those who remained to double down.</p>
<a>genocide</a> in Xinjiang today is the latest and most egregious manifestation of this campaign.
<p>The Chinese people continue to live under the threat of political violence and suffer systemic human rights abuses, epitomized by the CCP's massacre of hundreds, likely thousands, of peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.</p>

<p>But if we rise to the occasion, the Chinese Communist Party will surely meet its just end in time, and July 1 will then be observed as a day of mourning in a free, democratic China.</p>

<p>Typewriters are the Marr family passion. Marr's grandfather would come home, go into the basement and fix typewriters until 10 or 11 at night. "My father would be upstairs in bed and hear the clacking," he said.</p>
<p>Do any offices still use them? I asked. Yes! Lawyers do, and undertakers still type out death certificates. Government offices slip certain forms into typewriters, certainly in an old-school state like Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Marr's personal favorites? "I'm a little partial to the Olympia, a German-made typewriter," he said. But he also likes Smith Coronas and Royals. "They all have their place in my heart‚Äîa different feel, a different touch."</p>
<p>Needless to say, Marr's invoice for the work on my Selectric was typed out. You could tell because some of the numbers landed in the middle of lines. Naturally, the bill he handed me was a carbon copy.</p>
<p>I'm typing this on a computer. PCs and Macs liberated humankind from the correction tape once needed to cover typos. And they enabled the electronic signature.</p>
<p>But an envelope with a typed address is something you'd notice, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>And no one would have to wedge it into a printer to add the address. The typewriter lives.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Face Masks</a> Coronavirus</div>
<p>Are we at the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning? Let's call it the middle.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 numbers are going decisively lower, both infections and deaths. Millions, meanwhile, are getting the vaccine and becoming mostly immune to the disease.</p>
<p>Still, the seven-day average of American deaths from this virus continues in the thousands. And it would be much higher if more of us let our guard down by ignoring calls to wear masks, socially distance and sanitize hands.</p>
<p>We each make our own policy for how far to go. There are the absolutists, who take no chances. They see no friends and never enter a restaurant, much less step on a plane.</p>
<p>Then there are moderates, like yours truly, who always wear a mask in public but do gather with their "pod" of careful friends. We eat in establishments that take precautions.</p>
<p>Finally, there are those who don't care at all and do nothing. They risk their own life and the lives of others.</p>
<p>As we move into a somewhat less scary phase of this disease, we moderates probably have the most to think about. That's because we were always open to weighing more options.</p>
<p>Infectious-disease experts now believe that outdoor activities rarely cause the disease to spread unless people are in close conversation. They say that with a few exceptions, we can safely jog or bike without a mask.</p>
<p>Consideration No. 3: guilt. As frontline workers, the elderly and other vulnerable people get their protective vaccinations, less stigma is attached to easing up a bit on the restrictions.</p>
<p>The hope in this country is that the pandemic will end around summer. As the scourge shows more definite signs of weakening, we who tried to do the right things may be able to relax‚Äîif just a little. This will be a strange time.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Joe Biden</a> Donald Trump <a>Coronavirus</a> <a>Science</a></div>
<p>French news cameras were in California last week to capture America's spectacular drive to mass-vaccinate against COVID-19. What were the visuals? An amusement park with cars lined up, their passengers waiting for a jab.</p>
<p>"Armies" of volunteers are helping, the French reporter says as attendants in protective gear direct the snaking traffic. Aerial pictures show cars lined up at vaccination stations, "by day" and "by night."</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> has his critics on the left and right, but few would question his seriousness about getting people vaccinated. And to contain infections while the vaccination campaign ramps up, he's brought back to center stage
<a>Anthony Fauci</a>. America's top infectious disease expert is pounding the message that even as case numbers fall, Americans must continue to protect themselves.
<p>That is not to say, however, that his administration did nothing. Last spring, it launched Operation Warp Speed, which has spent something north of $12 billion helping companies develop, make and distribute vaccines.</p>
<p>Fortunately, America's scientists have pressed on past years of disrespect. And we now see astonishing results in fields beyond vaccine development.</p>
<p>The very same week, news arrived that our scientists have cloned a black-footed ferret using the frozen cells of an animal dead for 33 years. What they did was revive a species thought to be extinct. The possibilities amaze.</p>
<p>Over in COVID-plagued Europe, meanwhile, the vaccination project is a mess. While the U.S. has administered 19 doses per 100 people, France has done only 5.5. Italy and Germany have dispensed 5.8 and 6.1, respectively.</p>
<p>Lots of complaints here about the difficulty of getting the vaccine. But compared with most other countries, America is showing that when it comes to meeting a challenge, we still have the know-how.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Hollywood</a> Celebrity <a>Celebrities</a> <a>Britney Spears</a></div>
<p>At age 11, Britney Spears played the wholesome American girl on The All New Mickey Mouse Club. A few years later, she was on concert stages surrounded by big teddy bears as she bumped, grinded and moaned. There was also a pole dance.</p>
<p>The New York Times documentary Framing Britney Spears feeds on the tragic 39-year-old she has become. By her mid-20s, Britney was in drug rehab, had lost custody of her children and had a couple of failed marriages.</p>
<p>The woman's suffering is undeniable, but where this account loses credibility is in suggesting that the public drove the celebrity to this sad state. Supposedly, it was the paparazzi she intentionally cultivated who caused her unraveling.</p>
<p>Morris adds, "The idea that people could look at that and only see a crazy person, well, that just tells me what a vulturous society she was working with to begin with."</p>
<p>Wait a second. It was Britney who single-mindedly pushed society to obsess over her. She shaved her head in front of cameras, did she not? And at any point, she could have returned to a quiet life in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana.</p>
<p>The pop star's fans have set up a #FreeBritney movement to push for her release from the conservatorship.</p>
<p>I offer no informed opinion on this. Her father's powers have been reduced to cover only her finances, and a third party, a trust, now has power equal to his.</p>
<p>Does Britney deserve some of our pity? She does. After all, the teen tart did possess true talent. Britney could sing and dance, and she sold a ton of records. And her struggle with severe mental illness is painfully real.</p>
<p>Britney's fans have their own lives, and their trials and heartbreak are as real as hers. But the celebrity machine demands that the public cheer and cry over strangers who are famous. Perhaps the public has a right to be freed from Britney Spears.</p>

<p>Tom Nichols, a prominent never-Trumper, thinks it's over for the GOP. The party, he writes, is now "controlled as a personality cult by a failing old man."</p>
<a>Ted Cruz</a>, Josh Hawley and other would-be Trumps might want his voters, but they don't have his skills. They lack the Vegas-comic patter and tough New Yorker persona and silly antics. In sum, they're not entertaining.
<p>Same goes for the Trump children, hard as they might try on impersonation. (However, if Ivanka were to knock out the gutless Marco Rubio in a Florida primary, that would be OK.)</p>
<a>Republicans</a> took back several seats in the House. That, of course, was before Trump's cop-beating mob threatened to hang
<a>Mike Pence</a>. (The former vice president, understandably, sent his regrets to the CPAC organizers.) And it happened after a campaign in which COVID-concerned Democrats failed to go door to door while Republicans did.
<a>Democratic Party</a> has built up moderate appeal. The party's lefties are finding, much to their dismay, that their every wish is not Biden's command. By the way, Congress now has the highest job approval in almost 12 years, and it's run by Democrats.
<p>The happy news is that Trump doesn't even get me mad anymore. So what if he still insists he won the election? Crazy people on street corners claim to be president. Trump finally made me smile, because he no longer matters.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Andrew Cuomo</a> MeToo <a>MeToo movement</a> <a>New york</a></div>
<p>Three women have accused New York's Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. The complaints center largely around unsolicited shows of affection.</p>
<p>"I understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me," said Charlotte Bennett, a former aide, "and felt horribly uncomfortable and scared." A grown woman getting "scared" by a come-on? From a New Yorker, no less?</p>
<p>Wanting the world to know of her torment, Bennett made herself available to the media, done up in cat-eye makeup. Basically, that involves a vixenish wing of eyeliner swooshing to the outer corner.</p>
<p>Is your writer implying that Bennett somehow "asked for it"? She is not, because "it" never happened. It's possible that Cuomo was propositioning her‚Äîand if he was, he shouldn't have. But Bennett emerged from the ordeal untouched.</p>
<p>Next up is Lindsey Boylan, another of the governor's aides. She accused him of kissing her on the lips as she was about to leave his office. "I was in shock," she wrote, "but I kept walking." At least she didn't call 911.</p>
<p>Boylan also took great exception to Cuomo's alleged invitation to play strip poker while they were flying on a plane full of government officials. She might consider that he was joshing.</p>
<p>Cuomo's office is denying most of this, and his former aide Ashley Cotton came to his defense. "He can be funny, he can make lousy jokes," she said. "But I have never known him to cross the line."</p>
<p>Up to now, Boylan was an obscure candidate for Manhattan borough president. Obscure no more, but does she think this offended-dignity act is going to get her elected? Bad things happen in Manhattan, things far worse than stolen kisses.</p>
<p>Which brings us to accuser No. 3. Anna Ruch complained that at a New York City wedding reception in 2019, Cuomo put his hands on her face, said, "Can I kiss you?" and proceeded to kiss her on the cheek.</p>
<p>"I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed," Ruch said.</p>
<p>Small wonder. Imagine an Italian kissing people at a wedding party.</p>
<p>The tabloids at least are having fun. "Quit It, Andy," said the New York Daily News front page, noting that the lefty Working Families Party is demanding Cuomo resign and end his "reign of fear."</p>
<p>On the right, Long Island Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin says Cuomo is guilty of "bullying, abuse and harassment." Also, he may run against Cuomo in 2022.</p>
<p>The New York Post had "Handsy Andy" with a picture of the governor holding Ruch's face. Under that was "Look of fear as Cuomo 'gave unwanted kiss': Third accuser."</p>
<p>Let's end with another of Cuomo's "inappropriate gestures," as recounted by Boylan: "He gave roses to female staffers on Valentine's Day and arranged to have one delivered to me, the only one on my floor."</p>
<p>And she thinks she can run Manhattan?</p>

<a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, among others on the left. They argue that since over half the SALT deduction benefits go to households with income in the top 1 percent, the cap is a handy way to tax the rich.
<a>Republicans</a>' 2017 tax cuts. And these local governments need these taxpayers. The highest-earning 1 percent of New York residents accounted for almost 43 percent of the total income tax collected by the city.

<p>And so, are companies outraged? Damn straight they are. They have good reason, and it's not because their chief executives are "woke" or the left pressured them. It's because a healthy democracy is in their corporate interests.</p>
<p>American businesses, Henderson adds, "assumed that someone else would ensure that democracy, the rule of law, and the kind of robust, respectful discourse that keeps societies healthy would simply survive."</p>
<p>When the CEO of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines protested, Georgia's Republican-controlled House voted to repeal a $35 million tax break for the airline. (The bill hasn't gone through the state <a>Senate</a>, which has adjourned for the year.)</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a>, meanwhile, has called on his followers to boycott companies that opposed the Georgia law. He even offered a list that included Coca-Cola, Major League Baseball and Delta.
<p>A later discussion with 120 CEOs, Sonnenfeld wrote in The Wall Street Journal, revealed that "their spirit was defiant against politicians trying to muzzle them."</p>
<p>These prized workers are often labeled progressive, though one hopes that protecting the sanctity of the democratic process transcends the left-right political discourse.</p>
<p>"Free markets cannot survive without the ... kind of capable, accountable government that can set the rules of the game," Henderson wrote. "And only democracy can ensure that governments are held accountable, that they are viewed as legitimate."</p>
<p>Corporations that defend the democracy are seeing to their own interests. But they may save us all.</p>

<p>"There seems to be a mismatch between who is leading in the New York City mayoral race and the tenor of the times that we're supposed to be living in," said Matthew Miles Goodrich of the left-wing Sunrise Movement.</p>
<p>What, other than certain obsessions on Fox News, explains the exaggerated belief that the left dominates Democratic thought? The answer is undoubtedly the activists' outsized presence on social media.</p>

<p>In the Louisiana runoff, Peterson wholeheartedly supported the Green New Deal and bashed the oil and gas industry, which happens to be one of the state's largest industries. Carter wisely called for carefully weaning people off fossil fuels.</p>

<a>Bill Clinton</a>'s tryst with his then-intern Monica Lewinsky when he was president. Here again, a male politician allegedly lied and may have broken the law, but the American people saw a married man hiding the fact that he betrayed his wife.
<p>Both the Trump and the Clinton indiscretions involved mutually agreed-upon sex. And in both cases, the wives didn't raise a public fuss, leaving the spectacle of a betrayed and injured mate off the table.</p>
<p>How na√Øve it now seems to think that these revelations would have derailed either of these men's presidencies.</p>
<a>Brett Kavanaugh</a> to the U.S.
<a>Supreme Court</a> jumped on charges of sexual assault dating back to his high school days. I found Christine Blasey
<a>Ford</a>'s account that he and another student jumped on her during a drunken party to be plausible.
<p>I found fault with some of Kavanaugh's dissembling, but I did not jump on Ford's bandwagon. On the matter of sexual assault, I wanted to wait for an <a>FBI</a> probe. If I could do it again, though, I would be more skeptical of Ford's timing.</p>
<p>Although partisans obsess over them, sex scandals rarely alter the political landscape in a major way. And when the accusations smell of opportunism, they may actually help the accused.</p>
<a>Republicans</a> wasted months of the nation's time on Clinton's dalliance,
<a>Democrats</a> picked up five seats in the House. Clinton finished his presidency with a Gallup approval rating of 65 percent, higher than Ronald Reagan's.

<p>Tradition tells us that, come the midterms, the president's party loses seats in the House. If this tradition holds in 2022, that could be bad news for Democrats, whose House majority now stands at only nine seats.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> turned Georgia blue, POLITICO confidently stated that to win the state's two
<a>Senate</a> runoffs on Jan. 5, "the
<a>Democratic Party</a> will have to defy a long track record of failure in overtime elections." So everyone believed, Democrats included. "Everyone" was wrong.
<p>Special elections tend to produce low turnout, and former President <a>Donald Trump</a> wasn't on the ballot to motivate Democrats to show up. But while Trump wasn't on the ballot, he was in voters' heads. Democrats took both seats.</p>
<p>As a result, Trump will still be in the voters' heads come Nov. 8, 2022. And the party-turned-personality cult seems to be ignoring how unlovable most voters find its object of adoration. Or perhaps it doesn't know.</p>
<p>One imagines that as the 2022 election approaches, Republicans in swingable districts will say the party has moved beyond Trump. The evidence so far says otherwise.</p>
<p>In 2022, Democrats will be defending only seven House seats in districts Trump won. No Senate seat in a state that voted for Trump will be up for grabs. And the economy is expected to continue booming.</p>

<a>Republicans</a> would not. The thinking goes that Democrats would use a commission report to bash Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections. It would certainly detail how former President
<a>Donald Trump</a> incited his supporters to commit the outrage.
<p>Where Republicans err is believing that without a report, Democrats won't have the ammo to bash them effectively. But the trauma of that day is already seared in the American brain.</p>
<p>Legislation passed by the House would establish a 10-member commission appointed equally by Democrats and Republicans. Without Republican input, the official story of Jan. 6 will be told by historians, journalists and the courts.</p>

<a>George W. Bush</a>. That's because they campaigned on the terror of 9/11. They didn't need fancy explanations, because the national calamity‚Äîjetliners crashing into the World Trade Center‚Äîwas so visual and visceral.
<p>The same can be said of the horrific imagery that emerged from Jan. 6 as Trump supporters vandalized the Capitol and beat cops with flagpoles. It's all on video.</p>
<p>And so is the rally at the Ellipse, where Trump pushed the dangerous lie: "We will never give up. We will never concede. ... You don't concede when there's theft involved."</p>
<a>Bill Clinton</a> criticized his party for failing to address Americans' widespread anxiety. "We have to have a clear and strong national security stand," he said.
<p>If they don't want to help construct a respected explanation of the awful events of Jan. 6, then fine. Democrats will be happy to do it.</p>

<p>Not that long ago, American shoppers cleaned store shelves of toilet paper. Pandemic panic had fueled the run on toilet paper, the point of it never clear.</p>
<p>It's interesting that though COVID-19 is in retreat, shortages continue. The virus is only partly at fault. Barron's laid blame on decades of companies "fetishizing efficiency."</p>
<p>Similarly, retailers no longer stocked merchandise in the back. They put it all on the floor in the belief that should they need, say, more La-Z-Boy recliners, they could get them shipped right over the next day or so.</p>
<p>There are ordinary supply chain disruptions not directly tied to the pandemic. Swimming pool chlorine tablets are in short supply because Hurricane Laura set off a devastating fire at BioLab, the Louisiana maker of them.</p>
<p>Burger King has had problems providing the expected pickles, not because there's any shortage of cucumbers but because the pickle jars have been tied up in the supply chain.</p>
<p>A cyberattack against JBS, the world's largest meat supplier, has disrupted the meat supply chains. A similar attack on the Colonial Pipeline led to temporary gasoline shortages in several states.</p>
<p>Then there are just spikes in consumer desires. Chicken breast prices have doubled this year. The reason is high demand relative to chicken supply.</p>
<p>You want a Sub-Zero? You demand a Sub-Zero? Well, you can roll on the floor kicking your feet and wave a wad of cash and you still just may have to wait awhile.</p>
<p>A post-pandemic surge in demand for products with a computerized component has worsened an ongoing shortage of computer chips. Apple, for example, says the scarcity of semiconductors could cost it as much as $4 billion in revenues this quarter.</p>
<p>By the way, there's no shortage of toilet paper rolls at the moment. But a shortage of shipping containers could very well disrupt the flow of wood pulp needed to make them.</p>

<a>Democrats</a> are all in. The reasoning on the right seems to be that President

<p>Vaccine passports verify that someone has obtained protection against the virus. They let businesses reassure customers that they can congregate on their premises with little fear of getting infected by others.</p>
<p>By the way, employment rates are rising more quickly in subpopulations that have had faster growth in vaccination rates, according to an analysis at the University of Minnesota. Just saying.</p>

<p>China is America's economic rival. The way capitalists deal with rivals is to compete. President Joe Biden vows to compete with this rival on the rival's terms. He calls it "extreme competition."</p>
<p>China has built a massive semiconductor industry with massive government spending. It is about to send another $200 billion to its semiconductor sector through 2025.</p>
<p>The Biden administration called China's retaliatory move "economic coercion."</p>
<a>Bernie Sanders</a>, who complained that it amounted to "corporate welfare" to big, rich companies. Suffice it to say, if the companies could have become richer doing this on their own, they would have done it.
<a>Donald Trump</a>'s first actions in office was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership's purpose was to help its members‚Äîabout a dozen countries, including Canada, Japan and Australia‚Äîcompete with China.
<p>Biden has also dispensed with the racial taunts. Which do you think concerns China more, Trump's calling COVID-19 the "China virus" or Biden talking about "extreme competition"?</p>
<p>A modern economy runs on computer chips. A clean-energy future relies on lithium batteries. America cannot let China control the supply of them. Drop your purist dogmas, everybody. Economic nationalism is the future.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Obamacare</a> Medical <a>Health Care</a> <a>Republicans</a></div>
<a>Supreme Court</a> to uphold the health insurance program also known as "Obamacare."
<p>For that, Republicans should thank their lucky stars. There would have been unlovely consequences had they succeeded in killing a government program that secured health coverage for 23 million Americans.</p>
<p>Could it be that their attacks and thrusts to repeal the ACA were really just an act? Republicans passed several bills to do in the ACA during the Obama administration, resting assured that the former president would veto them.</p>
<a>Congress</a> but still failed to deep-six the ACA. Republican
<a>John McCain</a> famously stopped a serious repeal effort with his one vote in the
<a>Senate</a>. Though pilloried for that, he had saved his party from having to deal with the inevitable fallout.
<p>In 2016, <a>Donald Trump</a> ran for the presidency promising to replace Obamacare with "something terrific." As you know, nothing emerged.</p>
<p>Where does the health care debate go from here?</p>
<p>Republicans have turned to a more specialized complaint centered on the "public option." This would be a government-run plan that competes with private offerings on the ACA marketplace.</p>
<p>None of this is quite true. How a public option might affect private insurers would depend on how the public option is structured. (Sorry, everybody, but the details matter.)</p>
<p>The real problem with throwing thunderbolts at the public option is that Democratic leaders aren't currently pushing for one. They want to avoid a fight with insurers, providers and others who profit off the high cost of American health care.</p>
<p>Of course, Congress should let Medicare negotiate for lower drug prices.</p>
<p>Democrats have backed that for a long time, and lest we forget, so did Trump during his first presidential campaign.</p>

<p>But in making the case to raise taxes on the wealthy, it is counterproductive to portray such a scenario as a kind of just punishment for those who have accumulated wealth. Many on the left can't stop themselves from hurting their cause.</p>
<p>The pandemic did especially nice things for Silicon Valley companies that helped stay-at-home Americans move their shopping and working online. They didn't create the pandemic. They just happened to be in the right businesses when it hit.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s presidential campaign are the very billionaires on whom he wants to raise taxes. They include the top people at the likes of
<a>Apple</a>. One of them, Google CEO
<a>Eric Schmidt</a>, saw his net worth, now $17.4 billion, rise 61 percent in the Trump years.
<p>That makes Biden's plan to beef up the IRS to go after tycoons who chisel on their taxes long overdue. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig has said that tax cheats deprive the government of something like $1 trillion a year.</p>
<p>His largely immigrant constituents did not lose their service jobs because rich people lived elsewhere in the city. They lost them because a deadly virus shut down the businesses that employed them.</p>
<p>So, there's no need here to spin a morality tale about the evils of great wealth. The case for raising taxes on those who could most easily pay them is good. Let's stick to this more sophisticated argument and skip the reproach.</p>

<a>Congress</a> and powerful voice among the city's Hispanics, also endorsed Adams. Black people and Latinos have borne the brunt of increased crime, and guess what? They don't like it.

<p>How often must people of color save the Democratic Party from its left fringe? As often as they have to, unfortunately.</p>

<p>And face it; so is the United States. The vaccinated half is moving forward, and the unvaccinated half is falling behind. What a strange place we've become.</p>

<p>Many of us spent the pandemic months obsessing over how our mug looked on Zoom and other video-chatting services. Poor lighting was a torment, and the lack of sunshine and exercise produced what's been dubbed "lockdown face."</p>
<p>Many of us didn't like what we saw, and something had to be done. Often, that something was cosmetic surgery.</p>
