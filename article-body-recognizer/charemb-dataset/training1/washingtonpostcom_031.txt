<h2>England to ease covid travel testing rules</h2>
<div><div><div>By Karla Adam1:18 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><p>LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday announced an easing of coronavirus travel testing rules as his government attempts to “ride out” the surge of infections driven by the omicron variant.</p></div>
<p>In a statement to Parliament, Johnson said the need for pre-departure tests for travelers returning to England and the need to quarantine on arrival — measures introduced last month in response to omicron — will be dropped from Friday.</p>
<div><div><p>Johnson also said that from Jan. 11, England will scrap the requirement for asymptomatic people who test positive with a lateral flow test to follow up with a PCR test.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The changes come amid heightened concerns about staff shortages due to covid-19. One person not at his usual workplace Wednesday was Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. He has tested positive for the coronavirus.</p></div>

<div><h1>Biden promised to reverse Trump's health policies. He's done that -- mostly.</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 9, 2021 at 7:49 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: The Senate voted to repeal Biden's vaccine or test policy for private businesses, and there's a bipartisan effort to keep telehealth benefits around. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden has reversed some but not all Trump-era health policies</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>President Biden came into office with a goal in mind: Reverse Donald Trump’s health care policies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Obamacare</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s a philosophical difference between Biden and Trump that served as the driving force behind each president’s policies. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“There’s the important symbolic change of promoting the ACA rather than trashing it,” said Larry Levitt, an executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.</li></ul></div>
<li>The rule that got the most pushback from Democrats: Trump’s expansion of short-term health plans, which typically don’t cover pre-existing conditions.</li>
<li>The last regulation allows for employers to provide subsidies for their workers to buy health coverage on the individual market.</li>
<div><div><p>Medicaid</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Biden administration quickly worked to rescind one of Trump’s signature health policies: Medicaid work rules. </p></div></div>
<li>In 2018, the Trump administration issued first-of-its-kind guidance letting states require some enrollees work, volunteer or attend school as a condition of getting health coverage.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Abortion and contraception</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Senate votes to nullify key Biden vaccine and testing policy</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The effort was led by Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). Notably, it gained the backing of two Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Jon Tester (Mont.), ultimately passing in a 52-48 vote. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>The push hinged on a congressional process which allows lawmakers to review federal agency regulations, clearing the way for Republicans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote despite not controlling the chamber.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>The measure is unlikely to go far. A senior Democratic aide told The Health 202 that they didn’t expect the chamber to vote on the measure</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>First in The Health 202: Key lawmakers introduce bipartisan telehealth bill</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>New legislation to be unveiled today will push to make a slew of telehealth services last longer, as demand for such services has skyrocketed amid the pandemic. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A glimpse of the bill’s major provisions:</p></div></div>
<li>The bill also includes a two-year temporary extension of emergency telehealth waivers, such as allowing certain providers like speech language pathologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists to provide telehealth services.</li>
<div><div><h4><div>The uninsured are looking to Congress to fill a coverage gap</div></h4></div></div>
<li>But the proposal comes with limits: It would only run through 2025, if passed at all. Its fate is far from certain in the Senate, where the chamber will consider this measure and the rest of Democrats’ spending bill in the weeks ahead.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Fauci: The definition of full vaccination could change to include a booster</div></h4></div></div>
<p>“Right now, I don't see that changing tomorrow or next week,” Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said on CNN. But, he added that, in his personal opinion, “it’s going to be a matter of when, not if.”</p>
<div><div><h4><div>Schools play a role in encouraging kids to get vaccinated</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey showing that vaccine uptake is higher in schools encouraging children to get vaccinated. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In schools encouraging vaccination..60 percent of parents say their kid ages 12 to 17 is vaccinated. That rate was 28 percent among parents with kids between ages 5 and 11. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In schools that don’t encourage vaccination…42 percent of parents say their adolescent is vaccinated, and 8 percent say their younger child has received the shot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another takeaway: Many parents of younger children want to “wait and see”: </p></div></div>

<div><h1>At-home coronavirus tests are still elusive -- and here's why</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Alexandra Ellerbeck</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Rachel Roubein</p></div></div><div>December 10, 2021 at 8:41 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Hi, it's your Health 202 researcher, Alex. If you like this newsletter, check out the other one I work on, The Climate 202. Also, a bit of housekeeping: We'll be off Monday but back Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dueling drug pricing reports came out this morning and hospitals are suing over surprise billing. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The Biden administration's testing promises aren't panning out yet</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>President Biden framed testing as a key part of his pandemic response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Boston Globe reporter Matt Karolian:</p></div></div>
<p>Experts point to several reasons behind the U.S. testing challenges, including limited government investment, a stricter regulatory environment compared to other countries and a lack of clear public health messaging. Let's dive in a little deeper:</p>
<div><div><p>1. A lack of spending</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The United States has failed to invest in and prioritize rapid, at-home tests across two U.S. administrations, according to a Washington Post investigation published yesterday. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Government subsidies and large purchasing agreements drove testing availability in other countries, a senior administration official told our colleagues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lack of investment took a toll: As coronavirus cases dropped over the summer, test manufacturer Abbott laid off thousands of workers and destroyed excess test cards, as the New York Times first reported. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden administration officials defend their approach, pointing to a growth in testing supply and noting over-the-counter tests are just one part of the nation’s testing infrastructure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>2. The regulatory environment</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some public health experts told The Health 202 that the regulatory environment has also contributed to fewer at-home tests in the United States compared with other countries. </p></div></div>
<p>In Europe, at least 46 rapid, at-home antigen tests have been approved. The United States, for its part, has granted emergency use authorization for just 14 tests from 10 manufacturers, according to a database from Arizona State University.</p>
<div><p>But an FDA official attributed the discrepancy in testing availability in part to the fact that Europe relies on a self-certification model — a model, the official warned, which could allow low-performing tests on the market. </p></div>
<div><div><p>3. Federal messaging </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released additional guidelines for at-home testing this week, recommending the use of tests before gatherings. Some public health experts say more is needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We should be mailing fistfuls of free tests to every household in the country,” David Paltiel, a health policy professor at Yale School of Public Health, told The Health 202. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Paltiel’s vision is unlikely to become reality anytime soon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Federal regulators authorized booster shots for 16- and 17-year-olds</div></h4></div></div>
<p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky endorsed the move, which came a day after the vaccine makers released new data suggesting boosters could play a key role in protecting against the omicron variant by raising the level of virus-fighting antibodies.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Out this morning: Dueling drug pricing reports</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The panel’s Republicans released their own drug-industry report based on a less exhaustive look at pharmaceutical benefit managers.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>The middlemen “use their market leverage to increase their profits, not reduce costs for consumers,” the 19-page GOP report contends.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h4><div>First in The Health 202: Two top Democrats seek action to ensure birth control is free.</div></h4></div></div>
<li>In letters shared with The Health 202, several insurers wrote that patients needed to try to fail other birth control options before they’d cover the method the person was seeking.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Agency alert</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Tabak was named acting NIH director</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lawrence Tabak, the second-in-command at the National Institutes of Health, will assume the role on Dec. 20 as longtime director Francis Collins steps down from his post. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Reproductive wars</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s a victory for abortion rights advocates. However, the ruling by District Judge David Peeples doesn’t include an injunction against the law, which charges private citizens with enforcing it. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court heard arguments about the Texas law last month, but hasn’t yet made a decision. The high court seemed willing to allow a challenge by abortion providers to a ban on most abortions after six weeks. </p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>In the courts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surprise billing wars continue: The major hospital and doctor lobbies are suing the administration over its surprise billing rules less than a month before the regulations are set to go into effect. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The move is another salvo in the years-long lobbying war over how to resolve payment disputes among providers and insurers, since neither industry wants to pick up the bulk of the cost. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What happened: The American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association contend the administration didn’t adhere to Congress’ intent when drafting the law’s regulations. </p></div></div>
<li>Meditators help resolve payment disputes when providers and insurers can’t agree.</li>
<li>The rule generally pegged the winning amount to the plan’s median in-network rate for a similar service in that geographic area — and that’s the aspect of the rule providers are challenging.</li>
<li>The trade groups said the lawsuit shouldn’t prevent surprise bill protections from kicking in Jan. 1.</li>

<div><h1>Biden's FDA pick faces questions about his tobacco response</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 8:12 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Supreme Court declined to block New York's vaccine mandate for health care workers, and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is still an obstacle to passing Democrats' social spending bill before the holidays. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Senators want to know whether Robert Califf will go tougher on tobacco</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>President Biden’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration would step into the role at one of the most critical junctures for tobacco regulation. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the issues looming at the agency: </p></div></div>
<li>Menthol ban: The Biden administration aims to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes and cigars by April, in response to a 2013 citizen petition seeking such action.</li>
<li>Nicotine reduction: The FDA is still considering requiring tobacco companies to reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, Hunt confirmed.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Looking to the past</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s unclear how exactly Califf would approach each issue (and he declined to comment for this piece). But we can look to his record to get a sense of his priorities. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Califf served as FDA commissioner for nearly a year under President Barack Obama. During his tenure, the agency extended its regulatory authority to include all tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, cigars and hookah. </p></div></div>
<div><p>The nominee made what is perhaps his most extensive statements on e-cigarette regulation in 2019, amid a rise of a then-mysterious vaping illness. (It turned out contaminated marijuana vapes were the primary source of the outbreak.)</p></div>
<div><div><p>In an article for the Association of American Medical Colleges, he detailed a “trifecta” of sweeping regulations to “limit the harm done by vaping products.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This included lowering the amount of nicotine in tobacco products to subaddictive levels; banning over-the-counter vaping products; and supporting prescription vaping so tobacco users don’t go through withdrawals. </p></div></div>
<ul><li>“Outright prohibition of vaping products seems impracticable on several grounds,” Califf wrote, citing Americans’ belief in personal freedoms and concerns a blanket ban could dissuade people from seeking treatment.</li></ul>
<div><p>Since then, Califf has continued to be supportive of reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes. But he cautioned it would be “politically challenging” and “divisive” in comments to Alexandra earlier this year.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Robert Califf, FDA nominee:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Public scrutiny</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Califf got the endorsement of six former FDA commissioners yesterday, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports, citing the urgency of addressing omicron. But outside groups will be watching his tobacco efforts closely.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Deadline time: Senate Democrats are barreling toward a self-imposed deadline to pass Biden’s roughly $2 trillion economic package before Christmas, our colleague Tony Romm reports.</p></div></div>
<ul><li>“Anything’s possible here,” Manchin said about the prospects of a vote before Christmas. Asked if he intends to continue negotiating with the White House, he replied, “I’m engaged, we’re engaged.”</li></ul>
<div><div><p>ICYMI: The Senate Finance Committee released a new round of legislative text over the weekend. Here are the notable changes:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The Supreme Court declined to stop New York’s vaccine mandate for health workers</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>As is often the case in emergency relief requests, the justices in the majority did not give a reason for denying the request. The court has on three previous occasions declined to stop states from mandating coronavirus vaccines.</p></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Meanwhile, states and cities are imposing restrictions amid rising cases and the threat of omicron</div></h4></div></div>
<li>California and New York are reinstating indoor mask mandates as officials worry about the spread of the virus during the holiday season and a rising number of omicron cases.</li>
<li>Philadelphia will require proof of vaccination at bars, restaurants, movie theaters and any other establishments that serve food or drinks on-site.</li>
<div><div><h4><div>Officials identify omicron cases in the D.C. area.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The District, Maryland and Virginia have each detected cases of omicron, The Post’s Jenna Portnoy and Dan Keating report. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Here’s what else you need to know:</div></h4></div></div>
<li>Pfizer’s antiviral pill sharply reduces severe illness and should work against omicron, the company announced this morning.</li>
<li>More than 1 in 100 people 65 years or older have died of the coronavirus, The New York Times reports.</li>

<div><div><p>But she had a prescient message that day. The inoculations won’t work, she said, “if only some people take the vaccines.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s our look, by the numbers, at how 2021 unfolded: </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>800,000 Americans have died</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Post’s Aaron Blake digs deeper into the data: </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>1 in 100 older Americans have died</li><li>One-third have said a family member or a close friend has died</li><li>20th is how the U.S. ranks in total per capita deaths worldwide</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>61 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Back in September, experts told us they hoped roughly 60 to 80 percent of people would be vaccinated by the end of the year — and the country has hit the low end of that goal.</p></div></div>
<li>Roughly 27.2 percent of fully vaccinated people have gotten a booster shot. Federal health officials are pleading with the public to get an extra dose, which they say is expected to add a crucial layer of protection against the omicron variant.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Congress passed $1.9 trillion in coronavirus relief funds</div></h5></div></div>
<li>Congress set aside billions for measures like coronavirus testing, contact tracing and deploying vaccines.</li>
<li>Inside the Humphrey Building, federal health officials were charged with implementing efforts key to Democrats’ agenda, such as bolstering financial aid to low- and middle-income Obamacare shoppers and distributing funds to providers.</li>
<li>But could more money be needed? In recent weeks, senior White House officials have studied how much contingency funding they have available to combat the omicron variant, per our colleagues Jeff Stein, Tyler Pager, Taylor Telford and Dan Diamond.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Democrats are scrambling on their $2 trillion economic package</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s the biggest question in Congress: Will the Senate vote on Democrats’ social spending bill before Christmas? That’s Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s goal. </p></div></div>
<p>But Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is still an obstacle. Whether Democrats hand Biden a major victory before 2021 draws to a close is still uncertain — as is what awaits a country still in the throes of a once-in-a-century pandemic in 2022.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Agency alert</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden’s FDA pick gets a mostly friendly Senate reception</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Robert Califf appears poised to be confirmed as the next Food and Drug Administration commissioner after receiving bipartisan support during his nomination hearing yesterday. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“I’m not sure you could write a résumé for someone who’s more qualified to be FDA commissioner,” said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the top Republican on the Senate HELP Committee.</li></ul></div>
<li>During the hearing, Califf said the FDA would conduct a review of opioid labels, looking at the evidence to see if some painkillers needed to be relabeled.</li>
<li>Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) shot back: “The evidence has been here for a long time. … It’s the evidence of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people, dying in this country.”</li>
<div><div><p>But still, even if Califf loses some Democratic votes, he’s expected to pick up enough support from Republicans to ensure his confirmation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Becerra defends his work on the coronavirus response</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>One reporter pressed Becerra on how often he meets with the president. “Not that often on covid or on the migrant children issue or on Build Back Better — not that often, but enough,” Becerra said.</p></div></div>
<li>“I don’t think there’s a day that doesn’t go by that we’re not talking covid, but if your question was with the president directly, only when we need to because everything percolates up to him,” he said.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Omicron could peak as soon as January in the U.S.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Triple threat: The omicron wave could coincide with a continued onslaught from the delta variant and with the time of year when influenza infections usually spike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what else you need to know: </p></div></div>
<li>The Biden administration is facing renewed questions over its global coronavirus strategy as advocates and Democrats press him to push faster to vaccinate the world, our colleague Dan Diamond reports.</li>
<li>The World Health Organization warned that omicron is spreading faster than previous variants and cautioned against dismissing it as mild, The Post’s Paulina Villegas reports.</li>
<li>Amtrak is temporarily allowing a testing alternative to its vaccine mandate for employees in an effort to avert the termination of around 500 people and prevent possible service cuts, writes The Post’s Luz Lazo.</li>

<div><div><p>For a long time, modern scholars believed that the Amazons were little more than a figment of ancient imaginations.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Valerii Guliaev, who led the expedition, called it a “unique find” and said it underscored how women and men received equal treatment in Scythian society.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Amazons are common Scythian phenomenon,” Guliaev said in a statement. “All burial rites which were usually made for men were done for them.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amanda Loudin</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 2:44 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The brainchild of team leader Philip Henderson, 58, the project is about “summiting Everest first,” and “everything else second.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But with 30 years of climbing, mountaineering and working in the outdoors industry, often as the only Black person in any group, Henderson sees the Everest expedition as a way to bring diversity and change to his chosen field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>"The analogy I like to use is that there's a cruise ship that has been headed in one direction," he says. "It's time to turn it around."</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Racism of the Great Outdoors</p></div>
<div><p>Like others in the group, growing up, Saal was often the only Black rock climber. “I was exposed to climbing at age 12 through a local REI store. It was the first time I discovered this was something people did,” she says.</p></div>

<div><div><h3><div>The team</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Each team member has the experience to say that Everest is a challenge,” Henderson says, “but they all have the skills.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Scott will provide tech and logistics support at base camp.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It’s official: Mount Everest just got a little bit higher</p></div>
<div><div><p>Saal, on the other hand, is headed to the summit. While climbing Everest has not been a long-held personal goal, she says that the mountain is usually in the back of every climber’s mind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Even people who don’t know much about the sport know Everest, and so I’m always asked if I plan to climb it,” she says. “When Phil called, I said yes immediately.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No matter who’s climbing or what their experience level is, Everest brings with it a unique set of risks — on average, about five climbers lose their lives there annually.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Complex plans</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Having the desire, skill and determination to climb Everest is just one part of the equation. Funding is another big piece of the puzzle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A standard supported climb can range from about $30,000 to $85,000 per person. For custom climbs, where you choose your teammates, guides and guide ratio, the price tag can run well over $100,000 per person.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To help defray those costs, Full Circle has lined up the support of several mountaineering brands although the group is still seeking donations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among the brands supporting Full Circle are Perkins Coie, Hestra, North Face, Osprey Packs, Smartwool, MSR and the Greening Youth Foundation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Taylor says that as more people hear about the effort, interest and financial support has picked up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A month or so ago, things were kind of quiet,” he says. “But now we know we’re going to Everest. I’m happy to be part of a story that hasn’t been shared before.”</p></div></div>

<a>344 potential single-point failures </a>on this complex mission.
<div><div><p>The mission has had a couple of hiccups.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All the major deployments to date — including that of the solar arrays needed to power the observatory — have gone splendidly, Durning said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am thrilled,” he said. “I’ve been on the job 15 years. To see it unfurl in space, it’s awe-inspiring.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the sun shield deployment was complete Tuesday, he texted a postscript: “15 years of anticipation of this moment and it did not disappoint.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Webb, and the Webb Team, is doing great on deployments!” Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said by email early Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not out of the woods yet for JWST, but we have made wonderful progress. Kudos to the amazing engineers!” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Keith Parrish, observatory manager for the telescope at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said: “We’ll take each of our deployments as a touchdown. But the game is still going.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>On the first morning of the new year, Andrew Koch was working at his computer in Pittsburgh when a thunder-like sound rumbled through his home.</p></div></div>
<p>He felt it in his chest more than he heard it, Koch said Tuesday. Only after Allegheny County, Pa., tweeted that there was “no explanation” for the loud noise did he check whether his home security cameras had captured the boom.</p>
<div><div><p>“If it had been clear, there would have been something 100 times brighter than the full moon moving from north to south in the Pittsburgh sky,” Cooke said. “That would have been pretty cool to see.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>When the scientists saw that an infrasound station had recorded noise around the same time as the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the mystery appeared to be solved.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It left no doubt that what was located over western Pennsylvania on New Year’s Day was a bolide breaking apart,” Cooke said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>While meteor explosions tend to prompt fears of falling, flaming rocks, Cooke said damage caused by the blast’s pressure is a much more realistic concern. Movies about meteor explosions, he added, are usually not accurate.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Cooke said he can’t speak to the specific imagery in “Don’t Look Up,” which is streaming on Netflix. He hasn’t seen it.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“These incidents of poaching highlight how vulnerable our wolf population is in Oregon,” Kamal said. She said she also expects the reward amount to increase in coming days.</p></div></div>
<div><p>High-schoolers tracked a wolf pack for years. The feds killed eight of the pups, conservationists say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In September, the <a>Biden administration said </a>it would conduct a review considering whether to restore federal protections for gray wolves in the western United States.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A wolf hunt blew past its kill quota in February. Another hunt is coming this fall.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Kamal said that without federal protections, “it becomes especially important to strengthen our anti-poaching laws in Oregon.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She argued the state has “made big strides” in the past couple of years, passing an anti-poaching measure in 2019 and launching an anti-poaching campaign to curb illegal wildlife killings.</p></div></div>
<div><p>An endangered wolf wandered 8,712 miles to find a mate. Her journey ended in tragedy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said that at the state level, a critical way to try to prevent wolf killings like the recent ones in Oregon is to “take it very seriously,” which he said state authorities are doing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nelson said incidents like the poisoning “bring into sharp relief” that there’s a “culture that thinks of nature in this way.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a lot of, I guess I would call it worldview remediation, that needs to take place at the same time,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In Rob Wild’s household, Christmas is a big deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The British expat who lives with his family in the Western Cape province of South Africa told a<b> </b>radio show Wednesday that each year, his wife, Marcela, and their children spend hours decorating the Christmas tree.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They go to town on this thing,” Wild said on “Kfm Mornings with Darren, Sherlin Sibs.” He said they “hand-make all these little decorations and load this thing up to the eyeballs.”</p></div></div>
<p>But they never expected to see something staring back at them from among the ornaments. After decking out the tree for the holidays, Wild said his family was admiring it while his 5-year-old daughter was rifling through the presents underneath.</p>
<div><div><p>That’s when they saw it: a long, winding boomslang — one of the most venomous snakes in Africa.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Maryland man pleads guilty to having venomous snakes in his home</p></div>
<div><p>Wild said “havoc” immediately ensued. Everyone leaped back and his wife, <a>who is from Costa Rica</a>, said “a few words in Spanish” that he did not want to repeat on the radio program, he said, laughing.</p></div>
<div><p>‘It’s moving and it’s huge!’: An 18-foot-long snake on a roof horrified a Detroit neighborhood</p></div>
<div><div><p>The boomslang, which means “tree snake,” is native to sub-Saharan Africa and can be found in the Western Cape and other areas, <a>according to the South African National Biodiversity Institute</a> (SANBI).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snake tends to keep to itself, “it can deliver a lethal bite if threatened,” SANBI stated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wild told “Kfm Mornings with Darren, Sherlin Sibs” that he had to special-order an artificial tree and have it shipped because his family wanted a fuller, thicker tree than they could find in the Western Cape.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s how much they value this tradition of the Christmas tree,” he said on the radio show.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It came up immediately as a boomslang,” the 55-year-old British stock-market trader <a>told CNN</a>. “I thought, ‘Holy Moses, this is the king of all poisonous snakes,’ ” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s when he called in a snake catcher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The catcher, Gerrie Heyns, told the radio show that it was the first snake he had ever pulled from a Christmas tree.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Heyns told CNN that the boomslang was a female measuring between 4.3 feet and 4.9 feet long.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it wasn’t all bad.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Once I had it under control, the family came right up to see the snake. It didn’t try to bite or be defensive because I gave it no reason to,” Heyns told CNN.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A scary moment turned into an exciting moment for the children,” he added.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Turns out Instagram isn’t just good for vacation photos and beauty tips.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An image posted on the social media platform has yielded a surprising discovery — a previously unknown species of snake.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ancient snakes had tiny little hind legs and hunted alongside dinosaurs</p></div>
<div><div><p>Now, all three have published a study describing a new species of snake they’re calling the Churah Valley Kukri (<i>Oligodon churahensis</i>).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The animal shares similarities with the common Kukri snake, a stripy, egg-eating reptile that isn’t venomous. The small snakes are common in India, and they aren’t shy of humans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They named it after the valley where Bhardwaj snapped that photograph.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By María Luisa Paúl</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 19, 2021|Updated December 19, 2021 at 2:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>As it seeks answers about the cosmos and what they mean for Earth’s origins, NASA on Friday announced a slew of discoveries about Jupiter. And scientists brought home an interstellar tune from the road.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it’s not exactly a song, or even perceptible to the human ear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Uncovering the secrets behind Jupiter’s workings could shed light on the evolution of other planets and the formation of the solar system itself, said Scott Bolton, the Juno mission’s principal investigator.</p></div></div>
<a> bullied other ancient planets</a> out of the solar system.
<div><p>More evidence that Jupiter kicked ancient planets out of the solar system</p></div>
<div><div><p>“What always impresses me is we wind up discovering all kinds of stuff that we never anticipated,” said Jack Connerney, Juno’s deputy principal investigator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The result, he said, are “spectacular aurorae, or tremendous depositions of energy.” Much like our own Northern Lights, but thousands of times brighter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the data generated by Juno, Connerney and his team were able to map Jupiter’s magnetic field. Their study also revealed that the dynamo action stems from metallic hydrogen beneath a layer of helium raindrops.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>not from its color but from how magnetic field lines are drawn — sporting blue when they go into the planet. It also offers clues about the planet’s workings.
<p>“This is really the first time that we’ve seen a magnetic field getting affected by the atmosphere,” he said. “It really demonstrates that its deep atmosphere is very dynamic, much more than people had thought.”</p>
<div><div><p>Uncovering Jupiter’s secrets, said Bolton, is a humbling experience — one that can make us feel like tiny specks but also reminds us of how much there is left to explore.</p></div></div>
<p>“Throughout history we often thought of ourselves as the center of everything because, in a sense, you’re looking out right from your own eyes and your own brain,” Bolton said. “But there are many things out there.”</p>

<p>In presenting Driskell as an artist, the Phillips Collection foregrounds his range. The first gallery in the show includes a religious painting, an mixed-media assemblage and an abstraction. But there’s more to these works than checking boxes.</p>
<p>During Driskell’s career, much of the art world (New York-centric, predominantly White) was resisting figuration and disavowing personal narrative for what was believed, perhaps naively, to be a universal, apolitical language of abstract form.</p>
