<p>Prince Andrew withdrew from public life after a car-crash BBC interview, but has since made a series of high-profile blunders.</p>
<p>Royals do not generally get cancelled, but the Duke of York has been metaphorically dethroned—twice—over his relationship with the convicted pedophile <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew lost his role as a U.K. government trade envoy in 2011, following criticism of his trip to see Epstein in New York after the disgraced financier had been released from prison.</p>
<p>Over the years that followed, civil lawsuits in the U.S. brought more details of the allegations against the prince into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Three months after Epstein died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019, the prince attempted to tell his side of the story to the BBC—but the interview with Emily Maitlis left his reputation in tatters.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II's second son was forced to step back from public life after he told Maitlis that the account of Virginia Giuffre, who accuses him of sexual assault, <a>could not be accurate because she described him sweating</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew denies all the sexual assault allegations.</p>
<p>During the BBC interview, the prince also attempted to defend his decision to stay at Epstein's New York mansion after the financier's criminal conviction for soliciting a minor, saying he wanted to end the friendship in person.</p>
<p><a>He told Maitlis</a>: "At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>"But at the time I felt it was the honorable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable, but that's just the way it is."</p>
<a>Prince Andrew</a> allowed himself to be drawn into a war of words with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York last summer.
<p>His lawyers responded to claims that he had refused to co-operate with the <a>FBI</a> investigation into Epstein by <a>claiming he was the one who had been treated badly</a>.</p>
<p>A statement from his law firm Blackfords read: "Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the U.S., he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen."</p>
<p>In the autumn, anonymous sources speaking in the British press claimed the prince was planning a comeback.</p>
<p>"It is his intention to return to public duties but none of this can seriously progress until the legal process in the U.S. has been resolved and the duke's side of the story has been properly explained."</p>
<p>The crowning moment in his post-interview myopia, however, came after the death of his father Prince Philip in April this year.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the Duke of York was back in the public eye, interviewed on camera about the impact that the death of the queen's husband was having on the royal family.</p>
<p>Within days, however, it emerged that he was attempting to turn an inch into a mile by demanding to wear an admiral's uniform to Philip's funeral.</p>
<p>Andrew is a vice-admiral but had been expecting a promotion on his 60th birthday, as is traditional for senior royals. However, his landmark birthday came in February 2020, after his retreat from public life, and the honor was not conferred.</p>
<p>Seemingly, he felt the promotion was still owed him even though he had been exiled in his grace-and-favor home, Royal Lodge, in the privacy of Windsor Great Park.</p>
<p>A source told Newsweek at the time: "The Duke of York is very keenly aware of Saturday's funeral being a moment for the Duke of Edinburgh, HM [Her Majesty the Queen] and the nation. He has neither wish nor intention to distract from that.</p>
<p>"Speculation on what he may or may not wear is just that, speculation, and no matters of this nature have yet been decided upon.</p>
<p>"The Duke of York will do what is appropriate to the circumstances—he remains stepped back from royal duties."</p>
<a>Prince Harry</a>, who stepped back from royal duties last year and so lost his honorary military titles.
<p>On Thursday, Andrew's representatives for the third day running told Newsweek there would be no comment on the <a>bombshell claims</a> made by Giuffre in the civil lawsuit filed in New York.</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, Giuffre's lawyer David Boies had a stark message for the man often described as the queen's favorite son.</p>
<p>He told British broadcaster ITV: "This case is not going away. Virginia Giuffre is not going to go away, and I'm not going to go away.</p>
<p>"This case is going to go forward, whatever obstacles that they try to put in front of us, we will overcome, once this case goes to court."</p>
<p>For now, mainstream media outlets have, by way of a denial of the allegations, been left quoting the interview that cost Prince Andrew his position.</p>
<p>Asked whether he had had sex with Giuffre, Andrew told the BBC in November 2019: "No, and without putting too fine a point on it, if you're a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody.</p>
<p>"You have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore, if you try to forget, it's very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything.</p>

<div> U.S. Court <a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a> <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a></div>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell's defense on Thursday appeared to be quickly unraveling, with witnesses called to the stand failing to offer the "shocking" revelations in the sex abuse trial promised by the British socialite's defense lawyers.</p>
<p>After a three-day hiatus, Maxwell's lawyers began making their case at the 59-year-old's trial. Called to the stand was an expert on "false memories," former employees of Maxwell, government officials, and travel agents.</p>
<p>But none appeared to be able to provide anything substantial that could overwhelmingly aid Maxwell's defense.</p>
<a>Epstein</a> between 1994 and 2004, and faces six counts of sex trafficking. She has maintained her innocence in the case and has pleaded not guilty to all counts.
<p>Four Maxwell accusers—Jane, Kate, Carolyn and Annie Farmer—in their testimonies have so far painted a <a>damaging picture</a> of the British socialite's alleged grooming behavior.</p>
<p>First to take the witness stand for Maxwell's defense on Thursday was Cimberly Espinosa, a former executive assistant to Maxwell between 1996 to 2002, who testified that she "<a>highly respected</a>" her former employer.</p>
<p>"I looked up to her very much," she said, testifying that she had never seen Maxwell or Epstein engage in inappropriate conduct with minors. "I actually learned a lot from her."</p>
<p>Espinosa described disgraced financier Epstein as "a giver" and a "generous" individual.</p>
<p>"I always knew him to be donating to charities and just being a kind person." Espinosa said, adding that he "paid for a personal trainer" for her.</p>
<a>Maxwell's sex abuse trial.</a>
<p>Maxwell's first accuser Jane testified on November 30 that the alleged abuse by Epstein began in the mid-1990s when she was 14. She said Maxwell was sometimes present during the encounters at the Palm Beach estate, and participated at times.</p>
<p>Corroborating Jane's testimony, Juan Alessi, a former manager of Epstein's Palm Beach house, testified on December 2 that Epstein had "many, many, many" female guests at the estate, including two who appeared to be underage.</p>
<p>Also called to the stand on Thursday was Elizabeth Loftus, a psychology professor at the <a>University of California</a>, Irvine, and an expert on "false memories."</p>
<p>She sought to discredit the accusers' testimonies by suggesting that their memories could be corrupted.</p>
<p>"Even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event suggestion," Loftus said. "False memories [...] can be very vivid, detailed. People can be confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even though they're false."</p>
<p>During cross-examination, U.S. prosecutor Lara Pomerantz sought to portray her as favoring defendants, and her testimony as irrelevant to the case.</p>
<p>"Have you conducted a study where you arranged for girls to be sexually abused?" Pomerantz asked.</p>
<p>"No, absolutely not," Loftus responded. She also said she had never carried out a study in which she tried to implant a false memory of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Pomerantz also noted that Loftus had written a book in 1991 titled, "Witness for the Defense." Loftus has only once before taken the stand for the prosecution in about 150 criminal trials.</p>
<p>"You wrote a book called 'Witness for the Defense?'" Pomerantz asked.</p>
<p>"You haven't written a book called 'Impartial Witness,' right?," Pomerantz hit back, to which Loftus responded: "I don't have a book by that title, no."</p>
<p>Raghu Sud, a former employee of a travel booking company used frequently by Maxwell in the late 90s and early 2000s also took to the stand, although it wasn't clear why he testified.</p>
<p>Maxwell's lawyers have said they plan to call 35 witnesses to the stand in her defense. The trial is expected to last into January 2022.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>Coronavirus</a> Public Health <a>Vaccination</a></div>
<p>I propose we look at Omicron a bit differently than <a>Democrats</a> want us to.</p>
<p>You needn't be a virologist to understand that COVID will not go away. Viruses seldom do. Indeed, the World Health Organization has only <a>classified</a> two viruses as having been eradicated: smallpox and rinderpest.</p>
<p>COVID will continue to mutate and spread. You can only mitigate its effects where you can and hope newer strains weaken.</p>
<a>studies</a> and significant anecdotal evidence show it to have a minor impact on one's health. It seems to be a tad stronger than the common cold for most people.
<p>In the context of a virus that will never go away, isn't this good news? Not that anyone should want or try to get COVID, but if the now-dominant strain is highly transmissible but weak, we can reach herd immunity all the faster.</p>
<p>Instead of panicking over even mild variants, we should mitigate where we can (including by being vaccinated), and move on with our lives with herd immunity in mind.</p>
<p>The Biden administration isn't moving on fast enough.</p>
<a>announced</a> the purchase of 500 million take-home tests. They will be delivered for free to any American who wants them. But that doesn't even start until next month. How much good will this do?
<p>We keep setting ourselves up to fight a losing battle to contain COVID. We can be reasonable and responsible while returning to a semi-normal life where we focus on protecting the most vulnerable and extending treatment to those who need it.</p>

<p>In other words, <a>Republicans</a> are rewarding people for refusing the vaccine.</p>

<p>Refuse the vaccine, as the Republican legislatures seem to incentivize their constituents to do, and your chances of a very bad ending if you get COVID skyrocket.</p>
<p>The pathway out of the pandemic is not "paved in freedom" for these states; it's paved in gravestones.</p>
<p>Which is the most perverse result of all. In their drive to oppose any and all Democratic policies, Republicans are leading their followers to an early grave. Truly, the Republican Party has turned into a death cult.</p>

<p>Energy security is the top priority in Bulgaria's foreign policy. Ensuring the diversity of energy supplies should be of utmost concern as a new government takes power after weeks of negotiations to form a strong working coalition.</p>
<p>When Bulgaria left the Soviet bloc, we had three important goals:</p>
<p>—Join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (<a>NATO</a>);</p>
<p>—Join the <a>European Union</a> (<a>EU</a>);</p>
<p>—Reduce Bulgarian reliance on Russian energy.</p>
<a>Russia supplies Bulgaria with around 95 percent of its natural gas,</a> and Bulgaria has sought unsuccessfully in the past to import gas from elsewhere, especially Azerbaijan.
<a>Russia also supplies approximately 90 percent of Bulgaria's refined petroleum products</a>, which are produced in a Soviet-era refinery that was privatized and acquired by Russian company Lukoil.
<p>We also need our allies to help us secure a sustainable and climate-friendly energy sector by exploring ways that we can use solar and other green technologies here in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Republicans, including the president, should be focused on opposing Democratic radicalism and winning future elections—not half-baked conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>But Trump and his supporters should be thinking about the future, not the past.</p>
<p>That's why he should concede the 2020 presidential election and allow the country to get on with the business of transitioning to a new administration.</p>
<a>"Flight 93" moment</a>, in which, as in 2016, the consequences of defeat would be an unthinkable disaster. But the struggle to save the country from the Left won't end in a flaming crash that will consume us all on the day that Trump leaves office.
<p>To the contrary, that struggle will go on. And, despite hard feelings about the way Trump has been treated and the insufferable hypocrisy of the Democrats and their media cheering section, the war isn't yet lost.</p>
<p>The GOP needs to be concentrating right now on something more important than venting resentment: for example, holding the Senate by prevailing in two eminently winnable Georgia runoffs against flawed Democratic opponents.</p>
<a>Rudy Giuliani</a>, that Trump won the election by a landslide and that Biden's Electoral College victory, or his nearly six million popular vote advantage is the result of the most massive conspiracy against American democracy since
<a>Vladimir Putin</a> stole the presidency from
<a>Hillary Clinton</a>, none of that will happen.
<p>Yet if Trump's mission is to continue fighting for the issues and the citizens he championed in office, he needs to put the country out of its misery and prepare to move on in order to give himself and the GOP a chance to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The Democrats' Russia collusion myths undermined the norms of democracy, as well as national security, by casting a shadow over Trump's foreign policy agenda. But stalling on concession is now doing much the same thing.</p>
<p>Giving up on 2020 isn't a betrayal of Trump voters. Nor would it be a case of Republicans once again being conned into behaving like docile losers, in the spirit of <a>John McCain</a> and <a>Mitt Romney</a>'s all-too-gentlemanly campaigns.</p>

<a>Brett Kavanaugh</a> and Barrett—joined Alito and Clarence Thomas to create a majority that sought to restore the First Amendment to its former status as the indomitable source of our first freedoms.

<p>In the middle of a pandemic, racial unrest and the most bitterly contested presidential election in memory, it's largely gone unnoticed. But for many liberals, it's just one more reason to loathe the Trump presidency.</p>
<a>according to Gallup</a>. But since then, support for the death penalty has steadily declined, with a September 2020 Gallup poll showing that just 55 percent supported it. That's the lowest such figure in more than 50 years.
<p>The reasons for this decline are not hard to understand.</p>
<a>William Barr</a> were correct in insisting that the decisions of the judges and the juries in these cases be left untouched.
<a>Kim Kardashian</a> West, who had successfully appealed to the White House in another case, also asked Trump to stop Bernard's execution.
<p>While he may have been young, Bernard was an adult and therefore responsible for his actions when he helped murder the Bagleys in the sort of callous and gruesome fashion that is a prerequisite for a death penalty sentence.</p>
<p>Even if we were to dismiss the idea that the death penalty is a deterrent to future murder, such acts of depraved indifference to innocent life cry out for more than just the usual platitudes about preserving the lives of even the worst criminals.</p>
