<div> Culture Prince Andrew <a>Meghan Markle</a> <a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a></div>
<p>Meghan Markle could be called to testify in the lawsuit against Prince Andrew, a lawyer has said.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex has been named as a potential candidate to help Virginia Roberts Giuffre in her legal case against the royal.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew is currently being sued by Giuffre who says that the Duke of York sexually abused her when she was 17.</p>
<p>Giuffre, who is now 38, alleges that the queen's son assaulted her on three separate occasions in London, New York, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew has denied all allegations against him.</p>
<p>David Boies, the attorney representing Giuffre has said that Markle has "important knowledge," about Prince Andrew's behavior that would help the case.</p>
<p>"She is somebody we can count on to tell the truth," Boies told The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>He added that <a>Meghan Markle</a> was a "close companion to Prince Andrew and therefore probably saw what he did."</p>
<p>The attorney also listed three reasons as to why the former Suits star could be a potential deposition subject.</p>
<p>"Because of her past association with him, she may very well have important knowledge, and will certainly have some knowledge.</p>
<p>"Three; she is somebody who we can count on, to tell the truth. She checks all three boxes," the lawyer added.</p>
<p>Boies confirmed that no official decision has been made regarding Meghan Markle being called to testify yet.</p>
<p>He added that they are interested in calling other people from Prince Andrew's life as deposition subjects.</p>
<p>"We would likely take one or two depositions of people close to Andrew who would have knowledge of his actions," he said. "That might include his ex-wife. It could possibly be his brother."</p>
<p>As for the queen, Boise ruled out calling the monarch to testify.</p>
<p>"I don't think, out of respect and deference, and her age, we would seek to depose the Queen," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think she is going to have any knowledge that other people don't have. I think that he is unlikely to have spoken as freely to his mother about some of this stuff as he might have to his contemporaries or his ex-wife," he added.</p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Prince Andrew Hypocritical for Framing Epstein Accuser as Money Grabbing—Author</h1><div> By Jack Royston <time>On 12/13/21 at 10:43 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Prince Andrew is a hypocrite for letting his lawyers frame his Jeffrey Epstein accuser as motivated by money when <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> is paying his legal fees, a royal author tells Newsweek.</p>
<p>Virginia Giuffre is <a>suing Queen Elizabeth II's son</a>, saying he sexually assaulted her while she was a 17-year-old trafficking victim.</p>
<p>However, the Duke of York's legal team launched an attack on Giuffre's credibility, arguing she "profited from her allegations against Epstein" <a>in a court filing at the end of October</a>.</p>
<p>Nigel Cawthorne, Andrew's biographer, told Newsweek: "Andrew can hardly use that strategy when he has his mother to pay for his defense.</p>
<p>Andrew is preparing to try to get the case thrown out in January but even as his lawyers prepare their strategy, his name has been referenced several times in the <a>high-profile trafficking trial</a> of his former friend <a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a photo was released of Jeffrey Epstein with his arm over Maxwell's shoulder relaxing at the queen's log cabin at the 95-year-old monarch's Scottish retreat Balmoral.</p>
<p>Cawthorne told Newsweek: "The interesting question is who took the picture, was it Andrew himself taking it? They are certainly under pressure. It doesn't seem to be in his nature to be forthcoming about these things at all.</p>
<p>"Obviously a picture is worth a thousand words but we did know that Ghislaine and Epstein were brought into the royal world and indeed <a>Harvey Weinstein</a> at one bash."</p>
<p>Ingrid Seward, author of biography Prince Philip Revealed, told Newsweek <a>Prince Andrew</a> may play an increasingly big role in the queen's life following the death of her husband in April.</p>
<p>"He certainly sees her every Sunday for tea. I should think he sees her more often than that. With Philip gone he's there to go and pop up to see if mom's alright. Anything that goes on, she can pick up a phone and he's there."</p>
<p>"Most people could only dream of obtaining the sums of money that Giuffre has secured for herself over the years.</p>
<p>"This presents a compelling motive for Giuffre to continue filing frivolous lawsuits against individuals such as Prince Andrew, whose sullied reputation is only the latest collateral damage of the Epstein scandal."</p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Queen Elizabeth II 'Put Her Faith in' Prince Andrew Despite Epstein Lawsuit—Expert</h1><div> By Jack Royston <time>On 12/20/21 at 8:08 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II has "put her faith in" Prince Andrew despite the <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>-related sexual abuse lawsuit against him in New York.</p>
<p>The Duke of York is being sued by Virginia Giuffre who says she was forced to have sex with him in London, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands when she was 17. Prince Andrew has denied all the allegations.</p>
<p>Andrew's attempts to get the case thrown out have seen his lawyers attack a New York law, the Child Victims Act, which gave thousands of sex abuse victims hope as it gave them the right to sue their abusers years later.</p>
<p>However, he has told his mother, the queen, he is innocent and she is standing by him, according to royal author Katie Nicholl.</p>
<p>In a segment due to air on Wednesday, the royal correspondent, who wrote Harry: Life, Loss, and Love, told The Royal Beat: "My understanding is she has had full and frank discussions with Andrew.</p>
<p>"He has assured her that he is innocent, and she has put her faith in him. And I think the position she finds herself in is twofold. There's a dichotomy here.</p>
<p>"But of course the other role she fulfills is the role of mother, and we are seeing her standing by Andrew whether that's riding out with him at Windsor or just simply having him there.</p>
<p>"Who did he run to when the lawyers were trying to deliver him the papers? His mother."</p>
<p>A recent filing by Andrew's team read: "Giuffre's refusal to include anything but the most conclusory allegations is puzzling given her pattern of disclosing to the media the purported details of the same allegations included in the Complaint.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is Giuffre's tendency to change her story that prompted her to keep the allegations of the Complaint vague, so as not to commit to any specific account.</p>
<p>"Whatever the motivating factor, Giuffre's Complaint is deficient and fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."</p>

<a>Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) and local law enforcement agencies across the country.
<p>"Grooming can be defined as behaviors an offender engages in to gain access to potential victims, maintain access to those victims, and prevent those victims from disclosure," Turner said.</p>
<p>"This is so that other people cannot confront or question what they may perceive as strange or inappropriate behavior, talking, and touching between the offender and the victim," Turner told Newsweek.</p>
<p>"So, by isolating the victim across time, the offender ensures that the only thing the victim hears and sees is what the offender wants them to hear and see."</p>
<p>The second element is "normalizing" sex between adults and children. And once predators successfully isolate victims, the third element creeps in: a gradual pace.</p>
<p>"In that context, where no one else can raise questions about their behavior or their statements, the offender will slowly—in a graduated manner—normalize sex," Turner said.</p>
<p>In the context of Epstein's predatory acts, Turner said: "Ms. Maxwell is there, a woman, ensuring [the victims] all is well and normal."</p>
<p>During the trial, victims spoke of trusting Maxwell, who, they said, was the point person in introducing them to Epstein, giving them instructions, setting up "appointments," and buying them gifts.</p>
<p>One victim said Maxwell touched her breast and examined her naked body when she was 14 years old. Another similarly reported Maxwell touching her breasts during a massage when she was 16.</p>

<div> News Coronavirus <a>Los Angeles</a> <a>Hospital</a></div>
<p>The owner of private autopsy company 1-800 autopsy, Vidal Herrera, agreed with the witness and said people from his company had seen "piled up bloody body bags."</p>
<p>The hospital released a statement to explain the situation and their actions. It read: "Because of the overcrowding situation, hospital administrators took action yesterday to organize the outdoor cooling unit in a more orderly fashion.</p>
<p>"Hospital protocol calls upon security guards to assist in the process when mortuaries come to pick up bodies, primarily helping to lift and move the bodies.</p>
<p>"While the outside cooling unit was being better organized, the hospital engaged Environmental Services staff to clean the unit. That is why some of the bodies were removed from the unit for a brief period."</p>
<p>The hospital said that their morgue is small and can only hold 6 bodies. They added this has proven to be inadequate space as they deal with an influx of COVID-19 deaths and non-COVID-19 related deaths.</p>
<p>The hospital denies the suggestion that the bodies were not properly cared for and said they were kept at the correct temperature.</p>
<p>The witness has disagreed with this claim based on the fluid she saw on the body bags and at the scene. She told CBS Los Angeles: "Impossible, those bodies were defrosted, they were decomposing, you can see blood."</p>
<p>The witness also spoke to <a>Fox</a> 11 News and detailed what she believes was happening.</p>
<p>Speaking with Fox 11 News, Herrera said his company was picking up a body at the hospital and saw the "piled up bloody body bags and didn't know what to do."</p>
<p>While being shown images of the body bags he said the fluid seen was blood and it would not be there if they were kept at the right temperature and if the body bags were secure.</p>
<p>Regarding the body bags having temperature issues based on the pictures, he continued: "I see an indication of temperature issues because they are slightly decomposed. Those bodies are in bad condition, they have been like that for a while."</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the Memorial Hospital of Gardena for comment.</p>

<p>"On this morning's call with nine different health systems from around the state, they emphasized they're being inundated with people who need to be tested but aren't experiencing severe symptoms," Kemp said.</p>
<p>"The number one ask for them was to tell people don't come to the emergency room to get tested."</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said it will be a "bumpy road" to low COVID levels.</p>

<p>"Ending health inequity remains the key to ending the pandemic," he said.</p>
<p>Tedros added that he is "optimistic" that in the next year, "we can not only end the acute stage of the pandemic" but "chart a path to stronger health security."</p>

<h3>New Year's fireworks show canceled in San Francisco</h3>
<p>San Francisco's New Year's Eve fireworks show has been canceled due to a surge in COVID-19 cases and the impact on staffing levels.</p>
<p>Mayor London Breed and public safety leaders made the announcement Tuesday.</p>
<p>"While we are all understandably eager to ring in a new year with San Francisco's customary New Year's Eve fireworks show, we must remain vigilant in doing all we can to stop the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant," Breed said in a statement.</p>
<p>"After closely monitoring local health indicators, the decision to cancel is a proactive measure that will best protect SF essential front-line workers," the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (SFDEM) tweeted Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to SFDEM, 84 percent of eligible San Franciscans are fully vaccinated and 55 percent have received a booster dose.</p>

<p>In a press briefing Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is chief medical advisor to the president, said that as of today, it doesn't look like a vaccine mandate for air travel is coming anytime soon.</p>
<p>Fauci also noted that if there is a need to do something beyond the mask mandate, they will consider that.</p>
<p>"So it's just keeping an open mind that the situation may change but at this particular time, we do not feel that is necessary to make that a requirement for domestic flights."</p>
<h3>Fauci suggests skipping large New Year's gatherings</h3>

<h3>COVID cases spike 60 percent across U.S., fewer deaths reported</h3>
<p>COVID-19 cases are up 60 percent this week across the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 7-day daily average of new cases is 240,400, an increase of 60 percent from the week prior.</p>
<p>"In a few short weeks, Omicron has rapidly increased across the country and we expect it will continue to circulate in the coming weeks," she said.</p>
<p>The 7-day average of hospitalization admissions is about 9,000 per day, up 14 percent from the week prior.</p>
<p>The 7-day average of new deaths is about 1,100 per day, a decrease of 7 percent from the previous week.</p>
<h3>CDC director gives update on guidelines for people who test positive</h3>
<p>During a White House COVID news briefing Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky explained the science of the new isolation guidelines for a person who tests positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>"We know that after five days, people are much less likely to transmit the virus, and that masking further reduces that risk."</p>
<p>Walensky stated that people can remain PCR positive up to 12 weeks after infection.</p>
<p>She said if you have COVID, you can prevent transmission to others by wearing a mask, and if you are exposed to COVID, prevent further spread in time before symptoms develop by quarantining for the recommended five days.</p>
<p>"We are standing on the shoulders of two years of science, two years of understanding transmissibility," Walensky said of the updated isolation guidance.</p>
<h3>The CDC explains COVID test use</h3>
<p>During a television interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky gave an in-depth overview of the new COVID tests and their effectiveness against Omicron.</p>
<p>Walensky stated, "We do know the most sensitive test you can do is a PCR test. If you have symptoms and you have a negative antigen test then we do ask you to go get a PCR to make sure that those symptoms are not attributable to COVID."</p>
<p>Walensky also said the antigen tests work "quite well" in detecting COVID and that the CDC is still encouraging the use of the antigen tests.</p>
<h3>FDA considers expanding booster shots to ages 12 to 15</h3>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could soon make a decision on booster shots for Americans between 12 and 15 years old.</p>
<p>In an interview Tuesday morning on CNN, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said the FDA is currently looking into the issue.</p>
<p>"Of course, the CDC will swiftly follow as soon as we hear from them, and I'm hoping to have that in the days to weeks ahead," she said.</p>
<p>In early December, the <a>CDC recommended booster shots</a> for everyone 16 and older.</p>
<h3>Global COVID cases up 11%, WHO reports</h3>
<p>Global COVID-19 cases were up 11 percent last week from the previous week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday.</p>
