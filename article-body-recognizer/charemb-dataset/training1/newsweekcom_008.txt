<p>The Caring Corps could start at 100,000 elders helping young children read, learn, and develop, then climb to 1 million elders over the six years of the administration's early childhood mobilization and investment.</p>

<a>Foster Grandparent</a> program, a War on Poverty creation from the 1960s that helps lower-income older people become grandparent-like figures to young people, including children at Head Start centers and preschools. This year,
<a>20,000</a> Foster Grandparents are working as
<a>AmeriCorps Seniors</a> in all 50 states, many devoting 20 hours a week to the children in their care.

<a>more than 100</a> other places across the country, preschools are located adjacent to senior centers and housing, providing daily opportunities for connection. At the

<p>The payoff of a vast intergenerational Caring Corps will be enormous, for the youngest generation, for older people themselves, and for our sense of interdependence and connectedness across the ages.</p>

<a>Black Lives Matter</a> protesters and Democratic "Marxist-communist" agents. Greene and Representative
<a>Madison Cawthorn</a>, a Republican from North Carolina, have referred to some of the insurrectionists as "political prisoners."
<p>Republicans approve of that sort of talk. The October Quinnipiac poll found that while 94 percent of Democrats insist Trump is undermining democracy, 85 percent of Republicans say he's protecting it.</p>
<a>Steve King</a>, long known as someone unafraid to say out loud what many other Republicans are thinking, is confident that his party is better armed. "Folks keep talking about another civil war," he posted to
<a>Facebook</a> in 2019. "One side has about 8 trillion bullets... Wonder who would win?"

<a>Democrats</a> are suddenly energized, believing that an ugly primary fight on the Republican side could open the door for an upset in November.

<a>Joe Biden</a> and Vice President
<a>Kamala Harris</a>, desperately tried to make the race all about Trump. And it's no wonder—Virginia had become an increasingly blue state, voting for former President

<h3>2. Consider Maintenance Levels</h3>
<h3>3. Give Perennials a Try</h3>
<p>Perennials are aesthetically pleasing for years to come. It's no wonder they are the staple plant in flower beds. For a professional looking landscape in far less time, perennials are the way to go.</p>
<p>When planting trees, a little bit of planning goes a long way. From deciding on a color scheme to thinking about a growth pattern, you'll know exactly what you want for years to come with a little forethought.</p>
<p>Once planted, the bare root tree will lose its dormancy as it's growing season begins and leaf or bloom accordingly. This affordable way to plant trees makes it easier for beginning gardeners to get started in landscaping.</p>
<p>With these planting principles, homeowners can join the gardening trend and beautify their space whether they have a green thumb or not. As hobby gardening continues to climb, all will enjoy the benefits of environmental restoration.</p>

<li>If you engage with a reader or the public, you must be respectful and civil at all times. No profanity, no ad hominem attacks.</li>
<li>If you are contacted about a possible error in your story, examine the question fairly, with an open mind.</li>
<li>If we have indeed erred, you are responsible for writing a correction, noting that at the bottom of the story and notifying your editor and the editor-in-chief.</li>
<li>We make any needed corrections promptly and transparently.</li>
<li>If we need to retract a story, we do so transparently. We do not unpublish or "disappear" problem copy.</li>

<p>"Valuable aggregation does two things well: It discovers relevant news stories and highlights the most relevant parts of those stories." —Jeff Sonderman, digital media fellow, the Poynter Institute</p>
<li>Credit the source or sources of the story in the second paragraph. Explicitly name-check them: "the BBC reported" or "according to The Guardian" or whatever is the case.</li>
<li>Newsweek reporters should use anonymous sources only rarely, in consultation with their editors (at least one of whom must know the identity of the source).</li>
<li>Essentially, try to fact-check your story by using as many sources as possible.</li>
<li>Use only credible sources. The Associated Press is a good source. Wikipedia is not.</li>
<li>If in any doubt about the source or material, don't do the story.</li>
<p>Follow the <a>Newsweek Style Guide here</a>.</p>
<li>In general, we avoid profanity, especially in headlines, and use it only in quotations where it is relevant and necessary.</li>
<li>We do not publish nude photos (or links to them) or grisly, graphic images.</li>
<li>We never spell out the n-word.</li>
<p>Plagiarism is the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.</p>
<p>The company has a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism and fabrication, and violation of this policy will be considered a gross misconduct offense that may result in immediate termination of employment on the first offense (summary dismissal).</p>
<p>It is at the manager's discretion to determine how much content is required to constitute plagiarism.</p>
<p>Fabrication of any extent is unacceptable.</p>
<li>The most common instances of plagiarism involve replicating text published by another person or organization without attribution.</li>
<li>Editorial staff are strictly prohibited from using someone else's work as his or her own.</li>
<li>Plagiarism occurs when portion(s) of text have been cut and pasted, without citing where the text originally came from. Editorial staff must gather and verify every piece of information that is included in their final product.</li>
<li>It is not acceptable to merely make minor modifications to another publication's wording or to duplicate its story structure. Writers should produce stories with original phrasing and structure and with additional information and context.</li>
<li>On the rare occasion when we can't confirm a critical fact that another publication has reported, we must credit the fact to that publication. If you are ever unsure about the use of such material, consult your manager or editor-in-chief.</li>
<li>It is not acceptable to cut and paste paragraphs from one of your previous stories into another one.</li>
<li>It is not acceptable to use your own words if they were published by another publication; it is also a violation of the rules to use the words of your Newsweek colleagues (except in a brief quotation, explicitly attributed and linked).</li>
<li>Notify your manager or editor-in-chief if you feel that another publication has plagiarized your work.</li>
<p>SUICIDE, MASS SHOOTINGS AND OTHER DEATHS:</p>
<p>Mass casualty events are always confusing; do not rely on information from social media.</p>
<ul><li>Do not identify suspects or cite a number of victims until there is official confirmation.</li><li>Do not use social media to report a profile of a suspected killer or victim. It's all too easy to be mistaken.</li></ul>
<p><a>Poynter's Guidelines</a> for covering mass shootings</p>
<p>When writing about a suicide:</p>
<li>Do not describe the method. Do not give specifics. Do not say how painful or otherwise.</li>
<li>Do not speculate about a proximate cause—a lost job or relationship break-up, for example.</li>
<li>Never write that someone "committed" suicide—this is a dated phrase from a time when suicide was a crime. It no longer is. Use "died by suicide" or "took his/her own life."</li>
<li>Do not publish the contents of a suicide note (unless the family has purposely made it public).</li>
<p>The Poynter Institute offers <a>further guidelines here</a>.</p>
<p>Some guidelines for covering deaths of celebrities:</p>
<li>Cause of death only if not suicide;</li>
<li>Limit of five stories on the subject;</li>
<li>No stand-alone coverage of children if they are minors (they can be mentioned in the main story).</li>
<li>No stand-alone coverage of former partners (who are no longer tied to the subject) unless relevant.</li>
<li>Net worth only if the individual's wealth is central to who they were.</li>
<ul><li>Quotes</li><li>Reaction to passing</li><li>Life in pictures</li><li>Highlights of career</li></ul>
<p>WRITING ABOUT SCIENCE/HEALTH STUDIES:</p>
<p>In general, do not base a story on a single study. There are cases where doing so is a reader service as long as we're careful to present the study in context and with appropriate caveats.</p>
<li>Be clear about whether what you're writing about is a study, an opinion piece or a review of the literature.</li>
<li>Don't oversell the results. Is it actually a cure, or just a new avenue for further research? Does it delay or diminish symptoms, undo damage, prevent a syndrome or disease from developing? Make sure the headline is nuanced as well as the story..</li>
<li>Be explicit about the methodology and its implications. Were the test subjects animal or human? How big was the test sample? How did researchers measure the results? Was there a control group?</li>
<li>Also put the issue itself into context: How many people are affected by this, and how serious is it? How might this research change how we address a problem like climate change or a challenge like a Mars mission?</li>
<li>Assess the "cons" of the treatment—price, availability, known or possible side effects. Is the treatment studied the only one of its kind or are other treatments available?</li>
<li>Identify any conflicts of interest—the group or industry that sponsored the study, for example.</li>

<div> News NBA <a>Coronavirus</a> <a>Basketball</a></div>
<a>CDC</a>) shortened required isolation time for someone who tests COVID-positive and presents no symptoms to five days, the
<a>NBA</a> informed teams their players and staff can return in six days instead of 10, if they're asymptomatic and meet other standards.
<p>Teams were informed of the policy updates Monday in a memo obtained by t<a>he Associated Press</a>, and come as dozens of NBA players and coaches have tested positive, forcing them to miss several games in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Ninety-seven percent of NBA players are fully vaccinated, and at least 65 percent of eligible players have received a booster shot, according to the NBA.</p>
<p>The decision from the NBA comes after a change in <a>NFL</a> COVID <a>policy was announced</a> earlier this month, allowing vaccinated players to return to play after 10 days rather than having to test negative to return to their team.</p>
<p>The NBA told teams the change "reflects analysis of testing data that the league and its infectious disease experts and epidemiologists have gathered throughout the pandemic," according to the AP.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven NBA players entered the league's health and safety protocols Sunday, a new single-day high this season, and 205 players have been placed in the protocols over the course of the season, <a>according to ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>The CDC said evidence shows people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.</p>
<p>The NBA's changes were made in agreement with the National Basketball Players Association.</p>
<p>A pair of coaches — Phoenix's Monty Williams and Portland's Chauncey Billups — entered the NBA's health and safety protocols Monday.</p>
<p>The Blazers said the team will be coached by assistant Scott Brooks, a longtime head coach, during Billups' absence.</p>
<p>The count of players in the NBA's protocols remained around 120 on Monday afternoon, with no fewer than 63 players ruled out from among the seven games on the day's schedule because of virus-related issues.</p>
<p>Among the notable additions to the list is Olympic gold medalist Jayson Tatum, placed into protocols by the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Atlanta listed 12 players as out — 10 for virus reasons and two for injuries — for its game against Chicago, but the Hawks said guard Trae Young was cleared to return, making the announcement about 90 minutes before tipoff.</p>
<p>Teams that have been hit particularly hard by virus-related issues have been able to cobble together rosters over the last couple weeks primarily by signing players to 10-day hardship deals.</p>
<p>Tatum was one of 15 players — eight Celtics and seven Timberwolves — ruled out of the Boston-Minnesota game for virus issues.</p>
