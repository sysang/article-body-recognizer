<h2> How our basic feelings work </h2>

<p>“I view affect as the primary innate biological motivating mechanism, more urgent than drive, deprivation, and pleasure, and more urgent even than physical pain. ”</p>
<p>– Silvan Tomkins, in Demos, 1995, p. 86</p>
<h3>In last month’s newsletter…</h3>
<a>Shame</a> | Disgust | Dissmell
<h3>How Might Feelings Work?</h3>
<h3> Surprise, Fear, and Interest</h3>
<p>For many of the feelings, the type of feeling (facial expression) seems to depend on the rate of increase (i.e. speed) of the incoming stimulus.</p>
<p>Resetting: Surprise (resets the <a>nervous system</a>, to prepare for the next stimulus)</p>
<p>Negative: Distress; Anger; Fear; Shame; Disgust (a reaction to noxious tastes); Dissmell (a reaction to noxious odors)</p>
<p>Next Month… This month we explored how Surprise, Fear, Interest, Distress, and Anger are triggered. Next month we will examine the other four primary affects: Enjoyment, Shame, Disgust, and Dissmell.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2>How to Read Between the Lines With Greater Comprehension</h2> <p>If we can't admit that we need self-affirmation, we're likely to overlook and mismanage one of the fundamental subtexts of human life. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Giving Up Can Make a Great New Year’s Resolution</a></h2> <p>Sometimes, liberating ourselves from old commitments and obligations is more practical than creating new ones.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Soulful Season and the Growing Demand-Chain Shortage</a></h2> <p>Some reflections on this poignant season, inspired by the 1919 tune "How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paree?"</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>You’re a Being Who Tries, but What Are Beings and What Is Trying?</a></h2>
<p>We're all selves trying to figure out what's worth our effort? But what are selves and effort? For all of our detailed research, life and social scientists still don't know.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How Hypocrisy Becomes the Mind-Numbing Norm</a></h2> <p>To win arguments, we draw hard moral lines that make us sound good and our opponents bad — but with no commitment to living by the standards we set. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>More Precise Generalizations Will Make You Wiser Faster</a></h2> <p>Convince yourself you're not a self? Choose determinism? Love is the answer? These self-contradictions can inspire a better understanding of who you are. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Humbly Humble People Who Will Do Anything to Avoid Humility</a></h2> <p>Examining a pivotal question in psychology: how to tell if someone is an a-hole.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Under-Appreciated Virtue of Virtual Status</a></h2> <p>Crave more status than you've got? You're not alone. Here's a Neo-Epicurian cure for what ails us.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Huge Psych Question that Many Social Scientists Ignore</a></h2> <p>A Personal Perspective: Social scientists speak two languages and haven't known how to translate between them. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Stop Getting Suckered By People Who Agree With You</a></h2> <p>To be a more critical thinker, get good at spotting the rhetorical pandering in arguments that you support. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>How To Stop Beating Yourself Up and Enjoy Reality</a></h2>
<p>Though unrealistic, moralizing is tempting but comes at a cost. Some people beat themselves up with it and some just use it to beat other people up. Here's the saner alternative. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Unsung Benefit of a Mind at Ease: Exploratory Range</a></h2> <p>Want peace of mind? Try curiosity. Want curiosity? Cultivate peace of mind.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Romantic Fatalist</a></h2> <p>We all need dreams of happily ever after. If we don't manage them well, they become dangerous. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Living with the Tension Between Hope and Realism</a></h2>
<p>A Personal Perspective: Though hope and realism are both touted as virtues, they often conflict. We would be wiser if we could admit to our ambivalent relationship with both.</p>
<h2><a>Free Will Versus Determinism Is the Wrong Question</a></h2>
<p>The free will debate goes around in circles because it ignores explaining what will really is, starting with the "struggle for existence," which Darwin assumed and didn't explain.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Life Gives You Banana Peels—or, Why I Am an Ironist </a></h2> <p>Evolution explains why serious, playful irony is the most adaptive attitude.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Origins of Life Researcher Suggests Living Is Like Driving</a></h2> <p>A hippie turned "origins of life" researcher returns to the metaphor of life as navigating a winding, forking road. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Humans Adapt to What's True, Popular and Stress-Reducing</a></h2> <p>Expecting humans to be realistic is unrealistic. We're all trying to be realistic, popular, and at peace within ourselves. There are tradeoffs.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Is the Universe or Its Spirit Trying to Connect Us? </a></h2> <p>Science suggests the universe is heavily biased toward connection, but that we are much more selective about it, trying to connect with what's good, not bad for us.</p> </div>
<h2><a>"And Yet...": Wiser Words for Dealing with Life's Reversals</a></h2>
<p>To track reality's reversals – lifes' winding, switchback roads, cultivate the words and wisdom by which to notice the differences that make a difference. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Strategic Distancing, Upstaging and Jading</a></h2> <p>If your willpower isn't enough to keep temptations at bay, there are other options.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>I Once Was Lost But Now I'm Blind Syndrome</a></h2> <p>Often, we drop a dogma without letting go of the high-horse self-certainty we gained from it. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Virtue-Maxing: A Stupifying, Universally-Popular Moral Myth</a></h2>
<p>Stop worrying that you're failing to maximize some popular virtue as though one always should? Virtue maximizing is extremely popular nonsense that will dumb you down. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Trap of Over-accommodating Others </a></h2> <p>Why did you let them walk all over you? Perhaps because you subscribed to the half-truism that we should give everyone the benefit of the doubt.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Sophology: Research to Understand What Wisdom Really Is</a></h2> <p>We all know wisdom is good. We quest for it and sometimes claim to have it. But what the heck is wisdom anyway? Without a science of wisdom, it's anyone's guess. </p> </div>
<h2><a>For Genius Like Theirs, Cultivate Your Inversatility</a></h2>
<p>There are two sides to every coin. More of something is less of other things. This simple insight has led to many scientific breakthroughs and could explain life itself.</p>
<h2><a>The Silent Self: You, Beneath Thought and Feeling</a></h2>
<p>We feel and think about ourselves a lot. And we tend to overlook our vegetative sentience, our silent selfhood, unconscious and unfelt even though it's what keeps us alive. </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Tricked Into Choices You Regret? Here’s the Trick They Used</a></h2> <p>Weaponized words will change your life, usually for the worst. But what does it mean to weaponize? Here's the answer from linguistics. </p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Do You Allow Yourself to Be Bullied and Gaslit?</a></h2>
<p>When barked at, conscientious people tend to back down and back off. That's a great reflex for dealing with other conscientious people but terrible when dealing with total jerks.</p>
<h2><a>The Dark Triad Shell Game Explained</a></h2>
<p>The four traits universal to all organisms become the four traits we idealize as infinite in our understanding of God—and then become the four traits essential to the Dark Triad personality (yes, four).</p>

<h1> Can You Escape Bias? </h1>
<h2> How looking beyond first impressions can help us see more clearly. </h2>
<a>unconscious</a> biases that influence our judgments about people's character, ability, and potential. Implicit
<a>bias</a>, according to their findings, is inevitable.
<p>I was on the receiving end of this when my uncle was placed in rehab to get his bearings after a major health scare left him reeling.</p>
<p>The whole exercise was blasphemy. He was clearly showing off, sabotaging any chance of forming a meaningful rapport with my uncle, or actually being able to (imagine it!) help him. </p>
<p>I managed to remember what I learned on my yoga mat earlier that day and took as much breath in as humanly possible. I then retorted, "I'm Dr. Kris." Emphasis doctor. (I don't often pull out The Doctor Card, but if there was ever a time...)</p>
<a>lying</a>. My friends in STEM fields get a lot of silence when they bring up their professional life. No curious questions, no meaningful dialogue, just blank stares and quick-conversational-exit-strategies.
<a>groupthink</a> wants to swallow up anyone falling outside of their prescriptive narrow bounds of acceptance.
<p>I have a novel idea: Maybe, instead of fighting, we can work together to help each other out with this. We need to acknowledge:</p>
<a>career</a>-driven, brilliant and vulnerable, feminine and masculine, powerful and nurturing, serious and silly, and more. We have many sides, stories, and identities. When we move beyond limited social constructs, we are far better off.
<a>gender</a>, social class, ability, or
<a>sexual orientation</a> has overcome odds and continues to wade through institutionalized ism's — but s/he is not some novelty or token role model and doesn't need you to treat her/him like s/he is some big success story.
<p>7. It'd help if we took a cue from Aretha: R-e-s-p-e-c-t everyone you meet. Assume they are important. Everyone is.</p>

<h1> The Art of High-Stakes Psychological Diagnosis Pt. 2 </h1>
<h2> Skillful name-calling for healthier social relationships </h2>
<p> Posted November 30, 2016 </p>
<p>And to be clear, I don’t have any problem with name calling. We all do it, directly, indirectly or under our breath. There’s nothing morally wrong with name calling. If there were, then calling Hitler a monster would be immoral.</p>
<p>To choose the right name requires thinking about three distinct questions:</p>
<ol><li>What’s the problem behavior?</li> <li>What motivates the problem behavior?</li> <li>What diagnosis and strategy will be most effective in modifying the behavior?</li> </ol>

<p>So there we get one possible motivation for the problematic behavior. According to Hoffer, true believers (in my diagnosis, people who employ the know-it-all formula) are motivated by insecurity.</p>
<a>lying</a> hypocrites, or they could know those risks well, but be so eager to feel smart that it’s worth the risk. They could be highly sophisticated manipulative leaders or very naïve followers. And this is just to name a few motivations.

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Taking Shame Out of the Suicide Conversation</a></h2> <p>For multiple reasons, promoting shame-based messages is ineffective as a strategy in preventing suicide. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> Expectations and Cancer: Does How We Think Matter? </h1>
<h2> New research explores how expectations relate to cancer prevention and treatment </h2>
<p> Posted January 16, 2017 </p>
<a>diet</a> regime! Thus, our expectations are connected to our health. New research is showing that expectations also can have an impact vis-à-vis cancer prevention and treatment.
<a>stressful</a>. To examine this phenomenon,
<a>postmenopausal</a> women at risk for breast cancer who were enrolled in a randomized trial of an internet-based cancer chemoprevention decision aid were queried about how they expected taking the medication would make them feel.
<sup>4</sup> Similarly, in a longitudinal study, prostate cancer patients who had more positive prostate cancer-specific expectations before their surgery (i.e., regarding anticipated urinary problems, satisfaction with
<a>confidence</a> in sexual abilities, affection from their partners, making informed treatment decisions, regret about treatment decisions, worry about health, and outcomes of cancer treatment) had superior quality of life one year later.
<sup>5</sup> So, expectations have the potential to influence the experience of cancer, for worse and for better; understanding them may be a first step in productively limiting or harnessing their effects.

<h1>Your Neurochemical Self</h1>
<p>Getting real with a 200-million-year-old brain</p>
<div> <div> <h2>The Harsh Truth About Dopamine </h2> <p>Your brain turns on the excitement of dopamine when you approach a reward, but it defines "rewards" with neural pathways built from your dopamine past. New paths to dopamine await.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>This Is the Face of Cortisol</a></h2> <p>We often hide our negative reactions, even from ourselves. Babies can help us understand our natural responses. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Did Our Ancestors Manage Anxiety?</a></h2> <p>Our ancestors lived with huge threats, but they coped by focusing on their next step.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>The Biology of Belonging</a></h2> <p>Mammals live in herds for protection from predators, and we've inherited a brain that rewards you with oxytocin when you stick with the herd. But herd life is not all warm and fuzzy.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Shy?</a></h2> <p>Past threats wire you to expect new threats, but you can wire in positive expectations too. Here's how. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>False Alarms: 7 Reasons Why We Have Them</a></h2>
<p>Your brain evolved to protect you from touching a hot stove twice. It alarms you when you see anything similar to a past threat. You can accept old pathways and flow into new ones.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Fear Is Natural, But You Can Be Super-Natural</a></h2> <p>If you share the fears of those around you, your life will be wasted in fear. You can learn to redirect it when you understand it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Good Can Come of This?</a></h2> <p>We are building time management skills and social skills, and putting realistic expectations above the blame game. These are things to celebrate.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Stuck at Home? How to Keep Up Your Happy Chemicals</a></h2> <p>Here's how to avoid a cortisol spiral, even when others panic.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Three Ways to Laugh More</a></h2> <p>Laughing stimulates endorphins and helps you avoid cortisol. Here are three simple strategies that anyone can use.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Fear the Future?</a></h2> <p>Your sense of dread about the future is natural. You have power over it when you know where it comes from.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Personal Responsibility and Mental Health</a></h2> <p>Mental health is a skill that must be learned.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Your Self-Soothing Habit</a></h2> <p>Our happy habits feel good in the short run, but we may use them to avoid our feelings.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why We Want What Others Have</a></h2> <p>Social comparison shapes our happiness because we're mammals. We have power over this impulse when we understand it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>From Stressed to Rest in an Hour</a></h2> <p>Our brain prioritizes bad feelings because it evolved in a dangerous world. You can train your brain to go to a happy place instead.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Mental Health Through an International Lens</a></h2> <p>I haven't heard much positivity lately, so I am thrilled to find it in the Latin America Positive Psychology Network.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>This Is the Face of Dopamine</a></h2> <p>The joy of dopamine is released when you meet a need, but your brain defines needs in a quirky way. Knowledge is power!</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Others Hold You Back</a></h2> <p>Clinging to others promotes survival in nature but it frustrates us in daily life. You can manage this frustration when you know how you produce it inside you.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Expecting a Crisis?</a></h2> <p>Instead of focusing on the threats lurking everywhere, you can discover new pastures. You can train your brain to feel safe when you know how it creates alarm.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Cheer Does a Body Good</a></h2> <p>Whether you're cheering a new year, a sports team, or a birthday, it feels good. There may be lasting benefits too, so it's worth finding authentic opportunities to cheer.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Shakespeare’s True Identity Helped Me Understand Myself</a></h2> <p>A chance experience led me to read about the person who wrote the Shakespeare plays, and it was a thrill to see life's ups and downs through his eyes.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Man Who Drew Neurons</a></h2> <p>The man who discovered the synapse wrote a book of career advice a century ago. His advice helps you stimulate your happy chemicals (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin).</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Lens Do You Choose?</a></h2> <p>You can put on the glasses that let you see the world as a supportive place instead of a dangerous one. Why wouldn't you?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Fashion Trends and Primal Urges</a></h2> <p>Dopamine motivates us to seek novelty. Oxytocin motives us to fit in. Serotonin to be special. Fashion trends are natural for us mammals and you may find them in grandma's closet.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Compassion Failure: A New Paradigm</a></h2> <p>It's easy to blame problems on "our society," but the blame habit leads to hate, greed, and disempowerment. Invest yourself in a new paradigm instead. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Post-Traumatic Growth Story</a></h2> <p> A brain-injury patient recovered his consciousness in a way that illuminates your consciousness. A true tale of triumph!</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Neurochemistry of Love</a></h2> <p>Love is a powerful motivator because it stimulates all your happy chemicals at once. But our brain evolved to motivate reproduction, not to make you feel good all the time. Alas.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Nourish Your Brain in Five Minutes a Day</a></h2> <p>Your quality of life depends on the circulation in your brain. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h2> Why you feel like you're at the turning point in history </h2>

<p>Do you feel like we’re at a turning point in history?</p>
<p>Dopamine and Chronocentrism</p>
<a>neural</a> pathways created by the dopamine experiences of your past. Each brain promotes its survival by scanning the world for opportunity, and dopamine makes it feel good.
<p>Oxytocin and Chronocentrism</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Loretta Breuning</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Serotonin and Chronocentrism</p>
<p>Cortisol and Chronocentrism</p>
<p>You stimulate serotonin when you see your actions having an impact on the larger world. You stimulate oxytocin when feel yourself part of a larger movement. You stimulate dopamine when you anticipate rewards to your efforts.</p>
<p>You may say “it’s different this time,” but it’s useful to notice how often people say that. For example, when you study another time in history, you end up concluding that it too was “a turning point.”</p>
<p>You have power over your emotional ups and downs when you know how you are creating them. Find more information on this at the <a>The Inner Mammal Institute</a>.</p>
