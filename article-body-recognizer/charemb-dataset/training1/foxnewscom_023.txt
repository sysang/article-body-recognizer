<h2>Deshawn Pressley subdued purse-snatcher at a Kroger in Lemon Township, receives Citizen's Award</h2>
<h4><a>Ohio good Samaritan chases down purse-snatcher at grocery store</a></h4>
<p>A good Samaritan in Ohio answered an elderly woman’s calls for help at a Kroger grocery store earlier this month and chased down a purse-snatcher before making a citizen’s arrest.</p>
<p>A <a>good Samaritan</a> in <a>Ohio</a> received an award Thursday after he answered an 87-year-old woman’s calls for help at a Kroger grocery store when a man <a>snatched</a> her purse in the checkout line earlier this month. </p>
<p>Deshawn Pressley jumped into action on Dec. 5 and chased the purse-snatcher out of the store in Lemon Township and into the parking lot. Security footage shows Pressley taking down the suspect in the parking lot and making a citizen’s arrest.</p>

<p>For his heroic efforts, Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones presented Pressley with the Citizen’s Award on Thursday. Pressley was also reunited with Pat Goins, the woman whose purse was snatched.</p>
<p>"I’m glad that he received this honor because he’s my hero," Pat Goins told <a>FOX19 Cincinnati</a>.</p>

<p>NEW YORK BAKER SAYS HER BUSINESS CHANGED HER LIFE, NOW SHE'S SETTING OUT TO HELP OTHERS</p>
<p>"We really didn't give people a lot of direction, and the direction was, here's a $100 bill. Give it away. Spread joy," Klick Health chief creative officer Rich Levy told Fox News. </p>
<p>Levy told employees to be as "creative as humanly possible" on how they choose to give it away and to make sure they film the kind gesture. The plan was to compile the clips together to create the company's <a>annual holiday video</a>. </p>
<p>"Do it by yourself, do it with your family, do it in teams, do it in entire groups," he recalled telling employees.</p>

<p>"My favorite one of them all was somebody put a $100 bill in an envelope and wrote 'just because' on it and tucked it underneath somebody's windshield wiper," Klick Health Chief People Officer Glenn Zujew told Fox News. </p>
<p>Within a short period of time, the company received more than 1,700 clips, which was approximately 10:28 hours' worth of footage.</p>
<p><a><u>100-YEAR-OLD WWII VETERAN RECEIVES ALMOST 800 BIRTHDAY CARDS: 'IT'S BEEN AMAZING' </u></a></p>
<p>One employee admitted that they were overcome with emotion after giving the money to their delivery person who needed it to buy formula for her baby.</p>
<p>"My husband and I got in the car and almost cried ourselves," Serena Stanley, a Klick Health employee said, according to the company's internal messaging system. </p>
<p>Many team members even involved their own children, including Zujew whose kids tapped into their own savings to help. </p>
<p>"When we told them about what we were doing and what the holiday video was this year, both of them went and emptied their piggy banks and added to the money," he said.</p>
<div> <div><p> Klick Health employees pool money together to buy coats for those in need. (Klick Health )</p></div></div>
<p>One night, the family gave all the funds to their Uber Eats driver. It brought the driver to tears, Zujew recalled. </p>
<p>"My kids asked to do it, have asked to do it almost every day since. Can we do it again? Can we do this? Let's do that," Zujew added.</p>
<p><a><u>'DANCING DAD' CAPTURES THE INTERNET WITH SON'S CANCER-FREE DANCING CLIP</u></a></p>

<p>The video itself has gotten an overwhelmingly positive response since being posted on the company's YouTube channel on Dec. 6, according to Levy.</p>
<p>The company is also donating $1 for each of the first 10,000 YouTube views of the #SpreadJoy’ video to the Make-A-Wish Canada.</p>
<p>For the month of December, employees were also able to direct the corporate donation dollars they receive to the charity that aims to fulfill grandeur wishes for children with critical illnesses.</p>

<p>He returned to the U.S. in 1946 and worked for U.S. Steel in Birmingham after he left the Army. </p>
<p>Last year, in November 2020, Wooten tested positive for COVID-19, but recovered in time for his 104th birthday, which he was able to celebrate at home, according to AP. </p>

<p>His granddaughter, Holly McDonald, told AP that Wooten "is doing really well" and was able to participate in Veterans Day activities. </p>
<p>Wooten’s physical strength has recovered since contracting COVID-19 and some mental fuzziness that appeared at the time has faded away, McDonald told AP. </p>

<p>Brian Marshall doesn’t like <a>whisky</a>, but he’s certainly profited from the drink. </p>
<p>Marshall, from Kettering, U.K., recently sold his collection of 4,000 miniature whisky bottles for about <a>$</a><a>39,726 </a>(£29,750) at an online auction on Sunday, according to SWNS. </p>
<p>Marshall has been collecting mini bottles of whisky – primarily Scotch – since the 1980s from all over the world including the U.S., Iraq, Uruguay and Australia, SWNS reported. </p>
<p><a>COSTCO WORKER’S VIRAL TIKTOK SPARKS DEBATE ABOUT PAY</a></p>
<p>Marshall told SWNS he started his hobby when a coworker, who was collecting full-size bottles of whisky, recommended he collect mini ones. </p>
<p>"It took on a life of its own because I started planning my holidays in Scotland around it," Marshall said. </p>

<p>"Most of the bottles are from the 1980s and 1990s because the distilleries stopped making as many miniatures after that," Marshall said. "It’s an era that’s gone, but there used to be so many great whisky shops up there."</p>

<p>Recently, Marshall moved in with his partner and he didn’t have as much space for the collection. </p>
<p>After sorting through everything he had collected, Marshall decided to part ways with the mini whisky bottles, SWNS reported.</p>

<p>"I thought the entire collection would make between £7,000 ($9,344) and £8,000 ($10,679) at the very most, so this is a very pleasant Christmas bonus," Marshall said. "But I never had any aim in mind, I don’t even like the stuff."</p>
<p>"I’m delighted that my bottles have now gone on to new collectors and I hope they will enjoy them as much as I have enjoyed collecting them," he added.</p>

<h1>Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett not opposed to 'good' nuclear deal with Iran</h1>
<h2>Israel has watched with concern as European nations, Russia and China have restarted talks with Iran</h2>
<p><a><u>Israeli</u></a> Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Tuesday he is not opposed to a "good" nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, but voiced skepticism that such an outcome would emerge from the current negotiations. </p>
<p>Bennett spoke a day after negotiators from Iran and five world powers resumed talks in Vienna on restoring Tehran’s tattered 2015 nuclear deal. He reiterated that Israel was not bound by any accord, leaving it room to maneuver militarily. </p>
<p>"At the end of the day, of course there can be a good deal," Bennett told Israeli Army Radio. "Is that, at the moment, under the current dynamic, expected to happen? No, because a much harder stance is needed." </p>

<p>"Israel will always maintain its right to act and will defend itself by itself," he said. </p>
<p>Bennett has urged negotiators to tow a firmer line against Iran. Israel is not a party to the talks but has engaged in a blitz of diplomacy on the sidelines in an attempt to sway allies to put more pressure on Iran to rein in its nuclear program. </p>
<p>In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV that a "quick and proper agreement in the near future" is possible if the other parties to the negotiations demonstrate "seriousness alongside goodwill." </p>
<p>Iran says its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest enemy and it strongly opposed the 2015 deal. </p>

<p>It says it wants an improved deal that places tighter restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program and addresses Iran’s long-range missile program and its support for hostile proxies along Israel’s borders. </p>
<p>Israel also says that the negotiations must be accompanied by a "credible" military threat to ensure that Iran does not delay indefinitely. </p>

<p>The U.S. has viewed al-Sadr, a former enemy during the Iraq War, as a possible new ally due to his rejection of Iranian meddling in Iraq's politics.</p>

<div><div><h4><a>Chicago dispatcher sounds alarm on rising crime amid staffing shortages: ‘All hell has broken loose’</a></h4> <p>Keith Thornton says the ‘failure of leadership’ in the Illinois city is ‘ridiculous.’</p></div></div>
<p>A <a>Chicago</a> 911 dispatcher warned Tuesday on <a>"Fox Friends"</a> that citywide staffing shortages are exacerbating <a>violent crime,</a> knocking local government and leadership for their inability to keep citizens safe. </p>
<p>"All hell has broken loose," Keith Thornton told "Fox Friends" enterprise reporter <a>Lawrence Jones.</a></p>
<p>Thornton said that a "massive" amount of crime is taking place in the city at "all hours of the day," while first responders are being overworked and receiving no support from lawmakers and politicians. </p>

<p>"What’s horrible is the lack of leadership and the failure of leadership throughout this entire city of Chicago—and it’s ridiculous because it does not have to be this way," said Thornton. </p>
<p>Thornton added that the Chicago police, fire department, dispatchers, and other first responders are being "micromanaged" by <a>Mayor Lori Lightfoot.</a></p>
<p>"The blood, in my opinion, is on her hands," Thornton said. </p>
<p>The Chicago dispatcher added that, under the Trump administration, federal help was neither "acknowledged" nor "wanted" by the mayor.</p>
<p>"This is not a black problem, a white problem, a Democratic problem, a Republican problem, a Latino problem, this is an all-hands-on-deck problem and everyone within Chicago should be fueled up—and that’s why I’m taking a stand," said Thornton. </p>

<p>In a <a>recent viral Facebook video</a>, Thornton called the city a "death zone" where police are scared to go out on patrol by themselves.</p>
<p>"When you say ‘Chicago,’ people are afraid," said Thornton. </p>

<i> to reduce violence by building a community center that will increase the equality of opportunity for those living on the South Side of Chicago. </i>
<p><i>What follows has been lightly edited. We strongly encourage you to watch the accompanying video so you may hear the pastor in his own words. </i></p>

<p>I remember being seven years old when my mother, a single parent, bought me three toys. </p>
<p>One of them was a yellow Tonka truck. And, back in the day, you had to roll the Tonka truck and you had to manually lift the lift and dump stuff out of it. Maybe that's why I love trucks to this day. I'm a good old country boy. </p>
<p>We finally got Bozo blown up, and there he was, standing about four and a half feet off the ground. He had a big old Kool-Aid smile. And I'm gonna tell you, that's where I learned how to throw some of my most vicious shots. </p>
<p>I learned how to throw overhand rights. I’m a southpaw, and I learned how to do a nice left-hand jab, and I learned how to throw a hook and an upper cut and a combination. </p>

<h1>Rooftop Revelations: Pastor Brooks on the importance of fathers, and how to help fatherless youths</h1>
<h2>'I promote fathers being in their child’s life, but we all know that’s not gonna happen in a lot of cases on the South Side,' the pastor said</h2>
<p>On the 36th day of his 100-day rooftop vigil to raise funds to build a community center — also described as an opportunity center — Pastor Corey Brooks spoke with Tim Richards who grew up with a father and is a pipefitter by trade. </p>
<p>"Man, let me ask you a question," said the pastor. "Some of your friends who didn’t have dads in their life to make them get up and learn a trade, where are they? What are they doing?"</p>

<p>"It’s unfortunate," replied Richards as painful memories ran through his head. "A lot of them, you know, are deceased or in jail." </p>
<p>Richards nodded along in agreement. Then the pastor’s smile widened.</p>
<p>"I appreciate it," replied Richards.</p>
<p>The pastor then returned to the issue of fatherless men. "Do you think we could be successful if we get other men these opportunities?"</p>
<p>"That’s the reason why we got Project H.O.O.D.," said the pastor, who has worked tirelessly for years to offer vocational training from construction to electrical work. </p>
<a>father</a>, they can offer direction and a purpose in life to many fatherless youths. It is the only hope, in the words of the pastor, to "get people in trades, get people a job, give them a work ethic, help them to become everything that they can be."

<h1>Chicago pastor hopes community center will push South Side over 'tipping point' and create permanent change</h1>
<h2>Partners have created over 150 new construction jobs in last three and a half years</h2>

<p>"I’ve got some young people working for my company that came through this program and now are making $75,000 to $80,000 a year," said Uremovich. "These opportunities are a great way out of a difficult situation here.</p>
<p>Brooks agreed, "It gives us the chance to take these urban kids out of gangs, out of bad situations, and give them a skill set that will last forever." </p>
<a>poverty</a>. They have also created positive role models within the community for the youth to look up to.
<p>The only obstacle for these men is limited resources. "That is the reason why we need to build this community center so that we can build up capacity," said the pastor. "We’ll be able to do greater work."</p>
<p>Uremovich agreed: "We can be at 150 to 250 jobs a year if we have this center built and put the training facility inside of it." </p>

<h1>Mayfield, Kentucky, first responders recount experience immediately following devastating tornado</h1>
<h2>First responders, volunteers, came to Mayfield to help with tornado aftermath</h2>
<p>MAYFIELD, Ky. – Emergency tones poured into the Mayfield Fire Department after a tornado swept through the region, but first responders were at first helpless. The steel roll-up doors had caved in, trapping emergency vehicles inside.</p>
<p>Using a tow strap, the Mayfield firemen "hooked it to these roll-up doors and we had to rip them off the building so we could respond and start helping people," Mayfield Fire Chief and EMS Director Jeremy Creason told Fox News.</p>
<p>Even still, wreckage blocked the roadways, forcing emergency workers to respond on foot until paths were cleared.</p>
<a><u>Tornadoes</u></a> tore through multiple states on Dec. 10, killing around 90 people.
<a><u>Kentucky</u></a> Gov. Andy Beshear said 77 people died in Kentucky, the state hit hardest, and as of last week, more than 900 storm victims were being housed at state parks, resorts and hotels.

<p>First responders and volunteers from across the region came to aid the devastated town, often facing obstacles of their own.</p>
<p>"We responded to every portion of the path of the tornado," Creason told Fox News. The tornado directly hit his fire station.</p>

<p>Soon after the tornadoes struck, "a lot of walking wounded" started arriving at the fire station, Creason said. The department set up a triage station and began giving care. </p>

<p>Mayfield's Police Department also got "to work, instantly," Officer Jasper Mundy told Fox News. Police allowed community members to shelter in the department's basement.</p>
<p>Following the tornadoes, Mundy and others helped pull people from out under the rubble.</p>

<p>The community has been grateful for law enforcement's help, Mundy told Fox News.</p>
<p>"I helped a lady today … she actually hugged me and was thanking me for everything I've done for her," he said. "A lot of the people are really thankful <i>— </i>I think the hug brightened my day, that's all I really needed."</p>
<p>Similarly, Nate Flint, with the U.S. Army, and Ben Wofford, a paramedic from a neighboring county, told Fox News they were happy to lend a hand to the Mayfield community.</p>
<p>"It feels great being able to get out here and actually do something," Flint said. He flew in after the tornado and was handing out water to community members, asking if they had everything they needed.</p>
<p>The National Guard, the American Red Cross and <a>community volunteers</a> were among the countless others who responded to the tornado's aftermath.</p>
