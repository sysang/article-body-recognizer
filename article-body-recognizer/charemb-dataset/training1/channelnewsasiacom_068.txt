<p>SINGAPORE: It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas - especially on Orchard Road.</p>
<p>Cynics may decry little reason to feel festive with the current surge in coronavirus cases. But Singapore’s prime shopping street is pressing on with its annual Christmas light-up in the hopes of a “return to normalcy”.</p>
<p>Although it has been years since my childhood days of gawking at holiday displays in wonder, I am looking forward to the fresh breath of air this holiday season might inject into Orchard Road this year.</p>
<p>Life since the pandemic has been mostly defined by a plethora of strict measures, a distinct air of sombreness and more recently, lots of self-administered COVID-19 tests.</p>
<p>My dulled senses and COVID-frozen heart are yearning for visual and sensory stimulus that offer momentary relief from this seemingly endless and repetitive blur of pandemic living.</p>
<p>There is just something about decorative facades and piped-in holiday music that seems to create a happy, festive atmosphere, which is a welcome mood-lifter, whether we are locals or travellers in Singapore on the Vaccinated Travel Lane.</p>
<h2>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS STILL NECESSARY</h2>
<p>Singapore is not out of the woods yet. Playing our part in adhering to social distancing regulations to keep each other safe remains a chief responsibility.</p>
<p>Any increased footfall will surely be welcome, considering how eerily empty malls have been a more common sight when restrictions were tightened over the past two years.</p>
<h2>HOW TO GET MORE PEOPLE BACK TO ORCHARD ROAD</h2>
<p>But more than pretty lights and loads of bells and whistles - like an augmented reality enhanced projection at Mandarin Orchard Singapore - it is the experiential element of shopping that will get people coming back for more. </p>
<p>Many malls and flagship boutiques already attract travellers and big spenders who wish to splurge on luxury brands - but this category of shoppers are likely to be in the minority. </p>
<p>To entice more shoppers to “travel” to this destination, Orchard Road must continue bulking up its range and variety of shops - the main reason why anyone would take time to visit. </p>
<p>There is a stretch along basement one of Takashimaya Shopping Centre that includes a fascinating range of brands including designer handbag label Senreve hailing from San Francisco and cult fragrance brands Le Labo and Byredo. </p>
<p>Sitting within the affordable luxury price range, this is an interesting spot to scope out a small treat for ourselves - or a loved one - for those inclined.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys scoping out shops for inspiration, I wish for more of such unique concepts along Orchard Road to draw me out from my home bubble.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one good thing emerging from the slew of COVID-19 related closures along the street is the resulting creative destruction and the birth of space for new places. </p>
<p>The newly launched Courts Nojima megastore, which moved into The Heeren to replace Robinsons, is riding on the popularity of home furnishings as more people have worked from home. </p>
<p>With a storefront conjuring the chaotic exuberance of electronic stores in Tokyo’s famed Akihabara tech district, this could be the next destination for techies to check out the latest VR and AR gadgets. </p>
<p>The store’s robot vacuum experiential corner gives people the chance to create a mess and see if these gadgets can do the trick while its e-sports gaming centre also holds the promise of hosting future tournaments. </p>
<p>Already, snaking queues were seen last week when exclusive early access was given to Courts Homeclub members. It appears they are already meeting a pent-up demand in the consumer market.</p>
<h2>LIGHT AT END OF TUNNEL</h2>
<p>Another draw of Orchard Road is its destination for people can hang out with each other and check out interesting things, whether shops, FB outlets or lifestyle experiences like yoga sessions or cooking classes. </p>
<p>Many are craving a sense of newness and that sense of surprise they can enjoy with friends and family, especially after close to two years of the same old routines and mind-numbing safety precautions. </p>
<p>In this sense, this year’s Christmas light-up aptly conveys a message of hope for better days ahead. Perhaps they are a literal representation of the light at the end of our very long tunnel. </p>
<p>So this Christmas season, I am going to do something I have not done in years. I will take some time on a less-crowded weekday to stroll down Orchard Road and bask in the holiday lights as I, too, make my own wishes for a return to normalcy.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Is it frivolous to learn Korean to appreciate Squid Game and K-drama shows? </h1>
<div> <p>We may be a pragmatic bunch, but learning new languages for the fun of it draws on our yearning for connection and community, says NUS Centre for Language Studies’ Daniel Chan.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Daniel Chan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Interest in learning Korean spiked worldwide after Netflix’s blockbuster show Squid Game hit our screens, reported language platform Duolingo. </p>
<p>And with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting our social lives, perhaps more found motivation and spare time to take that first step.</p>
<p>As a linguist, it’s always amusing, but unsurprising, to see non-English popular culture motivating viewers to try their hand at learning foreign languages. </p>
<p>There are many “good” reasons to do so – but does interest in a TV show count as one of them? Or is it a frivolous reason? </p>
<h2>PRACTICALITY MIGHT NOT BE KEY FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS</h2>
<p>Throughout my 21 years as a French teacher and interacting with like-minded multilingual peers, I’ve seen many reasons for picking up a new language.</p>
<p>Think of it as a spectrum of increasing practicality (or frivolity): On one end, school, work and travel tend to be common reasons. English is, by far, the most popular language to study worldwide.</p>
<p>What might be other practical languages for native English speakers like us?</p>
<p>Looking at economic, geopolitical and cultural indicators, the British Council ranked the top three most important languages for the United Kingdom in the future - Spanish, Mandarin and French.</p>
<p>But when one learns languages for work, we tend to be driven by extrinsic motivation– or tangible “rewards”.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the job or the value of the reward, this may not always be sufficient. After all, don’t we have professionals or machine translation for that?</p>
<p>Studies suggest we may make more rational, less emotional decisions in a foreign language, possibly because we don’t acquire it through family, friends and experiences infused with emotion like with our native tongues.</p>
<h2>EMBRACING IMPRACTICAL REASONS</h2>
<p>But when picking up a language has never been easier, with free apps and online communities to practise with fellow language learners or native speakers, why tie ourselves to practicality?</p>
<p>Some “heritage learners” seek a sense of belonging to the cultural roots of their forefathers. Others desire less superficial interaction with the locals during travels. </p>
<p>We could simply be drawn to the aesthetic value and exotic sounds of a language, or the prestige attached to its underlying culture.</p>
<p>Starting to learn may be easy but communicating in a new language takes time, persistent commitment and effort. </p>
<p>And you don’t just learn Japanese, you learn three different scripts – Hiragana syllables for native words, Katakana syllables for foreign loanwords, and Kanji characters adopted from Chinese.</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation – doing something for the inherent satisfaction it brings – tends to drive us more strongly in these cases.</p>
<h2>GLIMPSE INTO ANOTHER CULTURE</h2>
<p>Learning new languages for the fun of it shouldn’t be dismissed as frivolity. And it’s certainly not new.</p>
<p>In Singapore, you probably know someone who picked up Cantonese watching Hong Kong serials, tried out Japanese after they listened to Ayumi Hamasaki, or dabbled in French after falling in love with Amelie Poulain.</p>
<p>Does entertainment serve no redemptive value or purpose in our lives? Watching a TV show may propel us to learn a language as a personal challenge - the realisation that meaningless gibberish slowly makes sense can be oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>Korean speakers were quick to point out cultural nuances in Squid Game, such as honorifics used to hammer home its critique of social classes and emotional pivotal scenes, that were lost in translation.</p>
<p>And it isn’t simply about understanding what is being said either, but the cultural and social realities of daily life it paints. </p>
<p>The resemblance between Netflix-viewers-turned-Duolingo-learners and fans of fictional universes is the most striking: Entertainment fuels a keen desire to further delve into a culture, which in turn triggers the motivation to learn.</p>
<p>It signals our yearning to feel connected to and exchange with another culture or people, and in a meaningful way that doesn’t gloss over intricacies and subtleties of the language.</p>
<p>And in a world where international travel was largely shut down for almost two years, perhaps learning a foreign language is our way of letting our minds travel when our physical selves were isolated. </p>
<p>And this certainly can’t be a frivolous reason.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why is former US president Donald Trump still so influential? </h1>
<div> <p>The effects of globalisation, the atmosphere of insecurity and other structural problems that gave rise to populism remain, meaning Trump will continue to influence US politics for a while, says Yale-NUS College’s Benjamin Schupmann.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Benjamin A Schupmann </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The last year should have been the end of Donald Trump. </p>
<p>He lost the presidential election big, by over 7 million votes. He blamed his loss on his own party. He attacked fellow Republicans, including his own vice-president Mike Pence and senior state election officials. </p>
<p>He instigated a violent insurrection to try to overturn the election, becoming the first US president to be impeached twice. </p>
<p>Besides losing the presidential “bully pulpit,” Trump also lost his digital megaphone when Twitter and Facebook banned him from their platforms. </p>
<p>Yet Trump did not fade away. Trump is the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination. He is a fundraising juggernaut. </p>
<p>This month’s off-year election demonstrated that Trump’s command over his base, the rural branch of the Republican Party, remains strong.</p>
<p>Other Republicans cannot afford to alienate him. If they seem to drift too far from his orbit, Trump threatens to wield his base like a cudgel and “primary” them.</p>
<p>When asked about the 2024 election, other Republican Presidential hopefuls dance around the question or declare outright that they will not run if Trump does.</p>
<p>Even Pence, who Trump threw to the mob, still clings feverishly to Trump. This all raises the following question: Why is Donald Trump still so influential?</p>
<h2>EFFECTS OF GLOBALISATION EXACERBATED BY COVID-19</h2>
<p>One reason is that the structural problems of US society that led to Trump’s election in the first place have not disappeared. The pandemic has aggravated many of them.</p>
<p>One structural problem has to do with the effects of the global economy. Although it benefits many, globalisation has led to stagnant wages and job displacement for some Americans. </p>
<p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, a significant number of lower- and middle-class Americans feel like they have fallen behind, economically and socially. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened this situation. </p>
<p>Millions of lower-income workers lost their jobs, especially those in the service sector. Others had to put themselves in physical danger to hold onto their jobs. </p>
<h2>AMERICANS FEEL THREATENED </h2>
<p>Another structural problem has to do with the effects of social and political change. Although many progressive changes to American society are unquestionably for the better, some feel threatened by them. </p>
<p>White Americans are told that they will soon be a minority. Some white men feel that their gender and race are now vilified by American public culture. </p>
<p>Political changes can also feel threatening. From the rise of China to the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Americans see signs that their era of global dominance is waning. </p>
<p>Climate change also poses an existential threat. As with economic insecurity, social change and instability can drive some into the arms of populists. This atmosphere can create a sense of pessimism about the future. </p>
<p>Some Americans believe that their society is in decline. They become nostalgic and yearn for a (romanticised) American golden age.</p>
<h2>TRUMP’S POPULIST FORMULA: TAPPING INTO CULTURAL PESSIMISM</h2>
<p>A significant part of Trump’s success lies in his ability to tap into these feelings of insecurity, threats, and cultural pessimism, promising to overcome them. </p>
<p>Trump promised to protect America from threatening change, to restore America to when it was “great”, and to restore his political base’s lost sense of self-worth. These promises still resonate loudly with his supporters today.</p>
<p>To be sure, Trump had his chance to fix those problems. His policies as president did little. For example, his isolationist and anti-foreigner policies tend to exacerbate underlying economic problems, leaving society even worse off. </p>
<p>Yet blaming foreigners works because it offers both a scapegoat and a simple solution, energising a populist base. Similarly, anti-progressive, anti-inclusive, and anti-environmental changes tend not to resolve underlying social problems. </p>
<p>The Joe Biden administration has not done much yet to address the concerns that motivate Trump’s supporters. The pandemic continues to disrupt American society. Despite the massive amounts of government aid, inequality has only grown.</p>
<p>There are still 4 million jobs fewer in the American economy than before the pandemic began. Wages remain stagnant for many other lower-income Americans. </p>
<h2>PORTRAYING HIMSELF AS HERO OF THE FORGOTTEN AMERICAN BESIEGED BY ENEMIES</h2>
<p>Besides his ability to exploit America’s structural problems, Trump remains influential because of his populist style, his mendacity and the amplification of those traits by social media.</p>
<p>Since his 2016 election, Trump has portrayed himself as the hero of the forgotten American besieged by enemies. </p>
<p>Those enemies include Congressional Democrats, traitorous “Republicans In Name Only” (RINOs), social and economic elites, the deep state, the liberal media, immigrants, foreign powers (especially the Chinese), and even the pandemic itself. </p>
<p>That portrayal appeals to some because of its simplistic good and evil narrative. It is also a lie. </p>
<p>Systematic lying was a defining feature of the Trump Presidency. It began with the lie that his inauguration crowd was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.”</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, Trump made a total of 30,573 false or misleading claims during his presidency. </p>
<p>Social media amplifies traditional forms of lying and propagandising. Social media’s business model is built around user “engagement”. Outrage generates engagement. </p>
<p>This then creates a vicious bottom-up cycle in which online platforms promote “engaging” content to other users, who react, broadening and further accelerating its promotion. </p>
<p>Social media has helped to create a new golden age for liars and propagandists. Trump, who has long understood that there is no such thing as bad publicity, has benefitted perhaps most of all. </p>
<p>Four years of lies laid the foundation for “The Big Lie”: That the 2020 US presidential election was stolen through rampant fraud perpetrated by Trump’s enemies. </p>
<p>Today, 68 per cent of Republican voters believe “The Big Lie”, according to a recent study by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution. </p>
<p>This is not surprising. The public sphere is drowning in misinformation first seeded by Trump and his associates by more traditional media, then amplified from the bottom up as Trump’s supporters take to social media . </p>
<p>And as long as the structural problems that give rise to populism remain and Trump and his supporters can exploit the design of social media to propagate his false narrative, Trump will continue to influence politics.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why most Americans think US president Joe Biden isn't doing a good job </h1>
<div> <p>This US presidency may be one of the most challenging in recent history and Biden is struggling to keep the people happy, says a US politics academic.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Clodagh Harrington </a> </div> </div>
<p>LEICESTER, England: Ten months into his presidency, Joe Biden’s poll numbers are, by any measure, lukewarm.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures, taken on Nov 24, only 43 per cent of Americans approve of his performance in office, while a majority thinks he is not doing a good job.</p>
<p>In a week when he announced that he is planning to run for the presidency again in 2024, these are surely not the numbers he is hoping for.</p>
<p>There are a number of explanations for Biden’s low approval rating, but some context is useful.</p>
<p>While he is recently polling lower than his three Democrat predecessors at this point in their presidency, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were not faced with a pandemic in an era of dangerously toxic partisanship.</p>
<p>Also, the storming of the Capitol in January 2021 by violent supporters of the outgoing president, Donald Trump, ensured that Biden’s ascension to power later that month took place at a time when American democracy appeared to be in peril.</p>
<p>Connecting with the 47 per cent of the public who had voted for his opponent was always going to be difficult – not least as the election outcome was – and still is – contested by many influential officeholders.</p>
<p>Bearing this tumultuous start in mind, there are some factors in particular that may help to explain where Biden has found himself politically.</p>
<p>The point at which his poll numbers crossed from positive to negative was just before the final withdrawal date for US troops from Afghanistan in late August 2021.</p>
<p>While the president’s position on America’s presence in the region was no secret – and most of the public were in favour of bringing the troops home – the bloody and chaotic reality of how this played caused shock both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>In the ensuing weeks, Biden’s poll numbers continued to slide. But Afghanistan was not the only source of voter dismay.</p>
<p>Despite campaign-trail promises and concerted presidential efforts to get COVID-19 under control, the pandemic has raged on.</p>
<p>The public health and economic toll have remained substantial as a hefty 40 per cent of the population (aged 12 and over) have not yet been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Some Americans may never get on board with the science. One route to surmount this obstacle was to introduce vaccine mandates for federal workers, associated contractors and employees of large companies.</p>
<p>Such a solution brought its own set of problems, as government mandates do not sit well with Americans.</p>
<p>Most unfortunately for the president, and arguably through no fault of his, COVID-19 is a polarising issue. It has become possible to find out a person’s political leanings based on their adherence – or lack thereof – to wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Pandemic partisanship has allowed Biden’s opponents to make political hay with the situation. After 22 months of disruption, it is easy for voters to forget that COVID-19 began and rapidly spiralled out of control during the Trump presidency.</p>
<p>His was an administration that showed zero interest in planning for distant risk. As a result, his successor inherited a monumentally challenging public health crisis.</p>
<p>This has been continually exacerbated by pushback from various opponents keen to score political points with their conservative base.</p>
<p>Governors in some Republican states, for example, have rejected Biden’s vaccine policies, refusing to implement mandatory vaccinations or testing.</p>
<p>The result is a continuing pandemic, fearful citizens, and the ongoing politicisation of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>Additionally, the disappointing economic recovery is damaging to the president as the anticipated bounce-back has to date not materialised sufficiently to turn the tide of unemployment and rising inflation.</p>
<p>Added to the president’s political headaches are problems in his own party.</p>
<p>Democrat family squabbles are nothing new, but Biden has to spend precious political capital on reining in frisky progressives while dealing with the disproportionate influence of specific conservative individuals.</p>
<p>West Virginia Senate representative Joe Manchin showed his power in the 50/50 deadlocked Senate by challenging the central tenet of Biden’s climate agenda, on the eve of the COP26 summit in Glasgow.</p>
<p>The result was a US president heading to a crucial climate conference with an agenda undermined by a recalcitrant member of his own party.</p>
<p>Presenting as a moderate Democrat was always going to bring challenges for Biden. On one level, it is a sensible strategy as traditionally, voters tend to veer to the centre at general election time.</p>
<p>Clearly many did, as the centrist Democrat won with 51 per cent of the vote. However, the flipside of such an approach is that the middle-of-the-road position may satisfy nobody.</p>
<h2>CHALLENGING LEADING A DIVIDED COUNTRY</h2>
<p>The political challenges facing Biden remain daunting. He leads a deeply divided country that has been unable to unite in a crisis. Misinformation abounds and undermines civil discourse.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine how any president might fare well in the polls under such circumstances. A less centrist leader than Biden could make the situation worse.</p>
<p>His 51 per cent disapproval rating still equates with 43 per cent approval. Under the circumstances, this constitutes a political glass that is (almost) half full. But it will need to be fuller if he really does plan to run in 2024.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Incoming US ambassador to Singapore confirmed at key time in US re-engagement with Asia-Pacific </h1>
<div> <p>Jonathan Kaplan’s political leadership will also bring a jolt of energy to seasoned foreign service career staff, says Steven R Okun.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Steven R Okun </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: No one has served in the post of ambassador of the United States of America to Singapore since Donald Trump placed his hand on the bible and took the oath of office.</p>
<p>For the past five years, after Kirk Wagar left, the United States has been ably represented by career foreign service officers serving temporarily as chargé d'affaires. </p>
<p>But on Sat (Nov 20), the US Senate ended the drought by confirming tech entrepreneur Jonathan Eric Kaplan for the top spot.</p>
<p>With the Senate confirmation of his presidential appointment, the next and last step in the formal process will be to arrive in Singapore and present his credentials to President Halimah Yacob.</p>
<p>In the meantime, expect the ambassador-designate to have a robust series of consultations with virtually every US government agency, members of the US Congress, business community and other key stakeholders.</p>
<h2>BIDEN’S FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS ASIA-PACIFIC JUST GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p>The demands awaiting Kaplan’s arrival are high. During US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo’s visit to Asia last week, including Singapore, she elaborated on US plans for a new economic framework in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Raimondo said the still-evolving effort could involve several key areas including the digital economy, supply chain resiliency, export control and clean energy, adding that it would be flexible and inclusive.</p>
<p>The business community here have seen firsthand how US companies, farmers, workers and investors have been disadvantaged since the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership nearly five years ago.</p>
<p>Its economic benefits have flowed to members such as Vietnam, now better able to attract companies as they diversify their supply chains out of China. </p>
<p>Agricultural goods and products once sourced from the US to the region also now get imported from other markets due to low tariffs enjoyed by those who have ratified the agreement since it came into force in 2018. </p>
<p>With significant requests to join the CPTPP by China and Taiwan being considered, the US can only watch the deliberations from the sidelines. </p>
<p>Echoing what regional leaders have highlighted, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Thursday that the US joining the CPTPP would be the “ideal approach”. </p>
<div> <div> <h4> <div>Related:</div> </h4> </div> </div>
<p>Unfortunately, Secretary Raimondo explicitly stated that the Biden administration has no plans to join the CPTPP.</p>
<p>Instead, as PM Lee said, “[Secretary Raimondo] is out here, selling very eloquently, the US Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. It is a trade deal without a trade deal. It does not have the trade deal at the back of it.”</p>
<p>If indeed, the US does not join the CPTPP anytime soon, governments and businesses in the region must work with the Biden administration as it develops details of the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and its implementation.</p>
<p>This critical time for US re-engagement with the region on trade and investments provides the backdrop to Kaplan’s assumption of the role of US ambassador to Singapore.</p>
<h2>WHAT KAPLAN BRINGS TO THE TABLE AS AN EDUCATION ENTREPRENEUR</h2>
<p>Kaplan crucially understands how business, technology and national interests come together, as a tech entrepreneur and innovator who invented the Flip video camera while serving as CEO of Pure Digital Technologies, later acquired by Cisco Systems. </p>
<p>Currently chair of EducationSuperHighway, a non-profit organisation working to connect American public schools to high-speed Internet, Kaplan has focused on using technology to provide solutions to societal challenges.</p>
<p>There is potential for Kaplan to head a US embassy which can be a linchpin in the US effort to formulate and effectuate an entire Indo-Pacific strategy.</p>
<p>“(F)riends are able to talk about difficult topics. They may not want to change — we’re going to want them to change — but we’re going to have a dialogue,” he said in response. </p>
<p>While areas in which the US and Singapore are not aligned will be on the US agenda, we should expect areas of immense mutual geostrategic interests to continue as the focus of US-Singapore relations.</p>
<h2>KAPLAN BRINGS A JOLT OF ENERGY AND DIVERSE EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>Though there are questions from the broader community given Kaplan’s lack of extensive foreign policy, keep in mind the past three ambassadors to Singapore were little different and all achieved significant accomplishments. </p>
<p>Both political appointees and career government officials take the same oath to uphold the US Constitution, and both work hard to advance the public interest of the United States.</p>
<p>Political appointees like Kaplan, however, bring a different sense of urgency to their role.</p>
<p>Foreign service officers have an entire career to make a difference over their numerous postings. A politically appointed US ambassador typically has one such posting of about three years before they move out of their government roles altogether. </p>
<p>Ambassador-designate Kaplan comes to Singapore at a crucial time as the Biden administration ramps up its high-level diplomatic engagement with Southeast Asia and develops its Indo-Pacific economic framework.</p>
<p>With the energy and business and entrepreneurial savvy he can bring to an already effective presence, Kaplan’s arrival in Singapore cannot come soon enough.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How Joe Biden went from most voted-for to least-supported US president </h1>
<div> <p>A persistent pandemic, an Afghanistan disaster and poor messaging have been his Achilles’ heel. The mid-terms and the next presidential election in 2024 don’t bode well either, says Yale-NUS' Trisha Craig.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Trisha Craig </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Joe Biden was elected in 2020 with a 7 million vote, four-point margin of victory and a decisive Electoral College tally. </p>
<p>In fact, Biden’s perceived performance three months into his presidency was solid and cause for optimism among his advisors.</p>
<p>Close to three quarters of the public gave him high marks for his handling of the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine then. Polls also showed broad support for Biden’s infrastructure plan to overhaul America’s ageing infrastructure and add jobs. </p>
<h2>A WORSENING PANDEMIC SITUATION</h2>
<p>The emergence of the Delta variant in July in the US despite vaccines becoming widely available meant a summer surge of illness, death and mask mandates. </p>
<p>People expecting to return to their pre-pandemic lives lost faith in Biden’s ability to govern. </p>
<p>Axios polling data shows that in June, over one-third of Americans thought their lives would be largely back to normal within six months but by October, that number had fallen to 13 per cent. </p>
<p>Responses to COVID-19 in the US have been particularly politicised: Democrats and Republicans are deeply split on vaccine mandates, mask requirements or even whether COVID-19 represents a real threat to public health. </p>
<p>But as the pandemic persisted, the country’s divisions sharpened. Biden was viewed by a majority of the country as responsible for its divisions.</p>
<h2>BIDEN’S MANAGEMENT OF THE US ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Another major stumbling block has been the public’s perception of the economy. </p>
<p>Throughout fall, economic issues have weighed heavily on Americans. This has to some extent always been Biden’s Achilles’ heel. Even during the campaign, voters were more likely to rate Trump ahead of Biden on ability to manage the economy. </p>
<p>Biden has two problems with respect to the economy. One is a deteriorating situation on things voters care deeply about. Gasoline prices, which have an outsized effect on presidential approval ratings, have soared to a seven-year high. </p>
<p>The pandemic has also affected global supply chains, with reports that Christmas shopping will be disrupted by the lack of goods. </p>
<p>Inflation is also hurting the president’s standing. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that over half (56 per cent) of the US public feels harmed by inflation and a majority feels it will only get worse. </p>
<p>Messaging is the core of the second problem for the Biden administration. When two thirds of the country believe the economy is in poor shape, it is a struggle to break through with positive news on growth, jobs and wages.</p>
<h2>DIFFICULTIES IN FOREIGN POLICY</h2>
<p>A majority of Americans favoured ending the war and bringing troops home, leading observers to expect that Biden’s poll numbers would bounce back. </p>
<p>Although there is some danger that the Biden administration’s preferred focus on Asia could be derailed by conflicts like Russia’s challenge to Ukraine, so far that does not appear to be happening.</p>
<p>There is also more attention to ASEAN than in recent memory: Numerous members of the administration including vice-president Harris, secretary of state Blinken, and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin have visited the region. </p>
<p>Singapore for the first time in almost five years has a US Ambassador and there are plans for an ASEAN summit at the White House in early 2022.</p>
<p>While none of this may help Biden’s standing in the polls in the short run, it is important for the future of US foreign policy that he show progress on US foreign policy on Asia, particularly China. </p>
<h2>LOOMING MID-TERM ELECTIONS</h2>
<p>Lurking in the background of this slide for Biden are the 2022 mid-term legislative elections. The party in power almost always sees a decline of Congressional seats in the mid-terms. The question is how large a rout the Democrats will face. </p>
<p>They highlight another threat to Biden: The factionalism of the Democratic party. </p>
<p>While he largely brought the party together in the 2020 election around opposition to Trump, the Democratic coalition is an uneasy mix of centrists, liberals and progressives.</p>
<h2>SALVAGING THE SITUATION</h2>
<p>Looking ahead to 2024 when Biden has indicated he will run again, can he pull out of this slump? Something close to a 50 per cent approval rating is thought necessary to win. </p>
<p>Global supply chain issues, related to the surge in inflation, are tricky and unpredictable in light of COVID-19. Yet there is some sentiment that the worst is behind us as production in Asia rebounds.</p>
<p>While important parts of the supply chain like microchips may not improve for years, some semblance of recovery by early 2024 is critical for Biden’s re-election chances.</p>
<p>Still, 2024 is a long way off and there are many unknowns, making it difficult to predict whether Biden can recover. </p>
<p>Finally, the great unknown is COVID-19. The public’s perception of the economy is tied to their views about the pandemic. </p>
<p>Fixing COVID and economic expectations is the common wisdom, but the appearance of the Omicron variant undermines the ability to fully control COVID-19. </p>
<p>That or another more virulent strain of the virus could doom Biden’s re-election chances, an ironic coda for a president who came to office with the expectation he was the one to beat it. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Ronaldo’s move to Manchester United is great for fans but not so much for football </h1>
<div> <p>The world-famous footballer's move shows just how concentrated the talent has become among the elite clubs, says John Duerden.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> John Duerden </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The European transfer window has come alive in August with some of the biggest names in the world moving or trying to. </p>
<p>Lionel Messi left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid tried to sign Kylian Mbappe from the same French club while the saga of Harry Kane saw the England captain trying to leave Tottenham Hotspur before staying put after all. </p>
<p>According to reports, the 36-year-old will be, by some distance, the best paid player at Old Trafford earning £510,000 (US$701,000) a week, £130,000 more than the next highest player, Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea.</p>
<p>In Spain, he scored an amazing 450 goals in 438 appearances as he won two Spanish La Liga league titles and four UEFA Champions League titles before heading to Juventus in July 2018 where he won two Italian championships.</p>
<p>The English Premier League has the highest international profile of any domestic league. Playing once again for Manchester United, one of the best supported teams, means he will stay very much in the headlines.</p>
<h2>SPARKING A TITLE CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>This, however, is not the Manchester United team that Ronaldo left 12 years ago. There has been no title since 2013 when its legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired. </p>
<p>The jury is still out on whether current coach and former team-mate of Ronaldo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who has been in charge since 2018, is the man to return to the club to glory. </p>
<p>United still spends big on players like Paul Pogba, Harry Maguire and this summer, Jadon Sancho and Rafael Varane, putting a huge deal of pressure on the team this season even before Ronaldo's announced arrival.</p>
<p>The question is whether the 20-time English champions need him. </p>
<p>When he left, Ronaldo was a flying winger but now the five-time FIFA Ballon d’Or winner has evolved into a cautious striker who does not stray too far from the penalty area. </p>
<p>United, second last season with 73 goals (and 121 in all competitions), was already well-stocked in that regard with Edison Cavani, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford. </p>
<p>But one shouldn’t be too quick to brush off just how good Ronaldo can be. He is regarded as one of the best football players in the world.</p>
<p>Younger players can benefit in being close to him in training and in preparation. He has shown, at the highest international levels he can convert possession into goals – even if he doesn’t run or defend as much as he used to.</p>
<p>With United’s relative struggles in recent years, the addition of one of the most marketable and famous names in the game can only boost the team’s brand and profile. It should also result in more opportunities for sponsorship and merchandise sales.</p>
<h4> <div>Swimmer Quah Ting Wen and rower Joan Poh talk to CNA's Lin Suling about taking part in the unprecedented Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the extraordinary pressures of competing for international sporting glory and dealing with criticism:</div> </h4>
<h2>SKEWED TRANSFER MARKET</h2>
<p>Barcelona could not afford to keep Lionel Messi and the Argentine moved to Paris Saint-Germain, a club funded by Qatar Sports Investments. </p>
<p>German teams are also watching their finances carefully. Apart from Paris, French teams are struggling with reduced broadcast revenues. </p>
<p>In 2011, Deloitte estimated that salaries in the top five leagues totalled 5.6 billion euros. By 2020, that had increased to 17 billion euros despite clubs struggling with the global pandemic and reduced revenues. </p>
<p>Of course, the richest clubs tending to win is nothing new in football but over the years, this has coalesced around a handful of clubs who can simply outspend everyone else.</p>
<p>This new and smaller elite have the financial power to get the best players, the best coaches and the biggest squads which means they can compete for trophies at home as well as the UEFA Champions League. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Can the Lion City Sailors reignite interest in Singapore football? </h1>
<div> <p>The Lion City Sailors have brought more money and ambition to the local scene. Can this take Singapore football to the next level, asks John Duerden.</p> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Those in the Jalan Besar area last Friday evening (Sep 17) were treated to a rare sight: Fans queuing to watch a Singapore Premier League (SPL) match.</p>
<p>Tickets for the clash between Lion City Sailors and Albirex Niigata were sold at the stadium two hours before kick-off. Eager fans lined the street to snap up the available seats, limited to 1,000 due to COVID-19 capacity limits. </p>
<p>Unfazed, some unsuccessful fans even found a vantage point on nearby rooftops to check out the top two teams of this season’s table battle in the final stretch of the title race.</p>
<p>And exciting it was. Albirex equalised in the precious final seconds to make it a 1-1 draw, sending Sailors forward Faris Ramli down to his knees, pounding the ground in frustration. </p>
<p>Indeed, the Lion City Sailors have been a positive force for the SPL.</p>
<p>The team was rebranded in February 2020, after Home United was bought over by home-grown global company Sea and its billionaire co-founder and CEO, Forrest Li, who recently became Singapore’s richest person.</p>
<p>And what a difference that has made. Changes in the boardroom have translated to bold ambitions. </p>
<h2>SETTING SIGHTS ON NEXT SEASON</h2>
<p>The trophy might slip out of the Sailors’ reach after their heartbreaking Sep 17 draw. But whether they win the title this season is not the point for SPL and Singapore football. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to stem the spread in Singapore have made it difficult to gauge just how much of a difference the Sailors might have brought to the league. </p>
<p>For the first half of the 2021 season, no fans were allowed in stadiums and capacity limits gradually increased to 500 in August and to the present cap of 1,000. </p>
<p>According to the club, the Lion City Sailors have sold out 100 per cent of their home games. There has yet to be a spare seat at the Jalan Besar Stadium when the team has played. </p>
<p>When the Sailors played at the home of the Young Lions and Tanjong Pagar FC, those games sold out too.</p>
<p>The 2021 SPL season has been exciting, in part also because the Lion City Sailors are in a particularly intense title race with Albirex Niigata.</p>
<p>Intrigue is a step in the right direction. But leading the league to a new level will take time. It remains to see how the 2022 SPL season will turn out, hopefully with fewer or no COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
<h2>TAKING SINGAPORE FOOTBALL TO THE NEXT LEVEL</h2>
<p>Could the Sailors’ turn in fortunes also benefit Singapore’s sights on qualifying for the 2034 World Cup?</p>
<p>Eleven of the 22 players called up to Singapore’s national team are from the Lion City Sailors, a sign of the club’s potential to energise our national football aspirations.</p>
<p>The Asia’s Champions League next year will be a milestone to watch, The Sailors will have an opportunity to show if the players can hold their own against other clubs from traditionally stronger nations such as South Korea, China and Japan. </p>
<p>More investment in players, good marketing and fan engagement can build excitement in the SPL.</p>
<p>The Lion City Sailors are in a similar situation as Johor Darul Ta’zim in 2012, just across the Malaysian border, after the crown price took ownership of the club and introduced sweeping changes. </p>
<p>But for SPL and Singapore football to have a chance to shine, other teams must step up. </p>
<p>The SPL needs at least two strong local teams in the league, along with the foreign clubs, for healthy competition that lifts standards.</p>
<p>The Lion City Sailors have presented an exciting new side of Singapore football this year - one where fans clamour for tickets, and where teams invest on and off the pitch to match their ambitions to compete in Asia. </p>
<p>Taking Singapore football to the next level will not happen overnight, but neither will qualifying for the 2034 World Cup.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Soh Rui Yong’s 2.4km challenge tapped into our love-hate relationship with the distance </h1>
<div> <p>We all have our 2.4km run horror stories and tales of achievement, and the local athlete has just unleashed these feelings, says CNA 938’s Gerard Wong.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Gerard Wong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Despite being postponed to November, Soh Rui Yong’s Pocari Sweat Singapore 2.4km challenge is now probably one of the most anticipated local sporting events.</p>
<p>In 20 years of covering local sport, I have never come across anyone who’s taken a seemingly innocuous running distance that all of us are familiar with, and turn it into a massive talking point.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary: To generate publicity for its upcoming Pocari Sweat 2.4km Run, a mass participation event, the isotonic drink brand arranged for Soh to see how fast he can complete the distance.</p>
<p>Soh clocked 6 minutes 53.18 seconds, an incredibly fast time that’s akin to running six 400m laps at 69 seconds per lap. </p>
<h2>A DARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
<p>That post and Soh’s own posts gained lots of traction online. While most reactions were positive, there were also brickbats.</p>
<p>Some questioned the achievement saying they knew of army mates and commando soldiers who could complete the distance just as fast as Soh did.</p>
<p>And that was when Soh took over and pulled off the marketing ace in the sleeve. </p>
<p>Issuing an open challenge on social media, he wrote:</p>
<p>“As a gesture of goodwill, I shall offer everyone, commando or not, the following incentive: </p>
<p>“Any Singaporean who runs sub-7:00 for 2.4km at next month’s Pocari Sweat Singapore 2.4km Run (Ground Race, 9-10 Oct) will receive $700 and 700 bottles of Pocari Sweat, both paid for by me.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it’s easy to make extraordinary claims without proof. Let’s settle the debate once and for all.”</p>
<p>Soh will now also race with Subas Gurung, Singapore’s fastest Gurkha in the 2.4km, as part of the event. Subas, whose best time is 6 minutes 58 seconds, signed up for the event on his own, but has since accepted Soh’s invitation to race.</p>
<p>Companies have also jumped on the bandwagon by coming forward to sponsor prizes. </p>
<p>The prize pot now includes all sorts of other interesting rewards besides money – staycations, packets of chicken rice, cryptocurrencies, fitness devices, gym memberships and even a year’s supply of toilet paper.</p>
<p>One could dismiss the whole thing as a huge marketing gimmick. Maybe. But the fact that there are so many prizes on offer is a huge win – for both athlete and the brand. </p>
<p>There are now prizes for every category – adult men and women, students, and even non-Singaporeans – making this a truly grassroots sports event.</p>
<p>But it also begs the question: Why does the 2.4km run resonate so much with Singaporeans?</p>
<p>It’s because the distance has been an inescapable part of almost all our lives growing up – either in school as part of the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test, or in the army, as part of their IPPT (Individual Physical Proficiency Test).</p>
<p>Every Singaporean male knows what a rich source of distress the wretched distance is - especially when they are reservists and struggling to stay fit.</p>
<p>Before the Ministry of Defence changed the IPPT testing and scoring format in April 2015, a reservist aged 30 to 40 would have to clock between 13 and 14 minutes just to minimally pass the station.</p>
<p>Missing the mark by mere seconds, despite having desperately trained for it for months was one of the worst things that could happen to you. </p>
<p>Because it also meant you failed your entire IPPT, no matter how well you had passed the other stations. No ifs and buts – you were certifiably a failure, felled by the 2.4km Sword of Damocles.</p>
<p>Now, the IPPT now comprises of just three stations – push ups, sit-ups and the 2.4km - you don’t have to complete your run within 14 minutes to pass. Thankfully, it’s no longer a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>Instead, points are awarded based on the number of push-ups and sit-ups you do, and the 2.4km timing you clock. So long as all your points add up to more than 51 points, you’ve passed the IPPT. </p>
<p>The changes made to the 2.4km scoring system also means the distance is no longer as daunting, and stress-inducing as it was in the past. In fact, instead of an albatross around one’s neck, it has now become aspirational.</p>
<p>You can now aim for incremental improvements in your timings that will increase the points on your own mental scoreboard. Mentally and physically, it is also easier to train for. </p>
<p>Unlike a half or full marathon, one does not have to invest long hours and months training for it - precious time that many people don’t have or are unwilling to spare. </p>
<p>This may be the exact vein that this race has tapped on – a reason to get out and do our personal best in something we are so familiar with. </p>
<p>As a Facebook user Nick Chui wrote in a post which carried a photo of a timing of 11min 58sec on his Casio watch:</p>
<p>“2.4km timing today. Haven’t ran (sic) this fast for almost 20 years. Thank you, Soh Rui Yong, for your idea. May not meet your standard but good to challenge yourself.” </p>
<h2>CAN ANYONE BREAK SOH’S RECORD?</h2>
<p>But everyone can now take part in a run that was very much a part of their lives growing up. The fact that it is easy to train for, whatever our age is part of the huge interest in this race.</p>
<p>This is what grassroots sports is about – almost akin to watching a football game in a full stadium. Except we are participants, trying to lead a healthier, sportier lifestyle.</p>
<p>When the next edition of the annual Singapore Sports Awards comes around, I hope this event is not only nominated for the Best Sports Event of the Year (Local) award but also wins it. </p>
<p>And hopefully, Soh gets to go on stage to receive it.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Manchester United should quit Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but they can’t seem to </h1>
<div> <p>The coach has little success to show after spending three years and millions on players at his former club, says John Duerden.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> John Duerden </a> </div> </div>
<p>SEOUL: “Humiliating” was the most common description of Manchester United’s 5-0 thrashing by bitter rivals Liverpool two weeks ago.</p>
<p>And on home soil at Old Trafford no less.</p>
<p>At £126 million for these three on transfer fees alone - a price tag most clubs can only dream of - and the pieces falling into place, fans were ecstatic at the possibility the title could be theirs this season.</p>
<p>The 20-time champions have not won since 2013 when emblematic manager Alex Ferguson stepped down after dominating for two decades.</p>
<p>United are slipping out of the title race before the Christmas decorations go up and people are pointing fingers at manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
<h2>LACKING IN COACHING ABILITY?</h2>
<p>The main criticism? Solskjaer, a former United star striker, is simply lacking in coaching ability – with title wins in Norway and a relegation in England.</p>
<p>Yet how is this the reason when coaching standards in England have never been higher? Other clubs don’t have this problem.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp, Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola and Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel had won major trophies before being hired and went on to collect more silverware at their current clubs.</p>
<p>Perhaps it doesn’t help that Solskjaer has a largely inexperienced coaching staff? Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher pointed out that Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna had never coached before in their lives.</p>
<p>After dropping out of last season’s Champions League group stage, United reached the “consolation” Europa League final. Winning a trophy could have lifted the club and provided some much-needed momentum to its unproven manager.</p>
<p>But it was not to be - Manchester United slipped up in a dramatic 22-kick penalty shoot-out to Villareal, a team operating on a fraction of United’s budget that placed seventh in Spain’s LaLiga that season.</p>
<p>Unable to secure a convincing win in regulation time, Solskjaer was judged to have been out-manoeuvred tactically by opposite number Unai Emery.</p>
<h2>OLE’S MAJOR MISSTEPS AS MANAGER</h2>
<p>The thing is Solskjaer just doesn’t seem to know what to do with a squad bursting with talent.</p>
<p>Fans and observers agree the team is currently massively underperforming at a level less than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Observers have pointed out United’s goals tend to come from the players’ individual brilliance rather than any coherent plan worked on the training pitch. Gone are those days when Manchester United’s formidable formations made weekend conversations.</p>
<p>Given Ronaldo’s popularity and track record, any decision to keep him on the bench will raise eyebrows.</p>
<p>Former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel also called out his former teammate’s “really big mistake” in constantly rotating between goalkeepers David de Gea and Dean Henderson, instead of building a “rock solid” presence.</p>
<h2>WHY MANCHESTED UNITED CAN’T SEEM TO LET SOLSKJAER GO</h2>
<p>The current English Premier League climate has seen five coaches fired in the space of last five weeks, mostly after their clubs’ poor starts to the season.</p>
<p>But there is little sign that Solskjaer’s job is indeed in imminent danger, despite nothing to show for the £441 million spent since his arrival in December 2018 besides disappointment and mounting criticism.</p>
<p>Perhaps all that emotional baggage and history has led to United being unable to even entertain the idea of reviewing Solskjaer’s performance.</p>
<p>That is understandable to some extent. Solskjaer is a club legend, having spent 1996 to 2007 in the red shirt and celebrated for his last-minute winning goal that gave United their Champions League title in 1999.</p>
<p>His arrival brought fans the emotional connection they craved after tumultuous post-Ferguson years and good results as interim manager resulted in a swift offer of a permanent position.</p>
<p>Much is also made of the “United DNA” with the implication Solskjaer understands and can deliver what fans want, after being “burnt” by his high-profile predecessors the likes of David Moyes, Louis Van Gaal and even Jose “the Special One” Mourinho.</p>
<div> <div> <h4> <div>Related:</div> </h4> </div> </div>
<p>Other major clubs have similarly appointed former legends in the hope of success, but no similar qualms in kicking them to the curb when results don’t follow. </p>
<p>Perhaps there’s just no one else? Even if Manchester United want a change, there is a lack of elite coaches currently looking for employment.</p>
<p>Firing Solskjaer without a good replacement could be catastrophic if the caretaker role falls to the even less experienced Michael Carrick. So Solskjaer might be at the wheel for some time to come.</p>
<p>Still, United best get cracking to find options or at least a convincing answer. They don’t want to wait until the tide turns because that might not be far along. </p>
<p>Fans cannot survive on nostalgia and idealism alone, much less club owners. In the beautiful game, success is still priority. If poor results continue, more fans may call for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to go. </p>

<h1> Commentary: What's behind Australia's awkward diplomatic boycott of Beijing Winter Olympics </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Richard Baka </a> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. This means that while athletes will still compete in the games, no officials will represent Australia at the event.</p>
<p>The move follows the United States’ announcement earlier this week of a diplomatic boycott. New Zealand has also said it will not send officials to the winter games, and other countries are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>Morrison said the Australian boycott was due to China’s treatment of the mostly-Muslim Uighurs in the far western province of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>In explaining the decision, he said “people have been very aware that we have been raising a number of issues that have not been received well in China, and there’s been a disagreement between us on those matters”.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTT?</h2>
<p>It is something of a slap in the face to China, and the initial reaction from Beijing has been hostile, referring to the US’s stance as “posturing” and arguing the country hadn’t been invited in the first place.</p>
<p>The Olympics movement has long had difficulty managing China’s human rights record alongside the country’s hosting of games.</p>
<p>China lost the bid for the 2000 games to Sydney in a close vote largely because of its human rights record, but it won the 2008 summer games on the promise it would improve.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should have pushed the issue harder. But they wanted to stay allied with China, and chose not to.</p>
<p>So is a diplomatic boycott even worthwhile?</p>
<p>Usually, Olympics are not particularly significant diplomatic occasions in any event - they are more like a big party than a major international meeting.</p>
<h2>PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTTS</h2>
<p>Threats or talk of Olympics boycotts have long been louder than actual boycotts - once a live option at the height of the Cold War, they are no longer in fashion.</p>
<p>Australia’s most notable dalliance with an Olympic boycott was at the Moscow games in 1980. President Jimmy Carter announced the US would boycott the summer games in response to the Soviet Union’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser wanted to follow suit, but the Australian Olympic Committee – which operates independently of government – decided Australia would still compete. In response, Fraser withdrew funding from the AOC.</p>
<p>A few Australian athletes decided not to go to the games, and those who did marched under the Olympic flag in the opening ceremony instead of the Australian flag.</p>
<p>But years later, Fraser conceded an attempted boycott was the wrong move, saying it was a “divisive” idea that had a terrible affect on the athletes.</p>
<h2>WILL THE ATHLETES BE AFFECTED BY THIS DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTT?</h2>
<p>That is, of course, unless there are noticeable protests by the athletes themselves at the games. The IOC recently changed its policy to allow mild protest at the games - but not during events or awards ceremonies.</p>
<p>If this happened, Chinese officials, the IOC or national Olympic committees would likely take action.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Singapore football just doesn’t feel the same – without the crowds or drums </h1>
<div> <p>The SingaBrigade’s question over why drums were banned at the AFF Suzuki Championship raises dilemmas over pandemic living and competitive sports, says John Duerden.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> John Duerden </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: You know there’s a different electricity in the air if you’ve ever been to a pre-coronavirus live football match.</p>
<p>There’s the waving of flags and banners, raucous singing and chants, even the rhythmic banging of drums. </p>
<p>There’s a brass band that follows the England national team around the world, though fellow fans don’t always welcome it. </p>
<p>And who can forget the incessant buzzing of the vuvuzela at the South Africa World Cup in 2010, even through our television screens?</p>
<p>Perhaps an extra level to the atmosphere was missing. The “SingaBrigade” - a fervent group of about 150 Lions’ fans, a red-shirted fixture at the National Stadium whenever Singapore plays - was absent.</p>
<p>The group was peeved they could not bring in two drums due to pandemic measures, in addition to the high ticket cost of S$25 for each adult. </p>
<p>It was also a pity that they weren’t at the Lions’ stunning win over the Philippines on Wednesday.</p>
<h2>WHAT’S THE NEW NORMAL FOR FOOTBALL?</h2>
<p>Southeast Asia has waited three years for the AFF Suzuki Cup to watch the 10 best teams in the region battle it out. </p>
<p>It was postponed since end-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when international travel was still largely restricted and the first vaccines were just starting to be rolled out globally.</p>
<p>In England, atmospheres are said to be better than ever as fans are delighted to be back watching live football after a year. </p>
<p>There are some exceptions but through the changing mask mandates in the United Kingdom due to the Omicron variant, football stadiums still do not require supporters to mask up.</p>
<p>Now no one is saying that we should tear off our masks in Singapore. Far from it. But did we need to be that prescriptive about the drums? It’s bad enough that food or drinks are not permitted in the stadium for the AFF Suzuki Cup.</p>
<p>And what’s with this odd rule that banners and flags “which do not contravene security or regulatory measures may be allowed, subject to approval at point of entry”? Can people bring flags or not?</p>
<p>To be fair, other countries are stricter with fans. In Japan, singing, shouting and screaming are all banned. Instead, supporters have been told to clap. </p>
<p>The Japan Times newspaper reported in October growing calls for all restrictions to be lifted. </p>
<p>J.League chairman Mitsuru Murai is not quite ready to do that just yet even though he acknowledges that it hurts to have to hold that in” when celebrating a goal, Murai said.</p>
<p>Murai also said that if home treatment for COVID-19 is approved, they may be able to “look at allowing fans to cheer”.</p>
<h2>FANS ARE THE 12TH MAN ON THE PITCH</h2>
<p>Cue the SingaBrigade’s recent outburst. Fan support makes a big difference. </p>
<p>While the Singapore national team used to play under the Kallang roar in the old days, it has not been easy to create a similar atmosphere in the cavernous 55,000 capacity National Stadium. </p>
<p>To have a group of dedicated, hardcore fans providing an audioscape to cheer on their team can be electrifying. It lifts players and, crucially, for the other supporters, is a bonus to the lived experience of a live soccer game.</p>
<p>A loud home atmosphere helps the team. It’s what creates home ground advantage, at least according to one 2021 study which compared referee decisions in front of big crowds to those made in empty stadiums. </p>
<p>Against an opponent like Myanmar, maybe it does not matter so much but in a tight game against Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia, passion and noise in the stadium may just be enough to tip the balance.</p>
<p>In other words, to give your team the best chance of winning games, get as many fans as possible into stadiums and ask them to be as noisy as possible. </p>
<p>The problem obviously arises when this conflicts with public health advice or rules, which has to take precedence. </p>
<p>SingaBrigade may be right to question the rationale and request for a clearer explanation but most fans will take what they can get. </p>
<p>Perhaps as Singapore moves towards living with endemic COVID-19, and as more rules are lifted because more are vaccinated, that could change. Or authorities could come out to better explain the thinking behind rules.</p>
<p>But for now, like the rest of us, football may still be searching for the right balance.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Is Hong Kong now just another Chinese city? </h1>
<div> <p>Hong Kong is becoming more Chinese, and as a result may become less of a draw for multinational corporations, says Christian Le Miere.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Le Miere </a> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: Hong Kong is about to reopen. After a long pandemic that has seen travel collapse, this most international of cities is getting ready to throw its borders open again. </p>
<p>But there’s a catch. The territory is only opening its borders one way – to China. For the rest of the world, entry into Hong Kong is about to get harder, rather than easier. </p>
<p>Last Friday (Nov 5), Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she expects Hong Kong’s borders with China to open up on a “large scale” by February. </p>
<p>Yet just over a week earlier, on Oct 26, Lam also announced that visitors from overseas beyond China will have even tighter restrictions for entering the territory. </p>
<p>It is unsurprising that Hong Kong would prioritise its border with China over the rest of the world – when they are part of the same country and China has been Hong Kong’s largest trade partner since 1985. </p>

<h2>HONG KONG BECOMES MORE CHINESE</h2>
<p>A shift in Hong Kong to becoming more of a Chinese city rather than an autonomous and international territory has been underway, cemented with the passing of the national security law in late June 2020.</p>
<p>Since then, the protest movement in Hong Kong has been curbed, leading opposition figures and organisations disbanded or driven overseas, and publications such as Apple Daily have been muted. </p>
<p>Elections have been postponed, raids conducted against a suite of opposition figures, protests outlawed, and legislators sympathetic to the protests banned from the unicameral parliament while the rest of the opposition resigned. </p>
<p>Electoral reform has made it harder for political candidates associated with the protests to build momentum by reducing the number of directly elected legislators and ruling that only vetted “patriots” can be candidates for political office. </p>
<p>These new reforms are also touching everyday aspects of society. In late October, the Hong Kong government passed a new movie censorship law that will “safeguard national security”. </p>
<h2>HONG KONG MAY BE LOSING SOME OF ITS LUSTRE</h2>
<p>These are significant changes for a territory with a very different history and ethos from much of mainland China that have fuelled concerns for multinational companies. </p>
<p>Hong Kong has built a reputation for an open and business-friendly economy, autonomy from China, a vibrant civil society and a highly international population to enable it to become one of Asia’s key financial hubs. </p>
<p>The territory’s population is also shrinking – by 1.2 per cent in the first half of the year, as residents vote with their feet. </p>
<p>This is partly owing to the pandemic and departure of foreign residents seeking to spend more time with families back home, but there are signs showing many residents are also leaving. </p>
<p>At least 8,000 residents leaving Hong Kong withdrew £2.1 billion (US$270 million) from the Mandatory Provident Fund pension scheme in the second quarter of 2021. </p>
<p>This figure is up 112 per cent from the same period in 2020 and accelerating: In the first quarter of 2021, 7,700 claims were made and HK$1.93 billion (US$250 million) withdrawn, a 49 per cent year-on-year increase. </p>
<p>Inflows have also been falling, with the total dropping to HK$10.5 billion in the third quarter of 2021, according to Bloomberg, the lowest since 2018 as more residents retired early or left the city. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, more mainland Chinese are arriving and sinking roots. Over 30 per cent of luxury property purchases in the city in the first half of 2020 were by mainland Chinese. </p>
<p>A one-way visa scheme allowing 150 mainland Chinese to enter Hong Kong each day and be reunited with their families has seen more than a million migrate since 1997, making up just under 15 per cent of the city’s population.</p>
<p>These trends are troubling for Hong Kong’s future as an autonomous territory, but they have not yet undermined its status as a regional hub. </p>
<p>It is still early to say if the city’s zero-COVID policy or the political changes over the past year are a bigger driver. </p>
<p>The territory’s access to China’s capital markets still make it an attractive location to access mainland China while still benefiting from an international city with a separate legal system. </p>
<p>The preservation of judicial independence will be critical - the primary reason multinationals have enough trust in the city to base headquarters there. </p>
<p>Being able to rely on the rule of law to ensure contracts are upheld or disputes resolved apolitically makes Hong Kong a stable and predictable place to do business, combined with its unique position as part of China. </p>
<p>Should there be an indication that judicial decisions or appointments are being swayed by mainland Chinese concerns, then firms might ask why not just move to Shenzhen or Shanghai for your China headquarters and have a regional base in Singapore? </p>
<p>Already, international companies and migrants in the city are worried they may fall foul of the broad-based national security law. </p>
<p>In the wake of COVID-19, as Hong Kong opens to China first before the rest of the world, the Sinification of Hong Kong will likely continue. The effects, though, are not just practical but also symbolic. </p>
<p>Effectively, Hong Kong is now signalling that its future lies within and as part of China, and less as an international city. </p>

<h1> Commentary: We’re missing the point of this Biden-Xi summit </h1>
<div> <p>The meeting has been dismissed as lacking in breakthroughs. But both sides had significant domestic priorities to square off and could have taken a strident tone, says East Asian Institute director Bert Hofman.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Bert Hofman </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The virtual meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday (Nov 16) was said not to have delivered any major breakthroughs, but this milestone was of great importance to both sides. </p>
<p>It offered a venue for frank exchange, opened up channels of communications and identified areas of cooperation and concerns. </p>
<p>Xinhua news agency carried a long report that extensively quoted from what Xi had said during the meeting. The White House posted a similar readout of the meeting focused on Biden’s remarks.</p>
<p>Both also clearly a domestic audience in mind. US television news showed Biden opening the meeting, whereas Chinese television news showed Xi speaking first. </p>
<p>It was a longer-than-expected, nearly four-hour long meeting with key officials from both sides present. </p>
<p>Seven months from a heated Alaska “AnchoRage” meeting that saw a confrontational exchange of rebukes, the positive atmospherics of the Xi-Biden summit have turned the bilateral relationship around and set it on a stronger foundation.</p>
<h2>BOTH SIDES SQUARED OFF DOMESTIC CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>Pressing domestic priorities on both sides, alongside the challenging logistics due to COVID-19, contributed to a delay in a face-to-face meeting between both leaders. </p>
<p>Biden and Xi, who have known each other for more than a decade, have not met in person since Biden assumed office in January — the longest wait since Bill Clinton met Jiang Zemin in 1993, after 10 months in office. </p>
<p>He also needs to soften the ground for the 20th Party Congress next year, where he is likely to seek a third term and has to manage considerable turnover in the CPC power structure. </p>
<p>Biden had to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, manoeuvre a large stimulus programme and get an infrastructure bill through Congress. </p>
<p>Since Alaska, US-China exchanges have been tense, with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman receiving a frosty reception in Beijing in July. </p>
<p>Wang also made clear in a subsequent meeting with climate envoy John Kerry that climate change cannot be singled out as an area of cooperation amid competition in other areas. </p>
<p>In recent months, China also repeatedly warned the US against forming “small groups” to contain China, in veiled references to the Quad and AUKUS. </p>
<p>This tone shifted in September after Biden and Xi spoke over the phone, and after Biden’s speech at the United Nations in which he said the US did not seek a new cold war. </p>
<p>His remarks were well received in Beijing and may have opened the door to the video summit and a subsequent US-China agreement on climate change cooperation on various issues including methane control at the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow. </p>
<h2>A SUCCESS IN LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE</h2>
<p>The most important outcome of the Biden-Xi meeting was in succeeding in lowering the temperature in bilateral relations. </p>
