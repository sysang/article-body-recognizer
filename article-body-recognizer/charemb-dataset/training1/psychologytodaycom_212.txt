<h2> The Debate Over Video Game Addiction </h2>
<a>addiction</a>” in the same sense as drug and
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, widely used for behavioral health diagnoses in the U.S., the latest version of the manual—the DSM-5—refers to Internet Gaming Disorder as a condition for further study.
<a>deception</a> about the amount of one’s gaming; and failed attempts to control one’s gaming.
<div> <h3> What are the criticisms of gaming disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> of pathologizing normal human behavior, which treatment providers could potentially exploit for profit; some argue that the proposed symptoms of
<a>Internet gaming disorder may reflect passion for a hobby rather than a clinical condition.</a>
<a>gaming addiction and its discerning criteria</a>. An addiction may reflect underlying psychological conditions that problem gamers are likely to have, suggesting that
<a>gaming disorder is not a discrete condition.</a>
<div> <h3> Is gaming disorder the same as a gaming addiction? </h3> </div>
<p>Colloquially, people tend to use gaming disorder and gaming addiction interchangeably. But some researchers believe the criteria and language put forth to diagnose <a>gaming disorder doesn’t fully capture the nature of addiction</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Does the video game industry view gaming as a disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How are behavioral addictions generally viewed? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does the DSM-5 include any behavioral addictions? </h3> </div>
<a>Gambling disorder</a> is the only behavioral addiction included in the DSM-5. But researchers and clinicians have long debated many others, including video gaming, Internet use, exercise, shopping,
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> When Is Gaming a Mental Health Problem? </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the signs of video game addiction? </h3> </div>
<p>According to the gaming disorder diagnosis in the <a>ICD-11,</a> signs include:</p>
<p>• The inability to control gaming, such as not being able to stop.</p>
<p>• Prioritizing gaming over other interests and activities.</p>
<p>• Continuing to game despite negative consequences, such as losing a job.</p>
<p>According to the DSM-5 proposed criteria for a <a>potential Internet gaming disorder,</a> signs include:</p>
<p>• Preoccupation with gaming.</p>
<p>• Symptoms of withdrawal when unable to play video games, such as irritability or <a>anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>• Tolerance over time—needing to play more or more powerful games.</p>
<p>• Inability to control gaming.</p>
<p>• Loss of interest in other activities.</p>
<p>• Excessive gaming despite negative consequences personally or professionally.</p>
<p>• Deception about gaming habits.</p>
<p>• Gaming to escape negative emotions.</p>
<p>• Jeopardizing or losing a relationship, job, or other opportunity due to gaming.</p>
<div> <h3> How common is video game addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>vast majority of video gamers do not have an addiction.</a>
<div> <h3> What factors might contribute to video game addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>, and anxiety.
<a>Motivation</a> also matters; people who game for fun or to be social seem less likely to become hooked than people who game for status or to escape from their problems.
<div> <h3> How do video games affect the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>Dopamine</a> pathways become active when people play video games, although those same pathways are activated by most pleasurable activities. Research suggests that
<a>video gaming may raise dopamine</a> to about double its resting level, whereas drugs like heroin, cocaine, and
<a>amphetamine</a> raise dopamine by roughly
<a>10 times</a> that much. 
<a>Video games activate the brain regions</a> involved in the task at hand.
<a>Research suggests,</a> for example, that games involving visual acuity and
<a>attention</a> activate parts of the brain that underlie visual acuity and attention. Games involving spatial
<a>memory</a> activate parts of the brain involved in spatial memory. Gaming not only activates many brain areas, but it may also lead to growth in some of those areas over time.
<div> <h3> How is video game addiction treated? </h3> </div>
<h2> Children and Video Games </h2>
<div> <h3> Is my child addicted to video games? </h3> </div>
<a>the child doesn’t have an addiction.</a> Kids may be drawn to video games because they satisfy psychological needs such as competence, autonomy, and connection, which are sometimes difficult to find in other places.
<div> <h3> What makes video games so appealing to children? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I reduce the amount of time my kid spends playing video games? </h3> </div>
<a>develop skills</a> to navigate
<a>stress</a>, social situations, and other challenges is also important.
<div> <h3> My child's social life takes place through video games. How do I navigate that? </h3> </div>
<a>video games can be extremely social. </a>And
<a>research</a> shows that communication during games is not just about the task at hand but about social and emotional themes as well.
<p>The fact that gaming can drive a child's entire <a>social life</a> puts parents in a bind. Although it's healthy to balance time online and off, the social needs children meet through gaming can sometimes outweigh the decision to stop them.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I get my child to stop playing video games? </h3> </div>
<a>social anxiety</a>, and ADHD. Understanding the feelings and experiences that
<a>drive a child to play video games</a> is key to helping them balance or stop playing video games.
<div> <h3> Do violent video games lead to aggression? </h3> </div>
<a>crime</a> and video violent game use find
<a>no evidence that increased sales of violent video games lead to a spike in violent crimes.</a> In fact, some evidence suggests that as more youth play video games, rates of youth violence have decreased.

<div> <h3> What are defense mechanisms? </h3> </div>
<a>Defense mechanisms were described by Freud</a> as ways in which the mind adapts to internal conflicts. Examples include repression, or barring uncomfortable thoughts from consciousness;
<a>displacement</a>, or shifting emotional responses (such as
<a>aggression</a>) from an initial target to a safer one; and

<h2> Freud and Psychotherapy </h2>
<a>psychotherapy</a>—including contemporary psychoanalysis—differ from him on the details of theory and practice,
<a>they have nevertheless been influenced by Freud's work</a>.
<div> <h3> What is Freudian psychoanalysis? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some of the techniques Freud used in therapy? </h3> </div>
<a>free association</a>, in which a patient talks freely about any thoughts that come to mind, thought to be a way to bring internal conflicts into awareness and address them. The relationship between therapist and patient was also considered key, and
<a>transference</a>—projecting one's feelings about another person (such as a parent) onto the therapist—presented an opportunity to deal with those feelings. 
<div> <h3> Why did Freud's patients lie on a couch? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are neuroses? </h3> </div>
<a>Neurosis</a> is a term used to describe conditions involving marked
<a>anxiety</a> or distress (in the form of irrational fears, obsessions, or other symptoms). Freud proposed that neuroses, as well as other forms of mental illness, stemmed from unconscious internal conflicts, as when an urge is suppressed.
<div> <h3> How did Freud train other analysts? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are there still Freudian psychoanalysts today? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>There are still practicing psychoanalysts, though <a>psychoanalysis has evolved</a> beyond Freud’s original ideas. A related and broader category of therapy is psychodynamic therapy.</p> </div> </div>

<a>wisdom</a> and meaning in Freudian concepts, such as
<a>defense mechanisms</a>," and modern
<a>psychoanalytic</a> therapists owe much to Freud’s methods, as do therapists who employ psychodynamic approaches.
<div> <h3> Why are Freud’s theories important? </h3> </div>
<a>Freud’s concepts persist</a> in the popular
<a>imagination</a> and his work forms an important part of the history of psychology. Though many of his ideas have been reevaluated or rejected, others provided a basis for further psychological theory and modes of treatment.

<h2> The Process of Engagement </h2>
<div> <h3> Why should you push yourself out of your comfort zone? </h3> </div>
<p>Despite being associated with creative tasks, flow can also be applied to education, sports, and the workplace. One of Csikszentmihalyi’s key points about flow is that a person needs to push oneself out of their comfort zone to induce it.</p>

<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> The Importance of Estrogen </li> <li> When Estrogen Fluctuates </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> The Importance of Estrogen </h2>
<p>Estrogen production impacts women’s health in a variety of ways, from protection against memory loss and dementia, to management of sleep cycles, to reproductive health. American women experience menopause at an average age of 51.</p>
<div> <h3> What role does estrogen play in the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>Estrogen bolsters learning and memory</a> through the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain on which estrogen and progesterone both act. The hormone also protects emotional well-being—when estrogen plummets in menopause,
<a>anxiety</a> and depression often result. It offers neuroprotective qualities, helping the brain heal after a stroke or
<a>traumatic brain injury</a> and guarding against degeneration that can lead to
<a>cognitive decline</a> and dementia. 
<div> <h3> What role does estrogen play in the body? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect mood? </h3> </div>
<a>genes</a> related to reproductive
<a>hormones</a> and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, a
<a>mood disorder</a> that involves intense sadness, irritability, and anxiety before a woman’s period. A woman’s
<a>genes may therefore shape how her body responds to estrogen,</a> and in turn, her mood. 
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect memory? </h3> </div>
<a>short-term memory deficits.</a> And the transition to menopause may render women more susceptible to
<a>developing Alzheimer’s disease,</a> showcasing the
<a>neuroprotective qualities of estrogen</a>.
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect sleep? </h3> </div>
<a>sleeping</a> soundly, and waking fewer times in the night. While high estrogen levels are associated with strong sleep, low estrogen levels are associated with disrupted sleep.
<a>Insomnia is one of the common symptoms of menopause,</a> a time when estrogen levels drop.
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect pain? </h3> </div>
<a>pregnancy</a> and childbirth, which provides some natural pain relief. There’s a
<a>gender</a> gap when it comes to pain—
<a>women have more frequent, longer-lasting, and severe pain than men</a>—and estrogen and progesterone are involved in those differences.
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect the immune system? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does estrogen affect attraction? </h3> </div>
<a>estrogen contributes to attraction.</a> Yet new work calls into question research on specific aspects of
<a>attraction</a>; for example, it seems that women are no more likely to prefer men’s faces that are more masculine than feminine at different stages of the menstrual cycle and when taking or not taking birth control pills.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> When Estrogen Fluctuates </h2>
<div> <h3> What happens when estrogen levels are low? </h3> </div>
<a>perimenopause</a> such as hot flashes, night sweats, lower
<a>sex</a> drive, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis,
<a>insomnia</a>, mood swings or depression, and impairments to memory and
<a>concentration</a>. This is the most common time to experience low estrogen, but it can also affect young women for specific reasons such as an autoimmune condition or
<div> <h3> What happens when estrogen levels are high? </h3> </div>
<a>testosterone</a>, such as when taking estrogen
<a>therapy</a>. This imbalance can occasionally lead to mood swings, anxiety, headaches, insomnia, memory problems, bloating, swelling, and low sex drive, which may lead women to shift their treatment. 
<div> <h3> How are atypical estrogen levels treated? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is hormone replacement therapy controversial? </h3> </div>
<a>estrogen has protective qualities</a> such as defending against heart attacks, osteoporosis, and dementia. The decision will be different for everyone, but many doctors believe that estrogen is not only safe but helps prevent other health problems.

<h2> When Mind Reading Is a Challenge </h2>
<a>psychiatric</a> and behavioral disorders, like
<a>ADHD</a>, make reading the thoughts and feelings of others a challenge. Although people with
<a>ADHD</a> don’t routinely lack empathy, they may struggle to pick up on subtle hints, or may respond impulsively without taking the time to assess someone’s words or tone.
<p>These difficulties likely have roots in multiple areas of the brain; some research has pointed to atypical activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the brain which plays a role in emotion, moral decisions, and social evaluation.</p>
