<h1> The Beautiful Truths About Being a Highly Sensitive Human </h1>
<h2> "Am I too much for the world, or is the world too much for me?" </h2>
<p>Being intense and sensitive—seeing the world through different eyes and feeling the world on a distinctive wavelength—does not lay an easy path.</p>
<p>You might have spent your whole life trying to fit in with the cultural "shoulds" and "musts." In school, you wanted to be in the clique, but you were unable to make small talk or have shallow relationships.</p>
<p>At work, you want the authorities to recognise you, but your soul does not compromise on depth, <a>authenticity</a>, and connection. </p>
<p>You feel hurt for being the black sheep in the family, but your success is not recognised in a conventional way.</p>
<p>In these following paragraphs, I want to remind you how precious your unique life path is. Rather than pretending to be who you are not, you only do yourself and the world justice by celebrating your sensitivity and intensity.</p>
<p>(Read the <a>full definition</a> of what it means to be emotionally intense and sensitive.)</p>
<p>Sensitivity as a form of brain difference</p>
<p>Emotional sensitivity is a brain difference—an innate trait that makes one different from the normative way of functioning. </p>
<a>neuroscience</a> are going in the opposite direction. More and more, the scientific community acknowledges "
<a>neurodiversity</a>"—the biological reality that we are all wired differently. Rather than being an inconvenience to be eliminated, neurodiversity is an evolutionary advantage, something that is essential if we were to flourish as a species.
<a>sex</a>, gambling, or other addictions.
<a>intelligence</a>, talents or
<a>loneliness</a> make them more susceptible to having an actual mental disorder.
<p>Some of us are born sensitive</p>
<a>sensory processing sensitivity</a>, "differential susceptibility theory," and "biological sensitivity to context" (Lionetti et al., 2018).
<a>stress</a>. Their system secrets higher levels of norepinephrine (our brain’s version of adrenaline) and stress
<a>hormones</a> like cortisol. In other words, they have a
<a>fear</a> system that is more active than most.
<a>chronic pain</a> and fatigue,
<a>migraine</a> headaches, and environmental stimuli ranging from smell, sight, sound to electromagnetic influences.
<p>Here are a set of HSP traits in Aron’s original conception:</p>
<li>Noticing sounds, sensations, and smells that others miss (e.g. clock ticking, the humming noise from a refrigerator, uncomfortable clothing)</li>
<li>Feeling moved on a visceral level by things like art, music, performance, or nature</li>
<li>"Pick up" others moods or have them affect you more than most</li>
<li>Being sensitive to pain or other physical sensations</li>
<li>A quiet environment is essential to you</li>
<li>Feel uneasy or overwhelmed in a busy and crowded environment</li>
<li>Sensitivity to caffeine</li>
<li>Dramatic impact on your mood</li>
<li>Having food sensitivities, allergies, asthma</li>
<p>The orchids and the dandelions</p>
<p>But does being born sensitive destine one to lifelong unhappiness and turmoil? To answer this question, Thomas Boyce, M.D., founded the "Orchid and Dandelion" theory. </p>
<a>the environment</a> can also bring a reversal of fortune.
<a>childhood</a> environment are the same children most likely to flourish and prosper. They may be more prone to upsets and physical sensitivities, but they also possess the most capacity to be unusually vital, creative, and successful.
<p>Our world is changing. Qualities such as sensitivity, empathy, high perceptiveness—what the sensitive person excel at, are needed and celebrated. </p>
<a>intuition</a>, creativity, and empathy.
<a>empathic</a> misfits rise to become the leaders. Therefore, embracing your gift of sensitivity is not just something you do for yourself, but also those around you. If you can summon the courage to stand out as a sensitive
<a>leader</a>, you set a solid example for all others like you. The more you can free yourself from the childlike need to trade "fitting in" for authenticity, the more you can channel your gifts and serve the world.

<h1> Get to the Roots of Your Anxiety and Perfectionism </h1>
<h2> Having to grow up too soon might be why you could never relax. </h2>
<p>Some of us only know ourselves to be highly anxious, <a>perfectionistic</a> adults.</p>
<p>When something goes wrong, we immediately assume it is our fault. </p>
<p>When mistakes happen, we are unable to forgive ourselves. </p>
<p>We feel guilty and ashamed for even the smallest error. </p>
<p>We jump to the worst possible outcome so we could prepare for it.</p>
<p>We become socially anxious because we do not believe our real self would be accepted. </p>
<p>When our partners distance themselves, we become frightened of abandonment.</p>
<p>When conflicts arise in relationships, we rush to rescue the situation, sometimes sacrificing our own dignity.</p>
<p>Even when we have done our best, we blame ourselves for not being perfect.</p>
<p>If we were to dissect our life history, we might realize our breathlessness stems from having to grow up too early, too soon as a sensitive and empathically <a>gifted</a> child. </p>
<p>"Parentification" occurs when a child is put in a position where she has to grow up ‘too early too soon’, is burdened with a huge amount of responsibility, or is made to be a parent to their siblings and parents. </p>
<a>empathic</a> individuals have automatically taken on the role of ‘the little adult’ in their family- sometimes concretely and practically, but most of the time covertly and on a psychological level.
<p>Children naturally blame themselves for what happens to them.</p>
<p>If they are bullied, they believe it is because they are not beautiful, or smart enough. </p>
<p>If they are neglected, they believe they are too needy to begin with. </p>
<p>If they are burdened with demands that they cannot fulfill, they believe it is their failure—failing to be a perfect child, failing to take good care of their siblings, failing to soothe their parents’ <a>anger</a>. </p>
<p>When parents blame a child, the child believes that they are in the wrong. </p>
<p>This feeling doesn’t just go away, and many of us carry it into our adulthood.</p>
<p>Some sensitive and intense children are cast as the black sheep of the family, the carrier of all blame. </p>
<a>subconscious</a> belief that whatever happened was because of us, and that somehow we should have fixed the situation.
<p>On the surface, we might say we don’t believe we are responsible for our family’s dysfunction. </p>
<p>But deep down in there, we feel as though if we had been a different child, things would have been better.</p>
<p>Our childlike mind thought perhaps if we were less difficult, less sensitive, our parents would treat us differently. </p>
<p>We thought if we were somehow "better"—a less needy child, a more helpful child, bad things would not happen. </p>
<p>We thought if we silenced our needs and desire, if we never expressed frustrations or sadness, they would be less angry.</p>
<p>We thought if we became hyper-vigilant and hyper emphatic, picking up the earliest smallest clues of our parents’ outbursts, we could protect our siblings. </p>
<p>We thought if we were our parents’ confidant and counselor, we could take away their pain. </p>
<a>guilt</a>, and the inability to feel safe.
<p>One reason we are unable to let go of the past is the deep-down longing that we will be able to make things ‘right’. </p>
<p>Yet no matter how hard we try, reality is not perfect, and our family may remain in <a>denial</a> of their wrongdoings. </p>
<p>Even in our own lives, we cannot control the many uncertainties.</p>
<p>When bad things happen, we get into the habit of driving all blame to ourselves, drowning in cycles of guilt and <a>shame</a>. </p>
<p>But you are reading this because you have had enough.</p>
<p>The childlike part of you is still terrified of conflicts, and fears abandonment and rejection.</p>
<p>But the <a>wise</a>, healthy part of you wants to break free from the myth that had kept you stuck. </p>
<p>The art of surrender is at the centre of many <a>spiritual</a> and healing practices; knowing that we cannot control reality can paradoxically bring the biggest relief.</p>
<a>childhood</a> conditioning that has trained us to always be in high alert to emotional signals, to put others’ needs before our own, and to hyper-empathise to the point where we lose ourselves.
<p>Relieving ourselves of the impossible duty to rescue, help, or emotionally caretake anyone is the biggest gift to ourselves. </p>
<p>It is not your fault that you could not cure your parents of their <a>depression</a>, <a>alcoholism</a>, workaholism, addictions, and trauma. </p>
<p>You do not need to punish yourself for not living up to an impossible standard.</p>
<p>It was never your task to live your parents’ unlived lives. </p>
<p>You could not have protected your siblings from your parents’ dysfunctions. </p>
<p>It should never have been on your to calm or comfort anyone. You were only a child. </p>
<p>You are allowed to be imperfect, to make mistakes, to make a mess. </p>
<p>You do not have to do anything to be worthy of existence. </p>
<p>You are not here to help others, achieve things, or be productive. You deserve to exist just as you are.</p>
<p>You do not have to sacrifice your needs to accommodate others. People can take care of themselves.</p>
<p>You could not change who your parents are, how they behave, or what they believe. </p>
<p>There might never be justice, but your <a>happiness</a> is not contingent on what they say or think. </p>
<p>The first step to releasing past hurt is <a>forgiving</a> yourself- even there was nothing to ‘forgive’ in the first place. </p>
<p>Let it go. You have done more than enough. </p>
<p>Unburden yourself, and live your own life, not according to anyone’s scripts. </p>
<p>Here is a poem from Rilke on releasing the burden you could not hold:</p>
<p><a>Fear</a> not the pain. Let its weight fall back into the earth; for heavy are the mountains, heavy the seas.</p>
<p>The trees you planted in childhood have grown too heavy. You cannot bring them along. Give yourselves to the air, to what you cannot hold.</p>
<p>(Rilke in Anita Barrows and Joanna Macy’s translation—"What you cannot hold.")</p>

<h2> Why being "over-excited" can be a gift. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>All your life, you have been told you are "too much."</p>
<a>friendship</a> and soulmates. All your life, you think there is something wrong with you. Never did you consider the possibility that your intensity is pointing towards enormous creative potential.
<blockquote> <p>“Overexcitability”—a high level of reactivity of the central <a>nervous system</a>—is a constitutional endowment. </p> </blockquote>
<p>Dąbrowski presented five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual and emotional, and each contributes to certain qualities:</p>
<p>(The following descriptions are drawn from Webb et al., 2005; Piechoski; Lind, 2001; Jeanne Siaud-Facchinin, 2012):</p>
<p>Intellectual Overexcitability </p>
<li>You have a hunger for knowledge, and you always seek to understand the truth, to analyze and synthesize a wide range of information</li>
<li>You love learning, problem-solving, and reflective thinking. This may or may not be reflected in terms of academic achievements.</li>
<li>You have an active mind and are immensely curious about the world</li>
<li>You are acutely aware of your surrounding and make keen observations</li>
<p>Imaginational Overexcitability</p>
<li>You have unusually imaginative and fantastical thoughts</li>
<li>As a child, you may have imaginary playmates, imaginary <a>pets</a>, engage in lots of <a>fantasy</a> play, or spend long hours daydreaming</li>
<li>You may come across as <a>shy</a>, self-conscious, or have a tendency toward <a>depression</a></li>
<li>You worry about issues of life and death more than other people</li>
<p>Emotional Overexcitability</p>
<li>You can form deep emotional attachments to people, places, and objects. </li>
<li>With your naturally high <a>empathy</a>, you feel like you have to be the emotional <a>caretaker</a> of whatever environment you walk into. </li>
<li>You seem to absorb the emotions of people around you and may have trouble setting personal boundaries and separating your feelings and needs from those of others.</li>
<li>You are uncomfortable with conflicts and concealed <a>anger</a> and could pick up on other people’s <a>passive aggressiveness</a></li>
<li>You sponge up others' feelings involuntarily. You could be overwhelmed by the amount of psychic information you receive in a group setting or crowded space. </li>
<li>As you endeavor to help others or the natural environment, you realize others do not share your idealistic perspective. </li>
<a>dissociate</a> with all feelings altogether and live in a constant state of numbness.
<p>Psychomotor Overexcitability</p>
<li>You seem to have lots of energy; you love movement and struggle to be still. Your body may fidget and twitch in their excitements. As a child, you might have been given the diagnosis of <a>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> (ADHD).</li>
<li>You speak fast, especially when you are excited. </li>
<li>When feeling emotionally tense, you may act impulsively or compulsively (such as becoming hyper-organized). </li>
<li>You at times experience <a>insomnia</a> or mild form of <a>mania</a>. </li>
<p>Sensual Overexcitability</p>
<li>You have a heightened sensitivity to sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Though you may thrive in chaos, other people’s clutters bother you.</li>
<li>From an early age, you have a deep appreciation of all the beauty in this world. You have always been drawn to elements of art, language, and music, and tend to immerse deeply in them.</li>
<li>You are easily over-stimulated or overwhelmed by sensory input.</li>

<h1> Unresolved Anger Towards Our Parents </h1>
<h2> Release your past to free your soul. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<h2>Forgiving vs. Forgetting</h2>
<p>First, forgiving is not forgetting.</p>
<p>In fact, forgetting is the antidote to forgiving. </p>
<p>By covering up our anger, prematurely moving into fake forgiveness, drowning our truths to protect others, letting go of our boundaries for surface harmony, we are bypassing an essential step in our attainment of emotional freedom. </p>
<a>depression</a>, allowing abuse, the inability to stand up for oneself.
<p>Though in reality, the process is not linear, it might be helpful for us to break down what "forgiveness" or "releasing" is, not merely as a concept, but as a step-by-step journey. </p>
<p>1. We face the truth — The ugly, painful, inconvenient truth.</p>
<p>2. We tell our story — We can start with one person, perhaps our therapist, or even our diary.</p>
<a>aggression</a>. It is essential that we do not direct the anger back towards ourselves in the form of
<p>4. We grieve — The tunnel of <a>grief</a> is dark, but the light at the end is liberation.</p>
<a>wisdom</a>, the love and the hate, the anger and the compassion.
<h2>Specifically, on Anger</h2>
<p>Anger is one of the most challenging steps in this journey. </p>
<a>envy</a>, grief, resentment, regret.
<p>But to release, we ought to reclaim rightful anger. </p>
<p>Anger can be a healthy emotion if we relate to it as such. </p>
<p>If we are not so afraid of releasing it bit by bit, it will not have to be built up to the point of explosion. </p>
<p>Anger is the other side of the passion that makes you feel alive. Shutting down the dark side of your emotions, you are also robbed of the joy and aliveness that is on the other side. </p>
<div> <h2>Anger Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>5 Symptoms of Repressed Anger</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Adaptive and Maladpative Anger </a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>When someone hurts you, see if you can feel angry instead of depression.</p>
<p>When something unjust happens in the world, try to turn your anger into energy that propels action. </p>
<p>When someone crosses your boundaries, practice an <a>assertive</a>, healthy expression of anger. </p>
<p>True release starts with knowing our story, even when it means staring daringly at the cruelty, dysfunctions, and limitations of those who have hurt us. </p>
<p>We see how, unlike the superman or superwoman our childlike-self had wanted our parents to be, they are wounded, limited, and human. </p>
<p>They have acted out of their insecurities, projections, insecurities, trauma, and wounds, and those acts have wounded us. </p>
<p>They did not understand our intensity and said hurtful words that made us shrink. </p>
<p>They felt threatened by what we saw and said, and tried to stifle our voice. </p>
<p>We were used to compensate for their unlived lives; </p>
<p>We had become the container for the <a>anxiety</a> that they could not bear. </p>
<p>Rather than deleting, bypassing, forgetting, or excusing the awfulness of it all, we see that our painful memories sit alongside all the happy moments, peace, and joy that we do have in life, and one does not negate the other. </p>
<p>We think not of elimination of our past hurt but of integrating our story as a part of us.</p>
<p>This is expansion, rather than contraction— we are expanding our capacity to hold paradoxes and opposites, rather than tightening to resist life. </p>
<p>We widen our circle of love, without shrinking into the position of a scared animal.</p>
<p>Once we have released our resentment, we can move through life with a sense of lightness and ease.</p>
<p>When something causes hurt now, we can hold both compassion for self and others in our heart, and we can stand up for ourselves without being aggressive to others. </p>
<p>When we again become confronted with our parents’ dysfunctions, we might be able to hold both their limitations and their love for us.</p>
<p>When people repeatedly let us down, we remember that we are no longer a helpless child, and could choose to take assertive actions, or walk away. </p>
<p>Rather than reacting, we patiently wait for our emotional wheel to turn, for the bad to become good, for the dawn after dusk. </p>
<p>We align with the narrative of a Phoenix rising from the fire, a heroic journey of a wounded soul rising to the occasion.</p>

<h1> Existential Crisis: Coming Home to Ourselves </h1>
<h2> Reclaim your true self as an intense person. </h2>
<p>Some of us are naturally more intense and sensitive than others.</p>
<a>shame</a>. Not all of us are fortunate enough to have a family that understands and respects
<p>We learned, painstakingly, with all our life force, to drown our <a>inner voice</a> so that we could fit in. </p>
<a>anger</a>, frustration, and minimize our needs.
<a>teenagers</a>, belonging meant adapting ourselves to
<a>the environment</a>. We did everything we could to be accepted, to not be bullied, teased, or rejected by the group. From a tender age, we learned the horror of being ostracized.
<a>authenticity</a> is often a harder path for the natural misfits.
<p>Being haunted by the threat of being ostracized, we spend our whole life constructing a facade that would allow us to "pass" normalcy. </p>
<p>We become hypervigilant and cautious, picking up the smallest negative social clues so that we can edit our behaviors accordingly.</p>
<p>Since our vibrancy and excitement were met with nothing but blind stares or puzzlement, we realized that sharing makes us lonelier than not sharing.</p>
<p>The minute our achievement sticks out, it gets chopped down; so we learn never to reach high. </p>
<p>Opportunities became threats, and we <a>self-sabotage</a> before anyone could destroy us. </p>
<p>We thought we could protect ourselves by playing small, but stifling our soul comes with huge costs.</p>
<p>We are depressed, because we have denied our soul’s truths. </p>
<p>We feel empty and numb, because our soul has gone into hiding. </p>
<p>We are like wild animals trying to domesticate ourselves, trading our natural exuberance for the crowd’s approval. </p>
<a>psychiatry</a>, and the experience of existential darkness has been medicalized, rather than examined, valued, and understood. The
<a>spiritual</a> origin and meaning of depression are hardly talked about, yet well documented when we look closely at people’s experience across history.
<h3>True Self, False Self: Winnicott</h3>
<p>Our soul is always aligned with our real, authentic, intense, and sensitive true self, and when we overwork in the suit of our armor, our soul will wake us up—sometimes violently, in surprising hours. </p>
<h3>Individualization: Carl Jung</h3>
<p>Authenticity was a big part of Carl Jung’s life’s work. Jung defined a mature personality as "the supreme realization of the innate idiosyncrasy of a living being" (CG Jung, The Development of Personality, 1954). </p>
<p>At the critical juncture, we enter a chaotic "liminal space"— a space where we anxiously float in an "in-between" zone. As Richard Rohr puts it: </p>
<a>Freud</a>. Given Freud's prominence in the 1920s, Jung’s action required tremendous strength. Without his tenacity to break free, we would not have the Jung we know.
<a>guilt</a> and a compulsion to please those we care about, it is a worthwhile endeavor and will eventually lead to deeper
<a>intimacy</a> with those we love. As Mark Nepo poignantly puts it:
<h3>Authenticity: Existential Philosophies </h3>
<a>morality</a>—created a more widespread existential crisis for the philosophically aware.
<h3>Honor the Existential Darkness</h3>
<p>The above is by no means an exhaustive list of theories and philosophies that see internal chaos as a necessary rite of passage for the unyielding misfits. There are many other examples in the world within art and literature.</p>
<a>neurotic</a> need to be liked, or your neurotic fear of being disliked. It is when you can free yourself from these fears that you become a true channel of your gifts.

<h1> Do You Have a “Normal Part” and a “Traumatized Part?" </h1>
<h2> Complex trauma, borderline personality disorder and structural dissociation. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Trauma? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from trauma</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Trauma affects intense people differently. </p>
<a>depression</a>. Their need for emotional feedback from a young age means they are heavily wounded by emotional neglect.
<p>Things that do not affect their siblings or peers hurt them deeply. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, few mental health professionals understand emotional sensitivity and chronic <a>childhood</a> trauma. People are likely to be over-diagnosed and medicated rather than getting the understanding they truly need. </p>
<a>intense and sensitive children</a> tend to face. In this article, we discuss the mechanism of structural dissociation, which is a common reaction to
<a>complex trauma</a> that affects many of us for life.
<h3>Structural Dissociation</h3>
<a>anger</a> and resentment for others toward ourselves. Our righteous anger became internalized
<a>shame</a> that were unbearable, so we had to create a "separate self" in our mind to survive the invasion.
<p>We carry our traumatized self everywhere we go.</p>
<p>Our traumatized part sees danger, criticisms, and abandonment everywhere, and has a hard time receiving love. </p>
<p>It is frozen in time, so when our traumatized part takes over, we feel like a child in an adult body. </p>
<p>It is always on guard, always waiting to be harmed or betrayed. </p>
<p>It controls our body and emotions in ways we are not always conscious of. For instance, when we grind our teeth at night, or when we burst into an uncontrollable rage.</p>
<h3>We Start Avoiding Life</h3>
<p>In structural dissociation, we live a life designed to avoid our <a>traumatic</a> memories.</p>
<div> <h2>Trauma Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How Men’s Mental Health Impacts Their Families</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>5 Secrets About Trauma Therapists</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>As we craft our life desperately trying to avoid our past, our lives become increasingly restricted. In the end, we build a wall against both the outer and our inner life and ended up feeling empty and numb.</p>
<h3>Signs of Structural Dissociation</h3>
<p>Here are some of the signs of structural dissociations that happen as a result of chronic childhood trauma:</p>
<p>Even we know that something happened, it does not feel real. We lose parts of the memories and so our story of the past does not make sense.</p>
<p>We detach from our physical bodies. We become like a working machine that does not know when it is tired, hungry, thirsty, <a>lonely</a>, or sad. Because of this, we also neglect self-care. Eventually, we get <a>burned out</a> at work and in life. </p>
<p>Lack of <a>Motivation</a> and Stamina</p>
<p>Counter-Dependency and Isolation</p>
<p>We develop self-sufficient armor and feel unable to trust or be dependent on anyone. We put up a wall to avoid being known by others.</p>
<p>Apart from the Apparently Normal Part and the Traumatized Part, there is another essential part of us: Our Wise Part. No matter how traumatized we are, our innate driving force towards wholeness and health does not cease completely. </p>
<p>When we are being self-critical, our wise part whispers in our ears telling us we are worthy of love. </p>
<p>It absorbs <a>wisdom</a> from loved ones, teachers, and resources, then acts as our inner guiding light.</p>
<a>therapy</a>, reach out to friends, and to seek out support. It is the part of us that reads poetry, makes a painting and sings a song to express our unspeakable pain. It is the part of us that honors our
<a>authenticity</a> and tell us to be honest with our feelings.
<p>In our work towards integration, we must find and reinforce this part of us.</p>
<p>Healing is to bring all elements of our selves together. After years of feeling empty, we can no longer tolerate a disintegrated life.</p>
<p>It can be daunting when we first begin to drop the protective armor we have worn for years. As we gently open our hearts, we may feel tender, sensitive, and wary of others. We might feel as though we will get hurt again. </p>
<p>However, there is nothing to <a>fear</a>—we are merely going home. </p>
<p>Beyond trauma, it is in our power to take the next step. </p>
<p>Step by step, we can re-open as a human and re-emerge as a soul. </p>
<p>Your life is waiting for you. </p>

<h1> 4 Ways to Release Anger Towards Your Parents </h1>
<h2> Tired of holding on to resentment? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>adolescence</a> into adulthood.
<p>There is no comprehensive list of the possible ways in which a child can be left emotionally scarred. The causes of lifelong <a>anger</a> that some hold against a parent could be due to any of the following: </p>
<li>Physical or emotional neglect from parents. They may not be intentionally abusive but were affected by their own vulnerabilities or limited emotional capacity.</li>
<li>Physical, mental, or <a>sexual abuse</a></li>
<li>Failure of a parent to protect/defend a child from <a>bullying</a> or abuse</li>
<li>The lack of <a>attention</a>, affirmation, and reassurance to make a child feel worthy or even wanted</li>
<li>Parents expected too much from a child or were excessively controlling.</li>
<li>The family scapegoated a child—the emotionally sensitive child—as the "problematic one."</li>
<li>Parents were continually critical of a child.</li>
<li>Lack of support from parents for the pursuit of a <a>romantic relationship</a> or for a lifestyle or <a>career</a> choice</li>
<p>For those who experience such pain and carry it into their adult life, the consequences can be devastating. Consciously or unconsciously, they may:</p>
<li>Be unable to move on from the past and fail to build a happy present for themselves</li>
<li>Be emotionally unavailable as adults and therefore unable to sustain intimate relationships</li>
<li>Harbor insecurities into adulthood about whether they deserve to be loved or nurtured, and sabotage opportunities they get</li>
<li>Find themselves at times responding similarly as parents to their own children, and therefore perpetuating the cycle of emotional pain</li>
<li>Feel <a>suicidal</a> regardless of how much they have achieved in adult life</li>
<p>How can you break free from the shackles of a troubling emotional past, especially when the triggers (the parents) are still part of your present life?</p>
<p>1. Acknowledge your anger.</p>
<p>“I need to move on; it’s been too long.”</p>
<p>“Remembering the past doesn’t make me feel any better.”</p>
<p>“Nothing can be gained confronting them.”</p>
<a>denial</a> and minimizing were the only ways for you. Perhaps without hiding your pain—both to the outside world and to yourself—you couldn’t have moved forward with your daily life.
<p>In most cases, what happened was a result of trans-generational <a>trauma</a>. Perhaps our parents faced similar conditions themselves as kids, and for them, the behavior was the only thing they know. </p>
<a>spiritual</a> teachers, the more you will be able to let go, release, and move on.
<p>This strategy is not always possible. Some parents are more defensive and might never acknowledge what they have done. On some level, they know they had failed you and that the feeling of <a>guilt</a> probably makes them more defensive.</p>
<p>3. Set boundaries with your parents.</p>
<a>assertiveness</a> and set firm boundaries with your parents. As a child, you could not escape the family home or build a wall to defend yourself. But as an independent adult, you have the ability to say no, walk away, and minimize contact.
