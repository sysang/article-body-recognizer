<h1>Biden says he’s in favor of exception to filibuster for voting rights, ‘whatever it takes’</h1>
<h2>Getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60-vote threshold for passage to 50</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a>Senate</a>’s filibuster rule when it comes to the wide-ranging election and campaign finance reform bill that passed the Democrat-controlled House earlier this year but hit a roadblock in the Senate.
<p>"If the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster," he told <a>ABC News.</a> </p>
<p>Getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60-vote threshold for passage to 50. In the split 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie, allowing Democrats to push past Republicans.</p>

<p>His comments were quickly picked up by news outlets. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board<a> joked,</a> "An ‘exception’ to the filibuster? This is like an engineer saying he merely wants to remove a section of the Hoover Dam."</p>
<p><a>CNN REPORTER KNOCKS BIDEN OVER INTERVIEW ON COVID TEST SHORTAGES</a></p>
<p>Biden told the network that the filibuster exception would only be done as a last resort. The president said he does not think the Senate will "have to go that far."</p>
<p>Democrats have been in a full-out campaign to get Biden to agree to eliminate the filibuster, a move that the president said earlier this year would "throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done."</p>
<p><a>HOW WELL HAS BIDEN HANDLED COVID-19?</a></p>
<p><a><u>AMERICANS WILL HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS OR LONGER FOR COVID-19 TESTS PROMISED BY WHITE HOUSE</u></a></p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Biden in March that he risked a "scorched earth" Congress if he backed efforts to end the filibuster.</p>
<p>Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said this week that he intends to force a vote on the rule in the new year. Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, two moderates, have spoken out against the move.</p>

<h1>Kamala Harris fires back at Democrats’ claims she’s being ‘set up to fail’</h1>
<h2>Vice President: 'Anything that I handle is because it's a tough issue'</h2>
<h4><a>Tammy Bruce: Kamala Harris citing lack of travel as biggest failure signals 'chaos' in White House</a></h4>
<p>The Fox News contributor joined 'Fox Friends Weekend' to discuss the vice president's recent interview, arguing her remarks signal 'they're still scrambling' in the White House.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said Sunday that she does not believe she is being "set up to fail" amid complaints by fellow Democrats that she has been handed an impossible portfolio by <a>President Biden</a> during their first year in office.</p>
<p>During a pre-recorded interview with CBS's Margaret Brennan on "Face the Nation," Harris was asked to address criticism by <a>Democrats</a> that the vice president is being given a portfolio designed to work against her.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe I'm being set up to fail," Harris fired back.</p>
<p>Harris refused to say whether she believed the scrutiny was due to the fact that she’s a Black woman.</p>
<p>"I'll leave that for others to deal with," she told Brennan. "I have a job to do, and I'm going to get that job done."</p>

<p>A recent staff shakeup in Harris’s office has also fueled reports of a toxic work environment that have plagued the vice president since she took office.</p>
<p>One former staffer who worked for Harris before she was vice president told The Washington Post earlier this month that Harris is a "bully" who subjects her employees to "a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism."</p>
<a>told Politico back in June</a>. "It’s not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It’s not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like s---."
<a>Ashley Etienne</a>, and senior adviser to the vice president and chief spokesperson
<a>Symone Sanders</a> recently announced their departures.
<a>Politico reported this month</a> that other key members in Harris' office are "eyeing the exits."
<p>The White House has downplayed the departures, with press secretary Jen Psaki saying it is "natural" for staffers to be ready to "move on."</p>

<h1>'The Five' slam Biden for failing on COVID campaign promises and 'giving up'</h1>
<h2>Tyrus: 'We've heard nothing but nonsense coming out of the federal government under the [Biden] administration'</h2>
<div><h4><a>'The Five' knock Biden for failing to deliver campaign promises amid omicron surge</a></h4> <p>'The Five' react to Biden's past statements on shutting down the virus and compare to his performance on combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div>
<p>"<a>The Five</a>" ripped President Biden Tuesday for failing to deliver on campaign promises to shut down coronavirus and accused him "giving up."</p>
<p>During the 2020 campaign, candidate Joe Biden promised that he would end the pandemic in the U.S. "We will deal honestly with the American people and will never, ever, ever quit," he said.</p>
<a>federal solution</a>" is not the key to combating the
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic, which he said requires resolution at the "state level." Biden pointed to long lines at
<a><u>Christmas</u></a> weekend, lamenting, "Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do."
<p>Biden's change in tone was not lost on co-hosts of "The Five."</p>
<a>Rachel Campos-Duffy</a> said. "The president is singing a much different tune, saying there's not really much [the federal government] can do."
<div> <div><p> President Biden at the White House in Washington, July 22, 2021. (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst )</p></div></div>
<p>BIDEN SAYS STATES BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR COVID RESOLUTION, 'THE FIVE' REACTS</p>
<p>"It feels like maybe somebody just played Joe Biden's words for Joe Biden, and he listened," <a>Joey Jones</a> said.</p>
<p>Campos-Duffy also noted that Biden was remaining on vacation amid the holiday season omicron surge.</p>
<p>"Joe Biden is giving up and going to the beach," she said. "The president has no events today and instead is in Delaware for a holiday getaway, while omicron spikes all across the country."</p>

<a>Trump administration</a> for failing to ramp up testing availability. "The [Trump] administration's failure on testing is colossal. It's a failure of planning, leadership, and execution," he said as a presidential candidate.
<p>Biden's words have come back to haunt him amid COVID test shortages and omicron's surge.</p>
<p> "People all across the country still don't have access to COVID tests, and they're stuck waiting hours in line when maybe it didn't have to be this way," Campos-Duffy said.</p>

<h1>Iran's limited access to nuclear program provides blurred image of reality, UN chief claims</h1>
<h2>IAEA director Rafael Mariano Gossi said inspectors in Iran face numerous restrictions</h2>
<a><u>Iran</u></a> threaten to give the world only a "very blurred image" of Tehran's program as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.
<p><a><u>SATELLITE IMAGES, EXPERT SUGGEST IRANIAN SPACE LAUNCH COMING</u></a> </p>

<p>While stressing he wasn't involved in the political negotiations ongoing in Vienna, Grossi acknowledged the advances made by Iran since the deal's collapse meant there would have to be changes to the original agreement. </p>
<p>And while Iran insists its program is peaceful, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA have said Iran ran an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003. </p>
<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Grossi's remarks. </p>
<p>In Vienna, however, anxiety is growing among European nations at the negotiating table. The U.S. has remained outside of direct talks since abandoning the accord. </p>
<p>"Without swift progress, in light of Iran’s fast-forwarding of its nuclear program, the (deal) will very soon become an empty shell," they warned in an overnight statement. </p>
<p>Asked about the difference between the two administrations, Grossi said that "the change is palpable." </p>

<p>"The president himself and people around him have been saying very clearly they have views about the program," he said. "They have strong views about the interactions that Iran has been having" with both the IAEA and parties to the nuclear deal. </p>
<p>He also described cooperation with the Raisi administration as "slower than expected." </p>
<p>"We have been able to start this relationship quite late I would say," Grossi said. </p>
<p>Grossi said Iran has informed the IAEA about the ongoing construction and his inspectors "are following" progress at the sites. </p>
<p>He stressed the importance of ensuring that IAEA inspectors have the unfettered ability to monitor and access Iran's fast-accelerating nuclear program. </p>

<h1>Psaki skips Afghanistan in list of Biden's 'biggest foreign policy successes'</h1>
<h2>The Biden admin admitted this week it left more US citizens behind in Afghanistan</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a><u>press release</u></a> from the State Department, are drastically higher than the estimates President Biden gave regarding the number of Americans left behind in Afghanistan after U.S. forces left the country.

<p>In addition, a suicide bomb attack outside the Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport in Afghanistan on Aug. 26 killed 13 U.S. service members and injured at least 18 more, U.S. officials said – making it the deadliest day for U.S. troops in 10 years.</p>
<p>In a tweet, Psaki first pointed to the work the administration has done "reclaiming our leadership role in international institutions" and reaffirming ties with foreign partners to address "the biggest challenges of our time." </p>
<p>Psaki championed the administration’s role in delivering vaccines not only nationwide but globally. She said the U.S. has been a "driving" force in encouraging economic recovery following the pandemic. </p>

<p>But Psaki pointed to new ties that have come out of these increasingly strained geopolitical tussles as a win for the Biden administration. </p>
<p>"In the Indo-Pacific, we have developed new platforms like AUKUS and elevated the Quad," she said in reference to partnerships that have formed in response the Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. </p>
<p>"We are working more closely with our allies and partners in the region on defense, security, and economic interests while deepening connections between our European and Indo-Pacific allies," she added.</p>

<h1>Rockets fired toward US Embassy in Baghdad; one shot down, other misses</h1>
<h2>The rocket fire came less than two weeks after the top U.S. commander for the Middle East warned of possible attacks by Iranian-backed militias</h2>
<p>Two rockets were fired in the direction of the U.S. Embassy in <a>Baghdad</a> on Saturday, with one of them shot down by the U.S. military and the other missing the embassy compound, Fox News has confirmed.</p>
<p>The rocket that was shot down was hit by a U.S. C-RAM (counter rocket and mortar anti-missile) defense system, according to a U.S. <a>defense</a> official.</p>

<p>The incident came ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Iranian-backed militias for the U.S. to withdraw its forces from Iraq, according to the Post.</p>
<a><u>Middle East</u></a> said the U.S. would keep the current 2,500 troops in
<a><u>Iraq</u></a> for the foreseeable future, and he warned that he expected increasing attacks on U.S. and Iraqi personnel by Iranian-backed militias determined to get American forces out.

<h1>Top 5 foreign policy lessons Biden taught the world in 2021</h1>
<h2>Expectations that American policy will get much better under Biden are low</h2>
<h4><a>Dictatorships see Biden's weak foreign policy as opportunity to take advantage: Former CIA official</a></h4>
<p>Dan Hoffman warns Russia, Iran and China pose an 'unprecedented' threat to U.S. national security under the Biden administration.</p>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>Like the noisy neighbor throwing a raucous, late-night, blow-out, America just can’t be ignored. Here are the five biggest lessons the rest of the world learned about U.S. foreign policy in the Biden era. </p>
<blockquote><p>Freedom-loving world leaders are losing sleep over what might happen in places like Ukraine, Taiwan and the Middle East.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Congress is Not Brain Dead on Defense </p>
<p>Biden led a massive delegation to Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26, the annual international gabfest on climate change. It produced little more than hot air. </p>
<p>Then he tried to jam his signature climate initiatives into the Build Back Better bill. It crashed and burned in the Senate. Something is going on here. We may have reached peak climate hysteria. </p>
<p>There is no question that climate ranks as a top item on the administration’s agenda. But politicians at home and leaders around the world are taking a harder look at that agenda and asking: "Is this really the best way to save the planet?" </p>
<p>Other countries are seeing similar responses. More and more people don’t want policies written by Biden, Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They want sensible policies that will work. </p>
<p>The most interesting lesson from the last year may be that Biden’s fecklessness has made a case—not just to Americans, but to the free world—that maybe America First wasn’t such a bad idea after all. </p>

<h1>MSNBC columnist calls for end of NORAD Santa tracker 'out of concern for Santa's safety' from US military</h1>
<h2>The columnist wondered if a military that 'wrongly' kills would ever come clean if it assassinated Santa</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>An MSNBC columnist is calling for the end of the NORAD Santa tracker, claiming that it is time to "decouple" Santa Claus from American military culture.</p>
<p><a><u>CHRISTMAS 2021: READ BIDEN, TRUMP AND OBAMA'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGES TO AMERICANS</u></a></p>
<a>Netflix movie "Operation Christmas Drop,"</a> a seasonally themed rom-com that cheerfully seeks to boost approval for America’s military base in Guam."
<p>Brown explained that he does not consider himself a "scrooge" and does acknowledge the joy the practice brings children but ultimately believes: "The messier business of war that goes on in the background doesn’t jibe with the Christmas spirit."</p>
<p><a><u>'A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE': MICHIGAN FIREFIGHTERS SAVE 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN TRAPPED IN HOUSE FIRE</u></a></p>
<p>Brown pointed to drone strikes that have caused civilian casualties across the world and have helped "military officials avoid the political headaches that come from massive ground deployments."</p>
<p>Brown outlined examples of the U.S. military, in his belief, not being held accountable for military strikes that left civilians dead and then wondered aloud if the military would be held accountable if it killed Santa Claus in a drone strike.</p>
<p>The article concludes with Brown not being able to answer that question, which he says is part of the justification for stopping the NORAD practice of tracking Santa.</p>
<a>because at Christmas you tell the truth</a>, let’s have NORAD release Santa from its annual pantomimed surveillance."
<p>Several Twitter users responded to Brown’s Twitter post containing the article objecting to his conclusion.</p>
<p>One user <a><u>explained</u></a> that the military is "far from perfect" and the Santa tracker is a "tradition my kids love."</p>
<p>"Honestly, fair — it’d be weird if everyone agreed with me 100% of the time and I’m glad your kids enjoy it," Hayes responded.</p>
<div> <div><p> The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said that it had to scramble two pair of U.S. F-22 fighter jets to intercept the Russian formation on Tuesday. (Twitter)</p></div></div>
<a><u>accused</u></a> Brown of "hubris" and said "people are on duty at command centers all over the world, right now, Christmas Eve night" and "this serves as an international *training exercise* of tracking comms systems in an enjoyable way."
<p>"That’s the best argument I’ve seen supporting the program so far," Brown wrote back. "Mostly I’ve gotten ‘it’s for the children.’ So it’s both practical AND an annual PR bonanza."</p>
