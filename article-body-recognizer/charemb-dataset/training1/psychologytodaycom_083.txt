<div> <h3> What are defense mechanisms? </h3> </div>
<a>Defense mechanisms</a> are unconscious strategies that people use to protect themselves from discomfort. For example, they may attribute their own feelings onto someone else (

<div> <h3> What are the principles of contemporary psychoanalysis? </h3> </div>
<p>Although there is diversity in <a>psychoanalytic theory and treatment today,</a> several beliefs cut across these different perspectives: </p>
<p>1. An assumption that all human beings are motivated in part by wishes, <a>fantasies</a> or tacit knowledge that are outside of awareness (this is referred to as unconscious <a>motivation</a>).</p>
<p>2. An interest in facilitating awareness of unconscious motivations, thereby increasing choice.</p>
<p>3. An emphasis on exploring the ways in which we avoid painful or threatening feelings, fantasies and thoughts.</p>
<p>4. An assumption that we are ambivalent about changing and an emphasis on the importance of exploring this ambivalence.</p>
<p>5. An emphasis on using the therapeutic relationship as an arena for exploring clients’ self-defeating psychological processes and actions (both conscious and unconscious).</p>
<p>6. An emphasis on using the therapeutic relationship as an important vehicle of change.</p>
<p>7. An emphasis on helping clients to understand the way in which their own construction of their past and present plays a role in perpetuating their self-defeating patterns.</p>
<div> <h3> What is neuropsychoanalysis? </h3> </div>
<a>Freudian</a> psychology and its emphasis on subjective experience with neuroscientific findings about brain processes. As new technologies reveal ever more precise brain activity,
<a>neuropsychoanalysis seeks to identify the biological underpinnings</a> of emotion, fantasy, and the layers of the unconscious.

<h2> How Psychoanalysis Has Influenced Therapy </h2>
<div> <h3> How did psychoanalysis influence psychiatry? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How has the prominence of psychoanalysis changed over time? </h3> </div>
<a>philosophy</a> and art adopting psychoanalytic concepts, and insurance companies standardizing medical and psychological care.
<div> <h3> What are the critiques of psychoanalysis? </h3> </div>
<a>envy</a>. Psychoanalysis is also an intensive treatment, requiring a substantial investment of time and money. For these reasons, some argue shorter treatments with stronger evidence bases are stronger options.
<h2> Psychoanalysis in Practice </h2>
<p>Psychoanalysis has evolved and modernized since Freud’s conception of the practice, and many people engage in it today; It can be a powerful treatment for those wishing to delve into deep self-reflection.</p>
<p><a>Psychoanalysis is open-ended</a> and lacks predefined goals, in contrast to other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy. The process often lasts years, or even decades. </p>
<div> <h3> Is psychoanalysis right for me? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does psychoanalysis address resistance to change? </h3> </div>
<a>Psychoanalysis is well-suited to address the psyche’s unconscious resistance to change</a>, as it aims to unearth the hidden forces that explain why the unconscious may benefit from maintaining existing patterns.
<div> <h3> What kind of relationship do the patient and analyst have? </h3> </div>
<a>allow the psychoanalytic process to take place</a> through mechanisms such as transference and countertransference.
<a>Contemporary psychoanalysis</a> also places greater importance on this human relationship and its therapeutic value.
<div> <h3> What’s the process for becoming a psychoanalyst? </h3> </div>
<a>psychoanalysis has become dominated by psychologists.</a> Social workers and other mental health professionals have been entering the field in greater numbers as well.

<div> <h3> How does coffee affect the brain? </h3> </div>

<a>In the brain, caffeine</a> mimics the neurotransmitter adenosine, which accumulates to promote sleep and suppress arousal. Caffeine binds to those receptors, called A1 receptors, which blocks adenosine and prevents people from feeling tired.

<div> <h3> How are SSRIs prescribed? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Does depression result from a chemical imbalance of the brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the rationale for using drugs that affect serotonin? </h3> </div>
<a>motivation</a>, movement, and the capacity for pleasure. However, the notion that a chemical imbalance in the brain generates depression has given way to newer ideas that reflect a greater understanding of how the brain works.
<div> <h3> What does “reuptake inhibitor” mean? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> If depression isn’t a chemical imbalance, what is it? </h3> </div>
<a>stress</a> response system, often in response to early adverse experience. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety can be seen as
<a>“aversive yet adaptive responses to adversity.”</a>
<h2> How Effective Are SSRIs? </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the clinical efficacy of SSRIs? </h3> </div>
<a>placebo</a>, but the effect sizes were generally modest. Studies consistently show that
<a>antidepressants work best in conjunction with therapies</a> like
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> therapy (CBT).
<div> <h3> How long does it take to start feeling better? </h3> </div>
<a>anxious</a>, and feel less hopeless about the future. If a patient has not shown such improvement after six weeks, it’s likely that their doctor will recommend trying another antidepressant.
<div> <h3> How do you know if an SSRI is working? </h3> </div>
<a>insomnia</a> or mental slowness—may improve first, often within three weeks of beginning treatment. 
<a>Studies show</a> that most patients who eventually see improvements in mood first report gains in 
<a>cognition</a>. As a result, changes in
<a>cognition</a> may be one way to 
<a>better predict whether an antidepressant will work</a> for a patient.
<div> <h3> Why do SSRIs not work for everyone? </h3> </div>
<a>in approximately one-third of all depressed patients.</a> These individuals may continue to suffer from lingering symptoms, such as fatigue, pain,
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions.
<div> <h3> How are SSRIs used to treat depression? </h3> </div>
<h2> Risks and Side Effects </h2>
<div> <h3> Can SSRIs cause personality changes? </h3> </div>
<a>withdrawal symptoms</a>, such as increased depression, anxiety, and
<a>anger</a>, when stopping an SSRI that should be discussed with their overseeing physician.
<div> <h3> Do SSRIs cause sexual dysfunction? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual</a> dysfunction, including the loss of 
<a>orgasm</a>. Even as SSRIs increase serotonin levels, they have a dampening effect on the neurotransmitter 
<a>dopamine</a>, which is associated with the elation of falling in love. Patients should be aware of the potential for
<a>some SSRIs to cause problems with sexual desire and performance</a>. In some cases, these issues can be addressed by changing antidepressants, lowering the dosage, or taking a brief, physician-directed
<div> <h3> Do SSRIs make you gain weight? </h3> </div>
<a>weight gain.</a> Switching medications to avoid or reduce unwanted weight gain may be an option for some patients.
<div> <h3> Is it dangerous to just stop taking an SSRI? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is serotonin syndrome? </h3> </div>
<a>starting a new SSRI antidepressant</a> is advised to seek medical

<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Does depression result from a chemical imbalance of the brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the rationale for using drugs that affect serotonin? </h3> </div>
<a>motivation</a>, movement, and the capacity for pleasure. However, the notion that a chemical imbalance in the brain generates depression has given way to newer ideas that reflect a greater understanding of how the brain works.
<div> <h3> What does “reuptake inhibitor” mean? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> If depression isn’t a chemical imbalance, what is it? </h3> </div>
<a>stress</a> response system, often in response to early adverse experience. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety can be seen as
<a>“aversive yet adaptive responses to adversity.”</a>
<h2> How Effective Are SSRIs? </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the clinical efficacy of SSRIs? </h3> </div>
<a>placebo</a>, but the effect sizes were generally modest. Studies consistently show that
<a>antidepressants work best in conjunction with therapies</a> like
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> therapy (CBT).
<div> <h3> How long does it take to start feeling better? </h3> </div>
<a>anxious</a>, and feel less hopeless about the future. If a patient has not shown such improvement after six weeks, it’s likely that their doctor will recommend trying another antidepressant.
<div> <h3> How do you know if an SSRI is working? </h3> </div>
<a>insomnia</a> or mental slowness—may improve first, often within three weeks of beginning treatment. 
<a>Studies show</a> that most patients who eventually see improvements in mood first report gains in 
<a>cognition</a>. As a result, changes in
<a>cognition</a> may be one way to 
<a>better predict whether an antidepressant will work</a> for a patient.
<div> <h3> Why do SSRIs not work for everyone? </h3> </div>
<a>in approximately one-third of all depressed patients.</a> These individuals may continue to suffer from lingering symptoms, such as fatigue, pain,
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions.
<div> <h3> How are SSRIs used to treat depression? </h3> </div>
<h2> Risks and Side Effects </h2>
<div> <h3> Can SSRIs cause personality changes? </h3> </div>
<a>withdrawal symptoms</a>, such as increased depression, anxiety, and
<a>anger</a>, when stopping an SSRI that should be discussed with their overseeing physician.
<div> <h3> Do SSRIs cause sexual dysfunction? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual</a> dysfunction, including the loss of 
<a>orgasm</a>. Even as SSRIs increase serotonin levels, they have a dampening effect on the neurotransmitter 
<a>dopamine</a>, which is associated with the elation of falling in love. Patients should be aware of the potential for
<a>some SSRIs to cause problems with sexual desire and performance</a>. In some cases, these issues can be addressed by changing antidepressants, lowering the dosage, or taking a brief, physician-directed
<div> <h3> Do SSRIs make you gain weight? </h3> </div>
<a>weight gain.</a> Switching medications to avoid or reduce unwanted weight gain may be an option for some patients.
<div> <h3> Is it dangerous to just stop taking an SSRI? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is serotonin syndrome? </h3> </div>

<h1> Will Big Data Save Psychiatry? </h1>
<h2> Computational techniques illuminate such illnesses as depression and schizophrenia, forging new paradigms for classifying and treating the thorniest psychiatric disorders. </h2>

<p>Silva posed this question to his colleagues: Can experts in big data look at brain scans from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls and determine which is which?</p>
<p>The brains of people with schizophrenia are different in countless subtle ways from those of people without the disease. The differences are likely due to multiple genetic variants in the brain, many of which might not be harmful by themselves.</p>
<p>For the competition, Silva collected the brain scans of 144 people, about half of whom had schizophrenia. The data from the scans were given to some 245 competing teams, which produced 2,000 entries (teams were allowed to submit more than one).</p>

<a>conscientious</a> about their jobs and considerate of others were also more likely to binge drink at 16. So were adolescents who entered puberty early. These findings were slightly mysterious and unexpected, which is partly why they are so important.
<p>One of the things that made the study possible was the large set of brain scans made available to Whelan and Garavan. To arrive at meaningful findings, researchers need huge data sets. Until recently, they didn't exist.</p>

<a>genetics</a> and majored in biology, he has also had an interest in computer science. As he continued his studies, he realized he could bridge the two fields.
<p>This has immediate practical implications, because "every disease is associated with a very specific cell type in our bodies," Krishnan says. "If genes 'break' and cause autism, the effect is through brain-related tissues."</p>

<p>Chekroud has employed computational methods to brighten that picture. He used his data analyses to develop a questionnaire for patients that can not only help diagnose them but also predict what is likely the best treatment.</p>
