<a>their children</a> are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ on this blessed and wonderful holiday.
<p>Every Christmas morning, they have a birthday party for Jesus in their home — and sing "Happy Birthday" to Jesus, "the reason for the season," as the couple explains in their book, <a>"All American Christmas."</a></p>
<p><a>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY: CHRISTMAS GLORY INCLUDES THE BEAUTIFUL NATIVITY SCENE</a></p>
<p>Read on for more thoughts as we celebrate this Christmas of 2021 — and about the "amazing, miraculous gift of love" that is given to all on Christmas Day.</p>
<h2>Read this beautiful take on ‘the greatest gift the world has ever received'</h2>
<p><i>Sean Duffy in All American Christmas</i>: <a>COVID</a> or no COVID, there are always things that come along to surprise us during the holidays. Sometimes those things delight us, and sometimes they try us. </p>
<p>So having things we can count on at Christmas makes us feel and believe that no matter what else comes our way, we've got people and things we can rely on.</p>
<i>Rachel Duffy in All American Christmas</i>: God gave us the greatest gift the world has ever received. Each year we mark that amazing, miraculous gift of love by celebrating Jesus's birth and our own salvation through this tiny baby prince of peace.
<p>THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS AND THE JOY OF FAITH</p>
<i>Rachel Duffy:</i> The one thread that runs through all of our lives, and not just at Christmas, is family. Jesus chose to be born into a family, and Sean and I are so blessed to have a large family and be part of an even bigger family — God's family.

<p>At Christmas, we welcome Jesus into our lives and our homes. We welcome family and friends. </p>
<p>We could say that they are guests, but they are far more than that.</p>
<p>They are a part of who we are and how we came to be so blessed and so grateful for all we've been given.</p>

<p><i>Sean Duffy:</i> As the saying goes, "The more the merrier."</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, after we pick up all the wrapping paper, and the kids play with their toys, and Rachel and I recover with a little catnap, we gather again to have a little birthday party for Jesus.</p>

<h1>The other gift Jesus gives us at Christmas</h1>

<i>gift</i>—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a
<i>gift</i> the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid." (John 14:26-27 NLT)
<p>I’ve wasted great energy and precious time trying to attain peace by creating better circumstances. Perhaps it’s fair to say we all, to some degree, believe that changing our circumstances or solving our problems will lead to greater peace. </p>
<p><a>WHAT IF THERE WERE NO CHRISTMAS?</a></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, our supernatural Helper, comforts us, fills us with hope and joy, gives us life and</p>
<p>Jesus, the Prince of Peace, promises His peace to us, in the Person of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Though the Holy Spirit is a <i>gift</i> freely given to all who believe, not everyone enjoys the gift. Not everyone opens the package under the tree, so to speak. </p>

<h1>Post-Christmas dilemma: What do I do with gifts I don't want?</h1>
<h2>It's often a holiday conundrum: Do you keep the items you really don't want, regift them, return them, or what?</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>What to do with unwanted gifts this holiday season</a></h4> <p>Lifestyle expert Carey Reilly joined 'Fox Friends Weekend' to discuss what to do with your unwanted gifts after the holidays.</p></div></div>
<a>Christmas</a> gifts you were given (with the best of intentions, of course) by friends and loved ones — and these are gifts you don't want, need, or really care for — well, struggle no more.
<p>There are practical ways to deal with them or unload them without hurting anyone's feelings (and while doing what's best for you).</p>
<p><a>BROTHERS REGIFT SAME HARD CANDY FOR OVER 30 YEARS</a></p>
<p>Carey Reilly, a lifestyle and retail expert, appeared on <a>"Fox Friends Weekend"</a> on Sunday morning, Dec. 26, 2021, to share some key tips. </p>
<p>"Sometimes we get a lot of gifts that we aren't necessarily loving," she said.</p>
<p> An array of beautifully Christmas gifts are shown here. What do you do when you receive something you really don't want, need, or care for (if truth be told)? Lifestyle expert Carey Reilly shared tips for how to deal with the conundrum. (Unsplash)</p>
<p>But we should understand that there are better ways to solve the problem than assuming there's nothing we can do about it.</p>
<h2>One: Know that help is available</h2>
<p>This tip for getting help applies especially to tech gifts that you or your family members might have received but find annoyingly problematic to set up or understand.</p>
<p>"A lot of times you might get a tech item — whether it's a tablet or a laptop — and you think, ‘I don't know how to work this thing, so I’m just going to throw it in the closet. Well, don't."</p>
<div> <div><p> What if you or a family member received a really thoughtful tech gift but have trouble setting it up or understanding how to use it? Help exists and is just a phone call away, says lifestyle expert Carey Reilly. </p></div></div>
<p>She noted that a tech hotline exists to help people through sticky problems.</p>
<p>"You can call 855-355-TECH," she said, and the folks there will help with setting up new tech items, including cellphones.</p>
<h2>Two: Consider regifting </h2>
<p>"Regifting used to have a bad stigma, and it doesn't anymore — or secondhand gifting. It's actually very much appreciated," said Reilly on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>"Regifting is great. And there are a lot of secondhand stores online — we are really seeing a resurgence of popularity" in this option, she said.</p>
<p><a>SHOULD YOU REGIFT? 5 QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE PAWNING OFF A HOLIDAY GIFT</a></p>
<p>She mentioned several options, including MPB.com, which offers an online platform for selling unwanted gifts. </p>
<p>Reilly said the group inspects all items and includes a warranty.</p>
<h2>Three: Return the item for store credit if possible</h2>
<p>In terms of returning something, "this is exactly when you want to know the retailer's return policy," said Reilly, noting that stores offer "a lot of leniency" right after Christmas.</p>
<div> <div><p> Can you return an item? On ‘Fox amp; Friends Weekend,’ Carey Reilly noted that a month-long window exists on Amazon to return most items you might have received but don't want. </p></div></div>
<p>"Check with the retailer [about] their return policy window." </p>
<p>With Amazon, for example, "you can go until January 31st and return [most] items," she said.</p>
<a>gratitude</a> for all you have and all you have received, during this Christmas season and throughout the year.

<h1>Before you download one more app, you must check this list first</h1>
<h2>Third-party apps will try to get their hands on any info they can through these permissions</h2>
<div> <div><div><p> File photo: WhatsApp and Facebook messenger icons are seen on an iPhone.(REUTERS/Phil Noble ) </p></div></div></div>
<p>What are the five most used apps on your phone? For me, it’s Messages, Mail, Refin, Instagram and Podcasts. </p>
<p>There are also those forgotten apps I downloaded and only used once or twice. I know you have them too. Before you hit "uninstall," there's a crucial step you need to take. <a><u>Tap or click for the right way to delete apps</u></a>.</p>
<p>While you’re making your phone more secure, take some time to wipe out tracking cookies. You do this on your computer, and it’s a step worth taking on your phone, too. <a><u>Tap or click for the steps to get the job done</u></a>. </p>
<p>Before you visit the Google Play or Apple App Store again, there are a few things to keep in mind to keep nosey and dangerous downloads off your phone.</p>
<h2>1. Watch out for sneaky 'always on' permissions </h2>
<p>How many apps have access to your camera, microphone, location, and contacts? I can tell you without looking that the answer is, "Too many." Few apps truly need those permissions, and even fewer need them enabled all the time. </p>
<p>Here’s an example: Your iPhone will notify you if it’s about to rain. I thought that sounded handy, so I went to enable the feature. Surprise, it also required me to have "always-on" location tracking. No, thanks. </p>
<p>Third-party apps will try to get their hands on any info they can through these permissions, too. (More about your contacts in No. 3 on this list.) </p>
<p>Over time, you can lose track of the specific permissions you set for each app. It’s worth checking. </p>
<h3>Manage app permissions on an Android phone</h3>
<ul><li>Go to Settings > tap Apps.</li><li>Select the app you want to adjust.</li><li>Tap Permissions.</li></ul>
<h3>Adjust app permissions on your iPhone</h3>
<li>Open Settings > Tap Privacy.</li>
<li>Select a category, like Photos, Microphone, or Camera.</li>
<li>For each category, you’ll see a list of apps that have requested permission for it. Slide the toggle to the left next to each app to remove access to that category.</li>
<p>PRIVACY BOOST: <a><u>Google knows what you type, watch, and say unless you take these steps</u></a>.</p>
<h2>2. Don’t be so quick to connect with Facebook </h2>
<p>With most apps and services, you have a few options for setting up an account. The most common are using your social media login or create a new account with your email address or phone number. </p>
<p>While it's faster to connect with Facebook, I suggest you make a new account instead. Enabling third-party app permissions spreads your sensitive information to even more companies and data brokers. </p>
<p>It’s also a security risk. If you use the same login for many accounts, what happens when one gets hacked? Be sure each account you set up has its unique password, too. </p>
<p>Speaking of social media, hackers, creeps, and trolls can easily use the content you’ve posted against you. <a><u>Tap or click for the security and privacy mistakes you are making</u></a>.</p>
<div> <div><p> Close up on a key and padlock lying on a red binary code surface. The padlock is unlocked and displays a glowing grid. (FILE)</p></div></div>
<h2>3. Protect your contact list</h2>
<p>When you let an app access your contacts, you’re giving away other people’s private information. </p>
<p>Say your friend isn’t interested in a social media app you want to try out. If you connect your contacts to the app, you’re giving away their phone number, email, and maybe even home address, all without their consent. </p>
<p>Here's a little-known fun fact. You often give an app permission to change or add contacts to your address book when you enable this feature. </p>
<p>Related: <a><u>How to clean up your iPhone contacts list in 4 easy steps</u></a></p>
<h2>4. Stop downloading duplicates</h2>
<p>Bad downloads sneak into the app stores way too often. <a><u>Tap or click for 10 apps you need to remove from your phone now</u></a>. Malicious code is often hidden in apps that appear innocuous, like PDF editors and photo editing software. </p>
<p>Then there are things like flashlight apps or QR code scanners. None of these should make their way onto your home screen. Why? Your phone has these features built-in. </p>
<p>Downloading apps you don’t need leads to a bloated phone. <a><u>Tap or click here for a list of bloatware apps you didn’t even know were slowing down your phone</u></a>.</p>
<div> <div><p> The buttons of the photo app Instagram, surrounded by WhatsApp, Facebook, Messages and other apps on the screen of an iPhone. </p></div></div>
<h2>5. Look for specific phrases in the reviews</h2>
<p>By this point, we know online reviews aren't the most reliable. Amazon is notorious for this exact problem; it's hard to tell if those five-star reviews are from real people who have tried the product. </p>
<p>That being said, the review section for an app can be a good indicator of serious issues. We often write about scam apps at <a><u>Komando.com</u></a>, and if you page through reviews for those downloads, you’ll see a common thread. </p>
<p>Watch for complaints about strange pop-up ads, the phone slowing down, unexpected charges, or other strange behaviors. If any of these indicators are in a review, don’t download the app. </p>

<h1>Tech 101: What to do when your computer freezes</h1>
<h2>It's frustrating to deal with a slow, lagging computer day in and day out</h2>
<p>Pop quiz: How often do you need to restart your computer for best performance? </p>
<p>Here’s a hint. If you only do it when your machine crashes or needs to update, that’s not enough. <a><u>Tap or click for my recommendation for keeping your computer happy</u></a>. </p>
<p>It’s frustrating to deal with a slow, lagging computer day in and day out. <a><u>Tap or click for six easy tactics to speed up an old PC.</u> </a></p>
<p>Sometimes the issues are more acute. If your computer is unresponsive, slow down and follow these steps.</p>
<p>OK, this step is obvious, but there is often confusion here. Some people think they have to pull the computer's power plug or flip the switch on the power strip. Instead, hold the computer's power button for 5 to 10 seconds to power it off. </p>
<p>A few things can happen next when your computer comes back on. </p>
<h3>1. Computer starts fine </h3>
<p>Need help? <a><u>Here’s what you need to know about backing up like a pro.</u></a> </p>
<p>If your computer does freeze again, keep reading. </p>
<div> <div><p> File photo of laptop computers. ((AP Photo/Diane Bondareff))</p></div></div>
<h3>2. Computer asks you how to boot </h3>
<p>While restarting, the computer might indicate an error with Windows and ask if you want to start normally or in Safe Mode. Choose to start Windows normally. Then back up your data and see if it freezes again. </p>
<p>If this is the second time your computer has frozen, choose to boot in "Safe Mode with Networking." Try using the computer like this and see if it freezes again. </p>
<p>If it doesn’t freeze in Safe Mode, it’s likely a software problem. </p>

<h3>3. Computer freezes again immediately </h3>
<p>If the computer freezes again immediately after booting, whether in normal mode or Safe Mode, you could have a serious software or hardware problem. It’s most likely a hardware problem, though. </p>
<p>4. Your computer is checking the disk </p>
<p>There could be corrupt data on your hard drive, and the computer is trying to repair that data. If so, it will start with a check disk. You mustn't interrupt this process, or you risk further data loss. </p>

<p>Basic troubleshooting steps </p>
<a><u>Tap or click for free tools to check if your machine is infected with a virus</u></a>.
<p>In cases where your computer freezes during startup in normal mode but boots OK in Safe Mode, the problem could be a program that’s loading during the boot sequence. <a><u>Tap or click here to make your startup process cleaner</u></a>. </p>
<p>If your computer is freezing during startup no matter what, and it’s at the same point, the problem could be corruption in Windows or a hardware problem. <a><u>Tap or click for steps to restore a clean version of Windows on your PC</u></a>. </p>

<h3>What if it’s the hardware </h3>
<p>On the hardware side, start with your peripherals. Unplug everything but your monitor and keyboard and see if the computer starts up. One by one, you can add your accessories back in to see if any triggers an issue. </p>
<p>The problem could also be with your hard drive, an overheating CPU, bad memory, or a failing power supply. It might also be your motherboard, although that’s rare. </p>
<p>Usually, with a hardware problem, freezing will start sporadic but increase in frequency as time goes on. Or it will trigger when the computer is working hard, but not when you're doing more basic things. </p>
<p>There are free sites that can tell if you have a failing hard drive. <a><u>Tap or click for six ways to check for a failing hard drive</u></a>. </p>
<p>You should also check the temperature of your machine. A program like <a><u>SpeedFan</u></a> can tell you if your computer processor is overheating or fluctuating voltages, which might be a problematic power supply. </p>
<p>If these DIY fixes don’t help and your machine is still failing, it might be time to start shopping. If your computer is newer, it might still be under warranty. Contact the manufacturer or seller to check. </p>

<h1>YouTube TV restores Disney, ESPN access following outage</h1>
<h2>Viewers lost all access to Disney content and live ESPN games during the outage</h2>

<h1>Simple ways to stop advertisers from following you online</h1>
<h2>Here are a few ways you can shut them out in just a few clicks</h2>
<div> <div><div><p> Happy young woman sitting on sofa and using digital tablet. Happy young student with eyeglasses watching a movie on tablet. Female student studying on tablet at home. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>We all know that prickling feeling when we see an ad online or on our phone for something we just talked about with a friend. </p>
<p>Big Tech companies say they’re not listening to us and feeding ads for things they hear. I say you can never be too safe. <a><u>Tap or click for a simple trick to block the microphone on your computer or phone</u>. </a></p>
<p>Speaking of simple, this quick test tells you how much information your browser is leaking. <a><u>Tap or click to test yours</u></a>. Don’t like the results? It’s time to pick a new browser. </p>
<p>If you’re sick of handing your private info to advertisers, here are a few ways you can shut them out in just a few clicks. </p>
<h3>How do advertisers decide what to show you? </h3>
<p>Your internet behavior dictates the ads you see. Through a process called retargeting, your data is crunched to give companies a picture of your online behavior. This list includes sites you visit, products you add to your cart, and ads you click. </p>
<p>Algorithms analyze your visits over time. One method to help stop your activity from being tracked by advertisers, and other nefarious entities, is to block or limit third-party cookies in your browser. </p>
<p>RELATED: <a><u>Here’s what happens when someone snoops on your phone using stalkerware</u></a> </p>
<h3>How to block cookies in your browser </h3>
<p>For Microsoft Edge, select the three-dot menu in the upper top right corner, then choose Settings > Site permissions > Cookies and site data. </p>
<p>In Mozilla Firefox, tap on the three-line menu in the top right corner, then click on Settings. Choose Privacy and Security, then click on the Custom option and check Cookies. Select All third-party cookies. </p>
<p>For Safari, choose Preferences > Privacy. From there you can select Block all cookies or choose an option like Prevent cross-site tracking. </p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that incognito mode hides what you browse from Google, your internet service provider, your work, and everything else. It doesn’t. But it does remove most cookies collected when you load a webpage. </p>
<p>To use Incognito Mode in both Chrome and Firefox, tap the menu (three-dot or line, respectively, on the top right corner of the browser), then New Incognito Window. </p>
<p>To browse in private using Edge, click on the three-dot menu and choose New InPrivate window. </p>
<p>In Safari, click File > New Private Window. </p>
<p>Incognito mode isn’t a fix-all, but it does have some practical uses. <a><u>Tap or click here for six of my favorites</u></a>. </p>
<p>Choose a security-first option </p>
<p>Ditching your current search engine can also limit advertisers from tracking you. One option is DuckDuckGo. It allows you to search the internet and protects your privacy. There's no tracking, collecting, and sharing of your personal information. </p>
<p>The problem: The search results you get with DuckDuckGo <a>aren't the best</a>. </p>
<div> <div><p> Your browsers could be telling advertisers what you do online. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p><a><u>Tap or click for a list of search engines that respect your privacy</u></a>. </p>
<h3>Dive into your settings </h3>
<p>Double-check your security and privacy settings in accounts such as Facebook or Google to help stop advertisers from tracking you. Be sure to check settings that include permissions, cookies, and site data. </p>
<p>With these settings, you can control what info websites can use and what content they show you. However, there is no guarantee you will save yourself from being tracked by <i>all </i>advertisers. </p>
<p><a><u>Tap or click to stop Facebook from passing everything you do to the highest bidder</u></a>. </p>
<h3>Remove your info from data broker sites </h3>
<p>You’ve seen these creepy sites. They sell all kinds of information on consumers, like you, to people and businesses willing to pay. </p>
<p>The sheer amount of data collected will make your skin crawl. It includes: </p>
<ul><li>Name</li><li>Address</li><li>Income</li><li>Websites you visit</li><li>Whom you connect with online</li></ul>
<p><a><u>Tap or click for methods to remove your info from three popular sites</u></a>. </p>
<p>Together, these steps prevent retargeting as advertisers can’t tell where your internet activity is coming from, providing you with the anonymity you deserve. </p>

<h1>Unwrapped new gadgets? 10 ways to lock them down</h1>
<h2>Your phone contains a ton of personal information, and you need to do more than setting up Face ID or fingerprint scanning to lock it</h2>
<p>Ah, a shiny new tech toy. In the eyes of a hacker, that’s a great way into your home’s network. </p>
<p>Most people don’t realize how important it is to properly secure your internet connection and router from snoops, hackers, and moochers. <a><u>Tap or click for five smart steps to keep hackers out of your home network and sensitive files</u></a>. </p>
<a><u>Tap or click for important ways to lock down your new (or old) smartphone</u></a>.
<p>When it comes to the rest of your tech, it’s never too late to adjust your settings and get back just a little privacy. Let’s dive in. </p>
<p>When you unwrap a new gadget, you're trying to get it up and running as quickly as possible. You might not usually spend much time poking around the settings. The security and privacy settings should be your first stop. </p>
<p>Chances are, your internet-connected gadgets are keeping track of your every move — and that data gets packed up and sold. Start with your location data. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, disabling location services altogether may impact your device's ability to work the way you want it. </p>
<p>Here’s how to turn off location settings on iPhone: </p>
<ul><li>Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services.</li><li>Here you can switch off location sharing or adjust access to only certain apps.</li></ul>
<p>Adjust location settings on Android: </p>
<ul><li>Swipe down from the top of your screen and tap Location.</li><li>If you don’t see it in your pulldown menu, click the edit button and add it to your quick settings.</li></ul>
<p>(Note: Steps may differ depending on your Android model.) </p>
<p>Your location is just one way advertisers and others track where you are and what interests you. <a><u>Tap or click for hidden maps and trackers in your smartphone you can switch off</u></a>. </p>
<div> <div><p> In this photo illustration a Google Maps logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) </p></div></div>
<p>Depending on how long your new device sat on a shelf or in a warehouse, it might need an update or two. </p>
<p>Again, pop into the settings and look for any software or firmware updates. You'll need to complete multiple updates from time to time, so make sure to knock them all out. </p>
<p>After that, my recommendation is to check each of your devices monthly. It only takes a few minutes, but it could save you a huge hassle down the line. Wherever you can, enable automatic updates, so you have one less thing to remember. </p>
<p>TRUE OR FALSE: It’s OK to restart your computer by holding down the power button. <a><u>Tap or click for my ruling</u></a>. </p>
<h3>3. Take time to register </h3>
<p>Do you register your new tech with the manufacturer? It takes a few minutes, but it's a way to recoup your device if a hacker somehow takes it over. The manufacturer has proof the device is yours no matter what changes a hacker makes to it. </p>
<p>It's also an essential step if something breaks down the road and still under warranty. </p>
<h3>4. Set up a guest network for all your connected devices </h3>
<p>What's the first thing you do after setting up a new device? Usually, you'll connect it to your home's wireless internet. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, every connected device is a potential way in for bad actors. By creating a separate guest network for all your smart home gadgets and IOT devices, you’ll protect your main network. </p>
<p>Here’s how to get started: </p>
<p>Open your router’s admin page and look for a section labeled Guest Network or Guest Networks. </p>
<p>Enable your Guest Network and make sure SSID Broadcast is turned on. </p>
<p>To get to your router admin page, you’ll need the device’s IP address and admin password. <a><u>Tap or click here for a list of default passwords for 548 router brands</u></a> — then be sure to change yours. </p>
<p>Once you’re in your router’s settings, <i>don’t </i>click any options that say something like: "Allow guests to see each other and access my local network." </p>
<p>RELATED: It’s easy to lose track of what’s connected to your Wi-Fi. Worried you forgot something? <a><u>Tap or click here for steps to see all the devices connected to your network.</u></a> </p>
<h3>5. Don’t get lazy with passwords </h3>
<p>Once you get your tech set up, make sure to set a strong, unique password for the associated account. Never stick with the default, even if it appears random. </p>
<a><u>,</u></a> and characters are best, but they are impossible to remember. Use a password manager or even a notebook to write your passwords down.
<p><a><u>I like this password book on Amazon that’s under $10.</u></a> </p>

<h3>6. Enable two-factor authentication </h3>
<p>When you swipe your credit card and enter your ZIP code, that’s an example of two-factor authentication. Basically, you’re providing an extra bit of proof that you are who you say you are. </p>
<p>You'll generally receive a text message or email with a code from the website or service you're trying to access. <a><u>Tap or click here to set up two-factor authentication on your social media accounts.</u></a> </p>
<a><u>Tap or click here for more info and options other than Google</u></a>.
<h3>7. Add your emergency contacts and set them as Favorites </h3>
<p>If you bought a new smartphone or tablet, take a moment to add your emergency contacts. It’s not just a good idea — it can potentially save your life. </p>
<p>When you add emergency contacts to your phone, the best way to make them stand out from your other contacts is to set them as Favorites. You’ll have them on speed dial for whenever you need them most. </p>
<p>On an iPhone, select a contact, scroll down and tap Add to Favorites. </p>
<p>On Android, open the Contacts app, and tap the contact you want to add to your favorites. At the top, tap Favorite. </p>

<p>This is annoying and intrusive, but ACR does have an upside: It makes smart TVs cheaper. </p>
<p>Even better, you can turn the feature off altogether. The steps will be different for every brand. </p>

<p>Smart speakers aren’t the only gadgets listening to you. <a><u>Tap or click to stop the other big offenders</u></a>. </p>
<h3>10. Streaming devices snoop, too </h3>
<ul><li>From the Roku main menu, open Settings.</li><li>Open Privacy. Then click Advertising.</li><li>Check Limit ad tracking.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Open Settings from the main menu. Then, choose General.</li><li>Choose Privacy, then toggle the Limit Ad Tracking option to On.</li></ul>

<h1>Column: Virus finds its way into the NFL playoff picture</h1>
<h2>Then a big chunk of that defense went into COVID-19 protocol and all bets were off</h2>
<p>Then a big chunk of that defense went into COVID-19 protocol and all bets were off.</p>
<p><a><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></a></p>
<p>Making the playoffs and advancing to the Super Bowl used to be an easy equation. Ride a hot quarterback or a stifling defense, play hard-nosed football and take advantage of the breaks that inevitably come your way.</p>
<p>But with COVID raging through the league, it may come down to something even more simple: The teams that find the best ways to deal with the virus will likely end up in Los Angeles in February.</p>
<p>It might mean going without a big chunk of your defense into a must-win game. And it might mean losing your quarterback just when he is needed the most.</p>
<p>Not the best way to crown a Super Bowl champion, that’s for sure. Not the best product to put on prime time TV, either, as evidenced by the Saints-Dolphins game and the Dallas-Washington matchup that preceded it the night before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even the NFL can’t solve this. Short of canceling games — something that hasn’t happened all season and won’t happen now — there’s not a lot the league can do to contain omicron.</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Saints played without a third of their team with 16 active players sidelined. The same day a dubious record was set, with more than 100 players across the league put into COVID protocols.</p>
<p>The NFL is not alone, of course. The virus is wreaking havoc in the NBA and causing games to be postponed in the NHL. The college bowl season is taking a big hit, with games called off and teams switching bowls as others drop out.</p>
<p>But the NFL has a reputation to protect and its credibility to uphold. And playing Monday night in New Orleans did little to enhance either.</p>
<p>With an offensive line crippled by COVID and injuries, the results were predictable. Ian Book was sacked eight times in a 20-3 loss for a team that deserved better.</p>
<p>"Just keeping him upright tonight was a challenge," Saints coach Sean Payton said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be this way, at least not this season. After escaping huge outbreaks last year, the NFL — like everyone — was blindsided by the omicron variant racing through locker rooms.</p>
<p>But the NFL can’t contain omicron and it can’t force players like Wentz and Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers to do the right thing for their teammates and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The product is hurting, and the playoffs are threatening to become way too random. The league is barreling into the postseason with no guarantee that an outbreak might suddenly turn the playoffs into a real free-for-all.</p>
<p>COVID is on the march once again, and it's even more unpredictable than before.</p>

<p>The Holiday Bowl became the fifth postseason college football game to be canceled when UCLA was forced to pull out just hours before Tuesday's kickoff because of COVID-19 issues with the team.</p>
<p>The Bruins were scheduled to face No. 18 North Carolina State at Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres.</p>
<p>A surge in COVID-19 cases across the country has disrupted a second straight bowl season.</p>
<p>The Hawaii, Military, Fenway and Arizona bowls have already been canceled due to virus outbreaks leaving teams without enough available players. The Sun and Gator bowls have had to scramble to find replacement teams for their games.</p>
<p>North Carolina State is the fifth Atlantic Coast Conference team to have its bowl disrupted by the virus.</p>
<p>Miami, Virginia and Boston College all had to withdraw from their games. Wake Forest is set to play in the Gator Bowl, but will face Rutgers instead of Texas AM as originally scheduled.</p>

<p><i>SPOILER WARNING: This article contains spoilers for "Spider-Man: No Way Home."</i></p>
<p><a>Kim Kardashian</a> is taking some heat from <a>Marvel</a> fans.</p>
<p>The <a>41-year-old reality star</a> is among the gobs of moviegoers to have recently seen "<a>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>" since its Dec. 13 release.</p>
<p>The movie was the subject of countless rumors since it went into production and has become known as one of Marvel's more spoiler-filled properties of late.</p>
<p>Kardashian saw the <a>movie</a> in what appeared to be her home theater on Monday night and documented the experience by sharing snapshots from the film on her Instagram Story, per Page Six.</p>

<p>Back in July, Biel opened up to the <a>outlet</a> about parenting during the pandemic.</p>
<p>"It was very much: Be flexible, go with the flow," she said at the time. "But you have to divide and conquer, otherwise I think one person probably gets too burned out. And we just have to be there for each other."</p>

<p>Biel shared that she was grateful for the "huge" support of some pod schools [small learning groups] the family was involved with.</p>
<p>"It was really helpful for my kids to have some small, safe social circle, and I didn’t go crazy," she explained. "I am not a teacher. That is what I learned."</p>
<p>Biel added that she finds hope in "just being with friends, looking at each other and going, ‘We made it through.'"</p>
<p>"Human beings are resilient creatures," she said. "We come back stronger when things are tough."</p>
