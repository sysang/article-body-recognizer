<h3><div>63 days to go</div></h3>
<p>In the wee hours of the morning after the election, as it appeared that he could be in danger of losing, Trump stepped before supporters in the East Room<b> </b>and falsely claimed that the election was rigged.</p>
<p>The next day, Trump tweeted that he “claimed” a win in Pennsylvania, falsely asserting that the state wasn’t allowing vote observers.</p>
<b> </b>used Sharpie pens to mark their ballots. County officials had debunked the rumor, but that didn’t matter.
<p>Holt felt his first pang of worry about where it would all lead when he was monitoring video from Maricopa on Nov. 4. He could see some protesters openly brandishing rifles and handguns.</p>
<p>“You had folks with very extreme views armed,” Holt said. “It wasn’t just an airing of grievances, but some went with intention to intimidate.”</p>
<h3><div>53 days to go</div></h3>
<p>As Trump refused to concede, angry supporters and self-styled militias geared up to fight. Quickly, plans for a “Million MAGA March” in Washington on Nov. 14 galvanized figures known for their hard-edge rhetoric.</p>
<p>Rhodes urged all citizens to be ready to fight while Trump “is commander in chief and has a narrowing window” to act.</p>
<div><div><p>Racine would go on to pass the information to the mayor and other elected D.C. officials, and asked McCord to keep his office updated. The prosecutors flagged it for the FBI’s Washington Field Office.</p><div>13</div></div></div>
<p>On Nov. 14, Mendoza and her team lined up outside the Capitol near dusk and watched as Proud Boys and other protesters paraded across the Capitol grounds. It seemed to her that they were eyeing her officers, sizing them up as they walked past.</p>
<p>As night dragged on, the extremists and groups of counterprotesters began to scuffle — they were soon brawling in the street between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mendoza and her crew repeatedly waded into the melee to separate the warring sides. Punches flew. Officers were pushed through the crowd.</p>
<p>By the time it ended, one person was stabbed, four officers were injured, police took eight firearms off protesters, and more than 20 people had been arrested, many for inciting violence.</p>
<p>The fighting was so intense that Mendoza could barely move when she awoke the next morning. The next night, she texted a colleague who had been there:</p>
<p>He was recovering, too, but wrote he’d toasted the job they’d done keeping it from getting worse — attaching a picture of an empty tumbler beside a bottle of Scotch.</p>
<h3><div>48 days to go</div></h3>
<p>But the president was so enamored with the conspiracy theories that he asked advisers if the government could research them — particularly whether foreign countries such as China hacked the vote.</p>
<p>Yes, Trump could exaggerate, Hodgkins knew, but the growing number of voices agreeing with the president was convincing.</p>
<p>He soaked up false allegations of election fraud on Fox News and the right-wing website Daily Caller. He took notice of Stop the Steal rallies popping up around Tampa.</p>
<p>The new movement helped Hodgkins shake off his post-election funk. He wrote a $10 check to the Trump campaign and attended a campaign meetup.</p>
<p>He was ready to help the cause.</p>
<h3><div>36 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Though it was clear that Trump’s rejection of the election was stirring his supporters to action, senior law enforcement officials at the FBI and Justice Department were feeling boxed in.</p>
<p>The president was increasingly irate that officials would not support his unfounded claims of voter fraud. Trump’s threats to Wray rankled. The FBI chief wasn’t looking for any more confrontations with the president.</p>
<p>“We can stop this whenever we want, but we’d rather not do that. It’s not our place,” said one senior official at the time.</p>
<b> </b>optimistic about that, although he felt that as long as Trump’s lawyers were focused mostly on state-related election issues, the Justice Department could steer clear of the fray.
<p>In the latter half of November, some Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), privately pressed Barr to make some kind of public statement knocking down the baseless claims about massive vote count errors.</p>
<p>Barr put them off, but on Nov. 23, he privately told Trump the claims of major problems with voting machines were nonsense.</p>
<b> </b>official recalled, and shift the burden of proof back to the president’s lawyers. Instead, it marked the beginning of the end of Barr’s tenure. Two weeks after the statement, he announced he would leave the job.
<p>Soon, Ali Alexander, Amy Kremer and Trump’s other backers were promoting a second rally in D.C. for Dec. 12 — two days before members of the electoral college would meet in state capitals across the nation.</p>
<p>A New Hampshire Proud Boys group leader calling himself “biggdaddy” promoted the event on Parler and told members not to miss making history to “support our President.”</p>
<p>Rhodes published a national call for Oath Keepers to travel to D.C., specifically calling on law enforcement officers to join the cause, noting they were allowed to carry concealed weapons.</p>
<p>“We especially need LEO and military veterans with pertinent backgrounds for security (combat arms veterans, for example), or civilian equivalents,” Rhodes wrote.</p>
<p>Discussions Holt could see on the social network service MeWe suggested the number of militants who would be traveling to D.C. this time was far greater than in the previous month.</p>
<p>“They’re meeting up with like 750 Proud Boys over there,” wrote one user on a chat group for self-described Three Percenters in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The longtime Republican official stood before the television cameras at a Dec. 1 news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with anger: “It. Has. All. Gone. Too. Far.”</p>
<h3><div>25 days to go</div></h3>
<p>On Dec. 12, just as they had a month earlier, thousands of pro-Trump supporters and protesters converged on D.C., including what police estimated were — as advertised in advance by extremists <b> </b>— about 700 Proud Boys.</p>
<p>“This isn’t over, this is just beginning,” Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson told the crowd.</p>
<p>Alexander told those assembled that if the electoral college endorsed Biden’s victory, his Stop the Steal organization would turn its attention to pressuring Republicans to object to the certification on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Trump flew over the crowd in a helicopter and cheered on his supporters.</p>
<p>With nightfall came chaos.</p>
<p>Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, paraded a Black Lives Matter banner that someone had ripped from the side of Asbury United Methodist Church, a historic Black church in downtown Washington, and he and others <a>set it on fire</a>.</p>
<p>Within the FBI, many would draw the wrong lesson from that night — that the principal danger posed by Proud Boys or other extremist groups was street clashes. It would prove to be a grave miscalculation.</p>
<p>“Jan. 6 will be the MPD’s problem,” one federal law enforcement official said in December, referring to the D.C. police and echoing an oft-repeated and widely held belief within the FBI at the time.</p>
<p>As it turned out, much of the planning for Jan. 6 was preparation for the wrong kind of violence, in the wrong place.</p>
<h3><div>19 days to go</div></h3>
<p>By mid-December, the <a>electoral college</a> had met and formalized Biden’s victory. Trump had just one more move: disrupting Congress’s count of the votes on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The exhortation, more than almost any other words or action by Trump after the election, seemed to electrify his most devoted followers in chat groups and<a> websites like TheDonald.win</a>. Some took it as an order.</p>
<p>Among the messages the informant flagged from a MeWe chat group for members of the self-styled militia:</p>
<div><div><p>Here, in a short, simple government form, was a warning about a threat identifying a potential place, period of time and a specific target: a senator from Utah.</p><div>20</div></div></div>
<p>Of the combined tips, an FBI official wrote: “None of these sites have specifics on what they’re going to do once they overturn the DC police. These sites are wanting to do this ‘because it will stop the steal.’ ”</p>
<p>By Tuesday morning, Dec. 22 – less than 48 hours after the first call was recorded in the FBI’s system — the threat assessment was closed, marked at the top: “Does not warrant further investigation at this time.”</p>
<p>Romney’s office could not locate a record that it had been alerted about the tip. An FBI official noted that the tip was shared with the Capitol Police.</p>
<b> </b>fundraising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which
<a>sent robocalls</a> urging people to go to D.C. for the day’s events.
<div><div><p>Stop the Steal also secured permitted space for a rally on the east side of the Capitol on Jan. 6. The organization had applied under a different name.</p><div>23</div></div></div>
<p>On extremist chat groups, Brookie, Holt and McCord saw a new tone of desperation take hold. Trump supporters were going further than before — talking about being citizen soldiers who might have to die for their cause.</p>
<p>Holt focused on the explicit talk of violence, writing in his report that Oath Keepers were “ramping up” pressure on their peers to join them in settling the election by force, “preferably with guns.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is going to happen unless we MAKE it happen,” began an exchange he highlighted in the report, which was passed along to the FBI.</p>
<p>“How much more of this s--- do you need to see … There is only one way. It’s not signs. It’s not rallies. It’s f---ing bullets!” read the post from a person identifying as an Oath Keeper.</p>
<p>Holt and Brookie soon spotted a shift from threats to planning.</p>
<p>At the White House, Pence began telling advisers that he knew he was in the crosshairs — Trump would expect him to act.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the White House chief of staff was also spurring on a looming confrontation between Trump and his vice president.</p>
<h3><div>16 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Still, D.C. officials relied on it for intelligence, and Harvin assigned an analyst to each new permitted protest that might turn violent and tasked them with gaming out whether the city would be able to handle it.</p>
<p>The Jan. 6 assignment went to the office’s most junior analyst, who quickly became<b> </b>spooked about what he saw. Almost daily, he brought Harvin disturbing new posts found online.</p>
<div><div><p>Extremists from different parts of the country were now coordinating logistics. They were mobilizing an informal army, exchanging tips about how to smuggle weapons into D.C., where to meet, what to wear, he noted.</p><div>28</div></div></div>
<b> </b>Someone could plant an improvised explosive device near the Capitol,
<b> </b>he said. With law enforcement distracted, extremists might then band together and attack government buildings, maybe even the Capitol.
<p>Even as the meeting went on, Trump returned to Twitter and further egged on his supporters:</p>
<p>[Tune into a special Washington Post Live conversation with Donell Harvin and Clint Hickman on Nov. 2]</p>
<p>For their part, Pentagon leaders were not looking for a role in Jan. 6 security.</p>
<h3><div>7 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The shutdown had been months in the making. The bureau advertised in early 2020 that it wanted to sign a new contract for “social media alerting,” describing the service as “mission-critical.”</p>
<p>Donohue was especially worried by the volume of well-known white-supremacist groups whose members said they planned to come, as well as a sense among them that they had the approval of, if not a direct order from, the president of the United States.</p>
<p>All the while, Trump was keeping the pressure up, seeking a soft spot in the system.</p>
<div><div><p>“We have the full support of Trump and Giuliani,” she added.</p><div>34</div></div></div>
<b> </b>It was from a man who said he was an operator at the White House switchboard, calling to inform Hickman that the president wanted to speak to him.
<div><div><p>Now — after midnight in Washington — the president appeared to want to talk to the Maricopa County chairman.</p><div>35</div></div></div>
<p>Hickman again did not respond: “My mom always warned me nothing good happens after midnight.”</p>
<h3><div>6 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Hodgkins put his blue Trump tights on for a New Year’s Eve party.</p>
<p>“As it got closer to Jan. 6, the people I talked to said it was important,” Hodgkins said. “That it was going to be a historical event, maybe the biggest political turnout ever in Washington.”</p>
<div><p>By New Year’s, Sandlin was in touch with around a dozen other Trump supporters making similar plans, including a 34-year-old Idaho man named Josiah Colt and a 31-year-old Las Vegas resident named Nathaniel DeGrave.</p><div>36</div></div>
<div><div><p>Other ominous messages were posted on Parler, which had recently begun communicating with the FBI after its attorneys had decided some posts were so threatening that they required law enforcement notification.</p><div>37</div></div></div>
<b> </b>informant in the Midwest characterized the talk among members of self-proclaimed militias as heavy on planning to travel to D.C., and said the tone had become significantly more “anti-law enforcement.”
<p>“Broad claims and online chatter often lack specificity or detail about concrete plans and participants and, therefore, are not susceptible to disruption,” said an FBI official.</p>
<h3><div>3 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Miller, the acting defense secretary, couldn’t believe the Justice Department wasn’t more concerned.</p>
<p>In the hours that followed, Rosen and the upper tier of the Justice Department would vow to resign should the president push forward with installing Clark.</p>
<p>Still, Clark encouraged Trump. “Mr. President, we can do this,” he told Trump. “We can get it done. History is calling.”</p>
<p>After a three-hour standoff, Trump dropped the idea as unworkable, leaving only one person left who could help him set aside the election and retain the White House: Pence.</p>
<p>Unaware of the high-stakes moment playing out at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, officials at the Capitol were reaching their own fire-alarm moment.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam, of the Capitol Police, were sweating the final intelligence assessment for Jan. 6.</p>
<p>For weeks, their analysts had catalogued comments on TheDonald.win and other sites in which Trump supporters had discussed confronting members of Congress and police.</p>
<div><div><p>“Anyone going armed needs to be mentally prepared to draw down on” law enforcement officers, read a post highlighted back in a Dec. 21 internal report.</p><div>40</div></div></div>
<p>It had been a day after that when the FBI told Capitol Police it wasn’t investigating similar threats about overrunning police and arresting lawmakers.</p>

<p>It seemed a menacing signal: Angry people knew where the two leaders lived and were willing to break the law to get their message across. The number of officers assigned to each leader was increased, and the details were issued assault weapons.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam made a grim prediction in their final internal report: Jan. 6 would be far more dangerous to the Capitol and its occupants than the pro-Trump rallies in November and December.</p>
<p>Sund agreed not to press for a deployment — unaware of the new threat assessment being prepared by his own intelligence unit that very day.</p>
<h3><div>2 days to go</div></h3>
<div><div><p>David Bowdich, the No. 2 official at the FBI, heard him out but did not sound concerned. Don’t worry, he told the senator, the FBI was on top of it.</p><div>43</div></div></div>
<p>That day, the National Park Service allowed the number of people expected under a permit filed for the rally at the Ellipse to balloon from 5,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Trump kept hyping the event.</p>
<p>In short, Sena wrote in an email to all 80 fusion centers, “a significant number of individuals plan to or are advocating for others to travel to Washington, DC to engage in civil unrest and violence.”</p>
<b> </b>surprised that the chief wasn’t on the call. But even for those on the call, many didn’t hear a major shift in Donohue’s risk forecast or fresh cause for alarm.
<p>It was part of a pattern of miscommunication, poor planning and sloppiness inside the department that left Capitol Police completely ill-equipped for what was to come.</p>
<p>Over at the Pentagon, officials remained worried about the level of preparedness.</p>
<p>Eastman’s allies, including Giuliani and former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, were huddled blocks away in a makeshift war room at the Willard Hotel, conferring about how to<b> </b>put the plan into motion.</p>
<b> </b>believed his legal theory would clear a path for Pence to overturn the election results, Eastman admitted that he thought it probably wouldn’t work. Furious, Cipollone exploded, berating the lawyer.
<b> </b>on his plan to disrupt the electoral college count. Eastman said that it was an “open question” whether Pence had the ability to unilaterally decide which votes to count.
<p>“You heard him say that, right?” Pence said to the president. Trump did not seem to be paying attention.</p>
<p>The vice president said the law seemed to leave him no choice but to preside over the formalization of Biden’s victory. But, Pence assured the president, he was still willing to read any materials on the topic that Trump wanted him to see.</p>
<h3><div>38 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>On Jan. 5, Hodgkins got off work in Tampa around 12:30 a.m. He’d slept only a couple of hours when he got up, collected his bag and a red Trump flag on a pole, and left for the bus terminal in Sarasota.</p>
<p>His spirits were tempered by a text from his mother, accusing him of being blind to reality.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, in Des Moines, Douglas Jensen prepared to go, too.</p>
<p>As Trump’s supporters converged on Washington, his allies anticipated the unrest that would follow. “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,” Bannon told listeners of his podcast on Jan. 5.</p>
<p>Across the city, officials charged with the nation’s security had wildly different expectations about what the next day would bring.</p>
<p>Miller also packed a gym bag with an extra set of clothes to bring to the Pentagon, on the off chance the situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>At Justice, Rosen told much of his staff they could work from home, reflecting a general sense of unease about possible traffic disruptions and disorder, but no serious concern that democracy itself could be at risk.</p>
<p>All day, a crowd kept growing blocks from the White House, where Trump surrogates took turns at a microphone declaring the election results were about to be overturned.</p>
<a>situational information report</a> describing alarming calls for violence circulating on TheDonald.win — it included more talk of the “MAGA Cavalry” and people heading for D.C.

<p>The report noted people had shared maps of tunnels underneath Congress, and planned rendezvous spots in the eastern part of the United States to travel together to Washington.</p>
<div><div><p>To some inside the FBI, that cautionary language was a telling example of how the bureau tempered its reaction to threats of violence from White, middle-aged and middle-class Americans.</p><div>52</div></div></div>
<p>While the memo was shared widely at low levels of various agencies, it was not flagged to the leadership of law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Outside the FBI, the bureau’s handling of the report sent the message that it was not particularly concerned.</p>
<h3><div>18 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Inside the Oval Office on the evening of Jan. 5, the Colonnade door swung open, filling the room with the frigid night air, but also the sound of the president’s supporters, gathered a couple blocks away.</p>
<p>Still, the president did not seem deflated after Pence’s departure.</p>
<p>Scavino, perched in a chair by the crackling fireplace, read it back:</p>
<p>Trump was getting warmed up. He and Scavino workshopped a second tweet:</p>
<p>The crowd outside suddenly roared loudly. “They’re fired up. They’re fired up,” Trump said. The president looked at Scavino: He didn’t want violence the next day, he said.</p>
<p>Soon a third tweet finished his thought:</p>
<p>For nine weeks, the coda to Trump’s presidency had blared like a siren song. His false claims of election fraud had lured followers to act on their worst instincts. A wave of them had come to Washington, and more were on the way.</p>
<p>Trump turned to an aide and asked what he thought the crowd wanted to hear at the next day’s rally. The aide suggested Trump should highlight all of his accomplishments. “I mean, you’ve had an incredible four years,” he said.</p>
<p>“No, no,” Trump interrupted. “These people are upset. They’re angry.”</p>

<div><p>In discussing the surge of workers quitting or retiring during the coronavirus pandemic, one question that I keep hearing, and that I asked last week, is: How are people who abruptly quit or retired from their jobs getting by financially?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most of the <a>departing workers</a> I heard from had also asked themselves that question, but they had decided that they could more easily give up their paychecks than their well-being.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A record number of workers are quitting their jobs, empowered by new leverage</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some retirees said that although the pandemic nudged them into retirement faster than they expected, it also brought relief from the expenses incurred in pursuing their careers.</p></div></div>
<div><p>America’s unemployed are sending a message: They’ll go back to work when they feel safe – and well-compensated</p></div>
<div><div><p>Of course, retirement is still a long way off for many people. Some have been reassessing what they want from their jobs versus what they need.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>One common theme among the people who shared their stories with me: They don’t take their relative fortune for granted.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The cause was multiple organ failure, said his daughter Christy Schlesinger.</p></div></div>
<a>National League of Cities building</a> and National Place. National Place saved the National Theatre from demolition.
<div><div><p>In a 1998 <a>profile</a> of Mr. Schlesinger, Washington Post architecture critic Benjamin Forgey highlighted the two structures as the “first major signal that the [decaying] Avenue was on its way back.”</p></div></div>
<p>From 1971 to 2001, Mr. Schlesinger taught at the University of Maryland’s school of architecture. He also taught at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. In 2007, he was a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
<div><div><p>Bernard Franklin Schlesinger was born in the Bronx on Sept. 17, 1925, and he grew up in Troy, N.Y. His father was a factory supervisor, and his mother was a homemaker.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After Navy service in World War II, Mr. Schlesinger graduated in 1950 from the University of Illinois and received a master’s degree in 1954 from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his personal life, Mr. Schlesinger was an avid sailboater and a lover of fine foods. Until the 1980s, when he quit cold turkey one day, he was a chain smoker.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His first marriage, to Jeanne Kraemer, ended in divorce. In 1972, he married Draga Christy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among his most-admired works and among the least visible was the expansion of Whitefriars Hall at the Carmelite friary in Washington, largely hidden behind another building.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> in 1991. “This rectangular court is surrounded by enclosed, glazed ambulatories leading to and from the major building elements. . . . Nature and the contemplative life are conjoined in the central void.”

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Bart Barnes</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 30, 2021 at 5:22 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div>Correction</div><p> An earlier version of this obituary incorrectly reported the year Mr. Smith retired as executive director of the Council for American Private Education. He retired in 1989. This obituary has been corrected. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Robert L. Smith, a progeny of nine generations of Quakers, author of “A Quaker Book of Wisdom,” and headmaster of the elite Sidwell Friends School for 13 years, died May 24 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 96.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The cause was complications from a stroke, said a son, Geoffrey Smith.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As headmaster, Mr. Smith presided over an effort to increase the number of Black students at the school, which graduated its first African American in 1967. He eliminated the remnants of an unofficial quota on Jewish students.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Robert Lawrence Smith was born in Moorestown, N.J., on June 10, 1924. His father was a salesman.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He attended Harvard College for two years, then broke with Quaker traditions and served in the Army during World War II, including combat operations during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in the winter of 1944-1945.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eliza Hamm, whom he married in 1948, died in 2009. Survivors include three children, Susan Bastian of Bethesda, Katie Smith Sloan of Washington and Geoffrey Smith of Hingham, Mass.; and eight grandchildren.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At Sidwell, Mr. Smith developed a nonconfrontational style of leadership. When someone espoused what he thought to be a bad idea, he usually replied, “I don’t know that that thought would ever have occurred to me.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>His book, “A Quaker Book of Wisdom: Life Lessons in Simplicity, Service, and Common Sense,” was published in 1998. But he also saw limits to common sense.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When a colleague advocated a “common sense” approach to a difficult problem, he was overheard to say: “I’m not sure I have much faith in common sense. Common sense tells us the Earth is flat.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Bart Barnes</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>June 22, 2021 at 3:38 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>The cause was complications after treatment for cancer, said his wife, Lynn Gutter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mr. Freudberg spent 40 years with COG, an organization of 24 local and municipal governments in the Washington area, before retiring in 2020 as deputy executive director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He previously had been COG’s senior director of environment, homeland security, and health, as well as director of environmental programs.</p></div></div>
<p>“He brought data to the table,” said COG Executive Director Chuck Bean, adding that Mr. Freudberg knew the level of pollutants flowing into the river, what it would take to clean them up, what it would cost, and who should pay.</p>
<div><div><p>Stuart Alan Freudberg was born in Washington on Sept. 26, 1953, and grew up in Newton, Mass. His father was an engineer, and his mother was a librarian.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He graduated in 1974 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and received a master’s degree in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Bart Barnes</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>July 13, 2021 at 3:31 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Montgomery C. Meigs, a four-star Army general who commanded a U.S. European military force of 60,000 from 1998 to 2002 and oversaw NATO peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, died July 6 at his home in Austin. He was 76.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia, said his wife, Mary Ann Meigs.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After graduating in 1967 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., Gen. Meigs led an armored cavalry unit into combat in Vietnam. Decades later, during the Persian Gulf War, he commanded a brigade of the 1st Armored Division.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Much of Gen. Meigs’s work related to internal Army procedures, such as logistics and order, said Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution scholar whose specialties include military and defense matters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was a “behind-the-scenes guy with an interest in technology,” said O’Hanlon, “a senior leader in making the Army stronger and more efficient.”</p></div></div>
<p>Montgomery Cunningham Meigs was born in Annapolis on Jan. 11, 1945, a month after his father, an Army lieutenant colonel and tank commander, was killed in World War II action near Rohrbach-lès-Bitche, France. His stepfather was a Navy officer.</p>
<div><div><p>In addition to his West Point degree, Gen. Meigs received a doctorate in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1982. His awards included the Distinguished Service Medal, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Survivors include his wife of 53 years, Mary Ann Mellenbruch Meigs, and two sons, William Meigs and Matthew Meigs, all of Austin; and three grandchildren.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The cause was a heart ailment, said a son, Scott Harris.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judge Harris began his legal career in the early 1950s with the Washington law firm then known as Hogan Hartson, where he became a partner and specialized in communications and energy law.</p></div></div>
<a>Washington Post profile</a>, he developed a reputation as “congenial, patient and fair” but also was known for his conservative bent and for decisions that tended to support government prosecutors.
<div><div><p>He said that in court decisions, “The law does not require that a defendant receive a perfect trial, only a fair one.”</p></div></div>
<p>He dissented when the D.C. appellate court upheld the constitutionality of a rent control law, calling it “confiscatory for landlords,” and he supported giving judges increased authority to impose stiff sentences on juvenile offenders.</p>
<div><div><p>In 1983, Judge Harris was appointed to a seat on the U.S. District Court in Washington, where he served until retirement in 2001.</p></div></div>
<p>Stanley Sutherland Harris was born in Washington on Oct. 19, 1927. His father, Stanley R. Harris, known as “Bucky,” was a Hall of Fame second baseman and player-manager on the 1924 Washington Senators team that won the World Series.</p>
<div><div><p>Survivors include his wife of 57 years, Rebecca Ashley Harris of Bethesda; three sons, Scott Harris and Mark Harris, both of Chevy Chase, Md., and Todd Harris of Las Vegas; a sister; a brother; and eight grandchildren.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While serving on the bench, Judge Harris helped run an ice hockey league for teenagers and often took his law clerks as spectators to his sons’ championship ice hockey games.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The cause was congestive heart failure, said Daniel Toomey, a lawyer and assistant to the family.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a stinging dissent, Appellate Judge Frank Q. Nebeker accused his judicial colleagues of “tinkering with the already fragile family structure. ... It is an intruder into any family circle as much as any burglar or disease.”</p></div>
<a>Rep. John L. McMillan</a> (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of the House District of Columbia Committee, from accusations in a lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy.
<a>held in 1973</a> that McMillan, members of Congress and congressional employees were constitutionally protected against such lawsuits, as the future judge had argued.
<div><div><p>John Alfred Terry was born in Utica, N.Y., on May 6, 1933, and grew up in St. Louis. His father was a salesman, and his mother was a teacher and journalist.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a child, he was seriously injured in a fall, which led to a year in bed to recover. For the rest of his life, he walked with a limp that grew more pronounced as he aged. Friends said he never complained.</p></div></div>
<div><p>He passed his time during his convalescence by listening to music on the radio, acquiring a love for music and song, especially opera, that would last a lifetime. He sang for years in the choral group Washington Men’s Camerata.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While working days for the committee, the future judge attended night classes at Georgetown University Law School, where he graduated in 1960. In 1962 he began working at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Invariably it went back to the sender, marked liberally in red with suggestions, questions and ideas for change. In his office he was said to have kept a box of used red-pencil caps as one way of keeping score.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Judge Terry never married and had no immediate survivors. He was a member of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Washington and was a former chair of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington’s task force on disciplinary canons.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Gladys M. Stern, who led Georgetown Day School for 21 years and built its cachet among private schools in the nation’s capital, died Nov. 14 at a medical care center in Pikesville, Md. She was 104.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The cause was complications following treatment for a kidney infection, said a son, Michael Stern.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I’ve always had a soft spot for eccentric kids, probably because I had one myself,” she told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What limits she set were firm. A student who brought a gun to school was expelled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Len Downie, a former executive editor of The Post, was also a former board president of Georgetown Day. He said he saw Mrs. Stern as a decisive leader who ruled “with an iron hand.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She graduated in 1938 from what is now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was then a women’s branch of UNC: White gloves were required at dinner, and there were weeknight curfews.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 1947, she married Joshua Stern, a physicist. He died in 2001. In addition to their son, of Reisterstown, Md., survivors include three grandchildren.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During Mrs. Stern’s leadership at Georgetown Day, she had a reputation for wanting to be involved in every major decision affecting the school.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One was especially delicate: her own retirement.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>How to downgrade from Windows 11 to Windows 10 within 10 days</div></h4></div></div>
<li>Open the Start menu and click “Settings”</li>

<li>Click “Go Back” and fill out the short form asking why you’re downgrading</li>

<div><div><p>The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Deborah Wince-Smith.</p></div></div>
<a>Clayton Yeutter</a> when Mr. Smith retired from government service as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to start his own international trade consulting business in 1988.
<div><div><p>He used nautical metaphors to illustrate issues he faced as a trade negotiator. A difficult problem was “sailing into the wind.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>He graduated from Harvard in 1958 but his initial application for the Foreign Service was rejected. As a boy he had his spleen removed for medical reasons that, ironically, made him medically unqualified, the State Department said.</p></div>
<p>His mother was outraged. She protested in a letter to Secretary of State Christian A. Herter. Her son, she said, “played football at Harvard, was on the Harvard swimming and lacrosse teams. ... What’s the matter with you people?”</p>
<div><div><p>He was among the leaders in the 1979 Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations that cut tariffs and slowed the growth of other trade barriers on a range of goods in 102 countries.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After leaving government service in 1988, he formed Rockmere Associates, a consultancy he ran until he was in his late 70s.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The cause was complications from a brain aneurysm, said his wife, former Washington Post reporter Margaret Webb Pressler.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Former D.C. police sergeant Joe Gentile, who retired in 2007 as a police spokesman, called Mr. Pressler “Clark Kent” for the “Superman” quality of his legal representation of police officers.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Both policies have been at least partially blocked from going into effect by lower courts after challenges from Republican-led states, and from business and religious coalitions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is highly unusual for the justices to schedule such hearings on emergency requests. Both will be considered Jan. 7, the Friday before the court was to resume its normal schedule of oral arguments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the cases involves a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that requires <a>employers with 100 or more workers</a> to have staff vaccinated or tested on a regular basis. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other is from the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, and it requires vaccination for workers at facilities that receive federal funds tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House said Wednesday evening that it is “confident in the legal authority for both policies and [the Department of Justice] will vigorously defend both at the Supreme Court.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden’s vaccine requirements take center stage at Supreme Court</p></div>
<div><div><p>More than half the states and coalitions of business and religious groups are asking the justices for emergency action to block the OSHA rules, which would cover an estimated 80 million workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And the Biden administration asked the court to intervene to lift lower-court decisions that have blocked a vaccine mandate for what is estimated to be <a>about 17 million health-care workers</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The court had called for additional briefing in those cases by Dec. 30. Under its normal procedures, the justices would then make a decision about whether to block or allow the policies while litigation continued.</p></div></div>
<a>shadow docket</a>.” This makes the third time this term the court has instead scheduled public arguments. The previous cases involved a controversial
<a>Texas law that restricts abortion</a>, and the other concerned the rights of inmates to have spiritual advisers close by at
<div><p>D.C. to require coronavirus vaccination to enter restaurants, gyms and other businesses</p></div>
<a>omicron variant</a> contributing to a sharp rise in infections and causing state and local governments to scramble.
<div><div><p>A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which last week said the OSHA requirement could go into effect, said the federal government was dealing with an emergency.</p></div></div>
<a>killed over 800,000</a> people in the United States, brought our healthcare system to its knees, forced businesses to shut down for months on end, and cost hundreds of thousands of workers their jobs.”
<div><p>Tracking U.S. covid-19 cases, deaths and other metrics by state</p></div>
<a>moratorium on evictions</a> imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying it was beyond the agency’s authority.
<div><div><p>The 6th Circuit’s decision on the OSHA regulations was immediately brought to the high court. More than a dozen challenges have been recorded this week.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Biden’s workplace vaccine mandate seems controversial now — but Americans will come around in the end</h1></div>
<h2>The mandate requiring private-sector employers with more than 100 employees to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated has provoked extreme reactions. It reminds me of an earlier workplace controversy, which was resolved in the end.</h2>

<p>Speaking as someone who hasn’t hugged her mom in nearly two years — and knowing how small a sacrifice that is compared to those who never got to hug their loved ones goodbye — I’d say that’s an understatement.</p>
<div><p>The pandemic marks another grim milestone: 1 in 500 Americans have died of covid-19</p></div>
<a>politely protect ourselves from our own colleagues and bosses</a>. We’re tired of making the impossible calculations between feeding our families and protecting them. Tired of being
<a>expected to cover, <i>yet again</i>, for parents </a>who are tired of overseeing their kids’ online schooling during
<i>yet another </i>class quarantine.
<a>workers seeking recourse </a>against bosses who can’t be bothered with
<a>coronavirus</a>-prevention measures. I’m tired of trying to find the words to convince bosses that
<a>letting workers feel safe at home </a>is better for the bottom line than seeing their dutiful faces crammed around a conference table.
<div><div><p>Even though I’m usually a fan of compromise and diplomacy, my better angels are on a long smoke break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So it’s in that context that I was pleasantly surprised by the “masks on, gloves off” tone of the Biden administration’s plan for <a>combating covid-19 in U.S. workplaces</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under the<b> </b>executive order, federal employers and contractors, as well as health-care providers that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, will be required to ensure that all their employees are fully vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden, CEOs, biz leaders meet on covid vaccine mandates</p></div>
<div><div><p>Up until now, masks, physical distancing, barriers, sanitation, contact tracing<b> </b> and other protective measures have been largely left to the discretion of state and local governments and individual employers.</p></div></div>
<p>Although OSHA did implement an <a>emergency temporary standard </a>in June establishing <a>rules for health-care employers</a>, its protections for workers in other industries have been limited mainly to<b> </b><a>firmly worded recommendations</a>.</p>
<div><div><p>Biden’s workplace vaccination mandate authorizes OSHA to upgrade those recommendations to requirements, although it’s not yet clear how OSHA will enforce them or whether they will withstand legal challenges.</p></div></div>
<a>go far enough </a>to effectively combat the coronavirus?
<a>seem to support </a>the mandate, perhaps because it takes a necessary but contentious decision out of business owners’ hands.
<a>A Washington Post-ABC poll</a> found a majority of Americans support businesses requiring employees to get vaccines.
<a>blocked the rule from taking effect, </a>and that seemed to be the end of it.
<div><div><p>I dunno. It just kind of gives me hope that even in the most polarized and contentious times, common sense might find a way to prevail, especially with lives still at stake.</p></div></div>

<div><p>MIT expert on work says any boss who thinks employees will return to offices is dreaming</p></div>
<p>Of course, not all jobs can be performed remotely, and allowing workers to set their own hours is not always possible, especially when the job involves hands-on care and service to meet client needs. In that case, employers have other options.</p>
