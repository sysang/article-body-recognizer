<h2> Why People Feel Fear </h2>
<div> <h3> Did humans evolve to feel specific fears? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do children learn fear? </h3> </div>
<a>many fears are learned</a>, perhaps most commonly by seeing a parent react fearfully to an animal or situation, or to frequently warn a child about its dangers.
<div> <h3> Why do people sometimes seek out scary experiences? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What everyday fears can hold us back? </h3> </div>
<a>fear of failure</a>, the fear of success,
<a>the fear of rejection</a>, the fear of missing out, or the fear of commitment. These feelings of insecurity, unworthiness, or indecision can often be addressed in
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Phobias fall into five broad categories:</p>
<li>Fears of animals, such as fear of dogs (cynophobia), spiders (arachnophobia), or bugs (insectophobia or entomophobia). These fears, known as zoophobias, also include the fear of bats (chiroptophobia) and of snakes or lizards (herpetophobia).</li>
<li>Fears of the natural environment, such as a fear of heights (acrophobia) or of storms. These phobias also include fear of fire (pyrophobia) and fear of the dark (nyctophobia).</li>
<li>Fears related to blood (hemophobia), injury, and injection, such as a fear of needles (trypanophobia) or medical procedures including dentistry (dentophobia).</li>
<li>Situational fears, such as a fear of flying (aerophobia), a fear of public speaking (glossophobia), or a fear of riding in elevators, which is itself a type of fear of closed spaces (claustrophobia).</li>
<li>Others, such as a fear of vomiting or choking.</li>

<div> <h3> What is agoraphobia? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do many people have a fear of heights? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do so many people fear public speaking? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can someone overcome the fear of public speaking? </h3> </div>
<a>ease the fear of public speaking</a>, but one of the most important steps people can take is to challenge their beliefs. Cognitive reframing of one’s worries—challenging beliefs about being
<a>anxious</a>, or uninformed and replacing them with more favorable, supportive, and, significantly, realistic statements can help someone gain
<a>confidence</a> and more accurately perceive the level of threat.
<div> <h3> Why do people fear clowns? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do some women fear pregnancy and childbirth? </h3> </div>
<a>fear of pregnancy</a> and/or childbirth, is a longtime phobia but one that has only recently been seriously researched. It affects both women who have experienced
<a>pregnancy</a> and those who have not. Sufferers can experience terror, panic, or intense disgust at the very idea of becoming pregnant, leading to difficulty in forming
<a>romantic relationships</a> and depriving women of the family they sincerely desire to have. (Women who simply do not desire children do not have tokophobia.)

<div> <h3> Is social anxiety a form of depression? </h3> </div>
<a>social anxiety can lead to depression</a>, and vice versa. People who experience social anxiety may endure extreme unhappiness, self-doubt, and even hopelessness, symptoms which overlap with those of
<a>depression</a>. But research on the two conditions reveals a core feeling of worthlessness, or feeling that one is undeserving, whether of
<a>happiness</a> or of other people’s
<a>friendship</a>. Addressing that symptom in therapy could help to address social anxiety before it triggers depression.
<div> <h3> How can someone overcome social anxiety? </h3> </div>
<a>cognitive behavioral therapy</a> may help sufferers begin to

<p>Medication such as beta-blockers, which block adrenaline and lower heart rate and blood pressure, may be prescribed in the short-term, often when a feared situation is necessary or unavoidable, such as before a public speaking commitment.</p>
<div> <h3> What thought changes could help free people from their everyday fears? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can fears be treated with virtual reality? </h3> </div>
<a>virtual reality</a> to simulate exposure to fears has emerged as a useful therapeutic tool. Evidence suggests that Virtual Reality Graded Exposure
<a>Therapy</a> (VRGET) can be especially helpful in addressing concerns like
<a>specific phobias</a>, agoraphobia, and
<a>anxiety disorders</a>. Patient outcomes appear to be no different in virtual and real settings, but VR may enable therapists to
<a>reach more people</a> with accessible and affordable care.

<h2> Why Genes Matter in Psychology </h2>
<div> <h3> What is a gene? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the genome? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is a chromosome? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>A chromosome is a structure within a cell nucleus that is made up of a long DNA molecule and proteins that provide support. Each human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which together store a person’s genetic code. </p> </div>
<div> <h3> What traits are genetically inherited? </h3> </div>
<a>intelligence</a>, risk of mental illness, and many others are to some extent influenced by genetics. While genes do not account for all of the differences between people on these characteristics, research indicates that
<a>they have a substantial impact.</a>
<div> <h3> How much do genes influence mental illness? </h3> </div>
<a>are determined partly by genetics. </a>Estimates of how much variability in risk can be attributed to genetic differences between individuals include: 75 percent or more for
<a>autism</a> spectrum disorders,
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, and schizophrenia; 50 to 60 percent for
<a>PTSD</a>, and major depressive disorder.
<div> <h3> How do genes influence behavior and traits? </h3> </div>
<a>differences in how the brain is wired.</a> These instructions do not completely determine how development plays out, leaving room for other factors (
<a>including chance events during development</a>) in shaping behavior. 
<a>the environment</a>. For example, a genetically influenced trait (such as above-average extraversion) might lead someone to seek out situations (such as frequent social interactions) that reinforce that trait.
<div> <h3> What is meant by “nature vs. nurture”? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are epigenetic changes? </h3> </div>
<a>epigenetics</a>). Epigenetic changes happen normally as part of development, but they can also be influenced by environmental and experiential factors, such as
<a>diet</a> and exposure to toxins. There is evidence suggesting that
<a>traumatic experiences may also lead to epigenetic changes</a> that influence gene expression.
<div> <h3> Is there a gene for depression (or anything else)? </h3> </div>
<a>There is no one gene</a> that activates a particular psychiatric disorder or any other complex psychological trait. In fact, many genes interact to influence the human brain.
<p>In medicine more broadly, there are certain genetic disorders that do primarily involve abnormalities in a single gene. These single-gene disorders include cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, sickle-cell anemia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<div> <h3> Why are the X and Y chromosomes important? </h3> </div>
<a>X and Y chromosomes</a> are also known as the

<h2> The Science of Genetics and Behavior </h2>
<div> <h3> What is behavioral genetics? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do we know genes matter for behavior? </h3> </div>
<a>identify numerous genetic differences across many individuals</a>, then analyze the association between these differences and personality traits or other outcomes.
<div> <h3> What is heritability? </h3> </div>
<a>every trait is (at least) a little bit heritable</a>—though the fact that a trait is heritable does not mean it is fixed.
<a>identical twins</a>, who share the same genetic code, would be exactly the same on that trait—but that doesn’t actually happen.)

<div> <h3> Can genes predict a person’s future behavior? </h3> </div>
<a>Some researchers are hopeful</a> that “polygenic scores”—which provide information about the likelihood of certain outcomes (such as developing a mental disorder)
<a>based on many small genetic variations</a>—will serve as a useful tool for assessing risk in psychological domains. However, the predictive power of such scores is currently limited, and
<a>there are further limitations</a> that lead other researchers to question how effective they will ultimately be for forecasting psychological outcomes.

<div> <div> <h1>What Is Productivity?</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>There's only so much time in a day, a year, or a life. Productivity generally refers to the ability of an individual, team, or organization to work efficiently within that time in order to maximize output.</p>

<a>the environment</a>—can also influence an individual to be more or less productive.
<p>To learn more about internal and external barriers to productivity, and how to overcome them, see <a>Obstacles to Productivity.</a></p>
<h2> Are certain personality traits linked to productivity? </h2>
<a>Conscientiousness</a>, for example, has been linked to higher productivity in both academic and professional settings. Other related personality traits such as
<a>self-control</a> have also been theorized to play a role. A recently proposed trait known as
<a>planfulness</a>—characterized by someone’s tendency to develop specific plans to reach goals—may also help someone improve productivity, preliminary evidence suggests.
<h2> How do emotions influence productivity? </h2>
<a>anxious</a> about an upcoming deadline, for instance, could motivate one person to work diligently to turn it in early; another person may attempt to avoid such negative feelings by putting the project off until the last second.
<a>happiness have also been shown to influence productivity</a>; one study, for instance, found that participating in a
<a>happiness</a>-boosting intervention increased productivity by approximately 12 percent. However, happiness's effects on productivity are complex. Other data indicates that while
<a>workplace happiness has shown marked decreases</a> over the past decade, worker productivity has gone up, suggesting that happiness and productivity do not always go hand in hand.
<p>For more on the relationship between emotions and productivity, see <a>Mental Health and Productivity.</a></p>
<h2> Are some people more prone to procrastinate than others? </h2>
<a>procrastinate</a> for a number of reasons that are subject to individual differences. A person who struggles with
<a>time management</a>, has lower self-control, or is high in
<a>perfectionism</a> may be more likely to procrastinate than others. Some researchers also hypothesize that individuals high in both
<a>extraversion</a> may be more likely to procrastinate than those who are lower in the two traits, since
<a>neurotic extraverts</a> may be prone to experiencing the intense negative emotions that can make
<a>procrastination</a> more likely.
<p>For common barriers to productivity, see <a>Obstacles to Productivity.</a></p>
<h2> Are “workaholics” more productive? </h2>
<a>depression</a> and anxiety, which will likely in turn harm their productivity. '
<p>To learn more about how mental illness negatively affects productivity, see <a>Mental Health and Productivity.</a></p>
<h2> Is it ever okay to be unproductive? </h2>
<a>burnout</a>. Allowing time for rest and idleness does more than recharge the brain and body; it also allows for creative, unstructured thought that can foster breakthroughs. It may even increase productivity in the long run.
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic, for instance, many people found themselves coping with sudden anxiety, stress, and
<a>grief</a>. Giving themselves
<a>the space to be unproductive, at least for a little while</a>, allowed them to reduce their cognitive load and manage complex and painful emotions.

<h2> Why Attention Matters </h2>
<a>Ritalin</a>. And others—particularly those with
<a>ADHD</a> or other mental health concerns—may struggle to pay attention even when it matters most.
<div> <h3> Do some people have shorter attention spans? </h3> </div>
<a>individuals with long and short attention spans both had value</a> in early human societies. The latter, for example, might have been novelty-seekers, more adventurous and quicker to migrate than others.
<div> <h3> Is it possible to multitask? </h3> </div>
<a>lower efficiency on both tasks</a>, greater
<a>stress</a> and distractibility, and even reductions in the brain’s grey matter.
<div> <h3> How does sleep affect attention? </h3> </div>
<a>much more difficult to rebound from distraction</a>, to complete tasks, and to finish jobs without mistakes. And in the case of driving, when focus is absolutely essential, insufficient rest leads to a higher accident rate.
<div> <h3> Why do I sometimes feel time speeding up or slowing down? </h3> </div>
<a>“Matrix effect”</a> has found that, in moments of extreme danger, such as a near accident, our perception of time slows significantly, enabling us to remember moment-by-moment details we cannot produce for more mundane events.
<div> <h3> Can your own mind distract you? </h3> </div>
<a>preoccupied by our inner thoughts and self-talk</a>, though, the costs can sometimes be tragic, such as leaving a child unoccupied in a car.

<a>mindfulness</a>, which cultivates the brain’s ability to direct attention to specific cues.
<div> <h3> Will meditation improve my focus? </h3> </div>
<a>Mindfulness training can help people stay calmer and more focused</a> when their mind wanders. With greater
<a>mindfulness</a>, many individuals find it easier to accept and sit with negative thoughts, develop greater personal awareness, and sustain attention. There is mixed evidence, however, on whether
<a>meditation</a> is any more effective at heightening focus than other mindfulness techniques.
<div> <h3> How can we help children focus? </h3> </div>
<a>they get quickly distracted</a> and the quality of their engagement suffers. When they have only a few toys to choose from, they play with more focus and

<a>fantasies</a>, and interior monologues to plot their futures, amuse themselves, and generate creative solutions for their challenges. Today, living in an environment full of distraction, some experts suggest that we should consider
<a>spending more time lingering in our daydreams</a>. Rather than representing a lapse in attention, occasional mind-wandering could help us remember more effectively, solve problems more creatively, and maintain greater mental health.

<a>refreshed and more effective</a> after they snapped back to attention.
<a>Unfocusing and refocusing</a>, some experts believe, may be a secret to solving personal and professional challenges, as when we walk away from a vexing problem only to have the solution pop into our head quickly when we return to it.
<div> <h3> Are there benefits to distraction? </h3> </div>
<a>pull us away from negative thoughts or unhealthy activities</a>. Video games, for example, can draw our attention away from overeating or
<a>attention</a>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Approximately 5 to 11 percent of children may live with ADHD, likely making it the most common
<a>childhood</a> mental health disorder. But ADHD affects many adults as well, making challenges of learning, working, and establishing healthy relationships. A combination of
<a>therapy</a> and stimulants is often used to help treat ADHD.

<h1> Understanding Chronic Brain Fog </h1>
<h2> Common causes and strategies for reducing chronic brain fog. </h2>
<li>Chronic brain fog can cause difficulty focusing, recalling information, and paying attention.</li>
<li>The methods by which brain fog occurs are still not fully understood, though it is connected with several illnesses.</li>
<li>There are both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions that can, in some cases, reduce symptoms.</li>
<p>There are many causes of chronic brain fog and while currently there are no FDA-approved medications for treating it, some <a>antidepressants</a>, <a>psychotherapy</a>, and at-home remedies may reduce the symptoms. </p>
<h3>Causes of Chronic Brain Fog</h3>
<a>concentration</a>, forgetfulness, or a haziness in thought processes.
<p>Brain fog is not a diagnosable medical condition, but a term often used to describe a variety of symptoms including difficulty with:</p>
<li>Recalling information and words.</li>
<li>Handling periods of multitasking.</li>
<li>Thinking and responding quickly.</li>
<li>Focusing and maintaining clear thought.</li>
<li>Following conversations and paying attention.</li>
<a>pregnancy</a>) may be a sign of a serious medical condition.
<p>Certain diseases can affect your brain, resulting in the symptoms described above. Here are a few common causes of chronic brain fog:</p>
<h3>1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</h3>
<p>This disease affects your central <a>nervous system</a> and can interrupt the way your neurons communicate with the rest of your body. <a>About 50 percent of people with MS have trouble with memory,</a> attention, planning, or language.</p>
<h3>2. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)</h3>
<p>This condition is complicated and characterized by experiencing extreme fatigue that isn’t improved by rest for at least six months. Those with CFS may feel confused, forgetful, and unable to focus for long periods of time.</p>
