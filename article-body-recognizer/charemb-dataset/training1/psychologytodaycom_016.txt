<h1> Exploring the Differences Between Male and Female Friendships </h1>
<h2> Men might be more transactional than women, but what else? </h2>
<li>Female friendships thrive on intimacy and emotional connection. Women want to feel emotionally connected and supported. </li>
<li>The intimate, face-to-face relationships between women have a lot to do with oxytocin, the bonding or "love potion" hormone. </li>
<li>Friendships between males are often more transactional. Men tend to value friendships that are more shared activity-based.</li>
<p>When I was out at dinner with my husband, he told me that our mutual friends of 20 years had decided to end their marriage. I wanted to know details: the why, the when, the where.</p>
<p>But he didn't have these details, and when I pressed for answers, he said his friend brought it up briefly with a group of close guy friends, then moved on to a different subject. Not many questions were asked; not many details were given. </p>
<p>If I was with a group of my girlfriends, and this topic was discussed, we would talk about the juicy details: the why, the when, the how, and the now what. </p>
<p>This specific example paints the perfect picture of the differences between men and women in terms of friendships.</p>

<a>extrovert</a>, and therefore we crave to be around others. Friendships help us create a community with like-minded individuals. A healthy friendship can teach us about joy,
<a>empathy</a>, trust, honesty, integrity, communication, and many other key characteristics that we need to evolve in all aspects of society. Healthy friendships are known to decrease rates of
<a>dementia</a> and obesity and increase longevity.
<h3>The impacts we feel when we don’t feel connected through friendship</h3>
<a>anxiety</a>. Isolation can negatively affect our self-esteem, leaving us feeling inept or not good enough. As a result, we may not feel worthy of being in a friendship, and we may hinder meeting new friends.
<h3>Why are friendships hard to establish and harvest as adults?</h3>
<p>Friendships are difficult to start as an adult for many reasons:</p>
<li>We don’t have a community to help us find friends within our peer group, and therefore it is harder to meet people in general without having a playground or a college campus.</li>
<li>We are busy, and trying to establish a new friendship takes a great deal of time, commitment, and effort.</li>

<h1> Beating the Holiday Blues </h1>
<h2> Questions for a lonely single and a fraught family. </h2>
<li>Sometimes, holiday sadness can, with effort, motivate efforts to improve the future. </li>
<li>It's wise to try to separate the likely ameliorable from the likely immutable. </li>
<li>As usual, it's easiest to move forward by identifying a not-daunting first baby step. </li>

<p>Christmas is over and the New Year looms. Some people are happy or at least relieved, but other people feel blue. Here are two composite examples drawn from my clients and friends. For each, I raise questions that should yield improvement.</p>
<p>Let's start with the behavioral. Do you want to make a small or even an all-out effort to find someone great or at least good enough to spend New Year’s with?</p>
<a>pessimism</a> with realistic hope.
<p>Might any of these be worth trying?</p>
<p>Is it clear what the root problems are? If so, make a judgment call as to which, if any, are improvable and which are better left alone per the old proverb, “Let <a>sleeping</a> dogs lie.”</p>
<p>Do you want to take a small bite at the problem by talking with one family member, the one with whom you may have a bit of an issue but that might readily be improved? Together, discuss what might be a positive next step for the family?</p>
<p>Should you, perhaps with one or more family members, talk with a counselor? Sometimes they can see root causes and possible solutions that you’re too close to see.</p>
<p>At the holidays, we tend to raise the amplitude of our expectations and disappointments. Rather than tamping them down, might the unhappiness motivate you to try to improve things now or as a New Year’s resolution?</p>

<h1> Transforming Friendships From Thematic to Genuine </h1>
<h2> Understand the role of a common theme in developing new friendships. </h2>
<li>Take time each week to hang out with the same (new) people doing the same things until they are no longer new and become our friends.</li>
<li>Making social time a priority will decrease the distressing feelings of social isolation that have become a by-product of the digital age.</li>
<li>Reflect on what you are doing with the time that should be freed up in your life by the efficiency of technology-mediated communication. </li>
<p>This is part eight of an eight-part series published over eight consecutive weeks. </p>
<p>Are you happy that, like Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, you didn’t have to traipse around London to listen to someone else’s albums? Happy with the convenience of Spotify or iTunes? </p>
<h3>The Real Goal: Social Connection </h3>
<p>You may want to think twice: just as the journey toward a goal is often more rewarding than achieving it, social interaction is often more important than the reason for coming together. </p>
<p>Without it, Richards and Jagger never would have become a central part of the underground blues community in London that was an incubator for one of the greatest rock and roll bands in history. In Keith’s words: </p>
<p>The point for Keith, Mick, and the rest of the Londoners gathered in front rooms across the city was never to just listen to the record; it was having a reason to get together. </p>
<h3>Tying the Stake to the Tree </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>There were more benefits than we realized during those analog days.</div> <div>Source: Unsplash/Clem-Onojeghuo</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>friendship</a> can develop. In the case of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, it was listening to records together. Social psychological research has found that
<a>proximity and repetition generate liking</a>, the basis of friendship.
<p>Today, there is a shortage of such stakes. We opt for convenience over the potential for social connection. We dismiss the importance of the stakes—the shared interests explored in person. As a consequence, we end up without the friendships. </p>
<h3>It’s “Need to Do” </h3>
<p>Making social time a priority will decrease the distressing feelings of <a>social isolation</a> that have become an unfortunate by-product of the digital age and bring untold <a>happiness</a> and well-being back into your life. </p>
<h3>Question the Glowing Rectangle in Your Hand </h3>
<p>To get started, take a no-holds-barred look at your relationship with the efficiency afforded you by your laptop, smartphone, or tablet—question how you are spending your time. </p>
<a>the efficiency of technology-mediated communication.</a>
<p>Alternatively, are you using the time you saved by sending pithy, emotionally vacant messages to send more pithy, emotionally vacant messages? </p>
<p>In the third millennium, that is the question. </p>

<h1> Feeling Down This Holiday Season? </h1>
<h2> This simple exercise will help process the feelings of loneliness and grief. </h2>
<li>Many people find themselves dealing with grief and loss at the end of the year.</li>
<li>Mindfulness and self-reflection tools can help them cope.</li>
<li>Some examples include the Grief Point Exercise, writing, drawing, dancing, and movement.</li>

<a>grief</a>. The holidays and the end of the year can trigger feelings of loneliness, especially when we have lost loved ones or are spending these days alone.
<p>We carry so much grief within: ancestral, intergenerational, personal losses, and pain. Grief makes our hearts ache, and we want to ignore, suppress, and just not feel. In this simple exercise, we touch the center of grief in our hearts.</p>
<p>Along the sternum over the heart is one point that is more sensitive than the others. Find that point, gently touch it, and allow yourself to feel and release the pain.</p>
<p>Now come down four finger-widths further from the thymus point (this is six finger-widths from the collar bone or clavicle soft spot).</p>
<p>Use your middle finger to feel for areas of tension on the breastbone. This is the grief point.</p>
<p>Apply gentle pressure to the grief point, close your eyes, and breathe.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to feel the losses that you’ve had, not to fight or resist them.</p>
<p>Enter into the heart, where grief is held. You may feel a softening or lightening of pain or tension.</p>
<p>No judgment, no seeking, no yearning, just paying <a>attention</a> and allowing.</p>
<p>Take your hand away and give yourself a moment, then open your eyes.</p>
<p>If you are up for it, take time to reflect on any emotions or sensations that arise after the grief point exercise.</p>
<h3>Additional Ways to Heal</h3>
<p>There are countless reflection tools, and every person will have their own preferences. Some ideas for reflection include:</p>
<p>Writing: This can be in the form of journaling, quick bullet points, poetry, prose, or any other form that helps you express your feelings in a space where they can be revisited and reflected upon later.</p>
<p>Talking out loud: Record yourself speaking your thoughts and feelings aloud, or engage in a conversation with a loved one, whether in person or virtually.</p>
<p>Drawing: Sketch out an image that is left in your mind. This could be a symbol, a place, or something more abstract.</p>
<p>Dancing or moving: Express feelings by moving more deeply into your body, and dance or move as an expression of your deepest self.</p>

<p>Are Americans becoming lonelier?</p>
<p>On May 1, <a>NPR reported on a survey about loneliness</a> conducted by <a>Cigna, a large health insurance company</a>. Cigna asked over 20,000 American adults if they agreed with statements like:</p>
<ul><li>“People are around me, but not with me.”</li> <li>“No one really knows me well.” </li> </ul>
<p>The survey found that younger Americans were lonelier than older Americans. But while researching for my upcoming book on <a>empathy</a> and social relationships, I found that the story is a bit more complicated.</p>

<a>UCLA Loneliness Scale</a>, one of the best available measures of loneliness. But just because a survey has 20,000 respondents doesn’t mean it’s high quality. Who were the respondents? Did they reflect the general population in terms of age,
<a>gender</a>, and other factors? Without more details about the methods, it’s hard to know how to interpret the survey.
<a>not always the case</a>. It’s possible
<a>to feel lonely</a> even when surrounded by people. And it’s possible to have just a few friends and enjoy deep connections with them along with times of solitude.
<a>they tracked</a> changes over time in a nationally representative sample of more than 385,000 high school students between 1991 to 2012.
<p>To measure loneliness, participants were asked whether they agreed with statements that indicated loneliness, like:</p>
<ul><li>“I often feel left out of things.”</li> <li>“I often wish I had more good friends.” </li> </ul>
<p>Statements like the following measured social isolation:</p>
<ul><li>“There is always someone I can turn to if I need help.”</li> <li>“I usually have a few friends around I can get together with.” </li> </ul>
<a>nationally representative government data</a> showing that the percentage of people in the U.S. who live alone nearly doubled from 7.6 percent in 1967 to 14.3 percent in 2017.

<p>Americans also seem to have <a>fewer confidantes</a>. The average number of people that Americans say they can talk to about important things declined from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004.</p>

<a>Data </a>suggest that chronic loneliness may afflict 15-30% of the general population.
<a>defined</a> as, “a negative and distressing emotional state that arises from a discrepancy between one’s desired and achieved levels of social connectedness," has attracted psychologists’
<a>attention</a> in part because it’s so common and in part because it’s
<a>so consequential</a>. High levels of loneliness predict a diverse host of negative health outcomes both physical and
