<h1> Hallucinations in Humans and Mice </h1>
<h2> Why is developing an animal model of hallucinations important? </h2>
<li>Auditory hallucinations are common in persons with schizophrenia, but they also can occur in people without psychiatric disorder.</li>
<li>Investigators have developed a method of studying hallucination-like experiences in humans. </li>
<li>The same investigators used similar methods to study hallucination-like experiences in mice.</li>
<li>The mouse model of hallucination-like experiences will facilitate studies of the mechanisms underlying psychotic symptoms.</li>
<a>psychotic</a> illness also can experience occasional hallucinations. These investigators reasoned that occasional hallucination-like experiences in those without
<a>psychiatric</a> illnesses likely involve the same brain mechanisms underlying hallucinations associated with schizophrenia.
<h3>Hallucinations in Humans vs. Mice</h3>
<p><a>Ketamine</a> is a drug that can cause hallucinations in humans. When the investigators administered ketamine to mice, there was a substantial increase in hallucination-like percepts.</p>

<li>The rise of Naziism led to an exodus of physicians and scientists from Germany and Eastern Europe to Britain, the U.S., and Canada.</li>
<li>Just as some of these refugees contributed to neuroscience, others made striking advances in psychopharmacology.</li>
<li>Among these remarkable individuals were Frank Berger, Leo Sternbach, and Heinz Lehmann. </li>
<li>Their discoveries led to modern psychopharmacology, though the specific drugs they developed are now less widely used than they once were.</li>

<div> <h2><a>Why Does the DSM Exist?</a></h2> <p>Psychiatric diagnostic systems like the DSM generate continual controversy, but if they are used wisely, they can reduce stigma and enhance our understanding of psychological distress.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Meditation, Medication, and the Middle Way</a></h2> <p>Mindfulness is everywhere, but it is not the solution to everything. We should use it mindfully, combined with other approaches, especially when mentally ill.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Mass Shootings, Guns, and Suicide</a></h2>

<h1> Erotomania and Delusional Love </h1>
<h2> Delusions of being loved from afar cause problems but are manageable. </h2>
<li>Erotomania occurs when a person develops the delusional belief they are loved from afar by another person.</li>
<li>Delusional love is generally intense, with rejections paradoxically interpreted as covert declarations of love.</li>
<li>There is an association between erotomania and high-risk behavior, such as stalking.</li>
<li>Treatment can involve antipsychotic medication, psychological therapy, and social supports.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Erotomania is a form of delusional love</div> <div>Source: Mathias P.R. Reding/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>

<h3>How Common Is Erotomania?</h3>
<p>The incidence of erotomania is not clear but appears to be low.</p>
<p>Erotomania can also occur as part of the clinical picture in Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, meningioma (a type of brain tumor), head <a>trauma</a>, and <a>alcoholism</a>, as well as some drugs.</p>
<a>social isolation</a>, and it has even been suggested that it can compensate for disappointments in life.

<a>medication</a> that is no longer commonly used.
<h3>The Future of Erotomania</h3>
<a>therapy</a> (CBT) for specific delusions.
<p>If erotomania pursues a chronic or relapsing course, it is hoped that the relatively attractive side-effect profile and acceptability of these approaches will enhance treatment programs, reduce risk, and improve outcomes for all affected.</p>

<h1> How to Recognize Delusional Disorder </h1>
<h2> Once called partial insanity, this disorder can be hard to spot. </h2>
<li>Delusional disorder can be hard to detect because the pathology is encapsulated and the person may seem very stable.</li>
<li>If someone's delusion becomes believed by others and affects their behavior, it is known as shared psychotic disorder.</li>
<li>Delusional disorder is of forensic interest, as radicalization of extreme beliefs must be differentiated from actual delusions/mental illness.</li>

<h3>The Relative Normalcy of Delusional Disorder</h3>

<h3>Treatment for Delusional Disorder</h3>
<p>To conclude, the following example, which I believe was documented by <a>Freud</a>, can illustrate the delusional dynamic stemming from an existential conflict:</p>
<a>denial</a> defense about his own
<a>homosexuality</a> and interest in
<a>sexual</a> relations with the doctor.
<p>With such a case, treatment understandably focuses on the conflict contributing to the paranoia.</p>

<h1> Interpreting the Symptoms of Schizophrenia </h1>
<h2> Incorporating psychodynamic and biological perspectives. </h2>
<li>Some modern approaches to schizophrenia view psychotic symptoms as meaningless and without psychological explanation.</li>
<li>For many years, psychodynamic theorists have offered psychological understandings of schizophrenia symptoms.</li>
<li>Psychological approaches to schizophrenia comprise an important part of biopsychosocial formulation.</li>

<a>psychoanalytic</a> investigation (see Stone, 1999, for an excellent overview). Much of this psychoanalytic work continues to this day.
<h3>A psychodynamic investigation of psychotic symptoms</h3>
<p>I will share a few brief examples to illustrate a psychoanalytic interpretation of schizophrenia:</p>
<a>olfactory</a> hallucinations of a foul odor emanating from his body has concretized his
<a>unconscious</a> belief that he is a bad or rotten person; as unpleasant as it is to smell awful, it is much more tolerable than to believe that one is awful.
<p>A man who believes that others are controlling his thoughts experiences a reactivation and concretization of the way he once felt that his parents were controlling or trying to direct his life and way of thinking.</p>
<a>anxiety</a> which accompanies responsibility, the patient becomes "frozen in time," shielded from the potential destructiveness of his own actions.
<h3>The value of a complementary approach</h3>
<a>neuroscience</a> to the study of schizophrenia. Psychoanalysis had been declared "dead." It was within this context that McHugh Slavney (1998) published the second edition of their Perspectives of Psychiatry.
