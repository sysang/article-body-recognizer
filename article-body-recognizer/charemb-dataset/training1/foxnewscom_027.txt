<h1>NFL Broadcaster John Madden Retires</h1>
<p><span>NEW YORK – </span>John Madden is retiring from football announcing, where his enthusiastic, down-to-earth style made him one of sports' most popular broadcasters for three decades.</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame coach spent the last three seasons on NBC's "Sunday Night Football." His final telecast was the Super Bowl in February.</p>
<p>"You know at some point you have to do this — I got to that point," Madden said on his Bay Area radio show Thursday. "The thing that made it hard is not because I'm second guessing, `is it the right decision?' But I enjoyed it so damn much.</p>
<p>"I enjoyed the game and the players and the coaches and the film and the travel and everything."</p>
<p>Cris Collinsworth will replace Madden, moving over from the network's studio show, NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol said. Collinsworth filled in when Madden took a game off last October.</p>
<p>Ebersol called Madden "absolutely the best sports broadcaster who ever lived."</p>
<p>Madden said his health is fine, but at the age of 73, he wanted to spend more time with his family. His 50th wedding anniversary is this fall, and his five grandchildren are old enough to notice when he's gone.</p>
<p>"If you hated part of it or if something was wrong, it'd be easy," Madden said.</p>
<p>Madden's blue-collar style and love for in-the-trenches football endeared him to fans. His "Madden NFL Football" is the top-selling sports video game of all time.</p>
<p>Madden is reluctant to fly and often traveled to games in a specially equipped bus.</p>
<p>Longtime broadcast partner Al Michaels said Madden will have a unique place in pro football history.</p>
<p>Madden began his pro football career as a linebacker coach at Oakland in 1967 and was named head coach two years later, at 33 the youngest coach in what was then the American Football League.</p>
<p>Madden led the Raiders to their first Super Bowl victory and retired in 1979. He joined CBS later that year.</p>
<p>Madden said that for the last several years, he waited until two months after the season to determine whether to continue, not wanting to rush into a decision. He surprised Ebersol when he told him last week he was retiring.</p>
<p>Ebersol flew to California on Wednesday morning and spent 11 hours with Madden, trying to persuade him to change his mind. Ebersol even offered to allow Madden to call games only in September and November and to take October and December off.</p>
<p>"I knew right away there was no way of talking him out of it," Ebersol said. "I knew in his voice he really thought about this."</p>
<p>Madden was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006.</p>
<p>"John's respect and passion for the game always stood out. He was the ultimate football fan who also happened to be an extraordinarily talented coach and broadcaster."</p>

<h1>John Madden dead at 85: Who was the legendary NFL coach?</h1>
<h2>Madden is one of the most recognizable faces in the sport</h2>
<p><a>John Madden</a> was one of the most recognizable NFL faces.</p>
<p>He went from Super Bowl-winning head coach with the Oakland Raiders to the voice of the league from behind the mic to the face of one of the most successful video game franchises.</p>
<p>Madden was larger than life, and his revolutionary career in all aspects of the game made him as recognizable as any player out on the field.</p>
<p>Madden died Thursday at the age of 85.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Eagles selected Madden in the 21st round of the 195draft, and he only made it to training camp. He would suffer a knee injury that would derail his professional playing career.</p>
<h2>Madden coached in college before the Raiders</h2>
<p>Madden was an assistant and the head coach of Allan Hancock — a community college in California — from 1960 to 1063. He was later a defensive coordinator from 1964 to 1966 with San Diego State.</p>

<p>Madden became a linebackers coach for the Raiders in 1967. He helped the team reach Super Bowl II, and after John Rauch went to the Buffalo Bills, Madden was named the head coach of the Raiders before the start of the 1969 season.</p>

<p>Madden called his final game in the booth in 2009 with Al Michaels for Super Bowl XLIII. The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
<p>Madden was most notably averse to flying in a plane. He had lost people close to hm in the tragic Cal Poly football team plane crash. He would travel around the country in a giant coach bus.</p>
<p>Madden was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2006.</p>

<h1>NFL legend John Madden dead at 85</h1>
<h2>The NFL announced Madden's unexpected death on Tuesday</h2>
<p><a>NFL</a> legend John Madden died Tuesday at the age of 85, the league announced in a statement. </p>
<a>Raiders</a> and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather.
<i>was </i>football. He was an incredible sound board to me and so many others. There will never be another John Madden, and we will forever be indebted to him for all he did to make football and the NFL what it is today."
<p><a>RAIDERS CLING TO PLAYOFF HOPES WITH 17-3 WIN OVER DENVER</a></p>
<p>The Hall of Fame coach turned broadcaster whose exuberant calls combined with simple explanations provided a weekly soundtrack to NFL games for three decades. The league said he died unexpectedly and did not detail a cause.</p>
<p>JOHN MADDEN'S LEGENDARY COACHING, BROADCASTING CAREER CELEBRATED IN FOX SPORTS' CHRISTMAS DAY DOCUMENTARY</p>
<div> <div><p> FILE: John Madden, head coach of the Oakland Raiders celebrates after the Raiders beat the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl XI on January 9, 1977 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>"People always ask, are you a coach or a broadcaster or a video game guy?" he said when was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. "I'm a coach, always been a coach."</p>
<p><a>COLUMN: VIRUS FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE</a></p>
<p>When he finally retired from the broadcast booth, leaving NBC's "Sunday Night Football," colleagues universally praised Madden's passion for the sport, his preparation, and his ability to explain an often-complicated game in down-to-earth terms.</p>
<p>Madden was raised in Daly City, California. He played on both the offensive and defensive lines for Cal Poly in 1957-58 and earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the school.</p>
<p>Al Davis brought him to the Raiders as a linebackers coach in 1967, and Oakland went to the Super Bowl in his first year in the pros. He replaced John Rauch as head coach after the 1968 season at age 32, beginning a remarkable 10-year run.</p>
<p>With his demonstrative demeanor on the sideline and disheveled look, Madden was the ideal coach for the collection of castoffs and misfits that made up those Raiders teams.</p>
<p>Still, Madden's Raiders played in some of the sport's most memorable games of the 1970s, games that helped change rules in the NFL. </p>
<p>Madden retired from coaching at age 42 after a 9-7 season in 1978.</p>
<p>Tributes poured in following news of Madden's death. </p>
<p>American sportscaster Jim Gray called Madden a "great coach and the best broadcaster ever." </p>
<p>Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, a former Super Bowl champion who played ten seasons in the NFL for the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders, said the "Raiders family lost a legend today." </p>
<p>"Honored to have known John Madden," Burgess said. "His impact, knowledge, and love for the game will never be forgotten." </p>

<h1>US may not need AstraZeneca's vaccine, Fauci says</h1>
<h2>AstraZeneca’s shot has been under scrutiny since late last year</h2>
<p>The US may not need AstraZeneca’s <a>coronavirus </a><a>vaccine</a> — <a>even if the shot gets approved</a> by federal regulators, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Fauci, the chief medical adviser to the White House, said the nation already has enough contracts with other vaccine makers to inoculate the entire population.</p>
<p>"My general feeling is that given the contractual relationships that we have with a number of companies, that we have enough vaccine to fulfill all of our needs without invoking AstraZeneca," he said.</p>
<p><a>WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ASTRAZENECA VACCINE BLOOD CLOT REPORTS</a></p>
<p>The nation’s top infectious disease expert added that the US possibly also has enough vaccine supply for booster shots in the fall.</p>
<p>"If you look at the numbers (of doses) that we’re going to be getting … it is likely that we can handle any boost that we need, but I can’t say definitely for sure," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Once hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19, AstraZeneca’s shot has been under scrutiny since late last year.</p>
<p>Last month, more than a dozen countries that had approved the London-based pharmaceutical company’s vax temporarily suspended the use of it after reports <a>linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US regulators <a>accused the company of "cherry picking" data</a> to make it seem like the shot was more effective. </p>
<p>Following public criticism, AstraZeneca said the data was based on a "pre-specified interim analysis," and agreed to release an updated report.</p>
<p>The firm then <a>released revised results</a> showing a diminished, though still strong, efficacy for its inoculation.</p>
<p>AstaZeneca also said it intends to seek FDA emergency use authorization for the vaccine within a few weeks.</p>

<h1>CDC significantly reduces estimate of omicron prevalence in US</h1>
<h2>The United States set a record for new COVID-19 cases at 441,278 on Monday</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Dr. Siegel on future of COVID in the US as omicron sweeps the nation</a></h4> <p>Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel on the FDA approval of the Merck pill and whether the end of the pandemic is near.</p></div></div>
<p>For the week ending Dec. 25, the agency says omicron accounted for 58.6% of all new cases.</p>
<p>Jasmine Reed, a spokesperson for the CDC, noted that there was "a wide predictive interval posted in last week’s chart," and the downward revision was partly due to the "speed at which Omicron was increasing."</p>
<p>"CDC’s models have a range, and… we’re still seeing steady increase in the proportion of Omicron," Reed told Fox News Digital. "In some regions in the country, Omicron accounts for ~ 90% or more of cases."</p>
<p>"A lot of people were seeing this S dropout on the tests even before they got the follow-up genetic testing, and so those samples were disproportionately more likely to be sent in for sequencing," Dr. Adams told Fox News Digital. </p>

<p>The new estimates mean that the delta variant was still dominant for most of December, though omicron has a slight edge now. </p>
<p>Regardless, COVID-19 cases have been surging in recent weeks, as the United States set a single-day record for new cases on Monday with <a>441,278</a> confirmed infections. </p>
<p>The 7-day average on Monday was 240,408, which is roughly quadruple the low of 64,206 on Oct. 24. </p>

<h1>'A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE': Michigan firefighters save 82-year-old woman trapped in house fire</h1>
<h2>A passerby heard the victim's calls for help and stopped to call 911</h2>
<p><a>Michigan</a> firefighters saved an 82-year-old woman from a house fire Saturday morning in what the Chippewa County Sheriff's Office is calling "a <a>Christmas</a> miracle."</p>
<p>Sheriff's deputies and firefighters were dispatched to the fire on Ridge St. in Sault Ste. Marie on Christmas morning when the woman woke up to the smell of smoke and yelled for help.</p>

<h1>MSNBC columnist calls for end of NORAD Santa tracker 'out of concern for Santa's safety' from US military</h1>
<p>An MSNBC columnist is calling for the end of the NORAD Santa tracker, claiming that it is time to "decouple" Santa Claus from American military culture.</p>
<p><a><u>CHRISTMAS 2021: READ BIDEN, TRUMP AND OBAMA'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGES TO AMERICANS</u></a></p>
<a>military jets flying over NFL games</a> give us an injection of jingoist testosterone before more regionally focused battles of testosterone are played on the field; and we get the
<a>Netflix movie "Operation Christmas Drop,"</a> a seasonally themed rom-com that cheerfully seeks to boost approval for America’s military base in Guam."
<p>Brown explained that he does not consider himself a "scrooge" and does acknowledge the joy the practice brings children but ultimately believes: "The messier business of war that goes on in the background doesn’t jibe with the Christmas spirit."</p>
<p><a><u>'A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE': MICHIGAN FIREFIGHTERS SAVE 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN TRAPPED IN HOUSE FIRE</u></a></p>
<p>Brown pointed to drone strikes that have caused civilian casualties across the world and have helped "military officials avoid the political headaches that come from massive ground deployments."</p>
<p>Brown outlined examples of the U.S. military, in his belief, not being held accountable for military strikes that left civilians dead and then wondered aloud if the military would be held accountable if it killed Santa Claus in a drone strike.</p>
<p>The article concludes with Brown not being able to answer that question, which he says is part of the justification for stopping the NORAD practice of tracking Santa.</p>
<p>Several Twitter users responded to Brown’s Twitter post containing the article objecting to his conclusion.</p>
<p>One user <a><u>explained</u></a> that the military is "far from perfect" and the Santa tracker is a "tradition my kids love."</p>
<p>"Honestly, fair — it’d be weird if everyone agreed with me 100% of the time and I’m glad your kids enjoy it," Hayes responded.</p>
<div> <div><p> The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said that it had to scramble two pair of U.S. F-22 fighter jets to intercept the Russian formation on Tuesday. (Twitter)</p></div></div>
<a><u>accused</u></a> Brown of "hubris" and said "people are on duty at command centers all over the world, right now, Christmas Eve night" and "this serves as an international *training exercise* of tracking comms systems in an enjoyable way."
<p>"That’s the best argument I’ve seen supporting the program so far," Brown wrote back. "Mostly I’ve gotten ‘it’s for the children.’ So it’s both practical AND an annual PR bonanza."</p>

<h1>Gowdy: Hold on to the hope of Christmas</h1>
<h2>'Hope is all around us, if we look in the right places,' Gowdy said</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Gowdy: Hold onto the hope of Christmas</a></h4> <p>'Sunday Night in America' host Trey Gowdy urges viewers to cling to the season's sense of optimism and possibility as we head into the new year.</p></div></div>
<p>Fox News host Trey Gowdy devoted his monologue on Sunday to the feelings of "hope" that accompany <a>Christmas</a>, urging viewers to cling to the season's sense of optimism and possibility as we head into the new year.</p>
<p>"Hope is powerful when we see it. Hope is powerful when we receive it. Hope is most powerful when we give it. It's all around us, if we look in the right places," he told viewers.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of a global pandemic, political turmoil and economic uncertainty, the country's collective devotion to the holiday and to one another are "enough to make even a cynic hopeful," Gowdy said.</p>
<p><a>WE ALL NEED A LITTLE CHRISTMAS: OPINION</a></p>
<p>"Somewhere in America over the holidays, a community is taking care of those who are cold, hungry, and lonely. It likely won't make the news, we might not ever hear about it, but we know it's happening and it should give us hope," he said.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in America police officers are buying presents for children whose parents are in prison. It won't make the news, we might not ever hear about it, but we know it's happening and it should give us hope," he continued.</p>
<p>"Somewhere in America a widow is putting more money into a Salvation Army kettle than she can afford because she knows it is better to give than to receive and that should give us hope."</p>

<p>The media and their collective fixation on doom-and-gloom stories rarely focus on the good of mankind, Gowdy argued.</p>
<p>"I don't know why our culture and media are focused on the negative. I'm not smart enough to figure out whether it's a supply issue or a demand issue. What I do know is most people are good. Anonymously good," he explained.</p>
<p>"As we close one year and stand on the doorstep of a new one, there are stories of hope, and love, and faith all around us that's enough to make even a cynic hopeful.</p>
<p>"It's the kindness of the American people that gives me hope. And it's there - even when we don't hear or read about it. It is there. These three things remain - when all else fades. Faith, hope and love."</p>
