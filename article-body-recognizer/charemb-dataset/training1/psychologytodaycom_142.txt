<p>While this seems harsh at first, it is for the greater good. It also does not have to be forever; sometimes, just by limiting contact for a period of time, you give yourself the time and space to regain clarity and <a>confidence</a>.</p>
<p>4. Love yourself and believe in your worthiness.</p>
<a>forgive</a> yourself for your inability to forgive. You are a survivor for being here today. You deserve to live without emotional baggage.
<p>If what you do grows into a deep sense of love for your parents, then the journey would have been worth it. If not, you know that you tried, and you will have no regrets. </p>

<h1> 5 Ways to Survive an Argument When Your Loved One Has BPD </h1>
<h2> The roller-coaster ride with a loved one's Borderline Personality Disorder. </h2>
<a>romantic relationship</a>, their intensity,
<a>creativity</a>, and deep capacity to love may be what attracted you to them in the first place. But because they are sensitive to threats or cues of abandonment, they can become emotionally erratic and volatile in a relationship.
<a>fear</a> of abandonment, impulsive and self-destructive behaviours, self-harming, and extreme mood swings, you may be left in a position in which you feel dragged into storm after storm, only to be left powerless and frustrated.
<a>object permanence and the fear of abandonment</a>. They are also highly perceptive; if you simply nod your head saying yes to whatever they say without listening, they will sense that you are not paying
<p>They are sensitive to being dismissed or not heard because that was all they had as a child. You don’t always need to have the answer, but if your intention is genuine, they can sense it, and it will help them calm down.</p>
<p>Validate their feelings, not their behaviours</p>
<a>lying</a> or bending your values. You are simply telling them that you hear what they feel, and that their feelings are valid.
<p>People with BPD are survivors of deep <a>trauma</a>. When arguing with someone with BPD, remember that you are not dealing with an adult, but a hurting child.</p>
<a>regress</a> into the state of a traumatised child. If you look at their
<a>body language</a>, the intonations, etc, you will realise this. If you think of it that way, things they say or do will make sense. They may kick and scream and say 'I hate you,' like a 5-year-old who doesn’t know what else to say or do.
<p>See if you can bypass the 'content' of what they say, and look at the unmet needs they are expressing. These needs might be legitimate, or they might be brought over from the past.</p>
<p>Set kind but firm boundaries</p>
<p>For instance, you may say 'I can understand you feel ____. I will do ____ for you, but I will not tolerate ____.'</p>
<p>Be clear with the consequences in a non-punitive way: 'I don’t want to, but if you continue to ____, I will have to _____.' You will have to execute what you say. You may have to repeat yourself like a broken record.</p>
<a>empathic</a>, sensitive, and compassionate, and have a lot to offer the world. The road to recovery may be long and hard, but it will be worth it.
<p>You are not forced to stay, but if you decide to walk this journey together, your love and commitment can be a powerful healing tool for them.</p>

<h2> Challenges that come from relationships, or the lack of them. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>From the get-go, intense and sensitive people feel the world on a different vibration. They may be told they are ‘too intense,’ ‘too extreme,' ‘too much,' or ‘too sensitive’ all their lives. </p>
<p>Intense people are fierce and passionate lovers. However, they face specific challenges due to their heightened sensitivity, speed of operation, and high level of <a>intuition</a>. </p>
<p>If you are emotionally intense and sensitive, here are some obstacles you may face in intimate relationships or the lack of them.</p>
<p>Since you are highly imaginative and energetic, you bring ideas and inspirations into the relationship but your partner may not have the capacity to reciprocate. </p>
<a>boredom</a> overrides any sense of affection, it is a warning sign that something needs to change. Because it is in your nature to learn and grow continuously, you find yourself outgrowing people rapidly.
<p>You don't enjoy couple's activities as much as other things.</p>
<p>You are highly reflective, and whether you are an <a>introvert</a> or an <a>extrovert</a>, you need time to yourself to gather energy and <a>creativity</a>. Your partner may not understand your desire for alone time, and they may feel left out. </p>
<p>Your partner does not understand your sensitivities and needs.</p>
<a>migraines</a>, pain, and fatigue.

<p>It is important that you understand your nature, and do not judge yourself for your idiosyncrasy. Your needs are legitimate, though it may take clear and <a>assertive</a> communication to make things work in a partnership.</p>
<p>You pick up on every emotion and nuance.</p>
<a>empathic</a> tendency, you ‘absorb’ whatever they feel, or even feel feelings for them. Being the more emotionally aware one, you may always have to be the one who initiates meaningful conversations or addresses issues in the relationship.
<a>burned out</a>. 2. Your partner feels intimidated or violated by you as you always seem to see through them.
<p>You look for depth in a shallow world.</p>
<a>online dating</a> people tend to represent how they want to be seen rather than who they really are; most lie online (Ellison, Heino, Gibbs, 2006; Toma Ellison, 2008). As a truth seeker, this frustrates you. You do not separate
<a>sex</a> from an emotional and soulful connection. You need more time to get to know someone than the social norm prescribes.
<a>lonely</a>, and it takes more effort for you to find people who are on your radar.
<p>You prioritize others' needs before your own.</p>
<p>You had to grow up so fast, so soon, that you were deprived of an innocent <a>childhood</a>. If you never had the chance to express your needs and have them met, it makes sense that you don’t know how to seek help now. </p>
<p>The above challenges are faced by many people who, like you, are emotionally sensitive and intense. With self-awareness comes understanding and compassion for yourself. </p>
<p>Just because there are challenges does not mean love and relationships are not possible for you. </p>
<p>For example, you can start by sitting down with yourself and clarifying your values, beliefs, and desires. Then, go into the world, knowing what is it that you want. </p>
<p>It is not easy, but for the right journey, it is worth it. </p>

<h1> Do You Have "Quiet BPD"? </h1>
<h2> Suffering in silence with borderline personality disorder. </h2>
<li>Borderline personality disorder exists on a spectrum, with attention usually given to only one end of that spectrum.</li>
<li>Those with stereotypical BPD externalize their anger, while those with "quiet BPD" aim their emotional volatility at themselves.</li>
<li>Symptoms of "quiet BPD" include blaming yourself for everything and self-isolating based on the belief that you deserve abandonment.</li>
<ol><li>Discouraged or "quiet" borderline</li> <li>Impulsive borderline</li> <li>Petulant borderline</li> <li>Self-destructive borderline</li> </ol>
<a>anger</a>, we forget to spare a thought for those with Quiet BPD who suffer in silence.
<a>anxiety</a>, etc. However, you do not show your inner turmoil on the outside. Instead of lashing out, you direct the anger, hate, and blame toward yourself.
<h3>Do You Have Quiet BPD? </h3>
<li>Do you experience extreme mood swings that last from a few hours to a few days, even when you don't show them on the outside?</li>
<li>Do you suffer from toxic <a>shame</a> and feel guilty all the time?</li>
<li>Do you tend to blame yourself when conflicts occur? </li>
<li>Even if you don't tell them or show it, do you find yourself idealizing someone one moment, then devaluing or discarding them the next? </li>
<li>Do you feel chronically numb, empty, and detached from the world?</li>
<li>Are there times where you feel "surreal," like you are in a movie or a dream?</li>
<li>Do you deny and suppress the anger you feel? </li>
<li>Do you often feel you take up too much space, or are somehow a burden to those around you?</li>
<li>Do you cut people off the instant they hurt you, rather than trying to talk to them about what happened?</li>
<li>When you are upset, do you withdraw into yourself and don't talk to anybody?</li>
<p>Many people with Quiet BPD also suffer from a condition called alexithymia—the inability to recognize or describe emotions. Because you lack the vocabulary for your feelings, you end up letting them fester inside of you.</p>
<a>self-esteem</a> are removed, as in the case of unemployment,
<a>divorce</a>, or financial losses, your sense of self will be at risk of crumbling.
<p>When you fall for someone, you become excessively nervous, and panic at the slightest sign of someone being displeased. This puts you in a hypervigilant state and robs you of the creative energy you could use to be productive.</p>
<p>People-pleasing becomes excessive when you find yourself unable to act spontaneously, and cautiously edit or harshly scrutinize yourself for fear of hurting or offending someone.</p>
<a>Self-loathing</a> can drive you to isolate yourself for days and weeks.
<p>You may have symptoms of <a>social anxiety</a>, harshly scrutinizing everything you say or do, then criticizing or even punishing yourself for it.</p>
<h3>Healing From Quiet BPD</h3>
<a>Asperger's</a>. Having Quiet BPD isolates you. Most likely, you feel uneasy and even ashamed of having to seek help, but the pain and turmoil is severe when you bear it on your own.
<p>If you wish to move forward and live a different life, one that is fuller, richer, and more fulfilling, you ought to summon the courage to do something different.</p>
<p>Having Quiet BPD is painful, but it does not have to be your story for the rest of your life.</p>

<h1> Did You Have to Grow Up Too Soon? </h1>
<h2> Healing from the trauma of parentification. </h2>
<p>Our experiences in childhood, be it an acute <a>trauma</a> or hidden, chronic trauma, could impact us for life. Things that happened years ago can affect our relationships, <a>self-esteem</a>, and quality of life today. </p>
<a>caretaker</a>, the family mediator, etc. It is a form of boundary violation because the innocent childhood that one is entitled to is robbed away.
<p>Forms of Parentification</p>
<a>gifted</a> children are especially prone to be parentified. They are by nature more
<a>empathic</a>, responsive and intuitive than others. They are keenly aware of other people’s moods and nuances in their environments. They see, hear, sense and feel things everyone else is missing, including their parents’ unsaid
<a>lonely</a> and empty in his/her own life. In need of a surrogate partner, the sensitive child is used to fill the gaps in their lives. There may or may not involve any overt
<a>sexual</a> behaviors, touch or abuse, but the emotional closeness is suffocating.
<a>codependent</a> in their future relationships.
<p>What Happens to the Parentified Child?</p>
<p>In most cases of parentification, there is no physical abuse or a lack of love; the parents love their child but only with limited capacity. The harm is usually done not out of malicious intent but personal vulnerabilities. </p>
<a>denial</a> become their second nature.
<p>Sadly, even the circumstances are no longer the same, they are not able to discard the impact of having been parentified. </p>
<p>Some children become extremely compliant. They hope that by becoming the quiet one, they can escape conflicts and blame. </p>

<a>nervous system</a> and are unable to relax even when the threat is no longer there. As adults, they are highly
<a>anxious</a>, picking holes in themselves or those around them. They have an
<a>inner critic</a> that is always complaining they are not doing things correctly, that they must improve and do better. They tend to blame themselves for everything that goes wrong, and constantly try to fix things that cannot be fixed.
<a>stress</a>, you can get paranoid about things even when you know they are illogical. Your overly cautious tendency may also stop you from reaching the next level in your professional life, as you are often held in "analysis paralysis."
<p>Fortunately, there are many healing processes and routes to wholeness and recovery for a young adult or adult who has been parentified as a child. </p>
<a>guilt</a> from not being able to fulfill the impossible demands that were put on you. Making room for self- directed kindness can significantly help you make sense of your experience and shine a light on even the darkest of places.
<p>See if you can imagine yourself to be surrounded by people who love and support you, and what they might say to you. If you feel stuck for words, recall the body memories of what it feels like to be held by love.</p>
<p>If you have little experience of being loved in life, imagine what you would say to a person or a child you love. Then, direct the tender feelings towards yourself. </p>
<p>Remember, you were a completely innocent child who came into the world with the hope to be loved and cared for like a child. Even when your actual childhood was painful, it is never too late to offer yourself the love you deserve. </p>

<h1> Have You Been Used as an Emotional Sponge? </h1>
<h2> Projective identification and the highly empathic child. </h2>
<p>Some children are born with a neurological makeup that can make them more emotionally or intellectually intense, sensitive, and more open to external stimuli than the general population.</p>
<a>intuition</a>, your ability can sometimes come across as psychic. As a child, however, you did not have the language to express what you felt, nor did you have the
<a>emotional regulation</a> skills. You ended up getting overwhelmed by the constant waves of social nuances and others' psychic energies.
<a>passive aggression</a>, hidden lies, and hypocrisies, though it usually does not happen on a conscious level. Before you know it, you might have become the family's emotional
<a>caretaker</a>, or worse, emotional sponge, scapegoat, or punching bag.
<a>Childhood wounding does not always take physical forms</a>. As a society, we must begin to recognize the toxic and insidious nature of chronic complex
<a>trauma</a>. Dynamics such as scapegoating,
<a>gaslighting</a>, chronic neglect, and indirect violence leave deep wounds in our collective psyche, yet historically they have been mainly ignored due to their invisible nature.
<a>gifted</a> children are more likely to fall into the role of emotional caretakers, and have to grow up too early, too soon, forgoing their innocent
<a>childhood</a> to make up for their parents’ limitations and dysfunctions. Their emotional trauma may not be a result of conscious or malicious acts but remain unnoticed for years.
<h2>The Empathic Child as the Emotional Caretaker </h2>
<a>laughter</a> and helping them calm down when they are distressed (Bowlby, 1990; Field, 1994).
<p>When we attempt to help another person regulate their emotions—either by cheering them up or calming them down, we are engaged in what psychologists call 'extrinsic interpersonal emotional regulation' (Nozaki, 2019).</p>
<p>When you sense the energy is low in the household, you make a joke, make a scene, use self- depreciating humour, or put yourself in the 'class clown' role to lighten things up. </p>
<p>When you detect <a>stress</a> in the home, you park away your own <a>anxiety</a>, put on a brave face and become the calm anchor everyone else count on. </p>
<p>When you predict the storm of an <a>anger</a> outburst coming, you know to quietly tuck away your own needs and protect your siblings from harm. </p>
<p>When you see your parents sinking into <a>depression</a>, you diligently help around the house or try to elevate the mood.</p>
<p>You may even silently take care of those around you by altering your self-identify. For instance, you disempower yourself, or take on an incompetent role to satisfy your parents' need to feel like they are 'good parents.'</p>
<p>As a child, you may have psychosomatic pain or eating disorders, although it was <a>unconscious</a>, you have ‘created’ these symptoms so your parents would stop arguing and collaborate. </p>
<h2>Projective Identification: The Dumping of a Shadow</h2>
<p>In some occasions, you take a step further and you actually become the 'sponge' for your family's anger, <a>shame</a>, self- pity, and other unwanted emotions.</p>
<a>psychoanalytic</a> psychology, this is called '
<a>projective identification</a>.'
<p>The truth may hurt, but a toxic lie could kill in the most silent and insidious way. </p>
<p>Self-awareness is the first step to waking up. The goal of this work is not to be stuck in anger or resentment, but to courageously face up to the truth, and take one leap towards liberation.</p>
<p>Seeing this dynamic can be a painful task. It challenges your worldview at a fundamental level. </p>
<p>The part of you that remains protective of your family feels guilty and wants to stay in <a>denial</a>. The part of you that is used to self-blame is frightened of the power waking up may bring.</p>
<p>But our tasks here are not blaming or victimizing. This is an opportunity to come closer to yourself and your truth, and to make room for insights that will help you heal and grow.</p>
<p>As a child, you were voiceless. But you now have the power to walk away. </p>
<p>You can set boundaries, say no; but more importantly, you can psychologically refuse to take in toxic projections, and reclaim your true self.</p>

<h1> Do You Have Paranoid and Controlling Parents? </h1>
<h2> The complex trauma of parents who are hysterical, defensive, and paranoid. </h2>
<li>A hysterical, defensive, paranoid parent can trap their child in a symbiotic relationship, often fueled by guilt, for years.</li>
<li>Characteristics of paranoid and controlling parents include being anxious and unable to handle intimacy.</li>
<li>Releasing one's own internalized anxiety can help someone raised by a controlling parent to reclaim their own life.</li>
<a>PTSD</a> that comes from a one-off event such as an accident, complex trauma that comes from toxic family dynamics is chronic. When you are stuck with a dysfunctional, symbiotic relationship with your parents, your wounds can remain unnoticed for years.
<a>parenting</a>. For some parents, however, their past or
<p>In this article, we will focus on discussing the characteristics of parents who tend to be "fearful and controlling," whose hyper-defensive behaviours are mostly driven by their fears of the world and defensiveness against their own limitations.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Parents With Paranoid and Controlling Tendencies</h3>
<h3>1. They are anxious and paranoid.</h3>
<a>paranoia</a>. They are constantly scanning
<a>the environment</a> for threat signals, and see the worst in everything. They over-analyse all interactions with people and assume others have ulterior motives.
<a>stress</a>, they psychologically
<a>regress</a> to extremist thinking, where the world gets split into the good camp and the bad camp; In their mind, people are divided between tyrants and the abused, the ones who blame and the faulty, the persecutor and the victim.
<h3>2. They are possessive and controlling.</h3>
<p>Parents with fearful and controlling tendencies take pride in their role as your protector. However, they may not realise how they have roped you into a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>With their excessive <a>caretaking</a>, they expect loyalty and obedience from you. They may limit your <a>social life</a>, pull you into a protective bubble, and see your need to go and have your own life as a form of betrayal. </p>
<a>guilt</a> in you, threatening to abandon you, or withdrawing financial support from you. They may even recruit you to be "on their side" against their spouse, which places you in an impossible dilemma.
<h3>3. They are cold and cannot handle intimacy.</h3>
<h3>4. They are extremely defensive.</h3>
<p>To protect their ego, fearful and controlling parents are defensive and reactive. They dread being seen by others, but mostly they cannot tolerate the <a>shame</a> of seeing their own limits.</p>
<p>To defend against their own vulnerabilities, they become extremely defensive to criticism and blame. They take conflicts personally, and hardly ever apologise; you almost cannot disagree with them without receiving a forceful backlash.</p>
<a>passive-aggressive</a> means such as belligerence, verbal violence, threats, unreasonable demands, temper tantrums, and complete withdrawal.
<h3>5. They cannot regulate their emotions.</h3>
<h3>What Happened to Them?</h3>
<a>denial</a>. In truth, their fierceness is there to compensate for how lost and unloved they feel for most of their lives.
<a>unconscious</a> level, they decided to become the strong parent they have longed for.
<p>Sometimes, to liberate yourself from the constant loop of disappointment and hurt, you must relinquish the hope that they will treat you with the love and respect you need.</p>
<p>When you take the plunge to create healthy separation from them, they may react with <a>aggression</a>, threats, or hysteria. They may frame you as an ungrateful or selfish traitor.</p>
<a>neuroscience</a> have given us hope. It is entirely possible for you to rewire the anxiety-prone neuropathways and reopen the doors to the adventures life has to offer.
<a>confidence</a> and self-agency will become your new defaults.
<a>cutting</a> contact (though that may be necessary for some), but reclaiming a life that is authentically yours. It is never too late to liberate yourself.

<h2> Does Free Will Exist? </h2>

<a>might simply call this kind of decision-making “will,”</a> or volition.) Even when
<a>unconscious</a> processes help determine a person’s conscious behavior, some argue, such processes
<a>can still be thought of as part of an individual’s will.</a>
<div> <h3> What is determinism? </h3> </div>
<p>Determinism is the idea that every event, including every human action, is the result of previous events and the laws of nature. A belief in determinism that includes a rejection of free will <a>has been called “hard determinism.”</a></p>

<div> <h3> Can you believe in both free will and determinism? </h3> </div>
<a>A compatibilist believes</a> that even though events are predetermined, there is still some version of free will at work in
<a>decision-making</a>. An incompatibilist argues that only determinism or free will can be true.

<a>morality</a> would collapse without a common belief that each person is responsible for his actions—and thus deserves reward or

<a>additional constraints on the freedom of a person’s will</a> (in the form of rigid thought patterns or compulsions, for instance), beyond the usual factors that shape thinking and behavior. Belief in free will, it has been argued,
<a>may contribute to the stigma</a> attached to mental illness by obscuring the role of underlying biological and environmental causes.
<div> <h3> Do believers in free will make decisions differently? </h3> </div>
<a>that people who believe more strongly in free will</a> may tend to perceive at least some kinds of choices—such as buying electronics or deciding what to watch on TV—as easier to make, and that they may enjoy making choices more.

<h1> 5 Ways to Be Your Own Best Friend </h1>
<h2> ... and stop treating everyone else better than you do yourself. </h2>
<li>People are often capable of giving good advice to their best friends, but find it hard to speak as lovingly to themselves.</li>
<li>Imagining what a friend might say, or even picturing it, can be a good way to distinguish whether one's own self-talk is helpful or not.</li>
<li>Forgiving oneself for negative self-talk can help put one's mindset back on track.</li>
<p>Here are five ways to develop positive self-talk and treat yourself like your own best friend.</p>
<h3>1. Improve Awareness of Negative Thinking</h3>
<a>self-worth</a> and restrictive behaviors. A true friend tells it like it is with the hopes of helping you, not bringing you down.
<h3>2. Picture How Your Best Friend Might Respond</h3>
<h3>3. Focus on the Type of Relationship You Want</h3>
<a>bully</a>’s words strike at our most vulnerable spots, leading to negative feelings and behavior changes. So be your own buddy, not bully!
<h3>4. You Can Fight and Make Up</h3>
<a>forgive</a>. Move forward with the intention of trying a different way next time.
<h3>5. When in Doubt, Pick Up The Phone</h3>

<h1> New Findings on Marijuana's Ability to Treat Chronic Pain </h1>
<h2> Recent studies compared water- and oil-soluble extracts of cannabis. </h2>
<li>The majority of people who purchase medical marijuana report that they are using it to treat chronic pain.</li>
<li>Chronic pain is often due to the presence of inflammation in the effected tissues.</li>
<li>Both oil- and water-soluble extracts of the cannabis plant contain novel chemicals that have anti-inflammatory actions.</li>
<a>cannabidiol</a> (CBD) has anti-inflammatory effects. This is likely because CBD cannot stimulate cannabinoid receptors. CBD does modestly reduce
<a>anxiety</a>; this action at serotonin receptors might reduce some cognitive aspects of the pain.
<p>It was once thought that the cannabis plant contained no aqueous-soluble chemicals that have therapeutic use. This is obviously not the case. There is much more to learn about the contents of the cannabis roots.</p>

<h1> What Really Happens in the Brain During a Cannabis High </h1>
<h2> A recent neuroimaging study discovered the effects of THC during euphoria. </h2>
<li>Many different brain regions are involved in the production of the subjective feelings of euphoria.</li>
<li>Human neuroimaging studies suggest that there is a common neural circuitry that is shared by diverse types of pleasures.</li>
<li>Subjects who received THC demonstrated greater resting-state functional connectivity between the right NAcc and the medial prefrontal cortex.</li>
<li>The findings suggest that THC induces two of the brain’s principal reward centers to start talking to each other.</li>

<a>fear</a> and disgust. Neuroimaging studies of the effects of euphorigenic drugs in humans may provide insight into the precise role of the other pleasure-related regions of the brain.
<p>Do all of the pleasure-related neurotransmitters in all of the pleasure-related brain regions turn on, or off, in some complex fashion when we are high? No one knows. Yet.</p>

<h1> Study: High-Intensity Interval Training May Be Hazardous to Your Health </h1>
<h2> A recent study found evidence of mitochondrial failure after extreme exercising. </h2>
<li>Scientists examined the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic health, and glucose intolerance in HIIT subjects.</li>
<li>HIIT did not improve their blood pressure or reduce their total body fat.</li>
<li>HIIT subjects developed sudden and severe declines in the function of their muscle mitochondria.</li>

<h1> Why Is QAnon’s Mythology More Popular Than Many Religions? </h1>
<h2> The human brain is easily capable of embracing an unprovable “fact.” </h2>
<li>QAnon is a recent example of leaders controlling followers by offering a comfortable myth that comforts and confirms fears.</li>
<li>Frontal lobes in the brain are apt to accept lies told to ourselves and each other.</li>
<li>Humans have been accepting myths as truths for millennia, for some they reduce the feeling that the world is dangerous and frightening.</li>
