<p>Currently, 107 inmates await execution, according to the Japan Times. The last time the country executed a death-row inmate was in 2019, when it hanged a 40-year-old Chinese national who was convicted of murdering a family of four in 2003.</p>

<div><div><p>Australian regulators have charged a landowner and two businesses with more than 250 instances of animal cruelty after dozens of koalas were found dead at the site of a partially cleared timber plantation last year.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We understand the community’s concerns about this case and we have ensured a thorough investigation which led to these charges,” Australia’s chief conservation regulator, Kate Gavens, said in a statement Tuesday.</p></div>
<div><p>Gavens said that the investigation included “gathering a large volume of evidence from the crime scene” and that techniques such as forensic radiography and pathology were used to determine when and how the animals died.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The inquiry was launched after Helen Oakley, a nurse, came across the dead koalas while on an evening walk near Cape Bridgewater last year. She posted a video of herself crying as she surveilled the scene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can smell them. It smells like death,” she told <a>Yahoo News Australia</a> at the time.</p></div></div>
<a>said in a statement</a> Tuesday. Seventy more were reported as suffering from starvation or dehydration, with some also sustaining fractures, the regulator said.
<div><div><p>The defendants have yet to enter a plea, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) <a>reported</a>. The charges are being filed under two laws — Wildlife Act 1975 and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Former president Donald Trump has canceled the news conference he planned to hold on Jan. 6 to mark the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was launched by a mob trying to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden’s electoral college win. It resulted in five deaths and injured about 140 members of law enforcement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his statement, Trump perpetuated his widely debunked claim that the 2020 election was stolen, the false allegation that spurred many of his supporters to invade the Capitol.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The big caveat<b> </b>to the report is that Facebook and other social media platforms see only the nefarious operations that they uncover — and do not know about the broader universe of disinformation that goes undetected.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The top countries Facebook identified as originators of most disinformation operations both domestic and foreign were Russia, Iran, Myanmar, the United States and Ukraine.</p></div></div>

<div><p>By contrast, domestic disinformation had a much greater impact that foreign. The five U.S.-based operations the company exposed heading into the 2020 election featured domestic political players who were abusing Facebook’s rules.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Four out of the five were on the political right.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One trend the report highlighted was the rise in “perception hacking,” in which the prospect of an influence operation helps cast doubt on the authenticity of public debate.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A Canadian court has ordered Iran to pay $84 million — 107 million in Canadian dollars — plus interest to the families of six people who died when a passenger plane was shot down near Tehran in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The judge, in his decision, said the case probably represented the first time a Canadian court had been asked to determine damages “for loss of life caused by terrorism.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This court well understands that damage awards are a poor substitute for the lives that were lost. But a monetary award is the only remedy that a civil court can provide,” Justice Edward Belobaba wrote.</p></div></div>

<p>The Pacific Gas and Electric utility company is to blame for the Dixie Fire, which ravaged swaths of Northern California last summer, after a tree fell on electrical distribution lines that it owns and operates, a state investigation found.</p>
<div><div><p>The report has been forwarded to the Butte County District Attorney’s Office, the agency added, which will determine whether criminal charges will be filed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The blaze was the <a>second-largest</a> in California’s history and burned nearly 1 million acres — an area larger than New York City, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles combined.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cal Fire also urged Californians to “remain vigilant and be prepared for wildfire,” after a year that saw climate change turbocharge <a>severe storms, floods and extreme weather</a> across the United States.</p></div></div>
<a>homes</a> after it began on July 13. It burned a total of 963,309 acres in Butte, Plumas, Lassen, Shasta and Tehama counties,
<a>according </a>to Cal Fire, destroying 1,329 structures and damaging 95 others. It also caused one fatality, the agency said.
<div><div><p>Some <a>past wildfires</a> were deadlier, including the 2018 Camp Fire<b> </b>that leveled the town of <a>Paradise</a>, catching residents off guard and killing at least 85 people as it torched well over 18,000 structures.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The government-funded body, which will start with 45 staff members based in Karlstad and Solna, will report to the country’s justice department.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine</p></div>
<div><div><p>The idea for the agency was first developed in 2018, and it is being led by Director General Henrik Landerholm, a former army officer and ambassador to the Middle East.</p></div></div>
<a>warned </a>Russia against carrying out “malicious cyber activities” on the eve of elections in Germany, as Europe grows wary of Kremlin-backed hackers.
<div><div><p>Social media giant Facebook issued a <a>report </a>last year revealing disinformation campaigns in more than 50 countries since 2017, and it named Russia as the largest producer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For this year, the agency will focus on working to “protect Sweden against foreign malign information influence” ahead of elections in September, he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sweden is not a member of NATO and has maintained a scaled-down military since the Cold War ended. Neighboring Russia has been an <a>ongoing </a>perceived threat, with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 alarming the Swedes.</p></div></div>
<a>protests </a>over government-imposed restrictions. The agency emphasizes that individuals will have a role to play in tackling fake news, alongside a robust national media and civil society.
<div><p>The Swedish agency says fighting disinformation “strengthens democracy,” however it will need to do so without impinging on the freedoms of speech and expression, which are protected by the country’s constitution.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“One has to tread very carefully when it comes to freedom of speech. We must never limit the democratic rights of our population,” Hjort said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This approach, she said, was “probably less likely to meet with public resistance” than simply blocking information on social media or websites.</p></div></div>
<p>Still, the move to establish such an agency, Bauer said, reflects a shift toward preventing disinformation as a form of consumer protection — with the government stepping in proactively to stop citizens from getting hurt by fake news.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adela Suliman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:51 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s Nadal vs. Djokovic — but not on the tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Nadal, speaking Thursday after winning a match at the Melbourne Summer Set ATP 250 tournament, <a>told</a> reporters that Djokovic knew the risks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s normal that the people here in Australia get very frustrated with the case because they have been going through a lot of very hard lockdowns,” Nadal said. Djokovic “makes his own decision,” he added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you are vaccinated, you can play in the Australian Open and everywhere,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, 34, who won the Australian Open last year, was <a>detained</a> by officials at the airport amid growing outrage over a decision to award the athlete a visa and medical exemption from vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia, once known for its tough <a>“covid zero”</a> policies to keep the virus at bay, is now grappling with the <a>omicron variant</a> and one of the world’s sharpest spikes in infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Nadal</a> and <a>Djokovic</a> have previously tested positive for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Djokovic situation has spawned debate on social media along with <a>memes</a>, as <a>airlines</a> offer the player a ride home and others <a>refer</a> to him as “Novax Djokovic.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rules are rules, and there are no special cases,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Thursday, as he thanked border officers and confirmed that Djokovic’s visa had been canceled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our government’s strong border protection policies, and particularly in relation to the pandemic, [have ensured] Australia has one of the lowest death rates of covid anywhere in the world,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>The world No. 1 men’s tennis star is now <a>reportedly being held at a hotel</a> used to house asylum seekers as his lawyers lodge an appeal.</p>
<p><b>John Feinstein:</b> Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. <a>Now he’s becoming a punchline</a>.</p>

<h1>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</h1>
<h2>Omicron has sparked alarm among health experts worried about the new variant’s ability to spread rapidly and evade the body’s immune defenses. Scientists are racing to learn more as cases rise.</h2>

<div><div><p>Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said omicron “is not something that can be avoided.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<a>milder infections</a> than other variants, public health experts say the sudden swell of cases and large number of people who remain unvaccinated could still overwhelm strapped health-care systems.
<div><p>How scary is omicron? Scientists are racing to find answers.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That said, much is still unknown about omicron, and U.S. leaders note that there are many more tools to combat the surge in cases than at the start of the pandemic.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Emails sent to the Foreign Office received a response saying they had been logged, but Marshall said “this was usually false,” with thousands of emails unread, including hundreds from lawmakers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>None of the team’s members had “studied Afghanistan, worked on Afghanistan previously, or had a detailed knowledge of Afghanistan,” he wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson denied that he had intervened to prioritize pets over people, telling reporters on Tuesday that the allegation was “complete nonsense.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.K.’s top diplomat defends chaotic Afghan evacuation, citing intelligence failures</p></div>
<div><p>Marshall also accused then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who <a>has since been reassigned as justice secretary</a>, of being slow to make decisions on tough cases and taking “several hours” to respond to the crisis center.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Raab, who faced rebuke in August for <a>vacationing on a Greek island</a> when the Taliban marched into Kabul on Aug. 15, rejected the criticism Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More than 1,000 Foreign Office staffers worked “night and day” to get 15,000 people evacuated in just two weeks, Raab added. “I don’t think we have seen an operation on that scale in living memory,” he said.</p></div>
<div><p>‘Some people won’t get back’: Britain’s defense secretary breaks down over those left behind in Afghanistan</p></div>
<div><div><p>The British government said it has <a>helped more than 3,000 people leave</a> Afghanistan since the evacuation effort ended and continues working to help others get out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest allegations, however, painted a picture of a “lack of interest and bureaucracy over humanity,” said Tom Tugendhat, a senior Conservative lawmaker and chair of the committee conducting the inquiry.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“These failures betrayed our friends and allies,” he added.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Europe</a></div></div><div><h1>Boris Johnson’s staff denied there was a 2020 Christmas party — except they joked about it on camera</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By William Booth</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Karla Adam</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 8, 2021 at 2:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>LONDON — Britain is obsessed by a Christmas party, which either did or did not happen at 10 Downing Street last year, in the middle of a strict coronavirus lockdown, as hospitals filled with the sick and dying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now there’s leaked video, not of the alleged party itself, but of a mock news conference staged by a communications aide to Johnson, about the party, four days after the alleged festivities. That aide resigned Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rife’ cocaine use reported in U.K. Parliament — just as Boris Johnson announces crackdown on drug crime</p></div>
<div><div><p>The revelations coincided with the government’s announcement of new restrictions to curb the spread of the omicron variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the prime minister added that he had been “repeatedly assured” that there was no party and that no covid rules had been broken.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He announced that he had asked his cabinet secretary to investigate and promised, “It goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That hardly settled the matter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, told the prime minister his apology “raises more questions than answers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Starmer charged that “millions of people” who followed the rules last Christmas “now think the prime minister was taking them for fools, that they were lied to.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Labour lawmaker said Johnson’s staff, “knew there was a party, they knew it was against the rules, they knew they couldn’t admit it, and they thought it was funny. It is obvious what happened.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson’s critics hammered away on their assertion that 10 Downing Street was partying while ordinary people were denied visits to nursing homes and to see sick relatives in hospitals. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s one rule for them and another for the rest of us,” David Lammy, the Labour Party’s point person on foreign affairs, told the BBC.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The following day, Johnson announced a further tightening of rules, amid concern about another variant spreading at the time, effectively canceling Christmas for millions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The clip is not definitive proof, but it is damning — as it appears to suggest that staffers knew all about the party and were cracking jokes about it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked whether there was such a fete, Stratton replies in the clip: “This fictional party was a business meeting — and it was not socially distanced.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pressed for an answer in the rehearsal by Johnson’s top aide, who was playing the role of a journalist, Stratton says, “I went home.” Everyone laughs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked whether the prime minister would condone such a party, Stratton asks the room: “What’s the answer?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, another aide jokes that “it wasn’t a party; it was cheese and wine,” and Stratton laughs and asks: “Is cheese and wine all right?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Late on Wednesday, Stratton gave a tearful statement as she resigned from the government. Most recently, she was in charge of publicity for the global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The images from the mock news conference were plastered across the British papers on Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A Sick Joke” ran a front-page headline in the Daily Mail; the Metro newspaper scolded the “No. 10 Party Clowns.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s disgusting,” Rivka Gottlieb, who lost her father in the first lockdown, told the BBC. “It shows the utter contempt they hold the British public in,” she said.</p></div></div>
