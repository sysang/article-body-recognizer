<h1>Tulsa cops rescue, adopt 'abandoned Christmas puppies' found zipped up in duffel bag</h1>
<h2>Someone dumped the bag on a QuikTrip counter on Christmas Day</h2>
<p>A horrific <a>Christmas</a> find turned into five new fur-ever homes for a litter of puppies left in a duffel bag abandoned at an <a>Oklahoma</a> QuikTrip on Saturday, according to authorities.</p>
<p>Someone allegedly zipped the pups up and dumped the bag on the store’s counter on Christmas Day, the Tulsa <a>Police Department</a> said in a statement.</p>

<p>So four responding officers from the Mingo Valley Division and a store worker rescued and adopted the five of them.</p>
<p>City animal control workers said the officers chose to adopt the animals directly and did not go through their office. </p>
<p>Photos show the four officers posing with their new pups outside the store. A veterinary partner with the <a>Oklahoma Alliance for Animals</a> estimated that they were about five weeks old.</p>
<p>"If you're looking for a pet, please adopt don't shop," Tulsa police urged in a statement Sunday. "There are lots of rescues and shelters that are over capacity for abandoned pets."</p>

<h2>Career criminal Darrell Brooks was released on $1,000 bail before plowing his SUV into a Christmas parade</h2>
<a><u>Darrell Brooks</u></a> was released on $1,000 bail and allegedly plowed into a Christmas parade, killing 6 and injuring more than 60.

<div> <div><p> (https://mobile.twitter.com/govevers)</p></div></div>

<h1>Omicron created huge vacuum of cancellations that 'keep on going': NYC restaurant owner</h1>
<h2>Manhattan restaurant owner Thomas Makkos says business dropped by about 70%</h2>
<h2>NYC restaurant owner says omicron caused business to drop by 70% in 2 weeks</h2>
<p>Nello owner Thomas Makkos says people 'are very afraid to come out' of their homes and that the new strain has led to many cancellations with no end in sight.</p>
<p><a>New York City</a> <a>restaurant</a> owner Thomas Makkos noted that business has dropped by about 70% over the past two weeks because of fears related to the "very transmissible" <a>omicron</a> strain. </p>
<p>The owner of Nello, an Italian restaurant in Manhattan, told "<a>Varney Co.</a>" on Tuesday that there have been "a lot of cancellations" as "people are very afraid to come out." </p>
<p>"It has created a huge vacuum of cancellations that keep on going," Makkos stressed. </p>
<p>He added that the new coronavirus strain is adding challenges to an industry already battered by the virus and the mandates that were enforced in an effort to curb its spread. </p>
<a>vaccine mandate</a> for private employers went into effect, as the largest
<a>city</a> in the country looks to implement the strictest
<a>vaccine</a> requirement on non-government employees yet.
<p><a><u>NOVAVAX AT ‘TIPPING POINT’ WITH COVID VACCINE: CEO</u></a></p>
<p>If they do not, the employer must ban them from the workplace or else the business could be subject to a "fine of $1,000 and escalating penalties thereafter if violations persist." </p>
<h2><a>Celebrity chef on challenges for restaurant industry amid surging inflation </a></h2>
<p>Celebrity chef and restaurateur Adrianne Calvo says inflation and labor shortages are contributing to the challenges experienced by the restaurant industry, noting most of the higher costs are being absorbed by owners.</p>
<p>Makkos stressed on Tuesday that the regulations in the city are "immensely" hurting business. </p>
<p>He said the regulations "were very strict from day one," especially for New York City restaurants. </p>
<p>Makkos said Nello was closed for about seven months and then reopened initially at 25% capacity. </p>
<p>"It was catastrophic," he said, regarding the loss in revenue. He stressed that while restaurants in the city were closed, some restaurants on Long Island were allowed to stay open, with those in Suffolk County doing "tremendous business." </p>
<p>Makkos argued that while New York City has been protecting people from COVID, another problem related to the economy has been exacerbated:</p>
<p>"Restaurants are all in trouble. They owe landlords a lot of money," he said, arguing that those that remain open were likely given a "lifeline" by their landlords. </p>
<p>"Way too many restaurants have not survived unfortunately," Makkos said on Tuesday, stressing that it has been "very difficult." </p>

<h1>Novavax at 'tipping point' with COVID vaccine: CEO</h1>
<h2>Stanley Erck says Novavax vaccine will 'be very effective against omicron'</h2>
<div><div><h2>Novavax vaccine will be 'very effective' against omicron: CEO </h2> <p>Novavax CEO Stanley Erck says the company will file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the end of the year.</p></div></div>
<p><a>Novavax CEO Stanley Erck</a> said on Monday that his company is at the "tipping point" as it pertains to its <a>COVID</a> vaccine and noted that the two-dose series will be "very effective" against the highly-contagious omicron strain.</p>
<p>Speaking on "<a>Varney Co</a>.," he acknowledged, however, that "nobody really has efficacy data." </p>
<p>He noted that there is efficacy data available from the company’s phase 3 clinical trials, "which shows that our vaccine works between 90 and 100%" against the original strain and the delta variant. </p>
<a>shows</a> with omicron we get a very potent response after two doses and then when you boost after six months, you get multiple fold increase on antibodies for omicron," he continued. "So we think it’s going to be very effective against omicron."
<p>Erck noted on Monday the company is in the process of manufacturing "quite a bit of doses and getting them out." </p>
<p>He made the comments about <a>two months after</a> it was revealed the company reportedly faced significant hurdles with its vaccine manufacturing, which delayed the roll-out for months. </p>
<a>awarded</a> Novavax $1.6 billion to help develop the testing and manufacturing of its coronavirus vaccine. However, multiple sources familiar with the matter told
<a>Politico</a> in October that Novavax had been unable to produce a COVID-19 vaccine that meets the Food and Drug Administration's purity standards.

<p>Novavax President and CEO Stanley Erck on its vaccine being 90.4% effective in a clinical trial and why the booster shot will be its' 'biggest market' in the U.S.</p>
<p>Novavax attested to analytics and testing issues in a <a>filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. However, sources reportedly claimed that the company's issues were more concerning than previously understood. </p>
<p><a><u>OMICRON VARIANT CAUSES CHRISTMAS FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AND HOLIDAY TRAVEL HEADACHES</u></a></p>
<p>Speaking on "Varney Co." on Monday, Erck said his company "shipped 10 million doses to Indonesia last week and so we’re getting our vaccine out." </p>
<p>"It’s a really positive moment for the company," he stressed. </p>
<h2><a>Novavax CEO says company at 'tipping point' with COVID vaccine </a></h2>
<p>Novavax CEO Stanley Erck says the company is in the process of manufacturing 'quite a bit of doses and getting them out' and notes that the vaccine will be 'very effective' against the omicron strain.</p>
<p>The Novavax vaccine was the ninth to be granted an emergency use authorization from the U.N. health agency, marking a vote of confidence for the company.</p>
<p>The vaccine was long anticipated to help increase global vaccine supplies given it requires only refrigerated storage compared to other vaccines that require colder storage. </p>
<p>On Monday, Erck also noted that Novavax has been given emergency use authorization in Indonesia and the Philippines. </p>
<p><a><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></a></p>
<p>"We’ve filed in multiple regulatory agencies for approvals," he noted on Monday. "We started with Indonesia and the Philippines. We just recently got approval in Europe for the vaccine and WHO, the World Health Organization." </p>
<p>He said the company plans to file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week, noting that it’s "the same filing package that we’ve been filing in Europe and WHO and we’re hopeful that it will be approved as quickly." </p>

<h1>2021: The year the 2024 presidential race ignited</h1>
<h2>Trump eyes 2024, but he's got plenty of company from other potential GOP presidential contenders</h2>
<h4><a>Trump reveals when he will make a decision about running for President in 2024 on 'Gutfeld!'</a></h4>
<p>President Trump sits down with Greg Gutfeld to discuss Hunter Biden's paintings, the approval ratings of the Republican Party, and Biden's call with Ghani on 'Gutfeld!'</p>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>It didn’t take long for former President Trump to begin publicly sending signals about 2024.</p>
<a>the GOP</a> briefly diminished in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists aiming to disrupt congressional certification of now
<a>President Biden</a>'s Electoral College victory over Trump, the former president was back in the spotlight.
<a>Conservative Political Action Conference</a> in Orlando, Florida, in a speech delivered two weeks after he was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial on the charge of inciting the deadly attack on the Capitol.
<p><a>WHAT TRUMP TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT HIS 2024 TIMETABLE</a></p>
<p>Fast-forward to the end of 2021 and Trump continues to tease a presidential bid.</p>
<p>"I am certainly thinking about it," he said last month in a Fox News interview. "I think a lot of people will be very happy, frankly, with the decision."</p>
<p>And earlier this month the former president, at an event in Orlando, Florida, emphasized that he is "very strongly" thinking about launching a presidential campaign for "a third time."</p>

<a>Iowa</a>, the state whose caucuses for half a century have kicked off the presidential nominating calendar. And he’s been incredibly active in party politics, making scores of endorsements in Republican primary showdowns.
<p><a>TRUMP'S FUNDRAISING PROWESS FUELED BY GRASSROOTS DONATIONS</a></p>
<p>Public opinion polling indicates that Trump remains very popular with the GOP base, and that at this extremely early point in the 2024 presidential cycle he’s the overwhelming front-runner in the Republican nomination race.</p>
<p>One thing Trump’s immense clout over his party and repeated flirtations is not doing is discouraging other potential GOP White House hopefuls from visiting the states that kick off the <a>presidential primary</a> and caucus calendar.</p>
<div> <div><p> Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas speaks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual leadership conference in Las Vegas on Nov. 5, 2021. (Fox News)</p></div></div>
<p>In 2021, there were 15 trips to Iowa by nine potential Republican presidential contenders, not far off from the 17 visits by 11 possible candidates in 2013 at this early point in the wide-open GOP nomination race in the 2016 cycle. </p>
<p><a>TRUMP'S 2024 TEASE ISN'T PREVENTING OTHER POTENTIAL GOP WHITE HOUSE HOPEFULS FROM VISITING EARLY VOTING STATES</a></p>
<a>Mike Pence</a>, who earlier this month made his second trip this year to New Hampshire. Pence’s busy itinerary in the Granite State included all the trappings of a presidential campaign-style trip.

<a>South Carolina</a>, which votes third in the GOP primary and caucus calendar, and
<a>Nevada</a>, which holds the fourth contest.
<p><a>WHAT MIKE PENCE TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2024 RUN</a></p>
<p>The week before Pence arrived in New Hampshire, <a>Sen. Tom Cotton</a> – another potential contender – made his second stop this year in the Granite State. The Republican from Arkansas has also made two trips to Iowa and a visit to Nevada.</p>
<p>"I'm not making any decision right now about the future. The election that’s looking at us right in our windshield is the 2022 election," Cotton told Fox News during a stop at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.</p>
<p>And with the possible contenders all hoping to avoid appearing like they’re challenging Trump, emphasizing their efforts to help fellow Republicans has become more essential than ever.</p>

<h1>McConnell continues pitching Manchin on switching parties, says WV senator 'feels like a man alone'</h1>
<h2>If Manchin becomes a Republican, it would give GOP control of Senate with a slim 51-senator majority</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Gallagher: Manchin could switch parties if far-left continues demonizing him</a></h4> <p>Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., on Republicans encouraging Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to switch parties.</p></div></div>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>Senate Minority Leader <a><u>Mitch McConnell</u></a>, R-Ky., has continued pitching Sen. <a><u>Joe Manchin</u></a>, D-W.Va., on switching parties, remarking that the West Virginia Democrat "feels like a man alone" in his party.</p>
<p>McConnell made his latest pitch to Manchin while speaking to conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, who asked the top Senate Republican if he had talked to the Democratic senator on if he would take the next exit into the GOP.</p>
<p><a><u>MITCH MCCONNELL SAYS HE’D WELCOME MANCHIN TO THE GOP IF HE WAS SO ‘INCLINED’</u></a></p>
<div> <div><p> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Oct. 19, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></div></div>
<p>"And I think what Manchin is discovering is that there just aren’t any Democrats left in the Senate that are pro-life and terribly concerned about debt and deficit and inflation," McConnell continued. "So he feels like a man alone."</p>
<p>McConnell also said that if Manchin "were to join" the GOP, "he’d be joining a lot of folks who have similar views on a whole range of issues."</p>
<p>The Senate minority leader also said he would "talk" to Manchin about keeping the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee gavel, but did not give a firm yes or no on whether that would happen.</p>

<p>If Manchin were to switch parties and become a Republican, it would give the GOP control of the Senate with a slim 51-senator majority.</p>

<p>If McConnell intends to keep Manchin in control of the gavel in the event of a switch, he would likely have to strike a deal with Barrasso for the chairmanship.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Republican has been pushing the case for Manchin joining the GOP hard, having said just last week that he would "certainly welcome" the West Virginia Democrat into the party if he switched.</p>
<p>Rumors of a Manchin switch-up have rippled through Washington following Manchin’s vow to vote down President Biden’s signature Build Back Better bill.</p>
