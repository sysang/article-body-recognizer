<div><h1>The battle to prevent another Jan. 6 features a new weapon: The algorithm</h1></div>
<h2>A year after the attack on the Capitol, data scientists say artificial intelligence can help forecast insurrection — with some big concerns</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>For many Americans who witnessed the attack on the Capitol last Jan. 6, the idea of mobs of people storming a bedrock of democracy was unthinkable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the data scientists who watched it unfold, the reaction was a little different: We’ve been thinking about this for a long time.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>that predicts the likelihood of coups and electoral violence for dozens of countries each month.
<div><p>Election misinformation soared to 10,000 posts per day in Facebook groups before Jan. 6</p></div>
<div><p>Another group, the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location Event Data Project, or ACLED, also monitors and predicts crises around the world, employing a mixed-method approach that relies on both machine-learning and software-equipped humans.</p></div>
<div><p>Biden White House concludes Jan. 6 preparations hurt by lack of high-level intelligence sharing</p></div>
<div><div><p>“For the 2024 election God knows we absolutely need to be doing this,” said Sheldon Himelfarb, chief executive of PeaceTech. “You can draw a line between data and violence in elections.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many of the models, for instance, find income inequality not to be correlated highly with insurrection; drastic changes in the economy or climate are more predictive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And paradoxically social-media conflict is an unreliable indicator of real-world unrest. (One theory is that when violence is about to take place, many people are either too busy or too scared to unleash screeds online.)</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bellish and other skeptics also point to a troubling consequence: Prediction tools could be used to justify crackdowns on peaceful protests, with AI used as a fig leaf. “It’s a real and scary concern,” Powell said.</p></div>
<div><p>Opinion: Polling on Jan. 6 shows the vast majority of Americans aren’t crazy</p></div>
<b> </b> He imagines a very slow transition to these models.
<div><div><p>“I don’t think we’ll have this in wide use by January 6, 2025,” he added. “We should, because the technology is there. But it’s an adoption issue.”</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Law enforcement agencies failed to heed mounting warnings about violence on Jan. 6</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security — two agencies central to domestic terrorism — have shown fewer signs of adopting these models.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>The weirdest and most interesting tech at CES 2022</h1></div>
<h2>The consumer electronics trade show salutes 2022 with some of the strangest technologies we’ve seen in a while. Here are the highlights.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Chris Velazco</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Tatum Hunter</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:58 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 4:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The world’s biggest consumer electronics trade show known as CES feels weird this year, with far fewer attendees gracing the Las Vegas conference halls where consumer tech companies show off their latest and greatest (almost) every January.</p>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<p>As always, some of the industry’s plans are raising eyebrows. People still don’t have legal protections for the personal data they generate in normal old smartphone apps, yet consumer tech is marching forward into virtual reality.</p>
<div><p>What it’s like at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Garments made for gaming — and the metaverse</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The age of the metaverse is nearly upon us, according to some of the biggest names in tech. But what good is palling around with people in a sprawling, interconnected virtual space if you can’t feel the “world” around you?</p>
<div><div><p>That’s where the smart — and sometimes painful — garments from <a>Owo</a> enter the picture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>At last, augmented reality glasses that don’t look (that) ridiculous</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>But what’s a wearable like this actually meant to do? The software on the prototype we saw was far from finished, but it mentioned the ability to control phone calls, view photos and even display text on a virtual teleprompter.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Spacious space abodes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some CES presenters are thinking forward to when people live in entirely connected homes. Sierra Space is thinking about when people live in giant inflatable houses on the moon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A fitness tracker for your cat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The pet’s place in the family is changing,” says Caudron. “It’s no longer a dog-master relationship. We think of ourselves as parents and our dogs as a member of the family.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A projector that works in unexpected places</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Even now, in the middle of the strangest CES on record, companies have devoted big chunks of the show floor to showing off their flashiest, best TVs. But for Samsung, one of its biggest new products might actually be one of its smallest.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that nibbles your fingers and warms your heart</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>True comfort is priceless, and for some people, that kind of peace only comes when animals or babies cutely gnaw on them. If that’s you, a tiny product from Japan just might be the best impulse buy of your life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aoki hopes to usher Amagami Ham Ham through a crowdfunding campaign in a few months, and — assuming that’s successful — he aims to sell the robot in Japan and abroad for the equivalent of about $30.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that probably upsets you</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Humanoid robots are getting more lifelike, but only compared to their predecessors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just take the Ameca robot from Engineered Arts, a true-to-scale, metal-and-plastic robot person who blinks, shrugs and grimaces just like you and me — if you and me were stilted human facsimiles.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>New Biden rule reducing climate emissions from cars and SUVs reverses major Trump rollback</h1></div>

<div><p>The Biden administration finalized a rule Monday to cut climate pollutants from new cars and light trucks, which will keep billions of tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and change the kinds of vehicles Americans drive.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The agency decided to issue tailpipe emissions tighter than those it <a>proposed in August</a> for 2025 and 2026.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pressed on whether the industry could meet the tighter pollution standards without the climate bill’s passage, he said at a news conference held in the EPA’s courtyard that the new rule is “achievable.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“We still believe those EV tax credits will be available for our union-made products, we really do believe that,” Curry said outside EPA headquarters.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Billionaire Elon Musk named Time’s Person of the Year for 2021</p></div>
<div><p>Tesla‘s approach stands out as radically different. The software — which Musk called part of a “debatable” upgrade in July — has been used to update cars already on the roads and in the hands of drivers.</p></div>
<b> </b>crashes within a day of learning about the incidents, stoking fears that Tesla’s brazenness will invite tighter regulations, slowing progress across the industry.
<div><p>Tesla is putting ‘self-driving’ in the hands of drivers amid criticism the tech is not ready</p></div>
<div><p>Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and now a safety consultant, said driver-assistance systems like Tesla’s should be tested more thoroughly before they’re released on public roads.</p></div>
<div><p>Tesla’s recent Full Self-Driving update made cars go haywire. It may be the excuse regulators needed.</p></div>
<div><p>It’s a big gamble that the technology will improve faster than the associated liability with testing it on the roads, said Andrew Maynard, a professor at Arizona State University who is director of its Risk Innovation Lab.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The company later issued a recall, and owners — including Smith — said they were dismayed by its actions related to the move.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Others have soured in the meantime.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Marc Hoag, a self-described Tesla fanboy and a shareholder of its stock, waited for a year and a half to get the software. But once he tried it, he was disappointed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s still so impossibly bad,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It seems to me remarkably, shockingly premature to allow it to be tested on public streets,” he added. “You can’t test it and not be reckless at the same time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many loyal Tesla drivers don’t fault Musk for promising the impossible.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tesla tempted drivers with ‘insane’ mode and now is tracking them to judge safety. Experts say it’s ludicrous.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Though hitting that button is satisfying, it may not help very much, said Mahmood Hikmet, a New Zealand-based self-driving car engineer who works in another part of the industry focused on autonomous shuttles.</p></div></div>
<p>He and other experts in the field say Tesla can’t use the fire hose of data from its cars all at once. Other companies instruct safety drivers to test specific problem areas at specific times, rather than have them drive around aimlessly.</p>
<div><p><span>City planners eye self-driving vehicles to correct mistakes of the 20th-century auto</span></p></div>
<div><p>For Chris, buying a Tesla was a “life changer” because the Autopilot feature allowed him to improve his grueling commute that begins on the dirt road leading out of his rural home in Fenton, Mich., and ends in Ann Arbor.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The office said the issue is present in Tesla Models 3, S, X and Y and that game play has been available to drivers since December 2020. Games range from solitaire to more advanced titles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Prior to this time, gameplay was enabled only when the vehicle was in Park,” the report said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla will no longer allow drivers and front-seat passengers to play video games while its cars are in motion, the company told federal regulators after a probe was opened this week.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>GM heralded this plant as a model for its electric car future. Then its batteries started exploding.</h1></div>
<h2>The company had to recall 141,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles, a microcosm of the challenge GM faces as it aims to shift its production to all-electric</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Faiz Siddiqui</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The nine-year GM employee ducked under a car frame on an orange vehicle carrier, swung a mechanical arm out and drove five bolts into a nearly<b> </b>1,000-pound battery pack with roughly the footprint of a bathtub.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But there is no mistaking its significance. “It’s the heart of the car,” McConkey said one day this past summer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a terrible thing that has happened,” Tim Grewe, GM’s general director for electrification strategy and cell engineering, said in an interview in September.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carmakers including Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Ford also have announced plans to go all or mostly electric — chasing ambitions similar to GM’s deadline of 2035.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Plug-in cars are the future. The grid isn’t ready.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But first, automakers have to show they can manufacture safe and reliable<b> </b>cars — at scale.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t want to minimize this point, but it also lets us build confidence that we’re going to be transparent, we’re going to take action,” Grewe said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why batteries explode</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Late last summer, Chevy Bolt owners received a notice from GM: They were not to park their cars within 50 feet of other vehicles. They shouldn’t charge their cars overnight. Fully charged vehicles, GM said, should not be kept in garages.</p>
<div><p>The recall of the Bolt covered all of the roughly 141,000 units GM had ever built. The company identified the issue as dual defects that led battery materials to make contact with one another and the components to combust spontaneously.</p></div>
<div><div><p>It’s a danger that comes directly from the core challenge of creating electric-vehicle batteries: the competition to pack more and more energy into them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Where electric cars could help save coal</p></div>
<div><div><p>That has carmakers in a 21st-century space race to pack as much energy density as possible into their battery cells, maximizing range and performance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The explosion of an electric car battery can release a massive amount of energy — and the resulting fire can burn for hours, stretching longer and registering hotter than a fire in a car with an internal-combustion engine.</p></div>
<div><p>“Battery fires can take up to 24 hours to extinguish,” according to an emergency response guide for the Model S on Tesla’s website. “Consider allowing the battery to burn while protecting exposures.”</p></div>
<div><p>General Motors teams up with LG Chem to jump-start its clean-tech future</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Both surfaces are electrically conductive,” Sakamoto said. If they touch, “then they short-circuit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When that happens, it’s cause for concern but not yet a catastrophe.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In the densely packed cell, a short circuit leads to the release of heat. A large release of heat from a cell can ignite another, and the combined heat can ignite others in a chain reaction known as “thermal runaway.”</p></div>
<p>In GM’s case, “cooling pillows” surround the pouch-shaped cells to prevent too much heat from being released between them. But they’re not meant to defend against thermal events so far outside normal operating conditions.</p>
<div><div><p>“The battery explodes,” Sakamoto said. “The adjacent cells explode, too.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>GM has been hit hardest by fire concerns — but Audi and Hyundai also have recalled EVs over fire risks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As GM addresses the issues with the Bolt, it has shut down the factory here. And the future of the Bolt, the first realization of GM’s vision for the coming decade, has been thrust into uncertainty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A fight for raw materials</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before they are able to install the batteries, GM, Tesla and their battery suppliers have to solve another challenging task: obtaining the raw materials to make them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s a problem likely to grow even more difficult in the years to come.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The raw materials used in electric cars are heavily concentrated in only a few regions of the world.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As companies push 2025 and 2030 deadlines to shift much of their production to electric cars, he said, “there’s a very low likelihood the world can supply enough lithium to make that happen.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>GM acknowledges the challenge.</p></div></div>
<p>“Categorically, you’re making all of this huge investment in the material supply,” Grewe said. “Let’s say we hit 2035: You’ve got to convert all that investment” into usable material for the battery.</p>
<div><p>Without access to charging stations, Black and Hispanic communities may be left behind in the era of electric vehicles</p></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. government says the market for batteries is expected to grow five to 10 times its current size over the next decade. Some estimates say the amount of lithium produced must quadruple by 2030 to meet the demand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on the company’s recent earnings call that the appetite for electric vehicles has grown significantly, creating short-term bottlenecks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles,” he said. “And, I mean, to be totally frank, it’s caught us a little bit off guard.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tesla test drivers believe they’re on a mission to make driving safer for everyone. Skeptics say they’re a safety hazard.</p></div>
<div><div><p>As automakers seek breakthroughs that could power an electric future, lithium-ion might not win out.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Two things: It’s the simultaneous improvement in performance and improvement in safety,” Sakamoto said. “If one can make a battery that has those two criteria satisfied, then one can supplant lithium-ion.”</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On the factory floor</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>reopen; GM now says it will be closed through February. The company said it has decommissioned old equipment for internal-combustion engines at the plant, rendering the facility capable of making only electric and autonomous vehicles.
<div><div><p>The energy of the factory floor this past summer, before the shutdown, suggested a recognition that EVs were coming but an unease about what it might mean for workers.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Ford building massive electric vehicle and battery plants with $11.4 billion investment</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Near the battery installation area, Joel Newsom, team leader of a chassis<b> </b>“marriage line,” bonded a Bolt together with four bolts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his free time, Newsom likes to race trucks, specifically his Chevrolet Colorado with a “big block,” shorthand for a type of larger-displacement engine. He has few qualms about GM’s strategy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“GM is preaching the future for us; we can’t always base it on fossil fuels,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he’s not so certain he’d partake.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The traditional labor concern is always fewer jobs: fewer American jobs because a lot of our parts come from many places around the globe,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the end of the assembly line last summer, where gasoline-powered cars once roared to life, Kim Fuhr stood with an electric-vehicle charger in hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fuhr doesn’t have to handle gasoline or deal with the exhaust fumes that preceded her work on the Bolt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m in [a] retirement home now,” joked Fuhr, a nearly 25-year veteran of General Motors.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes found guilty in landmark Silicon Valley fraud case</h1></div>
<h2>Mixed verdict included jury finding Holmes guilty on 4 of 11 charges in fraud trial</h2>
<div><span><div><span><div>By Rachel Lerman</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Nitasha Tiku</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Faiz Siddiqui</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><div><p>“She chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and with patients,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing argument.</p></div></div>
<p>“The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes’s culpability in this large-scale investor fraud, and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,” said Stephanie Hinds, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California.</p>
<div><div><p>Following the verdict, Holmes walked out of the courtroom holding hands with her mother and partner, and did not respond to questions.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Elizabeth Holmes trial is the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley</p></div>
<div><div><p>The <a>downfall of Theranos</a>, and Holmes with it, captivated people around the country when the company dissolved in 2018 after years of regulatory investigations and media scandals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The government filed charges against Holmes for allegedly misleading investors and patients about the capability of her company’s blood-testing device. She pleaded not guilty.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Blood, labs and fraud: Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes is on trial</p></div>
<p>One former employee, Erika Cheung, told jurors how she tried to bring concerns with the quality of lab tests to managers at the company, only to feel sidelined. Theranos’s tests weren’t passing quality-control checks, she said.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was starting to get very uncomfortable and very stressful for me working at the company, and I was attempting to tell as many people as I could,” she said on the stand in September.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Investors told jurors that they felt misled by Holmes’s representations of the company and said they didn’t know that Theranos was relying on third-party lab machines to run blood tests, rather than its own technology.</p></div>
<div><div><p>After the prosecution’s parade of insiders and expert witnesses, the defense called just two witnesses before it turned to its best weapon to woo the jury: Holmes herself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The entrepreneur testified for more than 20 hours over the course of seven days, alternately stony-faced and emotional. She told jurors that she always acted in good faith while leading the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They weren’t interested in today or tomorrow or next month,” she said on the stand. “They were interested in what kind of change we could make.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the verdict was read, Holmes sat up straight and gazed in the jury’s direction. She hugged her family and left the courtroom after it was delivered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She confirmed that Balwani did not force her to say allegedly misleading things to investors. But she said his influence was deeply felt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He impacted everything about who I was,” Holmes said. “And I don’t fully understand that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Balwani, who faces a separate trial for the same charges in February, has denied the allegations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In cross-examination, prosecutor Robert Leach pushed Holmes to admit that she was ultimately responsible for the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And you take responsibility for the company, is that your testimony?” he asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I do,” she responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 as a student at Stanford, growing it afterward to a massive company with hundreds of employees.</p></div></div>
<p>The Journal investigation in 2015 cited former employees who revealed that Theranos was using its own technology on only a small piece of its total number of tests, instead relying on outside traditional lab machines to test patients’ blood.</p>
<div><div><p>She left the company in 2018, and Theranos shuttered soon after.</p></div></div>
<h3>What to know about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes</h3>
<p><b>Elizabeth Holmes</b>, the founder of <b>Theranos </b>who rocketed to fame nearly a decade ago, is accused of <a>misleading investors and patients </a>about the capability of her company’s blood-testing technology.</p>
<p>Holmes is on trial for 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She has <a>pleaded not guilty</a>.</p>
<p>Her defense lawyers have argued that she <a>acted in good faith while running Theranos</a>.</p>
<p>On the stand, Holmes revealed a <a>cornerstone of her defense</a>: that her former partner and the company’s president had allegedly abused and controlled her.</p>
<p>While Theranos might have collapsed, but other <a>blood diagnostic start-ups are still raising cash</a>.</p>

<h2>Facebook gave rise to the boogaloo community that led the officer’s killer and accomplice to connect, lawsuit alleges</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Faiz Siddiqui</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:49 a.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 6:12 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>SAN FRANCISCO — The sister of a slain federal officer is suing Facebook’s parent company Meta, alleging it bears responsibility for her brother’s killing during racial justice protests in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook facilitated the hateful far-right<b> </b>“boogaloo” movement, leading an adherent to murder officer Dave Patrick Underwood, the lawsuit filed in a California Superior Court late Wednesday alleges.</p></div></div>
<div><p>An officer was gunned down. The killer was a ‘boogaloo boy’ using nearby peaceful protests as cover, feds say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The suit alleges wrongful death and a survival action for the pain and suffering Underwood endured before he died, citing alleged general negligence and negligent design by Facebook.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook pushed back against the allegations on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lawyers for Underwood’s sister say Facebook should not be protected by Section 230.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen tells lawmakers that meaningful reform is necessary ‘for our common good’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Rather than simply allow information to be posted on the site, Facebook actively promoted inflammatory content and steered people toward it, the suit alleges.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Section 230: The little law that defined how the Internet works</p></div>
<div><div><p>The complaint also alleges that Facebook “helped build” the boogaloo community that ushered in their planning.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook removes hundreds of boogaloo accounts for ‘promoting violence’ in coordinated takedown</p></div>
<div><div><p>The group’s emergence led to a wider examination of the effects of social media on the rise of violent movements, with some making comparisons to foreign militant groups such as the Islamic State.</p></div></div>
