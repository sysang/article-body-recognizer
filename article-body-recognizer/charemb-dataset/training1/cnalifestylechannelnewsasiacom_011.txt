<h1> The Singaporean giving 10,000 unwanted items a new lease of life at her vintage shop </h1>
<div> <p>CNA Women speaks to By My Old School founder Rebecca Wong, who shares the story behind her vintage shop – and explains why shopping for old things could be a way of embracing retail therapy sustainably.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annie Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>Rebecca Wong understands the love for things. On the surface, the 44-year-old vintage shop owner seems like the last person on earth to tout the “less is more” rhetoric.</p>
<p>Vintage shopping, you could say, is one of the few remaining ways to embrace retail therapy sustainably. </p>
<p>Collecting runs in Wong’s blood. Her father Winston Wong, 74, is also a collector. Together, father and daughter have saved countless items from second-hand dealers and families. </p>
<p>“You find the most interesting things in old homes when people are clearing their parents’ and grandparents’ stuff,” she said. </p>
<p>Before they started the shop 10 years ago, the duo kept their collection at home, occasionally running garage sales on weekends. Wong was then a senior writer at an interior design magazine and her father, a civil servant. </p>
<p>However, when a shop unit near their old home at Normanton Park became available in 2011, it seemed as though the stars had aligned. While still retaining their full-time jobs, they founded a vintage shop together.</p>
<p>The name By My Old School was inspired by a line from a Beatles song, Good Morning, Good Morning. </p>
<p>“When you think about your old school, it always comes with very fond memories of what you do after school, the places you walked past and hung out,” said Wong. </p>
<p>Having since shifted her shop to Commonwealth Drive, today, Wong’s collection spans from the 1940s to the 1990s, encompassing the memories of many generations of Singaporeans. </p>
<p>Wong knows her extensive collection intimately. You could point to almost any item and she would be able to give you some interesting tidbit on when it was created, or how it was used or made.</p>
<p>Though she left her editorial job in 2016, her experience as an interior design writer and editor has certainly helped. She brings to customers an eye for home decorating, suggesting creative ways to upcycle vintage items for modern homes. </p>
<p>What should one do with a long wooden daching? Why not suspend it above the bar counter and hang plants from it? </p>
<p>What about this Russian copper deep sea diving helmet? Put an LED light inside and you not only transform it into a lamp, but a statement piece and talking piece, she suggested.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>“You can make something creative out of a lot of old stuff. There is a real need for places where these things can come to the market again instead of being thrown away and incinerated,” she added.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Wong finds great beauty in things that bear the mark of time. “Part of the charm of vintage things is the patina. Many natural materials such as brass, wood, copper and leather actually look better as they age,” she said. </p>
<p>“Vintage items are also unique – usually we only have one of its kind, so after we sell it, it’s gone.”</p>
<p>Another key factor is craftsmanship. “A lot of things made in the past, such as typewriters and cooking tools were made to last; not to be discarded. </p>
<p>“Because these were things people depended on to make their living and raise their families, they were generally made with a lot more care. Many are even handmade and hand-welded,” she noted.</p>
<p>“In the past, they’d give you almost a lifetime guarantee. That’s the beauty of vintage – you can use it forever. It is more sustainable,” she added. </p>
<p>“Today, many items are mass produced and badly made. People just want to sell you things that you would throw away after two years and buy more so you are constantly consuming.” </p>
<p>Wong also lovingly restores many of the vintage items in By My Old School. </p>
<p>For electro plated nickel silver (EPNS) tableware, she uses a sanding block to remove surface tarnish.</p>
<p>For more complicated repair and restoration work such as re-upholstery, and broken clocks, gramophones and telephones, she ropes in a rolodex of professionals.</p>
<p>A CLOSER CONNECTION WITH OBJECTS</p>
<p>If you ask Wong, the problem is not that we love things too much, but that we don’t love them enough. </p>
<p>Sustainability need not be about denying ourselves the things we love and pursuing a minimalistic lifestyle. It can simply be developing a closer connection to each and every object we buy and own. </p>
<p>According to Wong, our satisfaction from purchases is so fleeting because of how detached most online shopping experiences are.</p>
<p>“The shopping experience is getting more and more impersonal. You can buy something online from anywhere in the world without stepping into the shop, meeting anyone or knowing much about how the product was made. </p>
<p>This does not give you much satisfaction because you are mindlessly consuming without valuing the things you consume,” she said. </p>
<p>Vintage shopping, on the other hand is about the “thrill of the hunt” and “looking for treasure” among what some may consider junk. </p>
<p>“What inspires me are the stories behind each item, how they were used in the past, and the connection between people and the things they own.” </p>
<p>Some of Wong’s customers have found items that their grandmothers or parents used to own. By sheer coincidence, her family friends even found their old family photo dating back to 1963 among By My Old School’s archives. </p>
<p>“Every collector that comes through our door is looking for specific things. They can’t tell you what it is, but they know it when they see it. It is kind of beautiful – the idea that these things are waiting for their owners.”</p>
<p>“I understand that vintage is not everyone’s cup of tea – there are people who don’t want to pay for something old. They want new things,” she said.</p>
<p>However, she urged consumers to be open to alternative sources of shopping instead of constantly pursuing new things.</p>
<p>“Buy something that has already been produced. Often you will find that the quality is better than many new items,” she said. </p>
<p>“Look for the experience, not things – the material, craftsmanship and story behind the object; not just newness.”</p>
<p>With conscious consumption, Wong reckoned retail therapy need not burden the earth with more junk. </p>
<p>“If we shop in a responsible way to our environment, we can instead save 'junk' and still enjoy well-made things,” she said. </p>
<p>By My Old School is at Block 115A, #03-24 Commonwealth Drive. It is open only by appointment at the moment. Call 9879 2088 or contact the shop via Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/Bymyoldschool/</p>

<p>It is almost 100 days after Singapore welcomed its first giant panda cub, Kai Kai and Jia Jia’s baby. He turns 100 days old on Sunday (Nov 21) – and soon, the public can look forward to his public debut, with a brand new name.</p>
<p>Currently weighing just over 6kg and measuring 67cm, the panda cub has grown out his baby teeth and developed crawl-walking skills that let him roam independently. </p>
<p>The cub’s gender was revealed back in September this year, as members of the public were invited to submit name suggestions. </p>
<p>Now, Singaporeans can look forward to the cub’s name-reveal sometime in December. </p>
<p>“We would like to thank the public for their help in the naming process, which received more than 64,000 votes,” said Mandai Wildlife Group’s Group CEO, Mike Barclay. </p>
<p>Born on Aug 14, Kai Kai and Jia Jia’s baby is <a>set to return to China</a> when he reaches full independence in about two years. Following which, he will join the rest of China’s panda breeding population. </p>

<h1> How to spend a wellness-inspired weekend outdoors in Hong Kong: Beaches, Lantau island and more </h1>
<div> <p>Wellness and yoga advocate Almen Wong of Pure Group reveals her 48-hour weekend itinerary to get her Om on in bustling Hong Kong.</p> <p>In partnership with Hong Kong Tourism Board.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Karen Tee </a> </div> </div>
<p>Cosmopolitan and buzzy, Hong Kong has long been a travel magnet for its rich gastronomic and nightlife scene, excellent shopping options and vibrant, multicultural population. But there is more to this city of skyscrapers, too. </p>
<p>Almen Wong, the co-founder of Pure Group and a yoga instructor with 20 years of experience, has noticed how the city is increasingly becoming more focused on wellness and sustainability. </p>
<p>“For example, I try to lead by example by talking about the environment when I teach and I carry my own utensils everywhere I go.”</p>
<p>9am: I normally start my weekends with breakfast at home. But on occasion, I like to pamper myself with a huge breakfast buffet. The sumptuous spread at JW Marriott Hotel Hong Kong's JW Cafe and the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong's Grand Cafe are my go-tos.</p>
<p>If you’re one for wining and dining to the sunset, Limewood is a barbecue and seafood restaurant with tropical vibes and Sip Song has good Thai food. For Cantonese cuisine, check out Meen and Rice, which serves modern versions of local food.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>SUNDAY</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>To me, the hike is like a moving meditation session. I get very immersed in the environment, listening to the sound of nature, instead of music.</p>

<h1> What Singaporeans planning an Australian holiday can expect: ‘We’re waiting with open arms’ </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Melissa Stewart </a> </div> </div>
<p>Australia, with its diverse landscapes, abundant wildlife, rich culture and more, has long been a popular tourist destination for Singaporeans. There’s something for everyone, regardless of taste, travel budget or age. </p>
<p>But for two years since the COVID-19 pandemic, it shut its international borders in order to fight the outbreak, like many other countries worldwide. In fact, its border restrictions were one of the strictest in the world. </p>
<p>That changed on Nov 21, when the country reopened to welcome fully vaccinated Singaporeans for quarantine-free travel. Singapore was the second country that Australia has opened up to, after New Zealand. </p>
<p>“Singapore is an important market for us. It’s our sixth largest market,” said Phillipa Harrison, managing director of Tourism Australia (TA). “But the great thing about the Singapore market is that you come back, and you come back often.” </p>
<p>Prior to the launch of the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) with Singapore, Harrison shared that it has been a “challenging time” for the tourism industry in the country. </p>
<p>WELCOMING THE OLD, RINGING IN THE NEW</p>
<p>Throughout the country, there have been numerous new hotel and FB openings as well. </p>
<p>“In Sydney, my favourite thing to do on the weekends is to go on a coastal walk. Walking along the ocean, smelling the ocean air and then going for brunch at one of the cafes, that’s a quintessential Sydney thing to do,” Harrison continued. </p>
<p>CATERING TO NEW TRAVEL TRENDS</p>
<p>Of course, much has changed in the tourism landscape since pandemic lockdowns, with new travel trends emerging. </p>
<p>For example, now that travellers have the ability to work from anywhere in the world, “a lot of our online travel agents are saying that they are experiencing requests for much, much longer stays”, Harrison said. </p>
<div> <div><p>“Our definition of luxury is a little bit different from having butlers and gold taps. Our luxury is about a sense of place and really having the rare opportunity to be in these beautiful places,” Harrison added. </p></div> </div>
<p>For those planning a holiday in Australia, several questions may come to mind. What are restrictions like in the country at the moment? Is life back to normal? </p>
<p>Travellers should note, however, that different states have different restrictions and requirements, including different apps to download. </p>
<p>For Singaporeans who embark on a holiday to Australia, Harrison hopes that they return with a “sense of wellbeing”. </p>
<p>“We’re waiting with open arms to welcome Singaporeans back to Australia, and (the country) is yours to explore,” she added. </p>

<h1> The Singapore Zoo's first-ever 'glampcation', extended until May 2022, is now sold out </h1>
<div> <p>Within two days of launching its debut outdoor "staycation in the wild", Mandai Wildlife Group added six more weeks of slots, until mid May 2022 – all were snapped up.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>When Singapore Zoo announced its first-ever outdoor dome tent experience called Staycation in the Wild, on Thursday (Dec 2), the two-day-one-night experience was slated to run from Dec 16 this year to March 19 next year.</p>
<p>Demand for this unique "glampcation" was so high that the Zoo extended its run-time, adding in new slots from April 1 to May 15 next year. </p>
<p>But the additional slots were also quickly snapped up. Mandai Wildlife Group confirmed on Saturday morning (Dec 4), that bookings for Staycation in the Wild are full. </p>
<p>Highlights include a guided tour of the Wild Africa section, a night walk at Rainforest Lumina, and waking up next to Upper Seletar Reservoir for a hearty breakfast at the Forest Lodge. </p>
<div> <div><p>We’re not surprised by the extension and sellout reaction, seeing that a similar one, Staycation with the Manatees, which launched in December last year at River Wonders (formerly River Safari), was sold out within hours. </p></div> </div>
<p>The indoor glamping option (from S$999 per tent) is also available this year, for the same period as the Zoo's Staycation in the Wild. Availability has also been extended, to June 5, 2022. </p>
<p>As of this morning, bookings for Staycation with the Manatees, from Dec 21 to Feb 22 are sold out, but there are still slots left from March to June 2022.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> From killer heatwaves to floods, climate change worsened weather extremes in 2021 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Many of these events were exacerbated by climate change. Scientists say there are more to come – and worse – as the Earth's atmosphere continues to warm through the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>Here are some of the events Reuters witnessed over the past year:</p>
<p>A blistering cold spell hit normally warm Texas, killing 125 people in the state and leaving millions without power in freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Scientists have not reached a conclusion on whether climate change caused the extreme weather, but the warming of the Arctic is causing more unpredictable weather around the globe.</p>
<p>Beijing's sky turned orange and flights were grounded during the Chinese capital's worst sandstorm in a decade.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the western United States was gripped by a drought that emerged in early 2020. Farmers abandoned crops, officials announced emergency measures, and the Hoover Dam reservoir hit an all-time low.</p>
<p>By September, the US government confirmed that over the prior 20 months, the Southwest experienced the lowest precipitation in over a century, and it linked the drought to climate change.</p>
<p>Hundreds died during a record-smashing heatwave in the US and Canadian Pacific Northwest, which scientists concluded would have been "virtually impossible" without climate change.</p>
<p>Over several days, power lines melted and roads buckled. Cities, struggling to cope with the heat, opened cooling centers to protect their residents. During the heatwave, Portland, Oregon, hit an all-time record high of 46.7 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Catastrophic flooding killed more than 300 people in central <a>China's Henan province</a> when a year's worth of rain fell in just three days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Europe, nearly 200 people died as torrential rains soaked Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Scientists concluded that climate change had made the floods 20 per cent more likely to occur.</p>
<p>A record heatwave and drought in the US West gave rise to two massive wildfires that tore through California and Oregon and were among the largest in the history of both states.</p>
<p>Scientists say both the growing frequency and the intensity of wildfires are largely attributable to prolonged drought and increasing bouts of excessive heat from climate change.</p>
<p>Large parts of South America are suffering from a prolonged drought. While Chile is enduring a decade-long megadrought linked to global warming, this year Brazil saw one of its driest years in a century.</p>
<p>In Argentina, the Parana, South America's second-longest river, fell to its lowest level since 1944.</p>
<p>Around the globe, heatwaves are becoming both more frequent and more severe.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, a hot and dry summer fanned intense blazes that forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes in Algeria, Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>The fires, which killed two people in Greece and at least 65 in Algeria, struck amid an intense heatwave, with some places in Greece recording temperatures of more than 46 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>In late August, nearly all the world's mountain glaciers are retreating due to global warming. In the Alps, Swiss resort employees laid protective blankets over one of Mount Titlis's glaciers during the summer months to preserve what ice is left.</p>
<p>Switzerland already has lost 500 of its glaciers, and could lose 90 per cent of the 1,500 that remain by the end of the century if global emissions continue to rise, the government said.</p>
<p>Hurricane Ida, which hit Louisiana as a Category 4 storm, killed nearly 100 people in the United States and caused an estimated US$64 billion in damage, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.</p>
<p>As the remnants of Ida moved inland, the heavy rains created flash flooding across the densely populated Northeast, vastly increasing the storm's death toll.</p>
<p>Climate change is strengthening hurricanes, while also causing them to linger longer over land – dumping more rain on an area before moving on. Studies also suggest these storms are becoming more frequent in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>Infrastructure and homes in Russia are increasingly in peril as underground permafrost melts and deforms the land underneath them.</p>
<p>Permafrost was once a stable construction base, in some regions staying frozen as far back as the last Ice Age. But rising global temperatures threaten the layer of ice, soil, rocks, sand and organic matter.</p>

<h1> We visited K-drama locations in Seoul and Incheon: Squid Game, Itaewon Class and Hotel Del Luna </h1>
<p>Binge-watched a lot of K-dramas during the pandemic? You can finally visit the actual shoot locations of some popular TV series – and their accompanying attractions – that CNA Lifestyle found.</p>
<p>In partnership with Korea Tourism Organization.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>PARADISE CITY (HOTEL DEL LUNA)</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Several scenes from the series that starred IU and Yeo Jin-goo were shot at Paradise City in Incheon, including the Willy Wonka chocolate factory-like amusement park featured in Episode 8. Yes, that fantastical interior does exist in real life. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>In pre-pandemic times, Chroma, a most unusually designed nightclub, has staged performances by global artistes such as DJ Afrojack and Steve Aoki.</p> <p>WOLMI THEME PARK (SQUID GAME, DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN)</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>In one short scene in Episode 2 of Squid Game, main antagonist Jang Deok-su was seen meeting one of his criminal underlings at Wolmi Theme Park before he got sold out to the casino goons he owed money to. </p>
<p>In reality, Wolmi Theme Park (formerly known as My Land), which sits on Wolmido Island in Incheon, was rather quiet when we visited on a weekday in the late afternoon. </p>
<p>G GUESTHOUSE (ITAEWON CLASS)</p>
<p>NOKSAPYEONG BRIDGE (ITAEWON CLASS)</p>
<p>This is the bridge that main character Park Saeroyi often went to in Itaewon Class, and the same spot where Jo ran into him after being thrown out of her home by her mother. </p>
<p>It was outside this real-life historical house where Kim Shin’s teary, emotional scene in Episode 13 was shot. Grim Reaper revealed to Kim right at this door that his bride Ji Eun-tak was due to die in a week’s time. </p>
<p>SONGDO CENTRAL PARK (SISYPHUS: THE MYTH)</p>
<p>The beautiful Songdo Central Park in real life is the perfect foil to Kang's emotional landscape – and is home to some very prime estate (as much as S$10.9 million an apartment) this side of Incheon. </p>
<p>Best experienced on foot following the man-made waterway or on a water taxi ride, where you'll chance upon the traditional-looking Songdo Hanok Village that consists of Hollys Coffee, a hotel, restaurants and shops.</p>

<h1> British tourists head to snowy Lapland seeking Santa Claus </h1>
<div> <p>The city of Rovaniemi in Lapland is the official hometown of Santa Claus, its tourism website says, with attractions that include a Santa Claus village and trips inside the Arctic Circle.</p> </div>
<p>Santa Claus and heavy snow falls are attracting British tourists back to Lapland, bolstering Finland's tourism industry that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Most of the tourists coming to Lapland over Christmas are from Britain, Sanna Karkkainen managing director of Rovaniemi Tourism and Marketing told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The first British charters come in mid-November and for them the focus of the trip is to meet Santa," Karkkainen said.</p>
<p>The city of Rovaniemi in Lapland is the official hometown of Santa Claus, its tourism website says, with attractions that include a Santa Claus village and trips inside the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>Karkkainen said that the discovery of the new Omicron variant had not caused cancellations like rising case rates and Finland's strict travel restrictions did last year.</p>
<p>Britain has recently tightened rules for people coming back into the country, requiring them to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test and another test on arrival in England, despite their vaccination status.</p>
<p>Finnish airport group Finavia and tourist agency Visit Rovaniemi both said there had been no cancellations.</p>
<p>Finavia said the number of charter flights for this year's Christmas season was close to 90 per cent of what it was in the 2019 season.</p>
<p>Finland currently requires tourists to present proof of vaccination, a negative test result or having recovered from COVID-19 within the past six months.</p>
<p>Karkkainen says that while most tourists still come from the United Kingdom, there are an increasing number of visitors from France and Italy.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic in December 2019, Lapland's tourism industry saw 724 charter flights land in its four northernmost airports, with Kittila and Rovaniemi being the most popular destinations, Finavia said.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Lapland had 152,000 visitors and accommodation sales totalled 39.3 million euros (S$60.6 million), travel research company TAK said.</p>
<p>But the pandemic stopped 98 per cent of visitors and 79 per cent of accommodation sales, according to TAK statistics.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, Finnish travel exports were growing by 12 per cent annually and the industry accounted for 2.7 per cent of the Finnish gross domestic product, a 2020 report by the Finnish ministry of economic affairs said.</p>

<h1> We staycay-ed at a Mongolian yurt in Yishun with 'wilderness survival' activities </h1>
<div> <p>Can camping in the great outdoors of Yishun really transport you to an exotic faraway country? And what about the rats, bats, snakes and mozzies? Here's how our “Magical Mongolia” experience went.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>Still, when you lay eyes on a full-on Mongolian yurt sitting in the middle of a plot of overgrown land in the Yishun-Mandai area, you do wonder if you need new glasses.</p>
<p>Popular with families as well as those who love the outdoors, the two-day-one-night programme, which offers “wilderness survival” activities like how to chop wood, pitch tents and “the art of firecraft”, is currently booked out until December.</p>
<p>The programme is run in line with the current safe management measures, with each experience kept to a maximum of four participants and the maximum number of people in each group capped at two (not applicable to families from the same household).</p>
<p>Not having been to Mongolia, though, I could only assess the authenticity of the experience based on how un-Yishun it felt.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that once you arrive at the yurt, decked out with colourful flags, right by a little lily-padded pond and engulfed by greenery, you know you’re not in Kansas any more.</p>
<p>It was rainy on my first day, so in the evening, after the weather had cleared up, Tay and his partner, Kavita Kaur, welcomed me by putting a pot of pasta onto the portable stove to boil.</p>
<p>Tay, who’s led expeditions all over Mongolia as well as in places like Kazakhstan and India, has spent so much time in Mongolia that “after more than 20 visits, you stop counting”.</p>
<p>His mission is to help people experience the essence of the country, which he says can be summed up in two words: “True freedom”.</p>
<p>EVERYBODY YURTS SOMETIMES</p>
<p>Chopping up wood for fuel, practising skills with axes and saws, and starting a campfire around which you can sit and toast your marshmallows are all the things that Tay enjoys sharing with his guests as part of the package he offers.</p>
<p>As I came to find out, it helps to think of this less as experiencing what it’s like to be in Mongolia and more as sharing in Tay and Kavita’s enthusiasm, hospitality and love for the country. </p>
<p>After dinner, we settled in for movie night under the stars, with a projector and screen, and Tay shared some clips of his Mongolian expeditions.</p>
<p>He and Kavita then went home, leaving us all alone in the middle of nowhere. Good thing there was a lock on the yurt’s door.</p>
<p>Getting ready for bed, though, I was preoccupied with another security issue: Rodents. What if a rat infiltrated the yurt and decided it wanted to share my bed in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>But the sun rose the next morning and lo, there had been no vermin-related encounters, although one little green frog did hop right up to the yurt and try his darnedest to gain entry.</p>
<p>And I learned that even if you think you have an adequate arsenal of bug spray for the tropical wilds of Singapore – well, you’re wrong.</p>

<h1> Glamping with manatees: What it's like to sleep over with the aquatic giants </h1>
<div> <p>CNA Lifestyle's May Seah shared a bedroom, so to speak, with the placidly charming animals at the River Safari's Glamping with the Manatees experience, which is back from Mar 13 to 20.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>I can't say I’d always wanted to spend the night with a manatee, but when I was invited to pack my bag and go glamping with them, it immediately became clear that this was the one thing that had been missing from my life.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Going on a Zoom date with Moe the capybara from Singapore's River Safari</a></h3>
<p>Sleeping in a tent inside the exhibit, pitched right up next to the huge aquarium wall, turned out to be as magical an experience as it sounded.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>Manatees wake early – about 6am – which meant I opened my tent flaps after a night of sleep to a transfixing scene of playful creatures diving, floating and rolling, enjoying their morning calisthenics.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>These precious few hours of early-morning quiet, when it’s just you and a herd of floating manatees in total privacy, make for an experience not soon forgotten.</p>

<p>GLAMPING: YES, THERE’S AIRCON</p>
<p>The best part of the River Safari’s two-day-one-night Glamping with the Manatees programme, if you ask me, is that you get to go “camping” without actually having to experience the honest-to-goodness wilderness. </p>
<p>Yup, I like nature, but I like it entry-level, thank you.</p>
<p>Manatees go to sleep at night just like we do, and they snooze near the surface of the water because they need to come up for air every 15 minutes or so. So, you can retire peacefully into your tent without fearing that you’ll miss too much action.</p>
<p>Make sure to wake early, though, so you can sit in the doorway of the fairy-lit tent and watch the animals at their most active.</p>
<p>The photo-worthy tents will of course be the highlight of the trip, and there’ll be no sense of deprivation there, to say the least.</p>
<p>But there’s an action-packed programme that takes you through the River Safari too, which families with children in particular will appreciate.</p>
<p>In the company of friendly and knowledgeable guides, we learned all sorts of things about manatees. For example, these speed bump-shaped mammals may be round and rotund, but they actually have very little blubber.</p>
<p>And at the moment, there are three manatee babies, all born last August. If you’re lucky, you might see them suckling at their mothers’ teats, located under their flippers.</p>
<p>We got to prepare a snack of sweet potato leaves for them, as well as make fish food balls to toss to the massive arapaima fish that share the aquarium.</p>
<p>It’s not all about the manatees, though. The glamping experience also packs in an animal show, for which seats were reserved so we could skip the queue; and an exclusive session with a keeper in the squirrel monkeys’ and saki monkeys’ enclosure.</p>
<p>I was extremely chuffed when I got to pet a pelican.</p>
<p>The “mystery animal meet-and-greet” segment kept us in suspense but didn’t disappoint: When the giant white-plumed, web-footed bird sauntered in through the door, everyone lost it.</p>
<p>I mean, he did angle his beak towards me and open it in a manner that gave the impression that he was trying to eat my head. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I don’t think there are very many people in the world who can say they’ve played catch with a pelican – or spent the night sleeping with manatees, for that matter.</p>
