<div><p>Supreme Court says Texas abortion providers may proceed with challenge of six-week ban, leaves law in effect for now</p></div>
<div><div><p>The move by the state is “a transparent attempt to forestall relief,” abortion providers told Gorsuch in a filing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Supreme Court’s four dissenters in the case seemed to believe that U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman would get the lawsuit quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hearron said after Gorsuch’s decision that Texas is “determined to stop the plaintiffs from getting any relief in even the sliver of the case that is left.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With its decision to send the case back to the 5th Circuit and not the district court, he added, the Supreme Court “has let Texas nullify constitutional rights and upend our system of justice.”</p></div></div>
<p>Texas said in its filing to the court that returning the case to the appeals court is normal after a decision and that it was the challengers asking the court for unusual relief. The state opposed the effort to waive the usual 25-day delay.</p>
<div><div><p>The complicated legal wrangling is pretty much the point of the Texas law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The structure was intentional, to make it difficult procedurally for federal judges to stop the law before it took effect, even though its terms violate the Supreme Court’s precedents.</p></div></div>
<a>Mississippi law</a> that mostly bans the procedure after 15 weeks into pregnancy. At oral argument in that case earlier this month, the court’s conservative justices seemed open to overturning
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the nearly 50-year-old decision guaranteeing a fundamental right to abortion.
<div><div><p>The court’s Dec. 10 decision a week later in the Texas case said a lawsuit could continue against a small group of Texas licensing officials who govern doctors and others and could have a role in enforcing the law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Texas has seized upon that language and says the Texas Supreme Court should decide whether the officials have the power the U.S. Supreme Court presumed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But <a>the decision from Judge David Peeples</a> did not halt enforcement of the law and did not comprehensively resolve the case, some aspects of which are now on review before an intermediate appeals court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Supreme Court’s decision, she said, “threw out the most promising avenue to relief and full restoration of abortion access in Texas.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Biden administration’s coronavirus protection requirements intended to persuade millions of health-care and other workers to get vaccinated are taking center stage at the Supreme Court.</p></div></div>
<p>And the administration itself is asking the court to lift lower-court decisions that have blocked a vaccine mandate for health-care workers in facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds. That implicates about 17 million workers.</p>
<div><div><p>The court has called for additional briefing in those cases by Dec. 30, which suggests rulings early in the new year.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Appeals of the OSHA requirement were filed in virtually every regional court in the country and consolidated for the 6th Circuit panel to consider.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judge Jane B. Stranch said Congress intended for OSHA to be able to impose emergency temporary standards in times of great peril.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Vaccination and medical examinations are both tools that OSHA has historically employed to contain illness in the workplace,” wrote Stranch, a nominee of President Barack Obama.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The new requirement “is not a novel expansion of OSHA’s power; it is an existing application of authority to a novel and dangerous worldwide pandemic.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Both policies have been at least partially blocked from going into effect by lower courts after challenges from Republican-led states, and from business and religious coalitions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is highly unusual for the justices to schedule such hearings on emergency requests. Both will be considered Jan. 7, the Friday before the court was to resume its normal schedule of oral arguments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the cases involves a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that requires <a>employers with 100 or more workers</a> to have staff vaccinated or tested on a regular basis. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other is from the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, and it requires vaccination for workers at facilities that receive federal funds tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House said Wednesday evening that it is “confident in the legal authority for both policies and [the Department of Justice] will vigorously defend both at the Supreme Court.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>More than half the states and coalitions of business and religious groups are asking the justices for emergency action to block the OSHA rules, which would cover an estimated 80 million workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And the Biden administration asked the court to intervene to lift lower-court decisions that have blocked a vaccine mandate for what is estimated to be <a>about 17 million health-care workers</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The court had called for additional briefing in those cases by Dec. 30. Under its normal procedures, the justices would then make a decision about whether to block or allow the policies while litigation continued.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Later Thursday, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the House Jan. 6 committee, asked the court to expedite its consideration of Trump’s request.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Delay would inflict a serious injury on the Select Committee and the public by interfering with this mandate,” he added, suggesting the justices decide by Jan. 14.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A district court judge in Washington disagreed in a November ruling, and the D.C. Circuit quickly affirmed the decision earlier this month.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump’s legal strategy tested in fight with Congress over Jan. 6 records</p></div>
<div><div><p>The panel delayed implementation of its order so Trump could go to the Supreme Court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump told the court Thursday that Democrats are simply looking for information to discredit a “political foe,” not for legitimate legislative interests.</p></div></div>
<p>The Supreme Court should preserve its ability to “review this case not to benefit this ‘particular President,’ but for the benefit of ‘the Presidency itself,’ ” Binnall wrote, echoing a past court decision.</p>

<div><div><p>Millett, like Chutkan nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, said Trump had not been specific about the harm that would come from turning over the requested information.</p></div></div>
<p>“Mr. Trump has made no record nor even hinted to this court what context or information has been overlooked or what information could override President Biden’s calculus,” she wrote. “We cannot just presume it.”</p>

<div><div><p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. acknowledged in a report released Friday that the federal judiciary has work to do in ensuring that judges live up to their ethical responsibilities and in creating a harassment-free workplace.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he politely told Congress it is work that judges can do on their own.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden Supreme Court commission notes support for term limits</p></div>
<div><div><p>But he said the judiciary’s independence is best maintained by remaining free of interference from the political branches.</p></div></div>
<p>“The Judiciary’s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co-equal branch of government,” Roberts wrote.</p>
<div><p>Roberts referred to articles in the Wall Street Journal that said “between 2010 and 2018, 131 federal judges participated in a total of 685 matters involving companies in which they or their families owned shares of stock.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said that was “inconsistent” with a federal ethics statute that requires a judge to recuse in any matter in which he or she knows of a personal financial interest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let me be crystal clear: the Judiciary takes this matter seriously,” Roberts wrote. “We expect judges to adhere to the highest standards, and those judges violated an ethics rule.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But, he said, in context, that meant the judiciary had a “99.97% compliance rate.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Roberts defends colleagues on recusal issues</p></div>
<div><div><p>Roberts did not address the view of some that judges and justices should avoid stock ownership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Nevertheless, new protections could help ensure that every court employee enjoys a workplace free from incivility and disrespect,” Roberts wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Court filing alleges continuing harassment in the judiciary</span></p></div>
<div><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation last summer that would establish whistleblower protections for judiciary employees and create a special counsel to investigate and report on misconduct complaints within the system.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I appreciate that Members of Congress have expressed ongoing concerns on this important matter, and the Judicial Conference and its committees remain fully engaged,” Roberts wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Roberts likes to lace his annual reports with history lessons, and this year’s reinforced his larger point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He wrote about William Howard Taft, who served as president from 1909 to 1913, and then was chosen by President Warren G. Harding as chief justice 100 years ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He knew well how to navigate the halls of Congress,” Roberts wrote, and “threw his considerable political heft into creating the mechanisms of self-governance for federal courts across the country.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ann E. Marimow</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Robert Barnes</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>vaccine policies</a> affecting nearly 100 million workers. Most already have made the choice to be vaccinated, but Biden has said the numbers are not good enough.
<div><div><p>One measure requires large private companies to implement a vaccination requirement or impose a masking and weekly testing regimen. The second applies to health-care workers at facilities that receive certain federal funding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Together, <a>the cases test a signature aspect of the White House’s response to the pandemic</a> that has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s an overview of the cases, the history and the issues that the justices will consider Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Can the U.S. government force private companies and health-care facilities to require vaccinations for their workers?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has never before tried to impose a vaccine-or-test policy on U.S. companies and their workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employers must provide paid time off to get vaccinated, but they are not required to pay for coronavirus testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rules were set to take effect Jan. 4, but OSHA pushed back the date in response to the litigation and said it would not immediately issue citations for those not in compliance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other policy from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires vaccinations for more than 17 million health-care workers at 76,000 facilities that receive federal money tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who is challenging the vaccination policies and why?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Any delay, according to the Biden administration, will “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vaccine mandate for health-care workers, opponents say, is “plainly unlawful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Have workplace safety requirements previously been issued on an emergency basis?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>OSHA, the federal safety agency, has used its <a>emergency authority infrequently</a> after mixed results in court in the 1970s and ’80s in response to rules to regulate exposure to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The term “grave danger” is not defined in statute, and courts also have not provided clear guidance about the term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hasn’t the Supreme Court upheld vaccination requirements for college campuses and those imposed by local officials?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, the justices have generally been supportive of vaccination requirements by local governments and universities. For instance, it allowed New York and Maine to mandate vaccinations for their health-care workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the court has also been skeptical when it comes to federal agency power generally, and with respect to the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The justices, for instance, rejected an eviction moratorium — first imposed by the Trump administration and extended by Biden — because it said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>What have lower courts said about Biden’s policies?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They are divided.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the administration announced the rules for private companies in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked enforcement of the policy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But lawsuits sprung up around the nation and were consolidated for review by a different court. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit dissolved the 5th Circuit’s stay, saying the rules could go into effect.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Opponents then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower courts also were divided on the health-care worker mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit dismissed a request from Florida to stop the requirement. But a district judge in Missouri stopped the rules, and the 5th Circuit agreed with a challenge from Louisiana.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the Supreme Court, a coalition of Republican-led states said the rules should be blocked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Biden administration said its authority is clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What about the Supreme Court’s own coronavirus policies for the justices and court visitors? </b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The courthouse has been closed to the public since March 2020. All nine justices have been vaccinated and received boosters. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had covid before she was confirmed to the high court in September 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After returning to in-person oral arguments this past fall, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh participated in some from home after he tested positive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The justices have not required lawyers arguing cases and credentialed reporters observing the proceedings to be vaccinated. But they must have received negative test results and be masked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The health-care worker cases are <i>Biden v. Missouri </i>and<i> Becerra v. Louisiana</i>. The OSHA cases are <i>National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor </i>and<i> Ohio v. Department of Labor</i>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Pentagon is updating its personnel policies to address a concerning rise of extremism within the military and hold service members accountable for the views they express on social media, officials said Monday.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>or outside law enforcement agencies to report concerning behavior.
<div><p>Seeking to combat extremists in ranks, the military struggles to answer a basic question: How many are there?</p></div>
<div><div><p>The prohibited actions — particularly online — are strict. Now, even clicking “like” on a social media post espousing extremist views can get a service member into trouble.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>though the Defense Department is “not actively screening” troops’ social media and intends to address such activities only “as an incident comes to light,”
<b> </b>an official told reporters during a telephone briefing ahead of Kirby’s news conference at the Pentagon.
<div><div><p>The expectation, officials said, is that military personnel will expose their colleagues who run afoul of the rules.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington Post investigation: The Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol was neither a spontaneous act nor an isolated event</p></div>
<div><div><p>It is unclear, however, how broadly the revamped policies will be enforced — or whether they will change the Pentagon’s understanding of how significant the problem is.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last week, a consortium at the University of Maryland <a>released a report</a> showing that since 1990, 458 crimes tied to extremism involved veterans or active-duty U.S. troops.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>THE CAPITOL RIOT</div><div><div>HAND CURATED</div></div></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Alex Horton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 20, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal authorities have accused Hale-Cusanelli of illegally entering the Capitol, using hand and arm signals to advance rioters forward and harassing police officers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This was a knee-jerk reaction to the charges,” the attorney said, adding that he intends to help Hale-Cusanelli fight the Army’s decision and have him reinstated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Army officials declined to comment on Hale-Cusanelli’s discharge, citing privacy laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both men have pleaded not guilty.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A soldier charged in the Capitol riot enlisted months after FBI interviews</p></div>
<div><div><p>Crisp declined to address the accusations before his client’s trial, which is scheduled for May, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hale-Cusanelli’s colleagues avoided reporting his conduct because they were afraid of how he may react, prosecutors said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His employer at the time, HBC Management, could not be reached for comment about his employment status. Court documents say he lost access to the Navy base.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why service members charged in the Capitol riot are staying in uniform — for now</p></div>
<div><div><p>Lt. Col. Simon Flake, a spokesman for the Army Reserve, said military leaders “are monitoring the ongoing civilian proceedings” involving Sahady and “will make further decisions at the appropriate time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Post-riot effort to tackle extremism in the military largely overlooks veterans </a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops have not yet complied with vaccine mandate as deadlines near</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The involvement of individuals with military links follows several incidents in which troops have espoused support for racist or extremist movements on social media or to their peers.</p></div></div>
<a>racial discrimination</a>, sexual assault and other internal scourges that officials say harm troops, threaten military values and damage recruitment and retention.
<div><div><h3><div>A lack of clear data</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>First among the challenges for Austin and his aides is the lack of centralized means of documenting and tracking incidence of extremism in military units.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But official statistics provide only a fragmentary picture. Last month, Pentagon officials said the FBI had informed them about 68 domestic extremism cases in 2020 involving current or former troops. Little other data exists.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Those lesser infractions, which can result in verbal rebukes or administrative actions, like a reduction in rank, are typically handled by commanders and are not required to be reported up through the chain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No one has ever asked us to track this in that way,” said one defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe internal challenges.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A decentralized system</div></h3></div></div>
<a>review</a> of policies surrounding extremism. Among the issues it will consider is whether the military needs to alter its vast, decentralized system for screening troops and recruits.
<div><div><p>Some extremism experts say the military’s screening procedures for recruits are insufficient.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Now that we have an administration that is taking this problem seriously, we must take action,” Speier said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Early detection</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another problem for the Pentagon is deciding which of the movements proliferating online are extremist and how involved service members must be before they are counseled, disciplined or removed from the armed service.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The law requires the Pentagon to include questions about antisemitism, racism and white supremacy in its annual workplace climate survey, potentially showing how many service members have encountered racists and extremists in the ranks.</p></div>
<p>Some experts have suggested the military should create deradicalization programs for service members, many of whom are in their teens when they enter the military. That would give commanders tools to potentially avert a more serious problem.</p>
<div><div><p>“What if someone is starting to flirt with these things?” Beirich said. “What do you do before they go full-bore on this?”</p></div></div>

<b/>setbacks, coupled with resistance

<div><div><p>The forces behind Gillibrand’s legislation are blunt in their assessment of the baseline changes contained in the House’s legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Our reform has the bipartisan support of 66 senators and 220 House members,” Gillibrand said. “The only way it does not become law in the NDAA is if a handful of powerful men rip it out behind closed doors.”</p></div>
<div><p>Pentagon leaders have opposed plans overhauling the military system for trying sexual assault for years. Has the time come for change?</p></div>
<p>The breakdown has occurred over two main points: how many types of offenses should fall under the new special prosecutor’s purview and who, ultimately, is responsible for convening the courts-martial that will hear the cases at trial.</p>
<div><p><span>In Congress, momentum grows behind effort to overhaul military handling of sex crimes</span></p></div>
<b> </b>the special prosecutor’s “binding” charging decisions will be enough to prevent cases from being drawn out. Instead,
<b> </b>they want to create an entirely separate courts-martial convening authority, though it would be left to the individual service chiefs — the generals and admirals who lead the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard
<b> — </b>to determine what that should look like.
<div><p>Commanders, Speier added, would have “no meaningful role” in convening the courts-martial — and would be subject to discipline themselves if they don’t heed the special prosecutor’s charging decisions.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But such assurances have failed to mollify Gillibrand and many minorities in Congress, who worry that lawmakers are missing an opportunity to make necessary change.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Pentagon is updating its personnel policies to address a concerning rise of extremism within the military and hold service members accountable for the views they express on social media, officials said Monday.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>or outside law enforcement agencies to report concerning behavior.
<div><p>Seeking to combat extremists in ranks, the military struggles to answer a basic question: How many are there?</p></div>
<div><div><p>The prohibited actions — particularly online — are strict. Now, even clicking “like” on a social media post espousing extremist views can get a service member into trouble.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>though the Defense Department is “not actively screening” troops’ social media and intends to address such activities only “as an incident comes to light,”
<b> </b>an official told reporters during a telephone briefing ahead of Kirby’s news conference at the Pentagon.
<div><div><p>The expectation, officials said, is that military personnel will expose their colleagues who run afoul of the rules.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington Post investigation: The Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol was neither a spontaneous act nor an isolated event</p></div>
<div><div><p>It is unclear, however, how broadly the revamped policies will be enforced — or whether they will change the Pentagon’s understanding of how significant the problem is.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last week, a consortium at the University of Maryland <a>released a report</a> showing that since 1990, 458 crimes tied to extremism involved veterans or active-duty U.S. troops.</p></div></div>

<p>Wisconsin National Guard soldier Abram Markofski, who pleaded guilty to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, was sentenced Dec. 10 to two years of probation and a $1,500 fine. Markofski is still serving as a Guard soldier.</p>

<div><div><p>At least 55 military veterans were federally charged in the riot, ranging from former privates who served for short periods to retired lieutenant colonels with full careers in uniform.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Compounding the challenge is a lack of continuity between the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has no dedicated program to combat extremism among former military members and has resisted calls to establish one.</p></div>
