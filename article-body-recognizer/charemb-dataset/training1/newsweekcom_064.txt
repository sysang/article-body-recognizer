<div> Tech Science Space <a>Solar system</a></div>
<p>Already the brightest comet of 2021, Comet Leonard is undergoing outbursts of light, with the latest occurring on Monday. The comet increased in brightness by 10 times in its latest outburst, according to Spaceweather.com.</p>
<p>Comet Leonard, labeled by some as the "Christmas comet" as a result of its timing, is currently making its way towards the sun and, like most comets, is gradually brightening as it does so.</p>
<p>But, Comet Leonard, named after the astronomer who discovered it in January 2021 Greg Leonard, a senior researcher at the University of Arizona, is also undergoing periodic outbursts of brightness.</p>
<p>The first reports of the comet, officially designated C/2021 A1, undergoing such an outburst came in a week ago on December 13. When this was repeated on December 20, many astronomers and astrophotographers were able to capture the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Tel Lekastas, a mathematician and keen astrophotographer with a passion for capturing images of comets, posted images of the December 20 outburst to his <a>Twitter</a> feed.</p>
<a>outer edges</a> of the solar system, is likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime chance that is rapidly running out for astronomers and stargazers. The comet will make its closest approach to
<a>the sun</a> on January 3, at which point it will be 57.2 million miles from our star. After that, the comet will pass out of view from our vantage point on Earth.
<p>The chances of a return visit are diminishingly small. Even if the intense heat and radiation from the sun doesn't cause Comet Leonard to fragment further, its discoverer warns that it may be headed out of our cosmic neighborhood for good.</p>
