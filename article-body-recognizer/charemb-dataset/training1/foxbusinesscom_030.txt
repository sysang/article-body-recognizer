<h1>New Jersey Gov. Murphy blasted for Costa Rica travel as COVID-19 omicron variant surges</h1>
<a>New Jersey</a> Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is catching heat for taking an eight-day Christmas vacation in Costa Rica despite the State Department warning travelers to

<a>COVID-19</a> and as the case count surges in his own state.

<p>Murphy was asked last week about whether the trip was appropriate, given that his state is seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases with a seven-day-average case count of 14,405.</p>
<p>"We’re going to spend some time together as a family," the governor responded, NJ.com reported. "Please God, we need that."</p>
<a>New Jersey</a> Gov. Chris Christie, for
<a>setting the "wrong message"</a> after jetting off to Italy for a 10-day vacation as the delta variant of the
<a>coronavirus </a>surged in the state.
<p>When the coronavirus first started to rage across the country in March 2020, Murphy defended keeping armed guards for his personal protection while closing "non-essential" gun shops.</p>
<p>"It is what it is," he said at the time.</p>
<a>attending a George Floyd protest</a>, saying he "can’t imagine what it would look like if we told people, ‘You have to ignore systemic racism, just stay inside.'" He lifted his stay-at-home orders just two days later.

<h1>New Jersey child, 12, charged for allegedly making school threats</h1>
<h2>Maple Shade incident becomes latest across the US</h2>
<p>A 12-year-old <a>New Jersey</a> child is now facing charges after allegedly directing threats toward a high school from "a variety of social media accounts," police say. </p>
<p>The development comes after at least a dozen students around the U.S. were <a>arrested late last week</a> in connection to similar threat rumors posted on TikTok and other social media apps as part of a viral social media craze.</p>
<div> <div><p> The threats allegedly were directed toward the Maple Shade High School community in New Jersey. (Google Maps)</p></div></div>

<p>The juvenile – who is not being identified because they are a minor – has been charged with terroristic threats, false public alarms and cyber harassment. </p>
<p>"It is apparent that this is not just a Maple Shade issue, but an issue that is affecting many towns in New Jersey and many states throughout our country," the Maple Shade Police Department said, alluding to the situations unfolding elsewhere. </p>
<p>"Lastly, we ask that each of our parents and/or guardians please take a moment to discuss the appropriate use of social media with your children," it also said. </p>
<div> <div><p> Similar threats directed towards schools were circulating last week on the social media app TikTok, according to reports. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p></div></div>

<p>Dinklage, one of the stars of <a>"Game of Thrones,"</a> spoke out on a recent "Awards Chatter" podcast, Mediaite.com reported.</p>
<p>He slammed "politically correct" critics as being "politically wrong" for saying he, a <a>New Jersey</a>-born White man, should not have accepted the role of Villechaize.</p>
<p>Dinklage added that many of his critics mistakenly believed Villechaize was Asian because of his appearance when the late actor was actually French. </p>

<h1>Steve Bannon indicted on contempt of Congress charges</h1>
<h2>Bannon failed to appear for a deposition in front of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>Former adviser to President Trump Steve Bannon has been indicted on contempt of Congress charges.</p>
<p><a>HOUSE VOTES TO HOLD TRUMP ALLY STEVE BANNON IN CONTEMPT</a></p>
<p>Bannon is expected to self surrender on Monday and appear in federal court that afternoon, according to a Justice Department official.</p>
<p>The House voted 229-202 to hold Bannon in contempt last month on Oct. 21.</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday’s charges reflect the DOJ’s "steadfast commitment" to showing the American people they follow "the rule of law."</p>
<div> <div><p> Merrick Garland testifies before the House Judiciary Committee (CSPAN) (CSPAN)</p></div></div>
<p>U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves, whose office announced the indictment, confirmed the reason behind the charges in the press release.</p>
<p>"According to the indictment, Mr. Bannon refused to appear to give testimony as required by subpoena and refused to produce documents in compliance with a subpoena," Graves continued.</p>
<p>While the grand jury charges are hefty, it is unlikely Bannon will face jail time – it's been over 40 years since the last person indicted on similar charges was sent to prison </p>
<p>Even if convicted, the contempt of Congress charges may not yield the information the committee is seeking from Bannon.</p>
<p>With Bannon's charges now revealed, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows could face similar charges for not complying with a subpoena of the Jan. 6 committee.</p>
<p>The charges could carry up to a year in prison and $1,000 fine, each.</p>

<p>"The congressional request is untethered from any valid legislative purpose and exceeds the authority of Congress under the Constitution and the Presidential Records Act.," Trump's attorneys wrote in a <a>petition</a>.</p>
<p>Trump sued the Jan. 6 committee and the National Archives to stop the White House from allowing the release of documents related to the insurrection. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia earlier this month denied Trump's request to block the records, citing a "unique legislative need." Last month, a federal judge also <a>ruled against</a> Trump.</p>

<p>FORMER NFL STAR TIM GREEN REVEALS HOW ALS ALTERED HIS OUTLOOK ON LIFE</p>
<p>The <a>newly signed legislation</a> will establish grant programs to address neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, which is more commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease.</p>
<p>Biden noted that it had been "82 years" since Lou Gehrig famously retired from baseball after being diagnosed with the disease, yet "outcomes are still the same" and there is "no cure."</p>
<p>"But today, we're finally closer than ever to new treatments and hopefully, God willing, a cure," Biden said.</p>

<p>The president singled out lawmakers from both parties during the ceremony, noting that the bill passed the House by a vote of 423-3 and unanimously passed the Senate.</p>
<p>"And you wonder why I'm saying whether Democrats or Republicans, to make the point when we act together we get things done," Biden said. "This is totally… a bipartisan effort."</p>
<p>ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord, eventually leading to a loss of muscle control. Patients diagnosed with the disease typically only live 2-5 more years, and there is no cure.</p>

<a>article</a> in which the senator claimed that "antifa scumbags" showed up at his residence in Fairfax County, Virginia.
<p><a>WHAT IS SHUTDOWN DC? THEY SAY THEY OPPOSE OPPRESSION, BUT SEN. HAWLEY DUBS THEM ‘ANTIFA SCUMBAGS’</a></p>
<p>Mike DeBonis, a reporter from The Washington Post, tweeted at the time that ShutDownDC defines itself as "an organizing space where individuals and groups can come together to organize direct action in the fight for justice."</p>
<p><a><u>HAWLEY SAYS ‘ANTIFA SCUMBAGS’ THREATENED HIS FAMILY AT THEIR HOME IN DC</u></a></p>
<p>Hawley blasted ShutDownDC's statement, tweeting, "Now 'vigil' means screaming threats through bullhorns, vandalizing property, pounding on the doors of homes and terrorizing innocent people and children."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, ShutDownDC shut down traffic around the nation's capital to <a><u>demonstrate</u></a> against the Biden administration and lawmakers activists believe have failed them by not delivering on various promises.</p>
