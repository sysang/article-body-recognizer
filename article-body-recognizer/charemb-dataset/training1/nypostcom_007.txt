<h2>Say ‘olive you’</h2>
<p>Yiayia and Friends EVOO, $19.99 at The Goods Mart, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and at TheGoodsMart.com</p>
<p>Give the gift of self-care with decadent scented bubble bath, whipped up from a mixture of avocado oil, cocoa butter and green tea. The bottle’s design recalls high-end perfumes, destined to class up the powder room.</p>
<p>Va-va-voom! It’s all about flavor with this spicy condiment. The shapely, Venus de Milo-style vessel is a surefire conversation starter. </p>
<p>California’s Usual winery sells its products by the glass, with offerings that include rosé, pinot gris and sparkling brut (hello, NYE!). The cone-shaped container holds a perfect pour of 6.3 ounces — so try a few.</p>
<p>The tantalizing turquoise bottle contains an equally intoxicating treat — small-batch gin made from the finest Pacific Northwest spices, including juniper, pink peppercorn and star anise.</p>

<p>Mom Kirsty Jordan-Smith was in stitches when her five-year-old son’s teacher took her to one side to reveal his first written sentence — “I like wine”.</p>
<p>Kirsty, 39, was worried because she feared “boisterous” Finlay may have been causing classroom chaos.</p>
<p>But the psychology student guffawed when the teacher showed her a tablet with a photo of her son’s words on it.</p>
<p>Kirsty, from Yeovil, Somerset, said: “His teacher called me over in front of other parents and my first thought was maybe he’d done something.</p>
<p>“She showed me a photo and said, ‘This is Finlay’s first sentence.’</p>
<p>“I fell about laughing.</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea where he got it from at all. When I got home I said, ‘Finlay, do you know what wine is?’ He said, ‘No’.</p>
<p>“Neither my husband, Mark, nor I drink very often so it’s not like he sees bottles and labels around.</p>
<p>“I told him it’s alcohol and he giggled. He knows he’s not allowed to drink it.”</p>
<p>Kirsty added: “When I showed Mark he laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks it’s hilarious.”</p>

<h1> Fanatics’ Michael Rubin turns to Macy’s for more female customers</h1>
<div> October 11, 2021 2:41pm <div> Updated <div> October 11, 2021 2:41pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Sports retailer Fanatics wants to sell more jerseys, ball caps and T-shirts to women.</p>
<p>It’s counting on Macy’s to help it do that.</p>
<a>eventually a publicly held company</a>.
<p>But most of its customers are male fans. </p>
<p>Rubin figures that women are more likely to buy sportswear for themselves or family members from department stores than they are from Fanatics’ website or handful of Fanatics’ stores. </p>
<a>The sports mogul </a>wants to grow the number of better brands Fanatics offers to 100, he said. 
<p>The retail partnerships with Macy’s and others has driven up Fanatics’ sales of women’s apparel in the “high double digits” over the past couple of years, the company said.</p>

<h1> You can own a private island just outside NYC for $13 million</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> June 11, 2019 10:29am <div> Updated <div> June 12, 2019 1:00pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A private island just 30 minutes from Manhattan has hit the market for $13 million.</p>
<p>Columbia Island is located just off of New Rochelle in Westchester, surrounded by the waters of the Long Island Sound. It’s just a short boat ride from The Bronx’s City Island and 30 minutes from Midtown by car.</p>
<p>The island’s 5,600-square-foot, four-bedroom, two-bathroom home sounds like a city dweller’s dream retreat — but its owner says creating the haven was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Sutton — a doctor, actor, author and producer — bought the island for $1 million in 2007 and then invested $8 million over the next 11 years developing it.</p>
<p>But instead, Sutton said, he could have gotten the same experience renting “a rowboat from City Island for $10” without the headache of managing complicated construction on the salt- and wind-beaten site.</p>
<p>But even after construction was finally finished, he never moved in.</p>
<p>“I’m 85 now,” Sutton said, “and I guess when I bought it, I was in my 70s and I was more ambitious.”</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 15</div> </div> </div>
<p>Sutton wasn’t the first victim of Columbia Island’s siren song.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, New Rochelle’s Huguenot Yacht Club sold the outpost to CBS, which promptly put up a 400-foot-tall broadcast tower.</p>
<p>The island changed hands again in the 1960s to vaudeville entertainer and film actor Peter Lind Hayes.</p>
<p>Hayes couldn’t afford the tax bill and passed the island onto the College of New Rochelle, who also couldn’t afford to maintain it. It eventually gave the island away to a school superintendent, who sold it to Sutton.</p>
<p>Now Sutton’s pain is some lucky buyer’s gain. Not only is Sutton selling his own rare retreat, but the sale price includes the neighboring and mostly undeveloped Pea Island.</p>
<p>“I’m not a big spender, or at least I wasn’t until now,” Sutton lamented. “But here was something that, to be realized, had to be done right.”</p>
<p>Patti Anderson at Julia B. Fee Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.</p>
<h1> Private island for sale outside Manhattan is shockingly cheap</h1>
<div> August 20, 2019 4:39pm <div> Updated <div> August 21, 2019 10:22am </div> </div> </div>
<p>For $850,000, you could buy a shoebox in Brooklyn. But why not pick up a private island instead?</p>
<p>In the middle of serene Putnam Lake, the island has a four-bedroom, 1½-bath house smack dab in the center.</p>
<p>Built in 1932, the two-story, 1,922-square-foot Colonial house has 35 windows, multiple docks and is accessible only by boat.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 9</div> </div> </div>
<p>In fact, the fully furnished house comes with its own solar-powered boat, because motorized boats are a banned on the lake. Ah, the sound of silence!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: The property includes a separately deeded private driveway with a garage on the mainland, presumably for a place to park your wheels before getting on the water.</p>
<p>On land, there’s also a 600-square-foot space “ideal for a yoga meditation studio,” according to the listing with Linda Finn and Regan Andrews of Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p>“It’s the perfect place to write the next great American novel!” the listing copy adds.</p>

<h1> $2,200 a month NYC apartment with shower in living room stuns TikTok</h1>
<div> December 31, 2021 12:46pm <div> Updated <div> December 31, 2021 1:51pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Imagine lounging in your New York City living room — relaxing on a couch that can face a fireplace with a handsome wooden mantel.</p>
<p>You look to your left and see a shower. Yes, a shower in your living room. </p>
<p>The cherry on top: There’s a towel rack right off to the side.</p>
<p>A new video showing this cramped layout — in a city apartment that asks a striking sum in monthly rent — has gone viral on TikTok.</p>
<p>The clip of the dismal dwelling easily nabbed north of 1.6 million views among onlookers left perplexed by the arrangement.</p>
<p>“When you pay $2,200 [per month] and have to shower in the living room,” wrote real-estate agent Claudia Degteva in the caption of the video, which has also earned roughly 135,000 likes since Thursday and about 2,300 shares.</p>
<p>It’s not clear where in New York City the unit is located. But for all its downfalls, it does seem to also have plenty of normal features to offer its next tenant. </p>
<p>Still, despite the perks of the space, Degteva’s commenters weren’t shy to share their thoughts.</p>
<p>“You have to entertain guests somehow,” said one viewer, while another, named Harsh, said, “new york can’t keep getting away with these god awful apartment layouts .. were the architects drunk.”</p>
<p>One follower replied to Harsh, saying “Landlords continue to buy buildings and split larger units into multiple small ones. I’ve seen it on newly built units.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one commenter asked, “why does anyone bother glamorizing NY anymore we all know they’re packed in like a pez dispender for thousands of dollars a month.”</p>
<p>But others, who seem to be in an Empire State of mind, didn’t really mind the quirky crib.</p>
<p>“You have windows so that’s kinda nice for NYC,” said one, while another chimed in with “this doesn’t [really] bother me.” But another didn’t mind the price.</p>
<p>“The fact I saw this and thought ‘that looks like a good deal,'” she said.</p>

<h1> House with secret strip club in basement billed ‘hottest club in Indiana’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 10, 2022 4:17pm <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 4:25pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Blink and you’ll miss this home’s most exotic feature. </p>
<p>A seemingly innocent house in Indiana is making waves after a secret strip club and nightclub were discovered in the basement.</p>
<p>Located in Indianapolis, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom custom abode is on sale for $799,900.</p>
<p>It first hit the market last May after the owners initially purchased the home in 2016 for $405,000. </p>
<p>On the surface, the home appears traditional — if not a tad outdated even. </p>
<p>The owners even admit in the listing some areas of the house could use some renovating. </p>
<p>“Master bath could use updating in our opinion,” the owner states, adding that they are “willing to offer 10K at time of closing for remodeling work.” </p>
<p>Features include a kitchen with granite countertops and under-cabinet lighting, which leads to a breakfast room with skylights. A large screened-in porch features a cathedral ceiling. </p>
<p>Separately are what is described as the “mother-in-law quarters with kitchenette private entrance.” </p>
<p>The basement was remodeled and comes with fully stocked fridges of booze, a pool table and neon signs throughout. </p>
<p>One area of the makeshift bar has been transformed into a full-on strip club — complete with a stage, a mirrored wall, stripper poles, a disco ball and a large viewing couch.</p>
<p>Commenters to the ZillowGoneWild post were quick to chime in on the sexy listing.</p>
<p>“I live just across the border in Illinois. That may really be the hottest club in Indiana.”</p>
<p>“Business in the front, party in the back,” another user quipped.</p>
<p>“Ultimate house for introverts,” another commented. “You can go out and stay in at the same time!”</p>

<h2>Interview with a killer</h2>
<p>I’ve interviewed convicted murderer Robert Durst. I’ve met him. I’ve been with him. I’ve spoken with him. I was in his Galveston jail.</p>
<p>I knew he’d become sickly. Cardiac arrest. Prison authorities had put him in the hospital.</p>
<p>And the verdict was: He was actually sensationally acquitted.</p>
<p>Despite that stunning verdict, he still was annoyed. Actually irritated. Just hours after the verdict Durst, on the phone, calmly told me:</p>
<p>Here’s the 411 on <a>“The 355,”</a> the female action flick with chicks doing all the kicks and tricks. Penelope Cruz, Diane Kruger, Lupita Nyong’o and ringleader Jessica Chastain.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been outspoken about how women have been and still are treated in Hollywood. Important to me to make a film where actresses were not just for hire but had each others’ back plus ownership over their work.”</p>
<p>So cold around here these days that some of this town’s rednecks have turned blue.</p>

<h1> Over 50 NYC schools missing at least half their students since returning from winter break</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 6:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 5:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The kids aren’t alright.</p>
<p>More than 50 city schools had at least half of their students absent Thursday amid an ongoing Department of Education attendance crisis.</p>
<p>Due to COVID cases, infection fears and rising truancy, the DOE has not cracked 80 percent attendance in two weeks — and had an overall 23 percent absentee rate Thursday.</p>
<p>“There is no learning happening in these schools,” said teacher Lydia Howrilka, noting schools are having to combine classes due to low attendance and that hallways in many DOE buildings are noticeably quiet.</p>
<p>A veteran Brooklyn teacher said some kids are passing on class for now, at least in part, because so many of their regular teachers are out of action. </p>
<p>“Kids see the sub for a few days and figure it’s not real school and they check out,” she said. </p>
<p>Scores of struggling city campuses have seen more than half of their kids vanish in the new semester.</p>
<p>Independence High School had only 19 percent of its 300 kids show up Thursday, according to DOE numbers.</p>
<p>At the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy, 66 percent of 346 students were in the wind.</p>
<p>About 73 percent of kids at Judith Kaye High School in Manhattan were missing Thursday, while Eagle Academy for Young Men in Harlem had an attendance rate of 50 percent.</p>
<p>Case counts have rocketed in recent weeks due to the Omicron variant and a sharp increase in student testing.</p>
<p>Brooklyn College and CUNY Grad Center education professor David Bloomfield said a <a>variety of factors are suppressing attendance</a>, including COVID sicknesses, isolation requirements, general pandemic fears and truancy.</p>
<p>“There are lots of schools that are hovering at 50 percent or lower,” he said. “I think Adams and Banks are looking at reality rather than sound bytes at this point.”</p>
<p>Bloomfield said that a segment of city kids have become habituated to not attending school amid constant interruptions wrought by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The risk versus reward at this point is not worth breaking that cycle,” he said. </p>
<p>The DOE stressed Friday that attendance has increased since Dec. 23 and that absenteeism is expected to ease.</p>
<p>Some of the city’s larger high schools have continued to see about 1,000 kids absent each day this week.</p>
<p>Forest Hills High School, which enrolls nearly 4,000 students, had an absentee rate of 27 percent Thursday. </p>
<p>Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, which enrolls 3,700 kids, had nearly a third of them absent.</p>
<p>The city’s specialized high schools saw sharply higher attendance rates than the overall city average, according to DOE figures.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan had an attendance rate of 88 percent Thursday while Brooklyn Tech saw 85 percent of its kids present.</p>
<p>Transfer schools, which teach some of the city’s most vulnerable kids, have suffered the lowest attendance rates in the city since the end of winter break.</p>
<p>Banks has said that he expects the numbers to normalize in the near future as the latest coronavirus wave begins to ebb.</p>
<h1> NYC schools to allow remote option as attendance plunges during COVID surge</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 15, 2022 6:40pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 6:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A remote option is coming back to city schools in response to plunging attendance amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. </p>
<p>Under a new Department of Education policy, students who don’t show up even though they are not sick or under quarantine won’t be marked absent if they meet with teachers on Zoom office hours and get class materials online.</p>
<p>Students can still be marked present, for instance, if they log onto Google Classroom to view PowerPoint presentations, subject notes and assignments. They can also communicate with teachers via email.</p>
<p>“We’re giving students permission to stay home as long as they are showing some level of participation online,” a Queens teacher told The Post.</p>
<p>“The city is making attendance rates go up.”</p>
<p>After the holiday break on Jan. 3, attendance in DOE schools sunk to 67 percent. On Friday, the attendance was 75 percent. With an enrollment of 938,000 students, that means 234,500 kids missed classes. </p>
<p>“However, if staff are willing and their supervisor approves,” they can do so “and be compensated accordingly,” Weisberg wrote. </p>
<p>Schools can now mark students present using the reason code “65,” which can mean either present in-person — or absent from the classroom but learning remotely.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the DOE will release data on students marked present remotely, as opposed to in-person.</p>
<p>DOE spokesman Nathaniel Styer said the city still considers schools “the safest places for young people to be,” but is trying to be the most flexible in providing an education to every student.” </p>

<h1> A Queens school social worker pleads: Don’t go remote, NYC schools</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:48pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:52pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>To understand how <a>disastrous a remote option would be</a> for our city’s youth, let’s take a look back at what “remote learning” amounted to last time — which I witnessed up close as a social school worker.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, teachers were talking to 30-plus gray squares with muted microphones, not knowing if their students were listening or even physically present. Teachers and counselors were working twice as hard for a tenth of the result.</p>
<a>Omicron wave is rapidly decreasing in New York City,</a> but even at its peak, only one in 100,000 children was hospitalized weekly, and that decreased to two to three per million in vaccinated children. By comparison, 20 in 100,000 were 
<a>hospitalized for the flu</a> in the 2019-2020 season, and we never dreamed of making school remote then. Every child 5 and up has access to two COVID shots, and every child 12 and up has access to three.
<p>It’s time to resume normal school.</p>
<p>We should work to assuage<a> parental fears about COVID</a>. In my role as a school social worker, I have been engaging with families all year to address their specific concerns. </p>
<p>Indeed, many students returned last week after initial Omicron worries. Now I fear the mayor’s musing about a remote option will validate the false idea that school is not safe.</p>
<p>Are we really going to turn school into an option? We are destroying a century-old norm of compulsory universal education. </p>
<p>Allowing an unrestricted remote option would be catastrophic for kids after nearly two years of stunted child development, especially the “asynchronous” model the Department of Education is floating that would resemble March 2020. </p>
<p>Children have no agency. It is up to us as adults to provide a free and fair education to every child, and that means in-person school.</p>

<h1> Cracking the case of the ‘woke’ prosecutor</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 12:30am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:41pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>One of the most puzzling conundrums about “progressive” prosecutors — who favor de-prosecution and de-carceration — is to ascertain their motivations. </p>
<p>What are these elected chief prosecutors thinking when they unilaterally decide not to enforce the law? And why, even as murders increase in the big cities they police, do they continue to support these policies without shame? </p>
<p>Let’s consider the options: </p>
<p>ARE THEY FISCAL CONSERVATIVES? The cost of solving a homicide and convicting a guilty party is enormous. Estimates of the all-in costs of investigation, trial and incarceration range from $8 million to $17 million per case. </p>
<p>While the number of homicides has been spiking under progressive prosecutors, the clearance rate for homicides has been plummeting: Once around 80%, rates are dropping into the 30% range in some cities. Great news for the bottom line. </p>
<p>ARE THEY INSANE? A popular definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. The just-indicted Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby is an interesting candidate for this theory. </p>
<p>ARE THEY ANARCHISTS? Perhaps these prosecutors are letting large swaths of the poor population get killed and failing to convict perpetrators of crimes because they crave disorder. </p>
<h2>Dispirit of St. Louis </h2>
<p>There has been more than 100% turnover in the office, as line prosecutors voted with their feet and left. Gardner is under investigation by the Missouri disciplinary board for misconduct in her role as a prosecutor. </p>
<p>She sued the St. Louis PD for racism, and the case was promptly dismissed. She previously admitted to campaign finance law violations. </p>
<p>Pity the American cities failing to see that these prosecutors are a cancer eating away at their own hosts. Alvin Bragg is threatening to bring this circus of ineptitude to Manhattan, and the Big Apple is justifiably concerned. </p>
<p>Tom Hogan, now in private practice, has served as a federal prosecutor, local prosecutor and elected district attorney.</p>

<h1> GOP governor hopefuls slam millionaire’s donation to ‘pro-criminal’ Manhattan DA Bragg</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 6:29pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 6:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>He hasn’t even officially entered the governor’s race but Republican millionaire Harry Wilson’s past donation to embattled Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Wilson, chairman and CEO of investment management firm MAEVA Group, said the two Manhattan donations were from someone else with the same name.</p>
<p>Other candidates in the Republican primary for governor pounced on Wilson’s donation.</p>
<p>“Anyone who donated to Bragg had to know he was running on a soft-on-crime platform.”</p>
<p>Long Island Rep. <a>Lee Zeldin</a>, the GOP leadership’s presumptive nominee for governor, said, “I will never turn my back on our law enforcement officers and the New Yorkers they are sworn to protect.</p>
<p><a>Andrew Giuliani</a>, the third GOP candidate for governor, urged New Yorkers to support his Change.org <a>petition to </a>try to oust Bragg. More than 9,000 people <a>have signed </a>the petition.</p>
<p>Wilson yanked his support for Bragg after reading about the new DA’s progressive policies.</p>
<p>“I was incredibly disappointed by his memo. I’m 100 hundred percent opposed to any district attorney who will not prosecute crimes,” Wilson said.</p>
<p>“Gov. Hochul must take action to either stop his policies or remove Bragg.”</p>
<p>Hochul, meanwhile, has <a>come under criticism </a>for trying to duck the controversy over Bragg.</p>
<p>Word of Wilson’s contribution to Bragg circulated after The Post reported last week that the businessman was strongly considering entering the race for governor.</p>
<p>The son of Greek immigrants, Wilson narrowly lost the 2010 race for state comptroller to Democrat <a>Tom DiNapoli</a>.</p>
<h1> Embattled Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg huddles with PR pro, Preet Bharara over soft-on-crime uproar</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:09pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:12pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Embattled Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is consulting a crisis communications specialist to try to douse the firestorm of outrage over his soft-on-crime progressive policies, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Sources also said Bragg is also seeking help from his old boss, former Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.</p>
<p>Bragg turned to veteran public relations professional Risa Heller amid the controversy that he acknowledged Sunday had resulted in “a challenging two weeks” since he took office Jan. 1, sources familiar with the situation said.</p>
<p>Bragg, a former federal prosecutor, has also been speaking with Bharara, who garnered widespread accolades for cracking down on inside traders and <a>corrupt politicians</a> when he was Manhattan US attorney, sources said.</p>
<p>“Risa and Preet have been making calls to people about what Bragg is doing and how to handle the fallout,” one source said.</p>
<p>Heller and Bharara worked together in the past as staffers for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY.)</p>
<p>Neither immediately returned requests for comment.</p>
<a>address widespread criticism</a> of his
<a>directives for Manhattan prosecutors</a> to downgrade certain felonies — including some commercial armed robberies — and not seek bail or prison time in most cases.
<p>It’s unclear if Bragg plans to walk back any of those orders.</p>
<p>One source said the speech could be delivered as soon as Wednesday but a Bragg insider said the date hadn’t yet been determined.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at different options,” the source closed to Bragg said.</p>
<p>That person said Bragg was also “talking to senior people in the DA’s office” and “to people who were endorsers and others about moving forward.”</p>
<p>State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs said he welcomed the planned speech because “the more clarity Bragg can give, the better.”</p>
<p>Jacobs also accused Republicans of seizing on elements from Bragg’s controversial, Jan. 3 “Day One” memo to be used as a “wedge issue” against Democrats.</p>
<p>“I have confidence in District Attorney Bragg. He knows what he’s doing. He has good intentions. Creating a safe city is his objective,” Jacobs said.</p>
<a>nine prosecutors have quit </a>the Manhattan DA’s Office since Bragg took over, including senior trial counsel Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, who successfully prosecuted Harvey Weinstein and won a 2016 conviction in the infamous 1979 murder of Etan Patz.
<a>sent every NYPD cop an email</a> that said she was “very concerned” Bragg’s agenda would impact “your safety as police officers, the safety of the public and justice for the victims.”
<p>Sewell and Bragg later <a>held a meeting</a> that they claimed afterward was “open, candid and productive,” and would be followed by additional “collaborative discussions.”</p>

<h1> Four-day work week pilot set to kick off in UK</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:05pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:05pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The four-day workweek is getting a tryout in the UK.</p>
<p>Dozens of British companies have volunteered to take part in a pilot program offering four-day work weeks for employees.</p>
<p>The six-month trial will include 30 firms that have agreed to allow staff to work up to 32 hours per week without cutting their wages or benefits.</p>
<p>Some firms taking part in the pilot could ask employees to spread out the 32 hours over a period of five days, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>“Moving to a four-day week would be a win-win for companies,” Joe Ryle, director of the Four Day Week Campaign in the UK, told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>“Studies have shown that productivity improves along with corresponding gains in workers’ well-being.”</p>
<p>Similar trials have taken place in other countries, including Spain, New Zealand, and Iceland. More are scheduled to run in Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>A four-year trial conducted by the Icelandic government and the city of Reykjavik found that four-day workweeks lead to maintained or increased productivity.</p>
<p>Last summer, <a>the Icelandic government said that an overwhelming majority of the country’s workforce</a> — 86% — “are now working shorter hours or gaining the right to shorten their hours.”</p>
<p>“Worker wellbeing dramatically increased across a range of indicators, from perceived stress and burnout to health and work-life balance,” the summary continued, adding that revenue “remained neutral” throughout the trials.</p>
<p>Similar results in its own trials moved the Spanish government to offer grants in order to encourage companies to shorten working hours without a cut in pay.</p>
<p>The idea of a four-day work week appears to be gaining popularity in the United States.</p>
<p>Last month, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill that would shorten the standard work week from 40 hours to 32 hours.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law, it would require employers to pay overtime to workers who exceed 32 hours per work week.</p>
<p>“The 32-hour work week would go a long way toward finally righting that balance.”</p>
<p>Some US companies aren’t waiting for the go-ahead from Congress. Instead, they’ve adopted a permanent, four-day, 32-hour work week on their own.</p>
<p>Bolt, the San Francisco-based e-commerce firm, instituted a permanent four-day work week for employees last fall.</p>
<p>Ryan Breslow, the firm’s CEO, <a>told CNBC</a> earlier this month that employees are happier, more efficient, and more productive.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t imagine running a company any other way,” he said.</p>
<p>Supporters of the four-day work week hope that more companies will adopt the model as a way to retain talent — <a>particularly in the wake of “the Great Resignation,”</a> during which millions of Americans have left their jobs.</p>
<p>But employers and economists aren’t so thrilled with the idea of a four-day work week, saying that it will only benefit white-collar workers.</p>
<p>Dan Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that blue-collar workers, whose pay has been in decline, choose to work longer hours in order to make ends meet.</p>
<p>“That’s what bothers me most about this discussion, frankly. It’s very much a bunch of well-to-do folks telling others how much they should work.”</p>

<h1> Standard General, Apollo close in on $9B deal for Tegna, sources say</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:11pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:11pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Standard General and Apollo Global Management are closing in on a roughly $9 billion deal for television station owner Tegna, sources close to the situation told The Post.</p>
<p>The buyers and Tegna have cleared what sources saw as the major stumbling block: how much the Standard General-Apollo team would need to pay if the deal takes more than a year to clear the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators.</p>
<p>Tegna had wanted a roughly $500 million break-up fee if the deal isn’t completed one year after it is inked — even if regulators weren’t the cause of a possible no-deal.</p>
<p>But the TV giant in recent days has largely relented on that point, sources said. “Now it is only about price,” a source with knowledge of the situation said.</p>
<p>The FCC presently has only four commissioners, instead of the normal five, making a deadlocked commission a possibility. </p>
<p>Standard General and Apollo will likely need to pay at least $24 a share for Tegna, sources said, after previously bidding $22.65. The buyers seem open to raising their offer for the second time, sources said.</p>
<p>Tegna’s shares have steadily risen based on market speculation over the last five trading days from $18.69 to $19.28 on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<a>spun off from newspaper giant Gannett</a> in 2015, operates 64 television and two radio stations across 54 US markets.

<h1> FAA rejects FedEx proposal to install missile-defense system on Airbus planes</h1>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday it was withdrawing proposed conditions that could have allowed delivery company FedEx to install a laser-based missile-defense on jet-maker Airbus A321-200 airplanes.</p>
<p>The FAA had said on Friday it was proposing conditions and opening the proposal for public comment.</p>
<p>In October 2019, FedEx applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed Friday.</p>
<p>“The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt</p>
<p>the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,” the FAA document said.</p>
<p>According to the US State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s.</p>
<p>In November 2002, two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport, and efforts to combat the threat accelerated.</p>
<p>In 2003, an Airbus A300 freighter flown by DHL was damaged by MANPADs and forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad.</p>
<h1> Tesla investors urge judge to make Musk repay $13B for SolarCity deal</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 3:11pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:11pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,” Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, told the Zoom hearing.</p>
<p>The closing arguments recounted key findings from a 10-day trial in July when Musk spent two days on the stand defending the deal. </p>
<p>The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers alleges that Musk strong-armed the Tesla board into approving the deal for the cash-strapped SolarCity, in which Musk was the top shareholder.</p>
<p>Musk has countered that the deal was part of a decade-old master plan to create a vertically integrated company that would transform energy generation and consumption with SolarCity’s roof panels and Tesla’s cars and batteries.</p>
<p>Evan Chesler, one of the lawyers representing Musk, told the hearing that the deal was not a bailout and SolarCity was far from insolvent and its finances resembled many high-growth tech companies.</p>
<p>“They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,” Chesler said of SolarCity.</p>
<p>The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016, but since that time Tesla’s stock has soared.</p>
<p>Shareholder attorney Lee Rudy urged Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware’s Court of Chancery to order Musk return the Tesla stock he received, which would be worth around $13 billion at its current price.</p>
<p>Musk said in court papers such an award would be at least five times the largest award ever in a comparable shareholder lawsuit and called it a “windfall” for plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Rudy said Slights should consider Musk’s contempt for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly clashed with and insulted shareholder attorneys.</p>
<p>“It would be a windfall for Elon Musk if he got to keep shares he never should have gotten in the first place,” Rudy said.</p>
<p>Chesler called the request to order Musk to return the stock from the deal “preposterous” and said it ignored five years of unprecedented success at Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla’s stock was down 1% at around $1,040 in afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Musk’s lawyers said the celebrity entrepreneur had no power to fire directors or control their pay and he recused himself from price negotiations on the SolarCity deal.</p>
<p>“Without Elon Musk, Tesla might not exist let alone have a $1 trillion value,” said Vanessa Lavely, an attorney for Musk. “That doesn’t make him a controller. That makes him a highly effective CEO.”</p>
<p>Slights ended the hearing by saying he expects to rule in about three months.</p>
<p>He said last week he intends to retire in the coming months and a related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk’s record pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge. </p>

<h1> Restaurateurs say they’re absorbing yet another blow as Omicron rips through NYC</h1>

<div> December 20, 2021 8:32pm <div> Updated <div> December 20, 2021 8:32pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>New York restaurateurs say they’re absorbing yet another blow with customers again staying away from their establishments as COVID cases rise — and this time, some eatery owners say they’re not sure they can survive. </p>
<p>Some are closing for the season, and a national advocacy group says some won’t be back.</p>
<p>Just since the beginning of November, when omicron worries flared, restaurant bookings are down 30 percent to 50 percent so far in the first two weeks of December, said James Mallios, owner of Amali on East 60th Street.</p>
<p>“Amali was looking like I might be able to distribute a payment to investors and a holiday bonus to the staff,” Mallios said of the outlook before omicron hit. “But no longer,” he said.</p>
<p>People who had booked holiday parties started calling after Thanksgiving about the restaurant’s cancellation policies, Mallios said. Then by last week, they started canceling. </p>
<p>Omicron has also been “a killer” for some of Mallios’s other restaurants, including Bar Marseille, which opened in the Rockaways during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said, “I had to lay off people and scale back staff.”</p>
<p>Ahmass Fakahany, founder and CEO of the Altamarea Group, which runs restaurants including Michelin-starred Marea, said his restaurants have limited reservations and canceled lunch service. </p>
<p>“The business has been impacted because of these steps of safety vigilance and restraint and also heightened client trepidation and concern,” Fakahany said, adding that some private event bookings are also being rescheduled. </p>
<a> Restaurant Revitalization Fund</a>, which is now dried up after doling out around $29 billion – even after the Independent Restaurant Coalition, an advocacy group, says eateries have lost more than $280 billion during the pandemic.
<p>In New York, even as the sky had started to brighten pre-omicron, things still weren’t back to normal: The IRC said reservations remain 47 percent lower than their 2019 levels. </p>
<p>On Monday as things looked likely to only get worse,<a> actress Gwyneth Paltrow</a> teamed up with the IRC to urge Congress to replenish the fund with an additional $60 billion.</p>
<a> Luann de Lesseps of Bravo’s Real Housewives of New York</a>. That was just before the omicon variant hit.
<h1> Embattled Barstool founder Dave Portnoy buys in the Hamptons</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 4:57pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 5:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Look out, Montauk pizza joints — One Bite reviewer Dave Portnoy, founder and CEO of Barstool Sports, has plunked down $9.75 million for a Hamptons beach house. </p>
<p>The new construction home, on Old Montauk Highway, is surrounded by trees and sits on an almost a full acre. </p>
<p>It comes with a pool and ocean views. </p>
<p>Last fall, Portnoy was in the news with a rant accusing Business Insider of slander following an expose alleging that Portnoy has been violent with young women during sex. </p>
<p>He fought back saying that the encounters were consensual.</p>
<p>Last April, Portnoy also bought a waterfront home in Miami for $14 million on North Bayshore Drive, the Real Deal reported. </p>

<p>Compass brokers Matt Breitenbach and Greg Gould repped both sides of the off-market deal and declined to comment. </p>

<p>“Real Housewives of New York” alum Jill Zarin is moving on up — in Boca Raton, Fla. </p>
<p>She just listed her four-bedroom, three-bathroom home for $2.29 million. The home is at 5853 Hamilton Way. </p>
<p>“I love the neighborhood and I’m staying nearby — I’m just moving into something bigger,” Zarin tells Gimme. </p>
<p>The renovated, turn-key, one-story home is 2,871 square feet and comes with lake views. It features hardwood floors, lots of storage and built-ins, and a flashy (and Insta-worthy) chef’s kitchen that opens to a family room. </p>
<p>Outside, there’s a large patio, grassy area, vegetable garden, and heated pool and spa. </p>
<p>The listing brokers are Debra Hofmann, of Palace Real Estate, and Elliot Koolik of Compass. </p>
<p>“I love the weather here and being able to play so much tennis,” she tells Gimme. </p>
<p>Her new home (which she is in contract for) is 6,609 square feet and comes with five bedrooms on Coventry Lane. It had been asking $3.49 million. </p>
<p>She’s also looking forward to returning to the Hamptons this summer, where she has bought a condo, <a>as we previously reported</a>. Her famed East End <a>charity lunch</a> may even be returning. Stay tuned! </p>
