<p>As talks resume over reviving the 2015 global nuclear agreement with Iran, the United States needs to alter the dynamics of its relationship with Tehran if it hopes to secure a deal that will serve American interests.</p>
<p>At the moment, Tehran is dictating the timing and terms of the talks while continuing to make progress on its nuclear program. Iran is <a>perhaps no more than a month</a> away from developing a nuclear bomb if it chooses to do so.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> and his team have acceded to Tehran's demand that the United States
<a>not sit at the table</a> during this week's talks in Vienna, leaving America's interests in the hands of European allies. Tehran also is
<a>insisting</a> that the United States lift all sanctions before it will consider returning to the 2015 deal. U.S. officials have responded with vague threats of military action against Iran's nuclear facilities that Tehran surely doesn't take seriously.
<p>Rather than prostrate itself to the dictates of an outlaw regime in hopes of convincing it to change direction, Washington needs to set the terms of discussion with Tehran.</p>
<p>Concretely, the Biden team should take the following five steps to change the nature of U.S.-Iranian relations and raise the chances of securing a strong nuclear deal.</p>
<a>two reports in November</a>, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran isn't letting its inspectors reinstall cameras to monitor a key nuclear facility, and is subjecting inspectors to "excessively invasive physical searches."
<a>as Israel has</a>, and make clear that it will support future Israeli sabotage efforts—rather than, as
<a>repeated</a> Iranian calls for "the annihilation of Israel," and Iranian forces used tear gas and pellet guns against hundreds of people in the city of Isfahan who were protesting water shortages.
<p>To nourish public support for the steps suggested above, Washington needs to showcase and condemn such Iranian behavior—just as U.S. administrations did with Soviet behavior during the Cold War and with that of other adversaries in later years.</p>
<p>All told, the United States must decide whether it's serious about stopping Iran from developing nuclear weaponry—and about convincing Tehran that it is.</p>

<p>New generations often retread paths that led their ancestors to destruction. Today, American elites are retreating from hard diplomacy, disarming the military and appeasing their nation's rivals—just as their forebears did after the First World War.</p>
<p>Back then, the democratic world reeled from the bloodletting of the Great War and the ravages of an influenza pandemic. In Russia, Italy, Germany and Japan, dictatorships emerged from the wreckage.</p>
<a>Heinz Guderian</a> later said his orders were to withdraw if so much as one French regiment appeared. The French never came. The totalitarians marched on. Ultimately, the road of passivity and appeasement led to another world war.
<p>Today, the military power of dictatorships is building again. A new axis has formed: China, Russia and Iran. And democracy is retreating once again—in the South China Sea, <a>Ukraine</a>, Afghanistan and <a>the Middle East</a>.</p>
<a>performative diplomacy</a>." How else can one explain the Biden administration's obsession with reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, which Tehran views as a mere speed bump on its road to Persian hegemony at the crossroads of three continents?
<a>pledged never to fight</a> for Britain in 1933, our own secretary of state has
<a>invited the United Nations Human Rights Council</a> (whose members include China, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela) to determine whether the United States is an irredeemably racist nation. Our elites believe they exist to, at best, manage American decline.
<p>We are disarming once again. The Biden administration's fiscal year 2022 defense budget proposal falls below the <a>minimum 3 percent increase</a> over inflation needed to meet current demands and prepare for future challenges.</p>
<a>reduce</a> the size of the Marine Corps. In its current state, the
<a>only marginally capable</a> of meeting the challenges that lay in front of it, and Russia and China will continue to aggressively modernize and expand their armed forces. New budget constraints will only hamper our ability to respond.
<a>People's Liberation Army Daily</a> says China must go to war with America. Taiwan is now in the crosshairs, and with it, the sea and air lanes that control access to Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and India.

<p>Iran has become a hub for Afghan migrants looking to escape hardships brought by the Taliban's takeover, with the country deporting over one million Afghans as of November 21, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Many hopeful migrants start in Afghanistan's western city of Herat, then make the treacherous 300-mile journey south through deserts and mountains, where they cross into Pakistan, then Iran.</p>
<p>An anonymous smuggler in Herat told the Associated Press that since the Taliban takeover, she has been moving about 300 people per week, a dramatic increase from her pre-takeover numbers of 50 to 60 per week.</p>
<p>"The country is destroyed so people have to leave," she said. "I feel like I'm doing the right thing. If some poor person asks me, I can't refuse them. I ask God to help me help them."</p>
<p>Once in Iran, most will stay there to look for work. But a few hope to go farther.</p>
<p>"We're going to get to Europe," said Haroun, a 20-year-old sitting in the bus next to his friend Fuad. Back in their village, there is no work. "We have no choice, the economy here is a wreck. Even if it means our death on the way, we accept that."</p>
<p>The <a>European Union</a> is now bracing for a potential swell in Afghans trying to reach its shores at a time when <a>EU</a> nations are determined to lock down against migrants in general.</p>
<p>But a significant portion of migrants likely intend to stay in Iran, which is struggling to shut its doors. It already hosts more than 3 million Afghans who fled their homeland during the past decades of turmoil.</p>
<p>Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city, is a main hub for Afghans from other parts of the country making their way to Iran.</p>
<p>At one point in Iran, he and others hid in the luggage compartment under a bus to get around checkpoints. He worked for a few weeks doing construction in Shiraz before he was caught in a police raid and expelled.</p>
<p>But he is undaunted. His father recently died, so he has to wait for the 40-day mourning period to end. Then he'll try Iran again.</p>
<p>"What else can I do? Here, there is nothing," he said.</p>

<p>The U.S. Navy seized two large caches of Iranian terrorist weaponry that were headed to insurgents in Yemen, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This represents the United States' largest-ever seizure of weapon shipments from Iran.</p>
<p>Beyond the IRGC, the State Department has said that Iran has supported a number of Iraqi terrorist groups, many of whom provided direct support to Syrian strongman <a>Bashar al-Assad</a>.</p>
<p>However, the seizure of the weapons was not the only victory that the U.S. Navy had, as a similar operation confiscated approximately 1.1 million petroleum barrels from four "foreign-flagged tankers" that were bound for Venezuela.</p>
<p>The oil was sold by the government for over $26 million, and the proceeds of that sale will be put towards a fund for victims of terrorism, the DOJ added.</p>
<p>In addition to the DOJ and State Department, assistance was provided in the counterintelligence field by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<a>FBI</a>).</p>
<p>The State Department told Newsweek that the Biden administration was committed to countering the threat of Iranian terrorist groups, and would "continue to address any effort at sanctions evasion."</p>

<a>Antony Blinken</a> on Thursday in Washington. Reuters cited U.S. officials as saying that potential military scenarios against Iran's nuclear program were to be discussed in the meeting.
<a>United Nations</a> told Newsweek that "this is not the first time that the language of threat against Iran's peaceful nuclear program is being used by the US and the Israeli regime."
<p>"However," the mission added, "we'll continue our peaceful nuclear program and exercise our right of self-defense in the face of any act of aggression against our territory."</p>
<p>The mission further called on Washington to commit to the ongoing JCPOA negotiations amid the seventh round of talks in the Austrian capital of Vienna, and warned Israel against verbal or military attacks against Tehran.</p>
<p>Reached for comment by Newsweek, an Israel Defense Forces official confirmed that the Israeli military was training to conduct operations abroad in response to developments concerning Iran.</p>
<p>Among the planned IDF drills is a massive set of maneuvers set to be held next spring hundreds of miles away across the Mediterranean Sea, roughly the same distance required to strike targets in Iran.</p>
<p>"The Iranian regime continues to pose a serious challenge to Israel's security and the stability of the region," the IDF official said. "Iran constitutes not only a regional, but a global challenge."</p>
<a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a> openly sought to dissuade former President
<a>Barack Obama</a>, whom President
<a>Joe Biden</a> served as vice president, from entering into the agreement alongside Iran and top power China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. Netanyahu applauded Trump's unilateral exit and the "maximum pressure" campaign that ensued.
<p>Asked about military scenarios, <a>Pentagon</a> Press Secretary John Kirby elaborated on Austin's discussion with Gantz during a press conference later Friday.</p>
<p>He added, however, that "we have a robust presence in the region, we have national security interests in the region, and the secretary's job is to defend those national security interests, so we're going to continue to do that."</p>
<p>But the resumption of talks late last month came with no breakthrough, and both Tehran and Washington continue to question the other's commitment.</p>
<a>Instagram</a> post. "The Western parties should know that in the last eight years, enough has been said and many promises have been made without action, but today is the time to act and we are working to reach a serious and good agreement."
<p>"Iran's nuclear program is quite peaceful," he added, "but resolving the alleged concerns of the Western parties is directly related to the complete lifting of sanctions."</p>
<a>Jen Psaki</a> also expressed a U.S. preference to resolve the issue through talks, but warned that "regardless of how we get there, the United States is committed to the fact that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon."
<p>"If diplomacy cannot get on track soon, and if Iran's nuclear program continues to accelerate, then we will have no choice but to take additional measures to further restrict Iran's revenue-producing sectors," Psaki said.</p>
<p>The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran agreed Wednesday to return cameras to the country's Karaj nuclear facility, but with some limits on what footage the agency can see.</p>
<p>Since June, Iran had not allowed the IAEA to replace the cameras. IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the Associated Press on Tuesday of the negative effects that could come from a limited view of the Karaj facility.</p>
<p>According to the IAEA, the cameras will be reinstalled "in the coming days." At the moment, Iran is keeping all the memory cards holding the camera footage.</p>
<p>"The agency and Iran will continue to work on remaining outstanding safeguards issues with the aim of resolving them," the IAEA said.</p>
<p>Iranian media first reported the deal without citing a source. Grossi later tweeted out a statement detailing the arrangement.</p>
<p>"This is important for verification under the Iran nuclear deal, and work will continue to address other outstanding safeguards issues," Grossi wrote.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian reportedly said earlier Wednesday that Iran had "reached a good agreement" with the IAEA.</p>
<p>Tehran blamed the Karaj assault on Israel amid a widening regional shadow war since former President <a>Donald Trump</a> unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's landmark nuclear accord with world powers.</p>
<p>As part of Wednesday's deal, the IAEA said it would "make available a sample camera and related technical information to Iran for analysis by its relevant security and judiciary officials, in the presence of the agency inspectors."</p>
<p>However, Iran still will keep all recordings from the cameras—part of another ongoing dispute between the agency and Tehran sparked by the nuclear deal's collapse.</p>
<p>Negotiations continue in Vienna over trying to restore the nuclear deal. However, Iran under hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi has taken a maximalist position in negotiations.</p>
<p>Anxiety is growing among European nations at the negotiating table.</p>
<p>"Without swift progress, in light of Iran's fast-forwarding of its nuclear program, the [deal] will very soon become an empty shell," they recently warned.</p>
<p>The U.S. has remained outside of direct talks since abandoning the accord.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<div> World Iran <a>Israel</a> <a>War</a></div>
<p>One of Iran's state-run newspapers published an article Wednesday threatening to attack Israel with airstrikes for "just one wrong move!"</p>
<p>The Times published the piece as Israel ramps up its military forces to prepare for a potential strike at Iran, according to Israeli sources.</p>
<p>"An intensification of the Israeli military threats against Iran seems to suggest that the Zionist regime has forgotten that Iran is more than capable of hitting them from anywhere," the article stated.</p>
<p>The Iranian outlet added that its country's military was at "maximum vigilance."</p>
<p>"Despite our confidence in the deterrence situation of the country, our forces have never underestimated the threat of the enemy and are prepared for the smallest of threats in the strategic field."</p>
<p>Accompanying the article was a map that appeared to show Iranian missile targets sprinkled across Israel. The map was reportedly also published on the Times' front page.</p>
<p>The article also referred to Israel as an illegitimate country, despite its having received international recognition by a vast majority of the United Nations' member states.</p>
<p>"The Tehran Times doesn't need to remind the illegitimate regime of Israel of Iran's defense capabilities," the story continued.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the article refers to Israel as a "Zionist regime" multiple times. The ideology in question advocates for a Jewish national state, but is often used as an antisemitic epithet by Israel's opponents.</p>
<p>Harkening back to a 2013 quote from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, the article further threatened to destroy a number of Israeli cities.</p>
<p>The story ended with a final threat from Iran towards Israel: "Keep your hands off!"</p>
<p>"Ramallah and Hebron also seem to be in Iran's list of retaliatory targets should Israel conduct a strike against the Islamic Republic," the article stated.</p>
<p>The Post also noted that, if this were to occur, it would not be the first time that the Iranian-backed rockets have, either on purpose or inadvertently, ended up striking Palestinian cities.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to the press office of the Israeli government for comment.</p>
<p>The Iran nuclear talks between world leaders in Vienna adjourned Friday without reaching a deal, but they hope to resume the discussion before the end of the year.</p>
<p>European diplomats said they are disappointed by the pause. Wan Qun, China's chief negotiator, said she is anticipating the talks "will resume hopefully before the end of the year."</p>
<p>Regardless of the delays, there has been some progress with the negotiations. Iran agreed Wednesday to reinstall damaged cameras at an Iranian site that manufactures centrifuge parts as part of a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>However, the negotiators from Britain, France and Germany are frustrated about the progression of the recent talks.</p>
<p>"There has been some technical progress in the last 24 hours, but this only takes us back nearer to where the talks stood in June," they said.</p>
<p>The three nations also said the other countries in the negotiations are ready to continue the talks as "this negotiation is becoming ever more urgent."</p>
<p>Diplomats from the three European nations said earlier this week that they were "losing precious time dealing with new Iranian positions inconsistent with the JCPOA or that go beyond it."</p>
<p>Iran's nuclear program "is now more advanced than it has ever been," making it critical that Tehran refrain from taking further steps that escalate the situation, they said.</p>
<p>The United States has participated indirectly in the ongoing talks because it withdrew from the accord in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump. President <a>Joe Biden</a> has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal.</p>
<p>Still, there was one sign of progress on a related issue when Iran agreed to reinstall cameras though inspectors remain limited on what footage they can access.</p>
<p>"We hope that Iran is in a position to resume the talks quickly, and to engage constructively so that talks can move at a faster pace," the European negotiators said.</p>
<p>"As we have said, there are weeks not months before the JCPOA's core non-proliferation benefits are lost," they added. "We are rapidly reaching the end of the road for this negotiation."</p>
<p>"For the eighth round, we have a lot of work ahead, a very complex task, I have to say," said Enrique Mora, the <a>European Union</a> diplomat who chaired the talks. "Difficult political decisions have to be taken."</p>
<p>The accord was meant to rein in Iran's nuclear program in return for loosened economic sanctions. Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China are still part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Russia's delegate to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, said the latest round has set a "sound basis for more intensive negotiations."</p>
<p>"The negotiators now much better understand each other," Ulyanov wrote on <a>Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is seeking to build upon a series of peace deals with Arab countries by fortifying ties with the United Arab Emirates, even as he wages war on a particularly contagious strain of COVID-19 at home.</p>
<p>"Straight from the beginning," the senior Israeli official said, "the Prime Minister was greeted with open arms and immense warmth. There was an instant connection."</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a> in 2018. Israel has protested the effort by its U.S. ally to return to the agreement, but President
<a>Joe Biden</a> has so far pressed on with negotiations.
<p>Bennett, whose nation has been regularly embroiled in controversy, crisis and conflict throughout a history spanning less than three-quarters of a century, has taken the war analogy seriously.</p>
<p>"We'll do what we can to protect lives in the fight against COVID and in the face of the threats posed to our people," he added.</p>
<p>Bennett said his approach, which as of Tuesday includes making Israel the first country in the world to administer a fourth vaccine to medical experts and elderly citizens, has been inspired by the results of his recent anti-epidemiological drill.</p>
<p>"The more prepared we are, the greater chances we'll have at winning the war against COVID," he added. "We must move fast, hard and strong."</p>
<p>Ayish shares the Israeli leader's view of the fight against COVID-19 as a war.</p>
<p>"It wasn't clear what the threat was," Ayish added, "but he felt that it's not the end of COVID and we should be ready, and he decided to choose a war game as a platform to deal with that as a war against COVID."</p>
<p>"From their perspective," Ayish said, it was "a very intense exercise and war game."</p>
<p>Ayish acknowledged that some aspects of the exercise were particularly stressful.</p>
<p>But Ayish was pleased with the results, saying that the initiative ultimately "derived the best out of all of" those involved.</p>
<p>Like Bennett, he noted that decision-makers initially adopted a course that only encouraged the spread of the simulated virus.</p>
<p>"I must admit that at the beginning the solutions were going in a certain direction," Ayish said, "and solutions were to allow the Israeli economy and Israeli society to live their life as much as they can."</p>
<p>But as the exercise evolved, the awareness grew among the participants that things had to change, and quickly.</p>
<p>"After they have realized that we are here with a very lethal variant and it has so many aspects," he said, "it led the prime minister to the understanding that we have to close all the entrances into Israel."</p>
<p>He also noted those conducting the exercise "learned that there are different types of PCR tests" with varying accuracy when dealing with a new strain. Millions of PCR tests were later ordered to accommodate the gaps in the system.</p>
<p>Ayish said Bennett's leadership and the exercise as a whole has proved to be a consequential asset that "helps us very much in this war, which has not ended, we are in the middle of it."</p>
<p>The findings were not only shared within Israel, but with other countries as well.</p>
<a>Antony Blinken</a>. The conversation also touched upon the ongoing Iran nuclear deal talks in Vienna, as did Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz's later talks with Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary
<a>Lloyd Austin</a> during a trip to Washington about a week later.
<a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, Bennett continues to cast Iran as an existential threat to his country, even in the midst of a pandemic that has already infiltrated Israel's borders.
<p>Following Gantz's visit, an IDF official confirmed to Newsweek that the Israeli military was actively training to conduct operations abroad in response to developments concerning Iran.</p>
<p>Next spring, the IDF is set to hold a large-scale series of exercises hundreds of miles away across the Mediterranean Sea, roughly the same distance needed to strike targets in Iran.</p>
<p>"The Iranian regime continues to pose a serious challenge to Israel's security and the stability of the region," the IDF official said. "Iran constitutes not only a regional, but a global challenge."</p>
<p>Such moves have drawn the ire of Iran, which sees Israel as the belligerent in a shadowy conflict that has played out across the Middle East.</p>
<p>"This is not the first time that the language of threat against Iran's peaceful nuclear program is being used by the US and the Israeli regime," Iran's permanent mission to the <a>United Nations</a> told Newsweek.</p>
<p>The mission said this peaceful nature has been affirmed by "numerous" reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is barred from inspecting Israel's own widely suspected nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>"However, we'll continue our peaceful nuclear program and exercise our right of self-defense in the face of any act of aggression against our territory," the mission added.</p>
<p>The Iranian mission also urged the U.S. to reverse the Trump-era return to sanctions against the Islamic Republic, and warned Israeli against pursuing any threats.</p>
<a>Jake Sullivan</a> and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert are traveling to Israel and to the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
<p>"I think the focus on Israel, where we're heading, the integration and building on the Abraham Accords has been a central focus of ours," the senior Biden administration official said. "And that will be an important topic of conversation."</p>
<p>But amid these U.S. official visits, Israel's borders remain closed as the war on COVID-19 rages on for a country accustomed to adversity.</p>
<p>"We are very flexible, very agile, and, for us, at the end of the day, when we are facing a crisis, it's like, okay, it's another crisis," Ayish said. "We've been there, we will adapt, and we will react."</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>U.S. Shot Itself in the Leg by Leaving Iran Nuclear Deal: Russian Diplomat</h1><div> By David Brennan <time>On 12/22/21 at 7:47 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> World JCPOA <a>Iran</a></div>
<p>Russia's lead investigator at the Iran nuclear deal revival talks in Vienna has accused the U.S. of "shooting" itself in the leg by withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action during former President Donald Trump's term.</p>
<p>Mikhail Ulyanov—Russia's permanent representative to the International Organizations in Vienna and the head of the Russian negotiating team—made the remark on <a>Twitter</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>President <a>Joe Biden</a> came to power vowing to resurrect the agreement signed by President <a>Barack Obama</a> in 2015. The deal capped Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities and stockpile in exchange for international sanctions relief.</p>
<a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018, dismissing it as a "giant fiction." Trump repeatedly vowed a more comprehensive and restrictive replacement but did not deliver.
<p>In the meantime, Iran expanded its enriched uranium stockpile, spooled up its <a>enrichment capabilities</a>, and began enriching uranium to near-weapons grade.</p>
<p>Iran's breakout time—how long it would take to make a nuclear warhead once the decision to do so is taken—could soon be only a matter of weeks, according to Secretary of State <a>Antony Blinken</a>.</p>
<p>Predictions of a quick U.S. return to the deal under Biden proved overly optimistic. The White House refused Tehran's demands for all Trump-era sanctions to be lifted in return for re-imposed limits on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>Iranian officials returned to Tehran after the latest round of talks for consultations, frustrating European and American negotiators who have warned that the window for a deal is fast closing.</p>
<p>"At some point in the not-so-distant future, we will have to conclude that the JCPOA is no more, and we'd have to negotiate a wholly new different deal, and of course we'd go through a period of escalating crisis," Malley said.</p>
<p>Iran, he said, appears to be "trying to build leverage by expanding their nuclear program and hoping to use that leverage to get a better deal."</p>
<a>military alternatives</a> to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The New York Times reported this month that the White House reviewed military options after the end of the sixth round of Vienna talks.
<a>Jen Psaki</a> told journalists: "Based on the outcome of the last round of talks and the ongoing advancements in Iran's nuclear facilities, we are laying the path for...the groundwork for another path entirely."
<div> News Iran <a>Hunger strike</a></div>
<p>Benjamin Brière, a French tourist imprisoned in Iran, started a hunger strike on Saturday after he was denied a phone call with his family on Christmas Day, according to his sister and lawyer.</p>
<p>Brière, 36, claims he has been experiencing mistreatment in prison, and after "one more mistreatment" after the refusal of the phone call with his family, he began the hunger strike, his sister Blandine Brière told the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Blandine Brière said that her brother wants to "protest…and therefore put his health at risk to move things forward."</p>
<p>"At the moment, we don't see any move, we have no hope of change, of freedom," she was quoted by the AP.</p>
<p>After taking photos in a desert area where photography is banned and asking questions on social media concerning the country's mandatory Islamic headscarf for women, Benjamin Brière was arrested in May 2020.</p>
<p>In March, he was charged with spying and "spreading propaganda against the system."</p>
<p>Blandine Brière described the "difficult" situation of her brother, who doesn't speak the local language, in the prison of the northeastern city of Mashahd, including "psychological torture" when guards promise him a phone call and later say no.</p>
<p>"Physically he was doing OK (until now), but morally he has really started to sink," she said. "It's getting critical. It is really a desperate call for help."</p>
<p>Valent said "the feeling of abandonment and distress" has led Brière "to embark on a hunger strike in order to alert Iranian authorities and French authorities about the absurdity of his detention."</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that French officials in Paris and Tehran have been very closely monitoring the situation and that Brière has been contacted by the French Embassy on Monday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials.</p>
<p>Rights groups accuse hardliners in Iran's security agencies of using foreign detainees as bargaining chips for money or influence in negotiations with the West. Tehran denies it, but there have been such prisoner exchanges in the past.</p>
<p>In March 2020, Iran and France swapped French researcher Roland Marchal for Iranian engineer Jalal Ruhollahnejad.</p>

<p>IRGC naval, air and land forces have been conducting joint drills this week, Iranian state media reported, which IRGC officials said included the use of indigenous smart bombs, cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>IRGC chief Major General Hossein Salami described the drills—named Payambar-e Azam 17, or "The Great Prophet"—as "precise" and as showcasing the "quality, effectiveness and accuracy of the systems," according to the Mehr News Agency.</p>
<p>The commander of IRGC naval forces, Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, told reporters on Tuesday that the second day of exercises were designed to test Iranian defense of islands in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>"Today, we conducted an exercise in defending the islands and showed that we will destroy the enemy before approaching the islands," Tangsiri said, according to Mehr. "Our war game was to destroy the enemy before it can reach our shores."</p>
<p>Tensions between the U.S. and Iran—rarely low for decades—have again been ramping up over the failure to agree a deal to revive the JCPOA, which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018.</p>
<p>The <a>seventh round</a> of talks in Vienna ended earlier this December without a deal, and it is unclear when the next round will begin.</p>
<p>European JCPOA signatories—the U.K., France and Germany, collectively known as the E3—warned soon after in a joint statement that time was running out.</p>
<p>"There are weeks not months before the JCPOA's core non-proliferation benefits are lost," the joint statement warned. "We are rapidly reaching the end of the road for this negotiation."</p>
<p>Iran's lead representative Ali Bagheri Kani has accused the European powers of negotiating in bad faith. "Some actors persist in their blame game habit, instead of real diplomacy," he wrote on <a>Twitter</a> after the E3 statement.</p>
<p>"We proposed our ideas early, worked constructively flexibly to narrow gaps; diplomacy is a 2-way street."</p>
<p>The U.S. too, is sounding the alarm. National Security Adviser <a>Jake Sullivan</a> admitted that talks were "not going well" after the most recent round of discussions, acknowledging that the U.S. did not see a clear route back into the accord.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Israel Says It's Open to 'Good' Iran Nuclear Deal But Doesn't Believe It's Possible</h1><div> By Katie Wermus <time>On 12/28/21 at 10:44 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday said he is open to a "good" Iran nuclear deal but doesn't believe it's possible right now based on how negotiations are going.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, of course there can be a good deal," Bennett said to Israeli Army Radio. "Is that, at the moment, under the current dynamic, expected to happen? No, because a much harder stance is needed."</p>
<p>The eighth round of talks to restore the 2015 nuclear deal resumed in Vienna on Monday, 10 days after they were paused because the Iranian negotiator returned home to consult with the government.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told state TV that a "quick and proper agreement in the near future" is a possibility if the other parties involved in the negotiation show "seriousness alongside goodwill."</p>
<p>Then-President <a>Donald Trump</a> withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018. Iran and five world powers have had been discussing the possibility of restoring it.</p>
<p>Iran previously said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Israel opposed the 2015 deal, which gave Iran sanctions relief in return for a curb on its nuclear program.</p>
<p>Bennett reiterated that Israel was not bound by any accord, leaving it room to maneuver militarily.</p>
<a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a> that he had agreed to a policy of "no surprises" with Washington, meaning that it would be frank about its military intentions regarding Iran with its prime ally and thus be potentially hobbled.
<p>"Israel will always maintain its right to act and will defend itself by itself," he said.</p>
<p>Bennett has urged negotiators to tow a firmer line against Iran. Israel is not a party to the talks but has engaged in a blitz of diplomacy on the sidelines in an attempt to sway allies to put more pressure on Iran to rein in its nuclear program.</p>
<p>The previous round of talks, the first after a five-month-plus gap caused by the arrival of a new hardline government in Iran, was marked by tensions over new Iranian demands.</p>
<p>Israel says it wants an improved deal that places tighter restrictions on Iran's nuclear program and addresses Iran's long-range missile program and its support for hostile proxies along Israel's borders.</p>
<p>Israel also says that the negotiations must be accompanied by a "credible" military threat to ensure that Iran does not delay indefinitely.</p>

<p>Firefighters contained a fire at the Syrian port of Latakia on Tuesday, officials said, after Israel missiles struck the port for the second time this month.</p>
<p>The attack targeted the port that manages a majority of the imports to Syria, which is facing a 10-year civil war and sanctions enforced from Western countries. Firefighters combated the flames after the attack, the military official said.</p>
<p>An Al-Ikhbariyah reporter said Tuesday's attack could be heard in Tartus, another coastal city more than 80 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) away.</p>
<p>Port manager Amjad Suleiman told Al-Ikhbariyah the damage was much larger than that caused by the December 7 attack and required a major effort to move in-tact containers away from the flames.</p>
<p>At the time of the December 7 attack, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitoring group, said the airstrike hit arms shipments destined for Iran-backed fighters.</p>
<p>"The increase in the scope of operations over the past year has led to a significant disruption of the movement of weapons into the various arenas by our enemies," he said. The statement did not elaborate.</p>
<p>In its year-end assessment, the Israeli military confirmed carrying out strikes on dozens of targets in Syria in what it called "the campaign between the wars." Three targets also were struck in Lebanon, it said. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>It also reported about 100 operations by the Israeli Navy, including dozens of "special operations." It did not elaborate, but the navy operates in both the Mediterranean and Red seas.</p>
<p>The Israeli military rarely comments on individual attacks or discusses details of such operations.</p>
<p>Some past strikes have targeted the main airport in the Syrian capital of Damascus.</p>
<p>Israel said it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, such as Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group, which has fighters in Syria. It says it attacks arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.</p>

<p>As negotiations aimed at restoring the broken 2015 nuclear deal were set to resume, Iran requested that the U.S. and allied governments pledge to allow Tehran to export crude oil.</p>
<p>The move weakened Iran's economy as exports of crude oil sharply decreased and international oil companies dropped deals with Tehran.</p>
<p>"Guarantee and verification [of the removal of sanctions] are among topics that we have focused on," he said.</p>
<p>The new, conservative administration of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has repeatedly demanded the removal of all economic sanctions before Iran reins in its nuclear advances.</p>
<p>Separately on Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said it would be "intolerable" for the West to demand anything from Tehran beyond compliance with the original deal.</p>
<p>Iran has steadily abandoned all of the accord's limits since the American withdrawal and is now enriching uranium to 60% purity—a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels. It spins ever-more advanced centrifuges also barred by the deal.</p>
<p>From Israel, which fiercely opposed the 2015 deal, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid repeated his country's vow that Iran will never get a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>The talks involve all the parties to the original nuclear deal—Iran, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Iran refuses to talk directly to the American envoy, who is engaging through the other signatories.</p>
<p>Khatibzadeh told reporters on Monday that Enrique Mora, the <a>European Union</a> diplomat chairing the talks, would ferry messages and drafts between Iran and the U.S.</p>
<p>"We present our views in writing, and the dialogue is ongoing in Vienna in an indirect way," he said.</p>

<p>An Iranian official has fired more barbs at the Western signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal, ahead of the resumption of talks to revive the accord in Vienna next week.</p>
<p>Iran's ambassador to the U.K., Mohsen Baharvand, is the latest Iranian diplomat to criticize the conduct of the U.S., France, Germany and the U.K. in the ongoing negotiations, which after seven rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock.</p>
<a>military action</a> to slow Iran's nuclear program.
<p>"When we do not negotiate with them, they use all their tools and hypocritically pretend to be in favor of dialogue and engagement," Baharvand wrote on his <a>Instagram</a> account, as reported by Iran's Mehr News Agency.</p>
<p>Iran and its European and American partners have blamed one another for the failure of the recent rounds of talks, both sides suggesting the other is making unrealistic demands designed to be rejected.</p>
<a>Russia</a> and China—have expressed public support for JCPOA revival. The deal was thrown into turmoil in 2018 when then-President
<a>Donald Trump</a> withdrew from the accord, vowing to force Tehran to accept a new and more restrictive replacement.
<p>Despite years of U.S. "maximum pressure" via sanctions and diplomatic pressure, Iran refused to return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran began moving away from the accord piecemeal, expanding its uranium enrichment capabilities, growing its enriched uranium stockpile, and increasing the quality of its enriched uranium to near-weapons grade level.</p>
<p>Iran has since moved far beyond the limits set by the JCPOA, and its breakout time—how long it would take Tehran to build a nuclear weapon—could soon be only a matter of weeks, according to Secretary of State <a>Antony Blinken</a>.</p>
<p>"Without swift progress, in light of Iran's fast-forwarding of its nuclear program, the JCPOA will very soon become an empty shell," they said.</p>
<p>Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, fired back on <a>Twitter</a>, suggesting the E3 were engaging in "their blame game habit, instead of real diplomacy." Diplomacy, he said, "is a two-way street."</p>
<p>Tensions are high as representatives prepare for the next round of Vienna talks on Monday.</p>
<p>From Iran, Abolfazl Amouei—the spokesperson for the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee—said on Friday that Western negotiators should "stop stubbornness and accept Iran's proposals for removal of sanctions."</p>
