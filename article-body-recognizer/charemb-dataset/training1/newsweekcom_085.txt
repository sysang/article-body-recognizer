<a>boycotts</a> that have driven most of them away from his show—off television, but Fox News itself off the cable spectrum in its entirety, didn't really take off until after the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6. While many
<a>Democrats</a> have sought to label all Trump-supporting
<a>Democratic politicians</a> and liberal media outlets—especially rival network
<a>Oliver Darcy</a> and daytime host
<a>Brianna Keilar</a>, have also taken up the cause of de-platforming Fox News. They've been seconded by The Washington Post's
<a>Max Boot</a> and The New York Times'
<a>Nicholas Kristof</a>, who have both lamented that the
<a>Senate</a> couldn't put the network on trial alongside Trump.
<a>irregularities</a> in the count should have been silenced is more in line with the pre-election efforts of mainstream outlets and social media companies that sought to kill all reporting—such as the New York Post's revelations about

<a>Barack Obama</a>, who blamed it for resistance to his policies. It is that popularity, among other factors, that will likely doom the effort to force Fox out of business.
<p>But as large as Fox News has loomed over the media landscape, it was not until the election of <a>Donald Trump</a> that the Left's anger escalated from annoyance over its existence to a growing determination to silence it outright.</p>
<p>If you are offended by Tucker Carlson's opinions, don't watch him. And if your objective is the defense of democracy, then a campaign whose goal is to prevent his views from being heard should be a line that you wouldn't think of crossing.</p>

<a>conservatives have "weaponized" it</a> to defend their rights in conflicts between religious believers and advocates for gay marriage and other, more fashionable causes.
<p>But now that the trial has begun, media coverage has focused not so much on whether Chauvin's defense can prove reasonable doubt with respect to the cause of Floyd's death, but on whether the entire exercise endangers the community as a whole.</p>
<a>is widespread</a>. That's hardly unusual in highly publicized murder trials. But the stakes involved in the outcome of this trial have made it all but inevitable that the defendant's lawyers
<a>would outrage</a> the television audience.

<a>hiring social media influencers</a> to produce pre-packaged spin about the trial in order to counteract what it called "misinformation," although that plan for astroturfing public opinion was withdrawn in the face of criticism.
<p>Yet there is another underlying factor legitimizing what in other circumstances might be dismissed as a normal mob mentality—whether actual or virtual.</p>
<p>The Left believes its legal advocates must never defend those who are out of step with liberal opinion, so lawyers like Harvard University professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended President <a>Donald Trump</a>, <a>are ostracized.</a></p>

<p>The judge presiding over the trial of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is urging jurors to deliberate the case until 6 p.m. moving forward due to an "astronomical spike" in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>However, Maxwell's defense attorney Laura Menninger opposed the idea in court on Monday. She claimed that the idea of making the jury stay later sounded more like Nathan wants them to hurry up and make a decision on the case.</p>
<p>"We would object to trying to urge them to stay later if they are not asking to do so and aren't expressing any difficulty in proceeding with the deliberations that they are currently undertaking," she argued.</p>
<p>Tuesday marked the fourth full day of deliberations as jurors decide Maxwell's fate on the six charges alleging she played a crucial role in Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls between 1994 and 2004.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers have said Maxwell, 60, is being used as a scapegoat by prosecutors after the U.S. government was embarrassed by Epstein's suicide at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited a sex trafficking trial.</p>
<p>Maxwell was arrested in July 2020 and has remained in jail after Nathan repeatedly rejected bail attempts, including a $28.5 million package with 24-hour armed guards to ensure she did not flee.</p>
