<div> <h3> Does society pathologize the neurodiverse population? </h3> </div>
<a>neurological differences</a> are normal and have existed throughout human history, they should be respected, understood, and supported, rather than pathologized or viewed as disordered. There is nothing to cure. Modifying
<a>the environment</a> of a neurodiverse individual, reducing stigma, and prioritizing each person’s inherent dignity will, proponents argue, allow for such individuals to discover innate talents and thrive within a diverse society.
<div> <h3> Should low-functioning, severe autism be viewed separately? </h3> </div>
<a>severe autism</a> argue that portraying the autism spectrum as just “different” minimizes the challenges that many
<a>autistic</a> individuals and their caretakers face. They point out that those with extreme neurological differences are simply not capable of caring for themselves. The
<a>opposing argument</a> says that neurodiversity can help the severely autistic, not hurt them. They propose that seeing severely affected individuals from a traditional medical perspective hurts everyone.

<a>severe autism</a> as well as related conditions. Parents feel that their children suffer from being marginalized and that their needs are left unheard.
<div> <h3> Is there a bridge between high function and low function? </h3> </div>
<a>Asperger's</a> syndrome and low-functioning autism disorder have been removed from the
<a>DSM</a>, which now lists only one category,
<a>autism spectrum</a> disorder. However, the gap between high-functioning and low-functioning can be wide. Some experts, including researcher Simon Baron-Cohen, argue that
<a>a middle ground</a> could be reached between the two views, with better explanations of what constitutes different and disabled, and what it means to have a “normal” brain.

<a>psychologically and socially transform into a young adult.</a> Breaking from their

<a>hormonal</a> and biological changes that occur can lead adolescents to feel
<a>anxious and self-conscious and to require more privacy and become preoccupied with their appearance,</a> which can influence how they are perceived and accepted.
<div> <h3> Why do teens make bad decisions and take risks? </h3> </div>
<a>risk-taking</a> is often blamed on hormonal changes, but relationships play a key role as well. The teenage years are devoted to creating friendships that can serve individuals for life. Along those lines, research suggests that
<a>adolescents are motivated by peer acceptance</a> more than adult perceptions—for better or for worse.

<h2> How Do I Talk to My Teen? </h2>
<p>Speaking openly with adolescents about changes that they are experiencing can be a challenge for any parent, especially given the shift in the parent-child relationship during this time.</p>
<a>intimacy</a> and trust—while simultaneously allowing the teen to process their experience.
<div> <h3> How can I maintain a close relationship with a teen? </h3> </div>
<a>maintain a close relationship</a> despite that process. Express interest and ask questions about your teen’s new passions. Welcome their friends and provide family structure. In disciplinary situations, critique choices rather than character.
<div> <h3> How do I talk to a teen about healthy sex? </h3> </div>
<a>porn</a>, pleasure, and love. During these conversations,
<a>listen openly and non-judgmentally.</a> Shutting down a vulnerable adolescent with negativity or judgment can lead to
<a>fear</a>. Being open encourages them to trust you with future questions and to develop a healthy relationship with sex.
<div> <h3> How do I talk to a teen about drugs and alcohol? </h3> </div>
<a>smoking</a>. But parents can
<a>inform the choices they make with guidance,</a> such as that the decision to use should be intentional, not automatic and a personal choice, not a socially-pressured one. Parents should discuss the topic openly, honestly, and continually.
<div> <h3> How can I support a teen when they’re upset? </h3> </div>
<a>bored</a>, maybe they can find a new hobby or sport. Adolescence can be an emotional time, but
<a>these ideas and others can help</a>.
<h2> How Does Mental Health Change During Adolescence? </h2>

<a>depression</a>, and other forms of distress that are developmentally appropriate and will not necessarily endure. It’s difficult to know when a problem merits clinical
<a>attention</a>, but when in doubt, querying a school counselor or another mental professional is the best course of action.
<div> <h3> Why are teenagers today so stressed and anxious? </h3> </div>
<a>91 percent of Generation Z has felt physical or emotional symptoms of stress,</a> such as depression or anxiety. This
<a>stress</a> may be due to parental trends like overscheduling, effects of social media like negative social comparisons, and historical events like the great recession and mass shootings.

<div> <h3> How common are mental health disorders in college? </h3> </div>
<a>one in three first-year college students</a> meets the criteria for a mental health disorder, research suggests. An array of factors can contribute to the onset of mental illness during this time: the transition to college, childhood
<a>trauma</a>, biological changes, financial stress, academic pressure, lack of sleep,

<p>Denial is a defense mechanism in which an individual refuses to recognize or acknowledge objective facts or experiences. It’s an unconscious process that serves to protect the person from discomfort or anxiety. </p>
<p>For example, a loved one may insist that she doesn’t have a problem with alcohol, despite the fact that it interferes with work and family life. Or a loyal employee may refuse to see signs that his boss is stealing from the company.</p>
