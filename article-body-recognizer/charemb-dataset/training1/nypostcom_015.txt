<p>Militant transgender advocates are imposing their agenda with uncompromising zeal on schoolchildren.</p>
<p>These issues grab the headlines, but they’re less harmful to most students than the damage being done by the distortion of the school curriculum. From the youngest age, students are being brainwashed with gender ideology.</p>
<p>Children — as young as 5 — are being encouraged to disregard their anatomy and choose their gender based on their feelings.</p>
<p>Last week, a California mother raged at the Spreckels Union School District board for <a>allowing teachers to coach her 12-year-old daughter</a> on becoming a boy, choosing a boy’s name and hiding the plan from the family.</p>
<a>occurs in about 0.6 percent of the adult population</a>, according to the UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute. Anyone afflicted should be treated with kindness and offered medical help. 
<p>Public schools shouldn’t be taking sides. But in Maine, and many other states, they are.</p>
<p>On Dec. 8, when the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case involving Maine’s public schools, the state’s attorney, Christopher Taub, insisted that they’re “religiously neutral.” That’s a laugh.</p>
<a>ACLU declares that</a> “religion is being used as an excuse to discriminate against others.”
<a>IOC announced it’s recommending eliminating any tests</a> whatsoever — including of testosterone levels — for transgender athletes to compete in women’s events. Fairness be damned.
<a>already told the transgender crowd</a> that “your president has your back.” His administration is unlikely to strike a middle ground that respects the majority as well as the transgender minority.
<p>Truth is, if students are to be educated, rather than indoctrinated, parents will have to stand up to the transgender militants. No one else has the nerve.</p>

<p>For working people, the monthly payments were merely an advance on their tax refunds. But parents who choose not to work have been getting no-strings money to support their nonworking lifestyles.</p>
<p>Democrats have been pushing to extend the free monthly payments through 2022 as part of the Build Back Better Act, with a plan to make them permanent.</p>
<a>talks the talk</a>. “My dad used to say, ‘Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.’” 
<p>Sorry, but most Americans don’t want to support the moochers.</p>
<p>It succeeded, reducing the welfare rolls, ameliorating child poverty and helping single mothers become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Yet today’s Democratic Party spurns that model. Democrats tend to blame unemployment on racism or a rigged economy and argue that people deserve dignity whether they choose to work or not.</p>
<p>Of course, all human beings deserve dignity. But not a seat on the couch in front of the TV, funded by people who toil.</p>
<p>Democratic politicians all over the nation are pushing to provide a monthly basic income to the nonworking poor, courtesy of taxpayers. They’ve formed Mayors for a Guaranteed Income.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is sending out monthly $1,000 checks to 2,000 residents. </p>
<p>Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is using millions in federal pandemic relief funding to distribute $500-a-month cash stipends to randomly chosen low-income recipients. That ought to enrage anyone who works and pays taxes.</p>
<p>Every time you pass one of those signs, you can think of Manchin. And thank him for holding the line against turning taxpayers into suckers supporting the freeloaders. </p>
<h1> If you’re the wrong race, the push for health-care ‘equity’ could kill you</h1>

<p>If you’re white and middle class, the push for health-care “equity” could kill you.</p>
<p>If the public doesn’t push back soon, getting fair treatment in the hospital will become as hard as getting into college or getting hired on your own merits can be. </p>

<p>But patients don’t want to worry that they’re getting less care because of the color of their skin or their ZIP code.</p>
<a>has been pressing</a> the Oregon Health Authority to adopt a triage scheme similar to Pitt’s, considering a patient’s home address as well as medical conditions. And doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital
<a>are pushing</a> for a “reparations framework” to offset past discrimination in access to the cardiovascular care unit.
<p>These schemes should horrify most Americans. No one wants to be the victim of racism in medicine — and reverse racism is just as bad.</p>

<h1> In allocating everything from pandemic relief to scarce COVID treatments, Team Biden is racist</h1>
<div> January 11, 2022 5:47pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 9:22pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Racial favoritism is affecting every way this administration treats Americans.</p>
<p>So a black patient with no health problems automatically will be put ahead of a white patient with no health problems. That’s sickening. Every patient deserves to be treated as an individual, not a member of a group.</p>
<p>Biden’s Treasury Department is rolling out a $10 billion program to aid small-business owners with loans and grants. Businesses owned by minorities, women, non-English speakers and ex-cons go to the front of the line.</p>
<a>white farmers were ineligible</a>.
<p>Biden’s <a>Restaurant Revitalization Fund</a> pushed minority and female restaurant owners to the front of the line for whopping giveaways — up to $10 million per business owner. Sorry, white men.</p>
<p>The infrastructure bill passed in November is chock full of anti-white racism. It includes grants to install solar and wind technologies in depressed areas. But when contractors bid, minority-owned businesses will get selected first. </p>
<p>The bill also allocates money to improve urban traffic patterns. Contractors and subcontractors get priority only if they’re owned by minorities or women. White male business owners can take a hike.</p>
<a>urged the Supreme Court</a> not to hear a challenge to Harvard University’s admissions policies, which plaintiffs say deny admissions to Asians who have grades and test scores far higher than black and white applicants. 
<a>to Pew Research</a>. In November 2020, California, the most left-wing and racially diverse state in the country, voted against reinstating affirmative action in state hiring and public-university admissions.
<p>Biden’s Education Department is <a>dangling federal grants to encourage state education</a> bureaucrats to adopt critical race theory and the factually challenged New York Times “1619 Project.”</p>
<p>The administration continues the indoctrination and reverse racism in the workplace. Is this what Americans want? Absolutely not. Three-quarters of Americans oppose using race to decide who’s hired and promoted, <a>Pew found</a>.</p>
<p>Biden is ignoring that. He’s cynically giving his political backers what they want and in the process ripping deep wounds into the nation.</p>
<p>When blacks and Latinos are ushered to the front of the line for medical treatments, get first dibs on pandemic relief funds or get hired faster or admitted to college more easily, other people suffer. Lives and livelihoods are affected.</p>
<p>Americans want to be treated as individuals and to treat others that way.</p>

<p>New data from the city’s Health Department show new positive test cases down to about 33,000 a day; last Friday it was 90,132. It shows how Mayor Eric Adams was absolutely right to insist that schools remain open. </p>
<p>Alas, schools Chancellor David Banks is signaling that a remote-learning option is now under consideration, due to “political pressure.” Sorry, but that’s no excuse. Remote-learning has proved near useless.</p>
<p>Which is why Adams was right to insist that the safest and best place for kids “<a>is in a school building</a>.” </p>
<p>Plenty of other school rules will need tailoring, too — starting for example with blanket masking rules — as the city, and world, move beyond the pandemic.</p>
<p>For the sake of the kids, pray Adams and Banks stand firm. </p>
<h1> New York state health council approves Hochul booster mandate for health care workers</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 11, 2022 2:57pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 8:25pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Public Health and Health Planning Council passed the measure after two hours of often stormy testimony.</p>
<p>Employees at hospitals and nursing homes are required to get their booster shots within two weeks of eligibility, which is based on when they got their first vaccine jabs. Many would have to get their booster shot immediately.</p>
<p>“You’re going to create a dangerous situation at nursing home across the state,” said James Clyne, CEO of LeadingAge New York that represents many of the state’s 611 nursing facilities.</p>
<p>Clyne said about three-quarters of the nursing homes he represents have already restricted admissions of new residents because of staffing shortages.</p>
<p>He said the booster mandate should be shelved until the state budget is approved in late March or early April. In her <a>state of the state </a>address last week, Hochul proposed retention bonuses for health care workers.</p>
<p>Even members of the health board urged Hochul and the state Health Department to take staffing issues into account when implementing and enforcing the booster mandate.</p>
<p>This mandate could have a “dramatic effect on the ground, possibly driving staff out at the wrong time,” said health council member Hugh Thomas, executive vice president of Rochester Regional Health.</p>
<p>“We are right now receiving a significant amount of questions and resistance to it to a booster mandate,” Thomas said.</p>
<p>He supports the booster mandate from a “public health perspective” but said calling for immediate compliance could cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>But Hochul defended the booster mandate last Friday, saying it will help prevent staffers from getting infected and sick with the latest COVID outbreak caused by the highly contagious Omicron strain.</p>
<p>“We are already losing health care workers because of them testing positive without symptoms. They’ve been going home … It’s been a source of enormous stress,” Hochul said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hochul said the state saw 160 deaths related to the virus on Monday while 12,540 New Yorkers were hospitalized — continuing an upward trend. The Health Department recorded another 48,686 new positive cases.</p>
<p>But a significant chunk of the patients were hospitalized for <a>other health reasons </a>and only tested positive for COVID upon admission.</p>

<h1> Kathy Hochul admits her controversial mask mandate ‘didn’t make a difference’ in NYC</h1>
<div> December 14, 2021 1:22pm <div> Updated <div> December 14, 2021 8:07pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul all but admitted Tuesday that the Big Apple doesn’t need her controversial mask mandate due to its success in batting the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Well, this is not — there’s very little difference between what we’re doing and what New York City has already done,” she said.</p>
<p>“So, if New York City had been — had not had taken their own steps, then we would have absolutely had that surgical approach.”</p>
<p>Hochul added: “And I would have looked at the numbers and seen [hospital] bed capacity, which is pretty good here in New York City; watching that closely. Infections were not high.”</p>
<p>The governor then made an apparent reference to the surprise, Dec. 27 deadline that Mayor de Blasio announced last week for private-sector workers to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>“So, yes, but it didn’t make a difference because they already had a more restrictive requirement in place,” Hochul said.</p>
<p>“So at that point, it just made sense.”</p>
<p>Hochul added: “I want to make sure that I offered flexibility. Flexibility. The result is still good. I want everybody vaccinated, but for those who choose not, I wish they would.”</p>
<p>“We’re just simply saying, a mask. But when it comes to other policies, I do plan to make it more surgical based on what’s going on there,” she said.</p>
<p>Masks are now <a>required in city schools</a>, on <a>mass transit</a> and in health care facilities under orders from de Blasio, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Health, respectively.</p>
<p>But de Blasio has not mandated masks elsewhere in the city and last month only advised New Yorkers “to get those masks back on” in indoor, public places amid the <a>emergence of the Omicron variant</a> of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>She also said there’s no legal requirement for the state to fund enforcement of her mandate, which carries fines of $1,000 per violation.</p>
<p>“Counties have always had to enforce public health requirements. That’s what they do,” she said.</p>
<p>“I encourage the counties to do this, but it’s also — this is also up to individuals. Individuals are asked to follow regulations and in general, follow laws. And that is what we’re continuing to do here.”</p>
<h1> Gov. Hochul apologizes to families of nursing home COVID victims in closed-door meeting</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> October 12, 2021 7:25pm <div> Updated <div> October 12, 2021 8:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“At the very top of the meeting, after we introduced ourselves, she (Hochul) leaned in pretty hard and opened up with an apology to the families about what they had to go through as a result of these policies,” Kim said.</p>
<p>“It was obviously a private apology, but I think it really touched the families. That’s something they’ve been asking for — to be treated decently as human beings.”</p>
<p>He added: “It was a genuine, empathetic moment that stood out to us.”</p>
<p>It was a stark change from the behavior of Cuomo’s lackeys, the lawmaker said.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t an inkling of dismissiveness or her saying that we don’t have the facts — as the previous governor used to be — there was no dismissiveness in her tone.”</p>
<p>The families and Kim, whose uncle died of suspected COVID-19 last year in a nursing home, had been requesting a sit-down with Hochul since she took over following Cuomo’s resignation in late August.</p>
<p>The roughly hour-long meeting on Tuesday afternoon took place at the governor’s Manhattan offices and was “very emotional” with “lots of crying going on,” Kim said.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s been 19 months, it still feels raw and fresh. We still feel like our family members just passed yesterday,” Rivera told The Post.</p>
<p>The group requested an announcement from the state that the Department of Health’s March 25, 2020 mandate that nursing homes <a>admit coronavirus patients</a> had “led to thousands of untimely and unnecessary deaths.”</p>
<li>That Hochul support a “bipartisan investigation with subpoena power into the nursing home crisis”; </li>
<li>That she release all remaining nursing home data and pending Freedom of Information Law requests; </li>
<li>That she direct the DOH to conduct a “re-audit” of all COVID-related nursing home deaths;</li>
<li>Pass a bill creating a nursing home victims compensation fund; </li>
<li>and that she dedicate a “nursing home victim memorial.”</li>
<p>“It was a good first meeting and they committed to continue to work with us on our requests,” Kim said, adding that governor’s staff also spoke with the group to discuss details of the requests following the face-to-face.</p>
<p>NYPD detective Haydee Pabey, 54, who lost her 72-year-old mother Elba Pabey to COVID-19 in a nursing home, was also at the meeting — and was thankful for Hochul’s apology.</p>
<p>“It was hitting a brick wall with the last administration,” Pabey added. “We had no answers and no one would get back to us.”</p>
<p>Peter Arbeeny, 55, the owner of an air conditioning business who lost his 89-year-old dad Norman Arbeeny to the virus, also appreciated the apology, but was more cautious.</p>
<p>“It was a good first step for a new governor,” he said. “I won’t know what it means yet until we see these promises turned into actions.”</p>
<a>would be “very transparent” </a>when it comes to releasing documents pertaining to COVID-19 nursing home deaths 
<p>Kim said the gov’s legislative director would also be working with the group on a memorial <a>and compensation fund</a>.</p>
<p>He noted that Hochul seemed inclined to get another meeting on the books once the <a>new health commissioner</a>, Mary Bassett, comes in, following the <a>resignation</a> of Cuomo appointee Howard Zucker.</p>
<a>a key figure in the Cuomo administration</a>, whose March 25, 2020 directive is blamed for putting many of the casualties of nursing homes in harm’s way by mandating that COVID-19 infected patients be sent back to nursing homes from hospitals.
<p> He is also accused of helping Cuomo and his aides hide the pandemic’s true death toll across the state and in its nursing homes.</p>
<p>“One thing that is clear is as soon as the new commissioner of health comes in, she personally would like to participate in a follow up discussion,” Kim said.</p>
<p>“It’s important going forward that families have access, and an ability for them to shape policies that impact their families,” he added.</p>
<p>“Governor Hochul is committed to transparency and restoring trust in government, and she looks forward to working with Assemblymember Kim on these priorities,” said Hochul spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays. </p>

<h1> The self-inflicted tragedy of the Tristate mass exodus</h1>
<div> January 4, 2022 6:28pm <div> Updated <div> January 4, 2022 6:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>However many may return when they see the pandemic has ended, the whole Tristate area continued to hemorrhage people last year, as did other heavily Democratic states. Blame heavy-handed responses to COVID on top of insane taxes. </p>
<p>The whole Northeast lost ground, as did California.</p>
<p>And nearly a third of exiting New Yorkers cited “family” as a primary factor, far more than those pointing to “cost.” (In short, many left for the same reasons as The Post’s own Karol Markowicz.)</p>
<p>Paying movers costs a lot more than renting a U-Haul, so it’s no surprise that the movers’ survey shows that the exodus also slams New York’s tax base, as those making $150,000 or more made up nearly half of those leaving.</p>
<p>Separately, new Census numbers last week showed that New York’s population fell 319,020, or 1.6%, in the 12 months leading up to July 1, 2021 — the biggest single-year drop in state history.</p>
<p>COVID will fade soon enough, but time alone won’t bring many exiles home: The leaders of New York and similar states will need to show they’ve changed their ways if they hope to reverse this exodus.</p>

<p>President Trump gets credit — and takes heat — for many things, but many folks don’t even know about one of his best accomplishments: blocking the federal government’s power grab for control of America’s suburbs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the feds began their campaign to force Westchester’s capitulation by halting millions of dollars in federal funds designated to help the county’s neediest. How’s that for moral high ground?</p>
<p>The impasse finally ended with the election of Donald Trump. Elections matter.</p>
<p>But the big win came last month, when — based on Westchester’s experience and expertise from groups like Americans for Limited Government — the Trump administration replaced Team Obama’s AFFH regulation with its own.</p>
<p>And builders are now more likely to build affordable housing, since the attached strings have been removed.</p>
<p>The United States needs affordable housing. By replacing social engineering with common sense, guarded by strong nondiscrimination laws, the country is now better positioned to meet that need — and that’s a victory for everyone.</p>

<h1> Kathy Hochul is just Cuomo version 2.0 — we need a new path in Albany</h1>

<a>book deal</a> he got in the bargain.
<p>So you might forgive New Yorkers who fear that her ascent to chief executive represents nothing more than Cuomo, Version 2.0. In her first days in office, she has only confirmed those concerns. Consider the evidence:</p>
<ul><li>Her top aide is married to a partner at the a high-powered Albany lobbying firm, Bolton St. John’s, that is extremely close to Team Cuomo.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Despite her pledge that transparency would be the “hallmark of her administration,” one week after making the vow, she suspended the state’s Open Meetings Law.</li></ul>
<ul><li>She retained most of Cuomo’s top advisers — including Health Commissioner Howard Zucker, who’s central to the nursing-home scandal.</li></ul>
<ul><li>She chose as her lieutenant a state senator who helped pass Cuomo’s disastrous bail “reform” and who has called for defunding the police.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Her order mandating masks in schools even came with standard Cuomo-esque arrogance: “Get used to it.”</li></ul>
<p>And as was the case with Cuomo the past several years, Hochul seems to think her most important constituency is the far-left progressives in her party.</p>
<p>Here’s a little of what that looks like:</p>
<li>Term limits for all state lawmakers.</li>
<li>Lower, flatter and fairer tax rates.</li>
<li>Reduction of debt and spending.</li>
<li>Elimination of job-killing regulations and mandates.</li>
<li>Greater educational choice for all families.</li>
<li>Repeal of the Cuomo-Hochul administration’s bail and discovery “reforms” that empower evildoers while undermining police and endangering law-abiders.</li>
<li>Strengthening the state ethics administration with true independence</li>
<p>And I did it all with a Democrat-led Board of Legislators, in a county with three times as many Democrats as Republicans. Sanity and balance need to be restored in this state. And yes, it can be done again in Albany.</p>

<p>Durant suffered the injury when teammate Bruce Brown fell into his knee in the second quarter of Saturday’s home win over the Pelicans.</p>
<p>Cardone is NYU Langone Sports Health’s chief of the Division of Primary Care Sports Medicine, and he surmised that a four to six week timeline would be appropriate for a Grade 1 or mild Grade 2, the latter indicating mild tearing.</p>
<p>Dr. Rajpal Brar said the average recovery time among NBA players was 41 days.</p>
<p>When Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in February 2017, he missed a little over five weeks.</p>
<p>“This might be a similar injury to that. … He’ll probably have fluid or what we call edema around the ligament,” Cardone said, adding that Durant’s heavy workload (36.5 minutes) played no role in the freak injury.</p>
<p>Joe Harris (ankle) has joined the Nets on this road trip. He won’t play on the trip but has been given the green light to resume shooting.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he’s on the trip,” Nash said. “He’s just started to do some very light shooting. So he won’t play on this trip.”</p>
<p>Harden took a knee to the left leg in the third quarter, but continued and insisted he’ll play Wednesday in Washington.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just got kneed. I’m good,” Harden said. “I should be all right. I should be straight.”</p>

<p>With Durant expected to miss at least a month, the Nets will have to figure a way to win without him. A way that doesn’t include Irving getting a COVID-19 vaccine so he can play home games, because he said that’s not happening.</p>
<p>“There are things that are just as important to me as being great at the game of basketball or leaving a legacy.”</p>
<p>Irving had 27 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, while Harden added 22 points, 10 assists and seven boards. But Harden finished minus-18 and got thoroughly outplayed by Darius Garland.</p>
<p>The Cavs guard had 22 points and 12 assists, while ex-Net Jarrett Allen added 14 points, 10 boards and two blocks.</p>
<p>The Nets (27-16) allowed 65 points in the first half, and after clawing ahead 97-93 with 8:16 to play, they shot just 2 of 13 down the stretch without Durant.</p>
<p>Harden appeared to take a knee to the left leg with 4:05 left in the third quarter and Brooklyn down 82-75. He limped off, but returned and finished the game.</p>
<p>The Nets trailed 85-77 after Brandon Goodwin’s free throw with 2:46 in the third. Irving had seven points and two assists in a 13-2 Nets run to take a 90-87 lead.</p>
<p>When pressed afterward on his vaccination status — told millions of basketball fans wanted to know — Irving stated that was the problem.</p>

<h1> Wichita State vs. Cincinnati prediction: Go with the Under</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 9:30am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 5:48am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Wichita State Shockers are off to an 0-3 start in league play for the first time since joining the American Athletic Conference and will look to snap their skid on Sunday against Cincinnati.</p>
<p>The Bearcats have one of the best interior defenses in the country, ranking fourth in opponents’ 2-point shooting percentage and 35th in overall points allowed on a per-possession basis.</p>
<p>The Wichita State defense is a near equal, ranking 37th in points allowed on a per-possession basis with a perimeter defense that is 25th in the country in opponents’ 3-point shooting percentage.</p>
<p>Wichita State played its most recent game, a home loss to Tulane, without Morris Udeze and Dexter Dennis, both of whom are going through health and safety protocols. It is questionable as to whether they can return for this one.</p>
<p>With Wichita State having allowed 68 points or fewer in eight of its past 10 games and both teams in the bottom 100 in 3-point shooting percentage, it will be a low-scoring affair in Kansas on Sunday.</p>
<p>The play: Cincinnati-Wichita State total, Under 134 points.</p>
<h1> Illinois vs. Purdue line, prediction: Illini remain perfect in conference</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 9:02am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 10:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Illinois is the lone team in the Big Ten that has yet to suffer a loss in conference, and the Fighting Illini will put that perfect mark on the line at home against Purdue on Monday. </p>
<p>The Boilermakers are fourth in the nation in 3-point shooting percentage and entered the weekend No. 1 in the country in points scored on a per-possession basis, but have also slipped to 89th in points allowed on a per-possession basis. </p>
<p>Both teams have dominated the glass with Purdue second in the country in rebound rate and Purdue third, but Illinois has done the better job of prolonging possessions, getting a rebound on 39.9 percent of its missed shots. </p>
<p>Purdue has allowed 38.9 percent of opponents points from made 3-pointers, which is 20th in terms of highest percentage of points allowed on 3s and Illinois is 17th in the country in 3-point shooting percentage. </p>
<p>In their last nine games, Purdue is 2-7 against the spread and is running into an Illini team, led by 7-foot Kofi Cockburn, that has covered eight of its last 10 games. </p>
<p>The play: Illinois, -1.5.</p>

<h1> Bettors going big is only certainty to Bills-Chiefs clash</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 11:00am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 9:46pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Buffalo’s road to the Super Bowl again goes through Kansas City, where the Bills hit a dead end in last year’s AFC title game. The rematch is the marquee game of this weekend’s divisional round.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the season, I was big on the Bills,” MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said. “I thought this was going to be their year. But they were so inconsistent.”</p>
<p>One consistency with the Bills has been the public betting support they attract, a fact reflected in the point spread. BetMGM opened the Chiefs -2.5, a line that shows respect to the underdog.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll take a lot of action on the Bills again this week,” Stoneback said.</p>
<p>Both teams are hot at the right time, especially the Chiefs. In a 42-21 victory over the Steelers on Sunday, Mahomes overcame a slow start to pass for 404 yards and five touchdowns.</p>
<p>Laying less than a field goal at home, the Chiefs also will get plenty of betting support on their drive toward a third consecutive AFC championship.</p>
<p>Led by the Bills and Chiefs, favorites won four of the first five games in the wild-card round. The <a>Bengals knocked out the Raiders</a> in a thriller, and <a>the Buccaneers blew out the Eagles</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s going great right now for the bettors,” said Stoneback, who called the weekend a “small loser” for his sportsbook.</p>
<p>Bookmakers always need an upset and got one from the 49ers, the only underdog to advance. San Francisco was a 3-point ’dog in <a>a 23-17 win at Dallas</a>.</p>
<p>“It was a very good result for us with the Cowboys going down,” South Point oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro said. “We made a few dollars. No complaints from this end.</p>
<p>“The 49ers’ front will put some pressure on Rodgers, but we know Rodgers won’t make a mistake,” Lombardi said. “I think you have to be honest and say San Francisco does have a good chance.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals-Rams winner from Monday will be an underdog at Tampa Bay, with the Buccaneers favored by more than a field goal. If the favorites advance in the NFC, there will be a Rodgers-Tom Brady rematch in the conference title game in Green Bay.</p>
<p>While the Bills-Chiefs game has the feel of an AFC title matchup, it’s important to remember the Titans are the conference’s top seed.</p>
<p>Tennessee is a 3.5-point favorite against the Bengals in the other AFC matchup. The Titans will benefit from the return of running back Derrick Henry, who could feast on a Cincinnati defensive front beat up with injuries.</p>

<h1> Cam Reddish trade should be wake-up call for Knicks’ incumbents</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 12:33am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 1:16pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Shouldn’t the Knicks he joined be a little offended by that?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t they be motivated to show Reddish that they don’t need his services quite as much as he thinks they do?</p>
<p>“We’re only going to do what’s best for the team, period,” Thibodeau said. “Whatever gives us the best chance to win, that’s what we have to do.”</p>
<p>Does Reddish give Thibs his best chance to win? Hey, it’s never a bad thing to acquire a talented 22-year-old perimeter shooter with a 7-foot-1 wingspan.</p>
<p>Unless you happen to be an older, more expensive teammate who essentially plays the same position.</p>

<h1> Tom Brady’s ability to elevate teammates makes Buccaneers most dangerous in NFC</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 7:50pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 7:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Tom Brady wasn’t pressed to be great on Sunday. </p>
<p>The Buccaneers didn’t need him to be. </p>
<p>But he was anyway. </p>
<p>This is what makes the Buccaneers the most dangerous team in the NFC. Yes, even with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers owning home-field advantage throughout the postseason and having had this week to rest. </p>
<p>Brady, at age 44 and on a mission to capture an unfathomable eighth Super Bowl ring, performed surgery on the Eagles in Sunday’s way-too-easy 31-15 wild-card win at Raymond James Stadium. </p>
<p>The patient, the Eagles, will survive. But they’ll be confined to rest at home for the remainder of this football season. </p>
<p>The beauty of Brady’s work was not in his flawless statistics — 29 of 37 for 271 yards, two TDs and no turnovers. It was in its precision, how clean — if unremarkable in its simplicity — it was. </p>
<p>So, Brady and the Buccaneers are on to next weekend’s divisional playoff round, which is exactly where the Buccaneers were supposed to be at this point. </p>
<p>The Buccaneers (14-4) returned all 22 starters from their 2021 Super Bowl championship team — most importantly Brady. </p>
<p>No problem for Brady. </p>
<p>Receiver Mike Evans, one of nine different players to catch a pass from Brady in the game, caught nine passes for 117 yards and a TD. </p>
<p>“He’s a surgeon,’’ Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said. “Once he figures you out, he’s going to eat you up.’’ </p>
<p>Brady never let the Eagles have a chance. The Eagles played their safeties deep, determined not to let him beat them over the top, so Brady bled them to death with paper cuts on quick, short passes that neutralized the pass rush. </p>
<p>When you’ve been watching what Brady has been doing for more than two decades, human nature can numb you into taking his greatness for granted. </p>
<p>Buccaneers linebacker Lavonte David said, “Having a leader like him gets guys’ confidence up even more. His leadership brings out a different vibe in people.’’ </p>
<p>A championship vibe. </p>
<p>If you choose to take a more cynical approach and point out that the Eagles (9-9) offered little in the way of resistance to the Buccaneers, that’s your prerogative. You wouldn’t be wrong. </p>
<p>Truthfully, the Eagles were easy pickings for Brady. </p>
<p>We, however, leave you with this warning: Diminish Brady’s accomplishments at your own risk.</p>
