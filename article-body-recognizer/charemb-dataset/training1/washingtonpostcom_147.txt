<div><h1>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022 </h1></div>
<h2>Electric vehicles, interoperable smart homes and ‘the metaverse’ will all make an appearance at CES — if it doesn’t get canceled first.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Tatum Hunter</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Chris Velazco</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 2:34 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>2022 will be a year of big tech promises. Whether companies can deliver is another question.</p></div></div>
<a>have pulled out</a>, and show organizers have shortened the event by one day — it now runs Wednesday through Friday.)
<div><div><a>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</a></div></div>
<a>metaverse</a>,” autonomous vehicles and greater repairability will take time to catch up to their hype, and companies must be careful not to overpromise, Milanesi said.
<a>we don’t trust companies</a> enough to share a whole lot of it, that technology gets stuck in the “my voice assistant still doesn’t understand me” phase.
<div><div><p>Here’s what we expect — and in some cases, hope — to see in 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A race into the ‘metaverse’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook parent company Meta may have generated the most buzz with its foray into the metaverse — a theoretical shared space where people can hang out in virtual reality — but the other tech giants won’t be far behind.</p></div>
<div><p>In 2021, tech talked up ‘the metaverse.’ One problem: It doesn’t exist.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The smart home will make a lot more sense</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Matter</a>. The aim: to ensure that the home gadgets you buy in the future all play nice with one another, regardless of who made them or what virtual assistant you want to use when interacting with them.
<div><div><h3><div>Electric vehicles are inching toward the mainstream</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 2022 tech trends are all about what’s <i>not</i> new. This year, electric vehicles will transition from cutting edge to standard issue — if you live somewhere with the infrastructure to support EV charging.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Chips will still be hard to come by</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>What you need to know about the global chip shortage</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Fixing your tech will start to get easier</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Phones, laptops, tablets — we rely on gadgets like these every day, but companies haven’t exactly made them easy to fix when things go wrong. Slowly but surely, it seems that might be starting to change.</p></div></div>
<a>self-service repair program</a> in early 2022. The (somewhat surprising) move will allow enthusiastic amateurs to access the parts and guides to fix their iPhones and Mac computers.

<div><div><h3><div>More ways to analyze data from your own body</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Tech companies want you to trust them more</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>People now trust companies more than traditional institutions like government and religious organizations, according to Forrester analyst Enza Iannopollo, but companies still tend to overestimate how much customers trust them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And customers have good reason to be skeptical. In 2021, <a>security breaches</a>, <a>data privacy problems</a> and <a>AI whistleblowers</a> dominated technology news.</p></div></div>
<a>people who identify bias in AI systems</a> and adopting technologies that partially anonymize personal data, Forrester research predicts.

<div><h1>Some voice mails are unspeakably precious. Here’s how to save them. </h1></div>
<h2>Don’t let an important message languish on your phone — or worse, disappear randomly</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Chris Velazco</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 27, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>If you’re anything like me, your voice mail is mostly mundane. A few work-related messages you need to follow up on. A couple of spammy robo diatribes. Maybe some snippets of silence from numbers you’ve never heard of.</p></div>
<a>games journalist</a> from Binghamton, N.Y., voice mail was his link to the past.
<div><div><p>He isn’t alone. Voice mails can go missing for many other reasons, too, such as accidental erasure or switching wireless providers, and stories such as Boudreau’s are unfortunately too common.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re one of the many people who have treasured voice mails locked away on your phone, please: Take a few moments to save them elsewhere, just in case. Here’s how to do it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On an iPhone</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Open the Phone app and tap voice mail.</li>
<li>Find the voice mail you want to save and click it.</li>
<li>Tap the square share icon in the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Send a copy of the recording via email, AirDrop, iCloud Drive upload — whatever you prefer.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>On an Android phone</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Open the Phone app and select your voice mail. If your phone has a separate voice mail app, open that instead.</li>
<li>Find the voice mail you want to preserve and tap it.</li>
<li>Tap the share icon, which looks like three dots connected by two lines.</li>
<li>Send a copy of the recording via email, Google Drive — whatever you prefer.</li>
<div><div><p>Note: Because Android phone makers customize their devices differently, the process for yours may vary from these instructions. If that’s the case for you, let us know.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Need a new monitor for your computer? You can wear one on your face.</h1></div>
<h2>Some new wearable displays are trying to make your office more portable</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Chris Velazco</div></div>Technology writer </span></div></span></div><div>September 27, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Forget settling down in front of a computer monitor at work — someday, you might strap on a headset instead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That might sound a bit like a ’90s cyberpunk fantasy, but it’s not really all that outlandish.</p></div></div>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<div><div><p>More than a few tech companies are convinced that sophisticated screens shoved into glasses could represent the future of work. But they have different visions for how a screen you wear on your face should work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To be clear, these kinds of specialized gadgets are still far from hitting the mainstream.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do they work?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Help Desk: Ask our tech team</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What can you do with them?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>These headsets aren’t meant to lock you in some strange virtual conference room — instead, they basically act as secondary screens you wear instead of putting them on your desk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Where do we go from here?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>These headsets are here, and they work, but let’s be honest: They’re still far from ideal.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook glasses: Not overly ‘smart,’ maybe a little shady</p></div>
<div><div><p>That will change over time, too, as the technology matures and the cost of parts become more reasonable. Until then, though, many of us will just have to make do with the computer monitors we have now.</p></div></div>

<h2>This year’s CES conference in Las Vegas raises questions about the future of giant in-person business events</h2>

<div><div><p>This year’s unorthodox CES raises valuable questions about the future of giant in-person business events.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since then, coronavirus tests have been even harder to come by in pharmacies, and testing facilities around Las Vegas have done their best to accommodate long lines of people anxious to learn whether they have been infected.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the administration’s failure to avert a covid testing shortfall</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Maybe the worst experience is kind of having to walk through the casino floor on the way out to the events here,” said Mathias Rygh, head of marketing for a start-up building an exercise bike for gaming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And while CES typically leads to skyrocketing hotel rates on and around the Las Vegas Strip, many rooms available this year are considerably cheaper — some even below $100.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Companies and attendees drop out of CES over omicron concerns</p></div>

<div><h1>Apple’s AirTags can be as creepy as they are helpful. Finding them with some phones is easier than with others.</h1></div>
<h2>The Android app made by Apple to find those $29 trackers comes with a big caveat</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Chris Velazco</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 21, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<div><p>Apple’s AirTag trackers made it frighteningly easy to ‘stalk’ me in a test</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What are AirTags, anyway?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>AirTags are tiny plastic-and-metal disks, each slightly bigger than a quarter. Apple built them to attach to — or slip inside — all kinds of items, so you can more easily find them when they go missing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because these tiny trackers rely on Bluetooth connections to share their locations, you shouldn’t have much trouble finding one with your smartphone — theoretically, anyway.</p></div></div>
<div><p>I found my stolen Honda Civic using a Bluetooth tracker</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How can I find one with an iPhone?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What if I have an Android phone?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Tracker Detect</a>, and you can download it free from Google’s Play Store.
<b> </b>tell the tracker to play a sound to help you find it. When you manage to find it and can confirm it doesn’t belong to you, report your findings to local law enforcement if you don’t feel safe.
<div><div><h3><div>What’s the catch?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s because, unlike on an iPhone, Android users need to open the app and manually scan for nearby trackers — it can’t just passively search in the background while you’re doing other things.</p></div></div>
<a>Danielle McClenahan</a> in a Play Store review of the Tracker Detect app. “It’s extremely concerning that as a company Apple hasn’t figured out a solution to this problem. I should not have to choose when to scan.”
<div><div><p>“To be forced to use an app to prevent ubiquitous spying is beyond the pale,” a reviewer named <a>Rob Bono</a> writes. “Android needs to detect AirTags at the OS [operating system] level.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jason Hong, a professor who focuses on privacy and security at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, agrees that Apple’s approach here is far from ideal.</p></div></div>

<div><p>For $4.99 a month, or about half of what any other comparable music service will cost you, Apple promises access to the full 90 million songs in its library. The catch? To listen to just about any of them, you have to talk to Siri.</p></div>

<a>there’s been little transparency</a> around what content counts as sensitive and how much exposure to potentially harmful content the company considers too much. Crenshaw declined to provide further details.
<div><div><p>Experts said they aren’t sure how the tool launched Tuesday squares with Instagram’s business model, which relies at least in part on keeping teens engaged on the social platform.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Recovering locked Facebook accounts is a nightmare. That’s on purpose.</h1></div>
<h2>Social media companies are juggling account security and recovery — and failing users in the process</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tatum Hunter</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 29, 2021|Updated December 14, 2021 at 2:05 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>For Jonca Bull-Humphries, a clinical researcher who lives in the D.C. area, being locked out of Facebook after a hack was more than<b> </b>just an inconvenience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She was missing important updates from family and friends. She worried that whoever got into her account and changed the password and associated email address could misrepresent her to people she cares about.</p></div></div>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m feeling increasingly like a lesson to all of those hundred of millions of people out there. When something goes wrong, it’s really hard to get it corrected,” she said.</p></div></div>
<p>After I emailed Facebook about Bull-Humphries’ Facebook account, the company sent her a link to reset her password and all seemed to be well. But the next day, she messaged me again: The hacker was back in and Bull-Humphries was locked out.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Why is account recovery such a nightmare?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hackers target social media accounts because they want to spread scams, phishing links or misinformation, said Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Trend Micro.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Any system that we build to help users get their accounts back, we also have to recognize that it becomes a threat vector for threat actors to exploit,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an industrywide problem,” Gleicher said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the difficulty of balancing security and recovery is only part of the story, said Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert and public policy lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Schneier said that users are stuck. Facebook has no meaningful competition, he said, so frustrated users can’t leave and go elsewhere.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook privacy settings to change now</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What to do if you’re locked out of Facebook</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Worth every penny,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Borchgrevink walked me through what he described as a typical Facebook account recovery. It is elaborate — if you have the time and energy. He recommends the following steps if you get locked out a Facebook account.</p></div></div>
<li>Send a recovery code to your phone or email address. If you don’t have access to the number and address listed, select “No longer have access to these?” and “Cannot access my email.”</li>
<li>If it lets you, reset your email address. If not, go to facebook.com/hacked and choose “my account is compromised.” Enter your old password, choose “secure my account,” and select “I cannot access these.”</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Have a headache yet?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Once you’re back into a hacked account, go immediately to Settings Privacy -> Settings -> General -> Contact and make sure the email addresses and phone numbers associated with your account are yours, not the hacker’s.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What about other social media?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Each social media site will have its own account recovery process — and some may be easier than others. Despite being owned by Facebook, Instagram is much harder to get back into, according to Borchgrevink.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said account recovery rates are similar for Instagram and Facebook. She declined to share recovery rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It might also help to send all communications from the IP address you usually use and to share that IP address with customer support, Larkina said. (Google-search “what is my IP address.”)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most importantly, take steps now to prevent hacks. Once an account is compromised, getting it back is a pain, Gleicher said.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Your Data and Privacy</a></div></div><div><h1>The ultimate guide to secure passwords</h1></div><h2>Here are Help Desk’s tips on how a few changes can solve most of your issues</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tatum Hunter</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 16, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Setting hard-to-guess passwords and then remembering them later isn’t easy, and even the best of us mess up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>SolarWinds, which builds IT management software for customers including the U.S. Department of Defense, blamed an intern after a critical company password was leaked online. The password was “solarwinds123.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You have to laugh to keep from crying,” said JD Sherman, CEO of password manager company Dashlane.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Don’t be that employee: How to avoid ransomware attacks at work</p></div>
<div><div><p>Data from Dashlane shows the average person online has more than 200 accounts that require passwords.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The password fatigue is real, but don’t let it stop you from making some small changes to protect your accounts, your wallet and your identity. Here are six easy things to do today:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Stop reusing passwords</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you take only one step to better protect your accounts, make it this: Retire that trusty old “qwerty” password and reset any defaults.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reusing passwords across accounts makes all of them less safe. For instance, if you use the same password for Netflix and Chase Mobile, a data breach at Netflix could put your bank account at risk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Make your passwords not guessable</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passwords shouldn’t draw on details from your life. You may think that no one could guess your child or pet’s name when all it takes is a quick visit to Instagram or LinkedIn to figure it out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Coming up with passwords is like leaving your car in a mall parking lot, Sherman noted. Most thieves are just hunting for unlocked doors and rolled-down windows.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Passwords to avoid:</div></h4></div></div>
<li><span><b>123456. </b>Easy to remember means easy to guess.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Password. </b>This goes without saying.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Password123. </b>Nice try, but no.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Qwerty. </b>Try a different combo of letters, then add some numbers and symbols.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Pets’ names. </b>Try combining pets’ names into a unique new word with some special symbols.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Kids’ names. </b>Same deal as pets. (But less furry, usually)</span></li>
