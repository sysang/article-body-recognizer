<h1> When It Comes to Weight Loss, It’s Not Just Psychological </h1>
<h2> Using neuroscience to explain why diet industry programs fail. </h2>
<li>Set-point theory suggests that each person has a predetermined weight where their body functions optimally.</li>
<li>Our bodies adjust their regulatory systems to keep us at our set-points.</li>
<li>Our body weights are not necessarily indicative of our health statuses.</li>
<p>Though more people acknowledge that the diet industry is misleading, weight loss programs still assure us that eating certain prepackaged meals and counting calories will lead to weight loss.</p>
<p>These claims, however, overlook two important complexities:</p>
<ol><li>Different bodies function best at different weights.</li> <li>Our unique regulatory systems fight to keep us at these weights for <a>peak performance</a>.</li> </ol>
<sup>1</sup> Consequently, each person's body works to keep them at their set-point by tweaking various biological systems; this helps regulate how much food a person eats and the amount of energy they expend accordingly.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Set-point theory suggests that our bodies run best at a predetermined weight.</div> <div>Source: Sean D/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Nonetheless, there is still so much we don’t know about how our bodies regulate weight.</p>
<p>One <a>hormone</a> that has gained recent <a>attention</a> for its involvement in weight maintenance is leptin. Leptin exists in fat cells and is released in response to energy balance and fat mass changes.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Leptin is a satiety hormone that helps regulate weight.</div> <div>Source: Towfiqu barbhuiya/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It is thought that people at unhealthy, high weights might be leptin resistant. This could result in them not receiving fullness cues when their bodies have sufficient energy.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, weight regulation is not that simple.</p>
<sup>1</sup> Rather, it might be skewed to protect our bodies from losing, rather than gaining, fat. In other words, leptin's primary job might be to keep us from falling below our set-point, with less regard for weight gain.
<p>This could be one reason why (biologically speaking) it’s easier for people to gain, not lose, weight.</p>
<p>Second, weight regulation involves many different factors besides biology, including, but not limited to, <a>genetics</a>, culture, and psychology. Each of these must be considered when discussing a person's weight.</p>
<h3>Psychology: An Updated Diet Industry</h3>
<p>One recent diet program has capitalized on increasing acknowledgement that psychology contributes to weight maintenance.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Psychology is only one piece of weight regulation.</div> <div>Source: Jamie Matociños/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>If this seems overly simplistic, that's because it is.</p>
<a>therapy</a> or CBT) can contribute to short-term weight loss, it’s unclear if psychological interventions alone can help individuals stay at a lower weight long-term.
<p>This is partially due to biology, and partially due to the challenges of changing our health behaviors.</p>
<h3>The Brain and Health Behavior Change</h3>
<p>The aforementioned diet program claims that "psychology" can change the “conditioned" thoughts people have had since <a>childhood</a>, such as cleaning one’s plate during a meal or eating while watching television.</p>
<sup>3</sup> This means that our experiences (i.e., our eating habits or thoughts about food) can alter our brains' structure. It also means that we have the potential to “rewire” our brains using thought and behavior change.
<sup>3</sup> This approach has proven effective in treating many psychological disorders, including
<a>depression</a>, and eating disorders.
<p>Nonetheless, altering how our brains function with behavior change isn’t easy.</p>

<a>bored</a>. At the other extreme, a highly aroused or frightened person won’t have the adequate brain or body chemistry for efficient learning.
<p>Finally, lasting brain changes depend on our brain cells' size, their configuration and arrangement, and their connections with other local and distant cells.</p>
<p>Because these factors vary between people, health behavior change will come much easier for some than others.</p>
<p>The U.S. weight-loss industry, which includes, but isn’t limited to, diet food/drinks and pills, diet chains, marketed diet plans, and health clubs, is worth well over 70 billion US dollars a year.<sup>4</sup></p>

<h1> How to Live with Homesickness During the Holidays and Beyond </h1>
<h2> Home is more than a place. It's a state of mind. </h2>
<ul> <li>A home is a place in the heart and mind as if it is a building or spot on the map.</li> <li>Most of us experience homesickness at some point.</li> <li>Homesickness has much to do with how we manage change in our lives.</li> </ul>
<p>“I’ll be home for Christmas … if only in my dreams,” we sing during the holidays. It’s the most wonderful time of the year for many of us when we retell old stories and recall holidays past.</p>
<p>But it’s also the most painful time of the year for all of us who have lost loved ones whose presence provided the foundations and support beams of our home and who feel their absence more acutely around now.</p>
<p>Home can also be a person whose mere presence in the world offers comfort and reassurance that all shall be well.</p>

<p>Poetry and songs worldwide overflow with expressions of longing and sadness for a beloved home or homeland or for "the old folks back home," those long familiar to us—even Homer’s Odyssey referenced homesickness.</p>

<a>depression</a>, sleep disruption, or nightmares, and even produce
<a>therapy</a> to help them adjust to new environments and circumstances, particularly if they find themselves lapsing into depression.
<h3>How to Deal With Homesickness</h3>
<li>Explore: Get to know your new area by attending local events and exploring places of interest.</li>
<li>Avoid isolating yourself: Simply putting yourself in places where other people, such as a coffeehouse, can keep you from slipping into depression and isolation. Use Meetup and find other ways to meet people who share your interests.</li>
<li>Eat well and get the sleep you need: Failing to eat healthy, nutritious food, and get enough sleep, and keep a regular sleep schedule, can exacerbate feelings like sadness as well as seriously undermine your physical and emotional health.</li>

<a>stress</a>, struggles with the kids,

<p>MM: Say more about the connection between capitalism and unmet attachment needs.</p>

<p>GM: That’s capitalism. Every year, air pollution kills more than double the number of people internationally than died of COVID. But no one is doing anything about that because air pollution is profitable, while COVID threatens the economy.</p>

<a>genes</a> that make them more sensitive, as in feeling more. That same sensitivity can make you more creative, alive, insightful,
<a>empathetic</a>, and compassionate. You may become a

<h2> Let's learn from those who have performed under uncertainty and pressure. </h2>
<a>depression</a>, emotional outbursts, inability to rest, changes in

<a>Dr. George Everly</a>, an international expert on

<a>collaboration</a> and support that we find from our teams and affiliated social groups. Other factors include having a strong

<a>anxiety</a>, a depleted immune system response, and the many negative effects of chronic stress on the body, we can employ the tools elite performers use to recover. Consider adding in one or more of the following strategies to your recovery routine:
<li>Engage in some physical activity each day (take a walk, stretch, or find a favorite home workout program).</li>
<li>Increase hydration (fill up that water bottle and add your favorite fruit).</li>
<li>Make a conscious effort to address nutrition (under stress, we tend to eat too much or not enough; consult your medical professional for resources).</li>
<p>Recovery is always important, but it becomes absolutely critical when there are psychologically toxic conditions at play.</p>

<h1> No Shame in Your Game: How to Use Data to Reach Your Goals </h1>
<h2> The power of a balanced critique. </h2>
<li>Each interaction provides us valuable lessons, if we choose to tap them.</li>
<li>The "balanced critique" is a simple, nonjudgmental review offering takeaway action steps to help us improve in any aspect of our life.</li>
<li>The challenge: Remove the judgment and find the power in growing from your experiences.</li>
<p>What thoughts run through your head after an interview or personal interaction that didn’t go exactly as planned? Here are some phrases that might sound familiar:</p>
<p>“That was a terrible presentation.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have said that thing about her sister, that was dumb.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, what a bad workout.”</p>
<p>One thing all these statements have in common is that they imply judgment.</p>
<a>shame</a> about the stats on their team’s performance. They want nothing more than to improve and put that feeling behind them. But ironically, it’s often removing the emotion that allows them to take the first step to get back on track.
<p>With my clients, I’ve taught them how to use a very simple, yet extremely effective tool: the balanced critique.</p>
<p>A balanced critique is an evaluation process that is designed to be non-judgmental and strip the emotional reaction to a performance or interaction out. It asks you to consider only two elements:</p>
<ul><li>What is one specific thing you did and want to keep doing?</li> <li>What is one specific thing you want to do differently?</li> </ul>
<p>The power of the balanced critique comes from the incremental improvements it helps us make over time. For example, after a presentation at work, you could sit down at your desk and complete the exercise:</p>
<ul><li>Keep doing: I made good eye contact with people throughout my talk.</li> <li>Do differently: Leave more time for questions at the end.</li> </ul>
<p>Rather than a broad dictate like, “do better,” you now have two clear actions to focus on for your next presentation. </p>
<p>The balanced critique can also apply to your personal life. After a tough night trying to get your kids in bed and asleep at a reasonable hour, before you collapse onto the couch with Netflix, you can get some data for the following evening:</p>
<ul><li>Keep doing: Read another chapter of Little Women together.</li> <li>Do differently: Pull the shades before I start reading so it’s darker in the room.</li> </ul>
<p>Even with something personal that can be quite emotional (believe me, I have two daughters myself!), repeat after me: it’s just data. </p>
<a>goals</a>, when emotion is threatening to overwhelm or derail action.
<a>athlete</a> something to keep doing, and something to do differently.
<p>In the same way, this exercise can help you identify two actions at the end of each day to implement the next. The following night, complete another non-judgmental evaluation of that day, get your two actions for the next day, and so on. </p>
<p>By seeing your performances as data rather than things to be judged, you can take action to improve them in the future. In effect, you can become a data scientist on the things that matter most to you.</p>

<a>Students are experiencing high levels of stress and mental health concerns</a>. School administrations are struggling to deal with the new realities. For example,
<a>a recent survey of students at the University of Oregon</a> shows that higher education institutions may be engaging in “institutional betrayal,” partly by “creating an environment in which
<a>COVID-19</a> transmission seemed more likely to occur.”

<li>Clinicians and neuroscientists approach eating disorders research differently.</li>
<li>Eating disorders are heterogeneous illnesses, which makes brain-behavior conclusions difficult.</li>
<li>Methodological limitations interfere with us connecting the psychological with the biological in eating disorders research.</li>
<li>Justifying eating disorders as medical illnesses can influence policies, health decisions, and public perception.</li>
<p>“I used to throw up all the time in high school. Weight is still a struggle. Every video I’m in, every magazine cover, they stretch you—they make you perfect… it’s not real life.” —Lady Gaga<sup>5</sup></p>

<sup>4</sup> Likewise, 90 percent of adolescents and young adults actively engage with social media “influencers” regularly.
<sup>6</sup> This exposure to diet culture and thin idealization could explain increases in body dissatisfaction over the past few years.
<p>However, it doesn’t explain why only certain people develop eating disorders.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the only way to get answers to my questions was to open the “black box"—a term psychologists use for the brain—and look around.</p>

<p>So, I started studying neuroscience.</p>
<h3>What Makes Researching the Neuroscience of Eating Disorders Complex?</h3>
<sup>2</sup> So, a clinician might study
<a>anxiety</a> in people diagnosed with an
<a>eating disorder</a>, whereas a
<a>neuroscientist</a> would study what brain mechanisms contribute to anxiety.
<p>Simply put: Two people with the same eating disorder diagnosis might not have the same diagnostic or neural profile.</p>
<sup>1</sup> This framework uses different levels of analysis (i.e., cellular; neurocircuitry) to explore different domains related to behavior (i.e., negative valence; reward). However, few eating disorders researchers have used it.
<a>genetics</a>, early life experiences, parental care, and diet. This is impossible (and unethical) to do with humans. By manipulating certain conditions, neuroscientists can study how specific factors, such as early life
<a>trauma</a>, impact an animal’s health over time. This provides more conclusive arguments about cause-and-effect relationships between the brain and eating disorders behavior.

<h1> Calorie Counts and Eating Disorders: A Neuroscience Approach </h1>
<h2> The science behind how menu calorie counts can contribute to eating disorders. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Menu calorie counts could increase anxiety about food and social evaluation.</li>
<li>For some individuals, weight management behavior can reduce anxiety through biological mechanisms.</li>
<li>Menu calorie counts cater to the compulsive nature of eating disorders behavior. </li>
<li>Teaching intuitive eating, nutrition, and food enjoyment is the best approach for healthy living.</li>
<sup>1</sup> The intent: encourage people “to make healthier food choices.”
<p>Several experts in <a>eating disorder</a> research, medicine, and charity work, however, have argued that these measures would discourage healthy eating practices.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Calorie counts on menus are already displayed in other areas of the world. Consequently, let’s consider, from a <a>neuroscience</a> perspective, why calorie labeling on restaurant food items could increase eating disorder frequency.</p>
<p>We experience stress when we encounter something “negative,” and what we label as negative is determined by our unique biology and experiences.<sup>11</sup></p>
<sup>17</sup> This region synthesizes information from several different brain regions about our experiences, evaluates it, and helps us determine what we should approach and what we should avoid.
<sup>18</sup> The primary job of cortisol is to prepare our bodies to manage stress.

<p>Individuals with eating disorders experience stress from a variety of sources, but food<sup>5</sup> and social judgement<sup>10;19</sup> stress are common.</p>
<p>Consequently, calorie labeling in restaurants might be <a>stressful</a> for an individual experiencing/or susceptible to an eating disorder. This could lead to anxiety about future food encounters and social evaluations.</p>
<sup>11</sup> It’s what we experience when we think about future, uncertain situations involving a stressor. The two aren’t isolated from one another, though.
<sup>20</sup> Neurocircuits for anxiety and stress overlap and interact, with each relying on the BNST for threat evaluation.
<sup>15</sup> These decisions depend on a complex orchestration of certain cells, chemicals, and subregions in the BNST. Unfortunately, we’re only just beginning to understand these relationships.
<p>When We Feel <a>Anxious</a>, We Try to Reduce it</p>
<sup>4</sup> This is problematic because, over the course of an eating disorder, anxiety might contribute to its maintenance. This is because eating disorders behavior might reduce anxiety.
<p>How does eating disorders behavior reduce anxiety? One possible explanation is through <a>ghrelin</a> secretion.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Ghrelin is the body’s “hunger <a>hormone</a>.” Its primary job is to motivate us to eat by making us hungry. Prior to eating, ghrelin levels rise, and following food intake, ghrelin levels fall.</p>
<p>Stress has also shown to elevate ghrelin levels, as ghrelin’s secondary job is to relieve anxiety.<sup>9</sup></p>
<sup>7</sup> Instead of a modest rise prior to food intake, ghrelin is excessively secreted and stays elevated.
<sup>8</sup> Consequently, for some individuals, food restriction reduces the anxiety they feel when encountering food.
<p>Therefore, having calorie counts on food menus could encourage food restriction among those currently experiencing, recovering from, or susceptible to an eating disorder. </p>

<sup>12</sup> Subsequently, they stick to ritualistic routines and rigid thinking patterns to feel "agency" over a chaotic world.
<sup>13</sup> This reduces anxiety.
<sup>22</sup> Cognitive and behavioral flexibility is the ability to change your thoughts and/or behaviors in response to a change in
<p>Put a little differently: it’s feeling comfortable with the randomness and spontaneity you encounter in everyday life.</p>
<sup>14</sup> Therefore, individuals across eating disorder subtypes might find it difficult to break maladaptive eating patterns (i.e., binge/purge cycles) when encountering menu calorie counts.
<sup>23</sup> This is due to dysregulation in a brain region called the insula. The insula is our brain’s regulator of internal experience; it guides us in knowing when, what, and how much to eat.
<p>For those with an eating disorder, ritualistic eating patterns help manage eating uncertainty. However, if individuals are not listening to their body’s needs, destructive eating patterns could endure. </p>
<p>Calorie counts on menus make it easier for individuals experiencing eating disorders to continue destructive eating patterns that maintain their illnesses.</p>
<p>What’s dangerous about encouraging compulsive calorie surveillance is that we still don’t know exactly what causes an eating disorder.</p>
<p>Consequently, creating an atmosphere of calorie counting and food <a>fear</a> could push more individuals to develop one.</p>
<a>nutrition</a> could help us understand how best to fuel our bodies and brains. Finally, in today’s culture of Instagram perfection, it’s important to learn to enjoy food and respect our bodies.
<p>These are only some of the reasons why menu calorie counts could contribute to eating disorders frequency. And it's also an example of why we need neuroscience to help shape public policy. </p>
