<h2><a>What Should the U.S. Do About Alexei Navalny? Unfortunately, Nothing</a></h2>
<div>No amount of U.S. sanctions or diplomatic isolation is likely to change how the Kremlin deals with internal challenges to its authority. And the fact is, the U.S. and Russia have business to do.</div>
<h2><a>With Trump's Iran Envoy Out, Change Is Needed</a></h2>
<div>The U.S. strategy of "maximum pressure" against Iran has failed abysmally. Now is the time for coldhearted, pragmatic diplomacy.</div>
<h2><a>Attacking Trump for Russian Bounties Ignores the Bigger Problem</a></h2>
<div>No matter what the president knew, U.S. policy in Afghanistan is at fault for providing Washington's adversaries an opportunity to bleed American forces.</div>
<h2><a>Let's Hope Pompeo's Trip to Hawaii Ushers in More U.S.-China Dialogue</a></h2>
<div>Anyone who was expecting some miraculous grand bargain between the top U.S. and Chinese diplomat was asking for too much. At this point, managing disputes through dialogue is the best both countries can do.</div>
<h2><a>Withdrawing U.S. Troops From Germany Is Right for Today's Reality</a></h2>
<div>The Cold War is over. And although Moscow has shown itself to be a prolific agitator, an outdated U.S. military posture in Europe isn't helping.</div>
<h2><a>Sanction China? Remember: Sanctions Rarely Succeed—And Often Backfire</a></h2>
<div>Politicians want to sound tough, but taking action against another country's economy can produce precisely the opposite of what they're hoping to accomplish.</div>
<h2><a>Venezuela Readies for Coronavirus. Is Now Really the Time to Indict Maduro?</a></h2>
<div>On legal merits, there is a solid case against Maduro and his associates. But the course of action pursued by the DOJ is unwise.</div>
<h2><a>No Compelling National Security Argument to Keep U.S. Troops in Afghanistan</a></h2>
<div>There is a curious lack of recognition in Washington of just how effective the U.S. intelligence and military apparatus has become since 9/11.</div>
<h2><a>A U.S.-Taliban Deal Is Progress. But It's Still a Formula for More War</a></h2>
<div>The American people don't want a partial withdrawal. They want a final end to a chapter that should have been closed long ago.</div>
<h2><a>Trump Must Scrap His New Sanctions on Iran And Row Back to Nuclear Deal</a></h2>
<div>Instead of overreact to every Iranian action, the U.S. needs to keep the scale of the Iranian threat in perspective—and make a pragmatic offer to Tehran.</div>
<h2><a>A Treaty to Prevent a New Arms Race Is Dying on Trump's Watch | Opinion</a></h2>
<div>Extending the New START nuclear arms treaty is one of those rare no-brainer decisions in a world where simple solutions are an endangered species.</div>
<h2><a>This Soros and Koch Collaboration Is Exactly What U.S. Foreign Policy Needs</a></h2>
<div>The two philanthropists are funding a new think tank to reintroduce some restraint and accountability to U.S. statecraft.</div>
<h2><a>Actually, There's a Pretty Good Argument for Suspending Aid to Ukraine</a></h2>
<div>There has been a shocking lack of discussion on whether that aid is in any way beneficial to U.S. national security. The short answer is no.</div>
<div>Despite loud protests about American betrayal, core U.S. national security interests in war-ravaged Syria were always narrow and specific: destroy the Islamic State's physical caliphate.</div>
<h2><a>A hostage negotiator may be just the national security advisor Trump needs</a></h2>
<div>The art-of-the-deal president might finally have a national security advisor who'll enforce his preferences instead of undermining them.</div>
<h2><a>Trump Should Seize Initiative on Iran and Back Macron's Daring Diplomacy</a></h2>
<div>The president may already be tiring of a maximum pressure policy that has resulted in much less than its supporters predicted.</div>
<h2><a>The Agreements that Slowed the Nuclear Arms Race are Collapsing</a></h2>

<h2><a>The Cold, Hard Truth about Belarus</a></h2>
<div>There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's latest attempt to squelch opposition is a gut punch to those who believe horrible actions like this have no place in the 21st century.</div>
<h2><a>How the World Views U.S. Foreign Policy</a></h2>
<div>If anything should guide U.S. foreign policy, it is U.S. interests—not the need to be liked by a particular country.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Needs to Accept Reality in Syria</a></h2>
<div>Syria's neighbors, many of whom detest Bashar al-Assad and funneled arms and money to their favorite rebel groups earlier in the war, now acknowledge he isn't going anywhere.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Defense Budget is Too Damn High</a></h2>
<div>It's a vicious circle the U.S. has yet to escape: more defense spending tempts over-extension around the world, which in turn is used to justify even higher defense budgets in the future.</div>
<h2><a>How Does Biden's Foreign Policy Stack Up After His First 100 Days?</a></h2>
<div>As President Joe Biden prepares to wave goodbye to his first 100-day stretch, those in the realist and restraint community are at least breathing a sigh of relief—things could be better, but they could also be worse.</div>
<h2><a>Biden's Afghanistan Critics are Wrong</a></h2>
<div>If the U.S. was truly interested in a peaceful settlement to Afghanistan's civil war, Washington would withdraw their troops immediately.</div>
<h2><a>Diplomacy—Blemishes and All—is the Best Way to Deal With Iran</a></h2>
<div>Diplomacy is extremely difficult work. But the absence of diplomacy creates even more problems.</div>
<div>With violence in eastern Ukraine bubbling to the surface, the clamor in Washington for a more aggressive U.S. response is growing louder.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Should Add a Little Humility to its China Policy</a></h2>
<h2><a>Biden's Foreign Policy is More Similar to Trump's Than You Think</a></h2>
<div>As it stands right now, the U.S. foreign policy of today is looking eerily familiar to the U.S. foreign policy of yesterday.</div>
<div>While both sides returning to the nuclear deal is the right policy, this common-sense exit-ramp will remain out of reach as long as U.S. and Iranian officials continue to joust in front of the cameras and talk past each other.</div>
<h2><a>Will Biden Make the Right Choice on Afghanistan?</a></h2>
<div>If the president is genuinely committed to closing the book on a two decade-long misadventure in Afghanistan, he needs to resist the temptation of accepting the same, old advice.</div>
<h2><a>The World Waits for No Man—Not Even the President of the United States</a></h2>
<div>Nobody in the world who values human rights and the rule of law likes what is going on in the streets of Myanmar's capital city right now.</div>
<h2><a>Blinken Wants Congress Engaged on Foreign Policy—But It Takes Two to Tango</a></h2>
<div>If Congress wants to be treated as an equal, it needs to do the job the Founders insisted on in the U.S. Constitution.</div>
<h2><a>Pompeo's Last-Minute Moves are About Damaging Biden, Not Securing America</a></h2>
<div>From Yemen to China and Taiwan, the departing administration is doing all it can to hamstring its successor's diplomats.</div>
<h2><a>For Biden, 2021 Will Be Far More of a Challenge than 2020</a></h2>
<div>Most of us will be breathing a sign of relief when 2020 is finally over. But for Biden, it'll only be the beginning of one of the toughest years that ever faced an incoming President.</div>
<h2><a>All I Want for Christmas is a Saner Foreign Policy</a></h2>
<div>The best gift Washington can give to the American people this holiday season is a large dose of common sense in U.S. foreign and national security policy.</div>
<h2><a>There's a Very Simple Way for Biden to Get Back on Track with Iran</a></h2>
<div>Iran returns to the nuclear obligations it gradually violated, while the U.S. provides the economic sanctions relief Tehran is afforded to under the deal. This is the fastest way to deescalate the situation.</div>
<h2><a>Why is the NDAA Trying to Keep Us in Afghanistan?</a></h2>
<div>The very same members of Congress who aren't comfortable with voting to send Americans in uniform into harm's way seem more than willing to vote to keep them there.</div>
<h2><a>Biden's Policy on North Korea Should be Prudent Dialogue—Not Sanctions</a></h2>
<div>The economic pressure strategy pursued by the Obama-Biden administration failed to stop nuclearization, and there's no evidence it'll do better the second time around. It's time for a fresh approach.</div>
<h2><a>Biden's First Message to Riyadh Should Be: Playtime's Over</a></h2>
<div>America doesn't need Saudi Arabia half as much as it used to, and can afford to get much tougher on its ally—and especially on Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the bull in the china shop of the Middle East.</div>
<h2><a>Trump's Afghanistan Withdrawal Isn't Rushed, It's Long Overdue</a></h2>
<div>Delaying a final U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan will only increase the cost to Americans in uniform.</div>
<h2><a>Trump's Foreign Policy Wasn't All Wrong. Here's What Biden Should Retain</a></h2>
<div>Many bad policies of the last four years are long past due for the trash bin. But others, such as getting Europe to shoulder more of it defense burden, have merit.</div>
<h2><a>The U.S. Should Continue Withdrawing Troops From Iraq Until It Hits Zero</a></h2>
<div>Caving to those who believe a permanent U.S. military presence is intrinsically connected to regional stability would tie thousands of U.S. soldiers to an indefinite deployment in the Middle East.</div>
