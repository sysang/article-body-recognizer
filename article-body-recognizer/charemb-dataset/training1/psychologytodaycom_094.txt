<p>What is your information based on? Are there studies? Some assemblage of best practices? </p>
<p>Are there some kinds of people or types of communities that suffer more than others? </p>
<p>I don’t think this work can be put in a quantitative category. Each community that has endured a tragedy that impacts the masses has its own challenges and strengths.</p>
<p>Are there some important things not to do in the aftermath of some group trauma? </p>
<p>What characterizes resilience at the community level? </p>
<p>What have you found most surprising about recovery efforts you have led? </p>
<p>What would you identify as the single most important thing to do? </p>
<p>Is there a timeline or sequence of stages of recovery against which communities can monitor or benchmark their progress in healing, or does every event have its own trajectory? </p>

<h1> Practical Tools for Being Crazy Happy </h1>

<p>Is it possible to be happy in a world that has more than its share of pressing problems and delivers a steady stream of bad news? You decide!</p>
<p>Let’s start even before the beginning: Do we really need to be crazy happy?</p>
<p>There is never a need of anything. There is always choice. Happiness is a choice. </p>
<p>Doesn’t the title alone set up a false expectation that we should go around being crazy happy or that that is the goal of life?</p>
<p>How does a person know whether it is time to be crazy happy?</p>
<p>It is always time to be happy. Being unhappy can make one happy as well. Happiness does not exclude unhappiness. You can enjoy sadness just as much as you can enjoy happiness. </p>
<p>What do you mean by people having a “wrongness” of themselves?</p>
<p>Many people are judging everything they do and say, constantly censoring themselves and anticipating the next mistake they might make. </p>
<p>What is the paradigm of psychology that you rejected, and why?</p>
<p>There is no rejection. Pragmatic means doing what works, whatever that is. What works for one person might not work for the other. Every paradigm creates a different possibility. None of them is right or wrong. They are just different. </p>
<p>And what is the paradigm of psychology that you have chosen, and why?</p>
<p>Why do we think change is hard, and how can it be made easy and fast?</p>
<p>What is it that people most need to change?</p>
<p>From my point of view, there is no need to change anything. Allowance is a big key to change. You can allow yourself to not change rather than thinking you need to change. </p>
<p>Judgments are important, but you are emphatic that they are also crippling. Can you explain?</p>
<p>What do you consider the single most important tool for creating happiness?</p>
<p>Choice! It's not a "how". It is saying “I will choose to be happy no matter what!” Start demanding of yourself to be happy no matter what occurs today.</p>
<p>What other tools are important?</p>
<p>If you had one message to give people, what would it be?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of a relationship? In their mutuality, and because of it, the best relationships become the mechanisms through which we can perfect ourselves as individuals. In that view, even failed relationships have their value.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the title. Creating a wonderful relationship isn’t magic; it takes awareness and often internal and interpersonal work. So what is the title intended to tell readers?</p>
<p>How is truth related to love?</p>
<p>What role do you see relationships playing in individual growth? </p>
<p>What is “full responsibility” for one’s relationship—and how does one take it?</p>
<p>What do bad relationships have to teach people, and what is a productive way to look at a bad relationship?</p>
<p>What is the most important thing to know about love?</p>
<p>What do you consider the most surprising thing about love?</p>
<p>Love seems to go bad so often in our culture, creating a great deal of misery. To what do you attribute so much wreckage; do people approach love with wrong expectations about it?</p>
<p>Blaming a partner for one’s own pain—so common, so counter to getting closer to love. Why do people do it, and what’s a better way?</p>
<a>stress</a> over the "shortcomings" of others is simply what we have yet to understand about ourselves.
<p>Great relationships foster growth—of both individuals and of the relationship itself. How to foster that?</p>

<h2> The Book Brigade talks to psychologist Ronald Frederick. </h2>

<p>There are many ways people get stuck in bad relationship patterns. But the most basic of all may be relating to loved ones as if still facing the disappointments of childhood.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the title, Loving Like You Mean It. It suggests that some, maybe many, people go about the business of loving without putting much heart into it. What point are you trying to make with the title? </p>
<a>fear</a> being more emotionally present and authentic with our partners. We’re afraid to open up and step into our
<a>romantic relationships</a> in a more honest and revealing way. Whether it’s the ability to give or receive love, manage and express
<p>You are putting forth the case for emotional <a>mindfulness</a>. What is that and why it is important?</p>
<p>You contend that we humans are wired to fear being emotionally present. </p>
<a>attachment</a> experiences, for better or worse, shape how we response to our emotions. For those of us who had caregivers who were uncomfortable with different emotional experiences, we learn to fear being emotionally open.
<p>What does it mean to be emotionally present? </p>
<p>What purpose does it serve to not be emotionally present?</p>
<p>We avoid discomfort and the perceived threat that something bad will happen if we were to reveal more of ourselves. We respond to an old fear as if the danger still exists, and, for the most part, it doesn’t. </p>
<p>How does the lack of emotional presence manifest, and how does it play out day to day in relationships?</p>
<a>depressed</a>. Or, we fail to express the fullness of love in our hearts—and then can’t understand why our partners complain about feeling frustrated, alone, and unsure of our love.
<p>Can you give an example of a common situation and how it is helped by emotional mindfulness?</p>
<p>You argue that people have to change the way the brain is wired. Why?</p>
<p>To be devil’s advocate, isn’t the brain changing its wiring all the time, with all new behavior? What’s special about your plan?</p>
<p>What specific efforts do you believe are required to change the wiring of the brain for love?</p>
<a>attention</a> inward and comfortably abide with and move through what’s happening inside of them without being reactive. In step three, “Pause and reflect,” readers learn to mine the
<a>anxiety</a> that comes with opening up in a new and different way, stay centered and present, and express their truth in a manner that paves the way toward healthier relating with their partners.
<p>Can change by one partner shift the other partner, too?</p>
<p>If you had one bit of advice to offer people in relationships, what would it be and why?</p>
<p>Grow your capacity for emotional mindfulness. Slow down, pay attention to, and make sense of your emotional experience before responding to your partner. </p>

<p>Let’s start with the subtitle, The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement. Why do you think the world is obsessed with early achievement? </p>
<p>Parents fear their kids won’t succeed in life if they fall off the fast track to success. The billions spent on private tutoring, SAT and ACT prep course, and college admissions counseling attest to this worry.</p>
<p>And is it the whole world that is so obsessed? Or just certain parts of it, such as most of the technologically advanced parts of the world?</p>
<a>leader</a> of the pack. More than 90 percent of the drugs prescribed to treat
<a>ADHD</a> are in the U.S. It’s almost as if we’ve turned a Harvard rejection into a clinical disease. But a former minister of
<a>education</a> in Singapore said he’s worried about the same phenomenon. And I heard the same story when I was lecturing at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
<p>How did we get to this point?</p>
<p>The trend has been building for 30 years, which correlates with the rise of technology companies and investment firms. As mentioned, these two industries screen for high test scores and elite college admissions.</p>
<p>What does science, including the developmental literature, tell us about the nature and trajectory of achievement/success?</p>
<a>memory</a> and rapid processing speed. Other cognitive capabilities improve throughout middle age, such as
<a>empathy</a> and certain kinds of pattern recognition. There is a reason why most effective managers and CEOs are in their 30s and above. Finally, our vocabulary and what you might call
<a>wisdom</a>, peak in our 60s and later.
<p>Does it matter that we lose tolerance for the natural course of development?</p>
<a>suicide</a> among teens and young adults is nothing short of a public health crisis. The pressure for early achievement is contributing to this crisis. The belief that college is always the best option for every
<a>teen</a> has contributed to the $1.5 trillion student debt, with an 11.5 percent default rate.
<p>The push for early achievement certainly isn’t coming from kids themselves. Where is it coming from?</p>
<p>And why? Why at this moment in history? And what is it that parents want for their children?</p>
<p>What kinds of things do they do to push for early achievement/success?</p>
<a>career</a>. These are not rich parents, either.
<p>Why is this bad for kids?</p>
<a>motivation</a>, we put them on a conveyor belt that measures excellence in narrow ways—excellence in taking standardized tests and advanced placement courses. That’s sad and misguided. The world is not an SAT test.
<p>What are some of the consequences?</p>
<a>burnout</a> at work. Among employers, a sense that too many young adults are brittle uncoachable. It’s no wonder. We’ve robbed their youth. We’ve turned them into performance robots.
<p>What are the real foundations for achievement and success?</p>
<p>What is your metric of success?</p>
<p>For me, it’s the feeling of fulfillment. It’s the sense that all my talents and motivations have been put to good use in the service of some higher purpose.</p>
<p>Not everyone catches fire at the same time. What gets people “lit” with a drive for involvement that may lead to “success”?</p>
<p>If you had one bit of advice to offer, what would it be and for whom?</p>

<p>Children today often lead over scheduled and overextended lives with high degrees of stress. Yoga may be an ideal way to boost physical fitness while quieting the mind.</p>
<p>What led you to write a book on yoga for children?</p>
<a>mindfulness</a> called Bee Still: An Invitation to
<p>Do kids really need yoga?</p>
<a>self-esteem</a>. With anxiety disorders being so prevalent, yoga is a wonderful intervention for kids.
<p>How do you use yoga in your practice with children?</p>
<p>What do the adults in children’s lives need to know about yoga for kids?</p>
<p>Is there any research suggesting that yoga has specific benefits for children?</p>
<a>memory</a>, self-esteem, and overall academic performance. It can assist in reducing stress and anxiety and improving classroom behavior. More research suggests that yoga can help children with
<a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD) by increasing attention and decreasing hyperactive and impulsive behavior. Research is continuing to grow on this topic.
<p>Where does yoga fit in an era when kids need to be encouraged to be active?</p>
<p>Do kids and parents really need yoga as a way to enhance their bond?</p>
<p>Are there specific types of yoga that are good for kids?</p>
<a>Laughter</a> yoga and Goat yoga, which integrates animal-assisted
<a>therapy</a> with yoga. Whatever style of yoga your child tries, it should be fun. It’s also possible to mix it up.
<p>Doesn't teaching yoga to kids inherently convey the message that even quiet time has to be a program?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Used with permission of author Frank Sileo.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In your book, a possum asked why it's standing there, looking up. The sky responds that the possum is really doing yoga—as if standing and looking at the sky is somehow not enough. Isn’t there a need for that, too?</p>
<p>Agreed! Standing and looking at the sky is a great way to shut off the world and let our minds just wander! </p>

<p>Sometimes we focus too much on goals. Especially in the digital age, the antidote may be taking the time for a different way of focusing.</p>
<p>What do you consider important for people to reflect on?</p>
<p>Is there a single goal of reflection?</p>
<a>mindfulness</a>. And to that end we’ve distorted mindfulness so we’re judged as either succeeding or failing at reducing
<p>Does it matter whether I engage in reflection instrumentally, to achieve some specific goal, such as stress reduction, or just to appreciate what exists?</p>
<p>How does reflecting relate to mindfulness?</p>
<a>attachment</a> and avoidance. I entered the monastery because of painful patterns that kept repeating in my life. What I’ve distilled from years of sitting
<p>Is there one way of practicing reflection that is desirable for everyone?</p>
<a>attention</a>. A short reflection here and there breaks through the monotony and trance state that sucks away the joy of feeling alive. By pausing to enter reflection, we touch the true presence that is our birthright and natural, innate state of being.
<p>What makes reflection particularly important for modern times?</p>
<a>lonely</a> and are craving real connection. You might have hundreds of online friends, and that’s great. But there’s a need for personal
<p>How does a person know when it is desirable to engage in reflection?</p>
<a>DNA</a>, and like breathing it keeps you alive and vital. You bring awareness to everything one way or another, but when you reflect you bring a deeper sensitivity and
<a>openness</a> to each moment, each interaction you have—with yourself and others.
<p>Your book consists of a number of statements to reflect on. Do they all have equal power to bring about a desirable state of mind?</p>
<p>Your book is divided into numerous topics of reflection. Is there some ideal sequence of topics of reflection?</p>
<a>Laughter</a>, Bliss, Transformation and Wisdom, expand further. I’m also a fan of opening up to any page and trusting that you’ll find what you need in that moment. Either approach works well.
<p>What would you consider the single most important message you would like readers to get from Reflect?</p>

<a>attention</a>—the right way. Doing too much for kids can be as bad as giving no direction at all, and may help explain why so many young adults today suffer from
<a>depression</a>, have an oversize sense of entitlement, or fail to launch at all. It's true that children today face more challenges than earlier cohorts did, but that is all the more reason that parents need to provide direction.

<a>coaching</a> them away from the sometimes negative alternatives they’ve now turned toward.
<p>This book teaches parents to recognize the challenges and opportunities children face early by putting a new twist to the old 3Rs, suggesting parents need to pay more attention to their child’s world:</p>
<p>• learn to Read their child’s environment, recognize the challenges, conflicts, or opportunities their children are presented with, know who and what influences them, and know how all this affects their performance.</p>
<a>motivation</a> for their present and future endeavors.
<p>What are the new challenges that parents face and where do they come from?</p>

<p>What do you consider some of the most counterproductive myths about sexuality?</p>
<a>orgasm</a> and multiple orgasms are the most satisfying” are based on erotic performance and “pop sex.” Other sex myths reinforce unhealthy sex splits, such as “
<a>therapy</a> almost always enhances sexual desire, especially erotic feelings."
<p>What is the paradox of sexuality?</p>
<p>It is striking that you have a chapter devoted to female-male equity. Can you discuss its relevance to good couple sexuality?</p>
<a>pregnancy</a> to sexual pain, whose domain is affection and relational security. The rules are clear—but totally wrong for women, men, couples, and the culture.
<p>What is the new sexual mantra, and how does it differ from the old? What’s shifted? And why?</p>
<p>Satisfaction certainly involves orgasm but is much more than orgasm. Satisfaction involves feeling good about yourself as a sexual person and bonded as a sexual couple. This mantra allows women and men to have a shared language.</p>
<p>You discuss good-enough sex—what is it, and when is good-enough sex good enough? </p>

<p>How does anyone know when he or she is being a jerk? </p>
<p>Of the numerous people I've told about this book so far, many have said something like:</p>
<p>"Wow, that's great! I am for sure going to buy a whole bunch of copies!"</p>
<p>"What?" I reply, "Why a whole bunch?"</p>
<p>"Because," answers the potential good customer, "I'm going to get one for everyone in my____________" (usually the answer is either "family" or "office”). </p>
<p>So the best way to know that this book is for you is that you thought you bought it for someone else. </p>
<p>What are the telltale signs?</p>
<p>Are dicks different from garden-variety jerks? And if so, how so?</p>
<p> How does dickish behavior arise and become part of a person’s repertoire?</p>
<p>How is dickish behavior self-protective?</p>
<a>anxious</a> and tentative security, where one sees the motivations and underlying emotions of one's own behavior in others (
<a>projection</a>). The dick lives in a state of
<p>Why do you believe we are experiencing an epidemic of dickish behavior?</p>
<p>And the opposite of jerkish behavior is…?</p>
<p>Acceptance of ourselves, others and the world itself—as is.</p>
<p>You flat-out state that being on the lookout for dicks, not having a finely tuned dick detector, is good for relationships. Please explain.</p>
<p>Could you summarize what you call the Dick Fix? What are the essentials of leaving dickery behind?</p>
<p>1. Keep the focus on yourself,</p>
<p>Is there some ideal response to another person’s dickery? </p>
<p>Hit pause, and don’t engage. This is Satyagraha: Nonviolent protest. It’s a dedicated commitment to harming no one, including ourselves—not putting ourselves in harm's way, not allowing others to mistreat us.</p>
<p>What do you consider the single most important message you would like readers to get from Don’t Be a Dick?</p>
<p>Letting go of the defensive use of dickery establishes a very different way of being in relationship with ourselves, others, and the world. It is a process where changing ourselves can change the world.</p>

<p>Today, I'll share an interview with Shauna Shapiro, the author of Good Morning, I Love You, where she shares on self-compassion, why it matters, what science says about it, and how to cultivate it in your life. </p>
<p>Your book is about self-compassion. How does one know when that’s what’s missing from one’s life?</p>
<p>The easiest way to know is to ask yourself, Would I treat a dear friend the way I am treating myself? The essence of self-compassion is treating ourselves as we would a dear friend.</p>
<p>What does self-compassion do?</p>
<p>Self-compassion has an alchemical power. It soothes the painful parts of ourselves and it grows our resources. It literally gives us the capacity to learn new behaviors and make lasting changes in our lives.</p>
<p>Why do you believe that people need more self-compassion rather than, say, compassion for others?</p>
<p>What kinds of practices develop self-compassion?</p>
<p>What does scientific research show about the value of self-compassion?</p>
<a>self-esteem</a>. People with greater self-compassion have less depression,
<a>stress</a>—and greater
<a>happiness</a>, life satisfaction,
<a>resilience</a>, and performance.
<p>What are common roadblocks to self-compassion?</p>
<p>The most common misgivings about self-compassion are fundamentally wrong. The first is the belief that it undermines <a>motivation</a>.</p>
<p>What is another roadblock?</p>
<p>The belief that self-compassion is selfish.</p>
<a>wise</a> and necessary to learn to take care of ourselves. When we are able to give ourselves care and support and meet our own needs, we have more emotional resources available to help others.
<p>What are other common roadblocks to self-compassion?</p>
