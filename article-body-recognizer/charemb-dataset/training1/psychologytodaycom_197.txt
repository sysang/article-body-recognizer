<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic and disabling illness.</li>

<a>sex</a>, other medical conditions, income level, and urbanization (using a scale related to urban versus rural living).
<p>After controlling for potentially contributing variables, the chances of a person with OCD developing dementia was more than 4-fold higher than controls.</p>
<p>Men with OCD were more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease while women with OCD were enriched in the group that developed vascular dementia. This pattern is opposite to what would be expected in a general population.</p>
<a>earlier post</a>, we discussed a study indicating that individuals with schizophrenia may be at increased risk for dementia. Results from both of these studies are consistent with other evidence from longitudinal, prospective studies demonstrating that
<a>psychiatric</a> disorders in general, across the range of mental illnesses, are associated with

<li>Family caregivers spend an average of 24.4 hours per week providing care.</li>
<li> Nearly 1 in 4 caregivers spends 41 hours or more per week providing care. </li>
<li>Unpaid caregivers report that positive activities in their daily lives are reduced by 27.2% as as a result of their caregiving responsibilities. </li>
<p>“I got plenty of money; it’s just tied up in debt,” as the saying goes.</p>
<p><a>Humor</a> often has a way of getting to the point.</p>
<p>The debt and associated burdens are mounting at staggering levels for caregivers of those afflicted with Alzheimer’s, other forms of <a>dementia</a>, and other serious illnesses.</p>

<a>depression</a> and a breakdown of their immune systems, while often juggling job responsibilities to stay afloat,” writes George Vradenburg, chairman and co-founder of
<a>UsAgainstAlzheimer’s.</a>
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic has made this patently clear, forcing 16 percent of Latino and 13 percent of black adults to leave the workforce to care for an adult family member.
<p>According to the <a>National Alliance for Caregiving </a>and AARP, nearly 1 in 4 family caregivers spend 41 hours or more per week providing unpaid care.</p>
<p>My point is simple: paid leave for Alzheimer’s caregivers in any appropriate legislative form is critical and needs to be addressed now or the ravaging impact on family caregivers will continue.</p>
<p>Our nation needs to fix bridges and infrastructure, but we also need to fix lives.</p>
<p>When a family member is diagnosed with Alzheimer's or another form of dementia, the effect on families can be overwhelming—financially, physically, emotionally.</p>

<h2> Six tips for caregivers. </h2>

<li>Caregivers can experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, guilt, and anxiety.</li>
<li>Caregiving can bring up negative feelings involving family dynamics, which a therapist can help with.</li>
<li>Changing one's outlook and letting go of attachment can be healing for caregivers.</li>
<a>caregiving</a> can be overwhelmingly
<a>stressful</a>. It is perfectly normal to feel a range of emotions in response to this. It's an experience that can produce sadness,
<a>anxiety</a> about having those feelings.
<p>It can feel shameful to admit this, and yet normalizing these feelings is important so people can feel less alone and more able to communicate what they are going through to gain support. Here are some key tips for caregivers: </p>
<p><a>Consider seeing a therapist</a> to discuss what this is bringing up for you. It is normal to feel burdened and to feel <a>fear</a>, anger, resentment, and anxiety. And it is also normal to then worry about your own life and your own fate.</p>

<h1> Trouble with Behavior in Dementia? Try the ABCs </h1>
<h2> Consider both antecedents and consequences when evaluating behaviors. </h2>
<li>It is important to consider what came before and what came after a behavior to understand its cause.</li>
<li>All behaviors have a purpose, such as expressing emotion, satisfying a need, or communicating a purpose.</li>
<li>Behaviors are specific and observable, something your loved one does or does not do; something seen, heard, or felt.</li>

<h3>The ABCs of behavior change: Antecedents, Behaviors, Consequences</h3>
<a>anger</a>. It may be to satisfy a need, such as hunger or affection. It could even be to communicate information, such as, “I want to be left alone,” or, “I want to stay in the car.”
<h3>Behaviors are observable and can be measured</h3>
<h3>Antecedents come before behaviors</h3>
<ul><li> <p>What day and time of day was it?</p> </li> <li>What was the environment like?</li> <li>Who was there?</li> <li>Was there something happening or about to happen?</li> <li>Was there something your loved one wanted, like food or drink?</li> </ul>
<p>These questions can help us to identify aspects of the environment or unmet physical or emotional needs that might be causing the problem behavior. These questions may help you discover, for example, that the yelling occurs at bath time.</p>
<h3>Consequences occur after behaviors</h3>
<ul><li>How did the environment change?</li> <li>Did something start or stop as a result of the behavior?</li> <li>Did your loved one get something, like food, drink, or <a>attention</a>?</li> </ul>
<p>In my next blog, I will discuss how to use the ABCs to create a behavior log and manage behavior.</p>

<h1> Could Psychedelics Help Treat Dementia? </h1>
<h2> These ancient healing compounds could offer benefits to people with dementia. </h2>
<li>Psychedelics and guided therapy may benefit the treatment of depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, and PTSD.</li>
<li>Success of preliminary studies have led researchers to imagine a potential role for psychedelics in skilled nursing care settings.</li>
<li>Some believe psychedelics may potentially be used in ways that improve cognition, mood, and quality of life for people living with dementia.</li>
<li>Ongoing studies must investigate questions regarding proper dosages, safety and supervision, ethics around consent, and other critical issues.</li>
<p>After being banned internationally in the 1970s, psychedelics have experienced a recent resurgence in Western medical research. What do we know? And could these powerful ancient compounds be integrated into care for people living with dementia?</p>

<a>evidence base</a> suggests that “classical” psychedelics like
<a>psilocybin</a>, LSD, DMT, as well as compounds like MDMA and
<a>ketamine</a> may be effective therapies in controlled medical settings, with researchers observing preliminary benefits in the treatment of
<a>anxiety</a>, substance use disorder,
<a>PTSD</a>, and in palliative care for patients facing terminal cancer.

<h2>Major risk factors for strokes</h2>
<li>Prior stroke warning sign (transient ischemic attack or “TIA”)</li>
<li>A disease of other blood vessels of the body</li>
<ul><li>Smoking</li> <li>Sedentary lifestyle</li> <li>Unhealthy diet</li> <li>Obesity</li> <li>Alcohol: more than one drink per day</li> </ul>
<ul><li>Old age: after age 55, the stroke risk doubles every decade</li> </ul>
<p>Q: You’ve seen your loved one’s MRI report, and it says they have “scattered T2 hyperintensities consistent with microvascular ischemic disease.” What does that mean?</p>
<p>A: That’s a doctor’s way of saying that there is something on the MRI scan that looks like tiny, small-vessel strokes.</p>
<p>Q: Your loved one has never had a stroke, yet the doctor says they did, and she can see it on the MRI scan. How can that be?</p>
<p>A: Many strokes—especially small ones—are “silent,” meaning that they may not cause any noticeable symptoms.</p>

<h1> 8 Principles for Communicating With People With Dementia </h1>
<h2> Tips for communicating with those who have cognitive impairment. </h2>
<p>Here are some principles of communication, action, and understanding that I have learned from my patients. I hope that they are helpful to you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Consider his perspective. Because of his <a>memory</a> loss, he does not remember that she has been there every week for the last year. He just thinks there is a strange woman he has never met who is asking him to take off his clothes.</p>
<a>dementia</a> will often absorb our moods by unconsciously perceiving our
<a>body language</a> and tone of voice. Thus, we may inadvertently create agitation if we become irritated when a question is asked for the 34th time or upset when the sugar bowl accidentally falls to the floor.
<p>4. It is important to be busy. No one truly wishes to be idle. The thing that can be difficult is to find an activity that an individual can do and enjoys. Here we would simply encourage you to think out of the box.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your mother likes to fold laundry, let her fold it. Did she finish it already? Shake it out and let her fold it again.</p>
<p>5. Involve family and friends. Dementia is a team sport. Many spouses feel that they should be able to take care of their wife or husband by themselves, but caring for those with dementia is more than any one person can do alone.</p>
<a>politics</a>, current events, sports, or even the weather. But many can still enjoy things that are directly in front of them. Try strolling through a gallery at a museum, an exhibit at a zoo, or a path in a garden.

<h1> Staying Socially Active May Offset Risk of Cognitive Decline </h1>
<h2> Frequent social contact may boost cognitive reserves and lower dementia risk. </h2>

<p>Last month, the big news from the annual <a>Alzheimer's Association International Conference </a>(AAIC) 2019 in Los Angeles was that various lifestyle factors may offset <a>dementia</a> risk.</p>
<a>five research studies</a> were presented that focused on specific lifestyle interventions (e.g., regular exercise, healthy
<a>smoking</a> cessation, limited

<a>Psychiatry</a>, said in a news release.
<p>Why would increased social contact decrease someone's risk of dementia?</p>
<a>memory</a> and language, which may help them to develop cognitive reserve—while it may not stop their brains from changing, cognitive reserve could help people cope better with the effects of age and delay any symptoms of dementia," senior author
<a>Gill Livingston</a> of UCL Psychiatry said in statement. "Spending more time with friends could also be good for mental well-being, and may correlate with being physically active, both of which can also reduce the risk of developing dementia."
<p>Notably, this research on the correlation between social contact and dementia risk has some significant limitations.</p>
