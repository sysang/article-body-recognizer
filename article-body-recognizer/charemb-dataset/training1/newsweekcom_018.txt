<p>The RV we live in would have cost around $160,000 to purchase, and our renovations so far have cost between $4,000-$5,000, though we are planning to do more, like changing the flooring and tiling the bathroom.</p>
<p>The beauty of this lifestyle is that there are so many options, it just depends on how you want to do it. There are people who live in RV parks where the rent costs $400-$500 a month and there are people who live out on the land.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with so much freedom comes so many options and that can be a little overwhelming. We can go anywhere in the country, stay in any town and do anything! But honestly, there haven't been a ton of lows.</p>
<p>Wherever we are, we always just stop for a second and take it all in so we can remember it. Life does go fast. So for us, living this way has helped us to slow down and really savor every moment with our family.</p>

<div> News Trial <a>Fraud</a></div>
<p>The jury in the trial of former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes finished the fourth day of deliberations Monday without reaching a verdict.</p>
<p>The jury, comprised of eight men and four women, completed Monday's deliberations without any indications as to how close they are to making a decision. They are set to resume deliberations Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>They have been meeting in a San Jose, California federal courthouse after hearing evidence in the high-profile trial.</p>
<a>AP</a>. She could be sentenced to 20 years in federal prison if convicted.
<a>AP</a> reported. It discussed Holmes' founding of Theranos at 19-years-old as a college dropout, to her breakthrough in Silicon Valley's male-dominated culture, to her rise as a billionaire before allegations came out claiming she was a charlatan.
<p>She spent seven days on the witness stand, maintaining her belief Theranos was on the edge of an advancement in medical technology, while acknowledging some mistakes and decisions she made in the past.</p>
<p>Holmes spent years promising Theranos would be able to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with just a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick instead of relying on vials of blood drawn from a vein.</p>
<p>It was such a compelling concept that Theranos raised more than $900 million and struck partnerships with major retailers Walgreens and Safeway. Holmes herself became the subject of cover stories on business magazines.</p>
<p>But unknown to most people outside Theranos, the company's blood-testing technology was flawed, often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients.</p>
<p>After the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016, Theranos eventually collapsed and the Justice Department filed a criminal case in 2018 that charged Holmes with 11 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy.</p>

<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci has defended the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>) after the agency issued updated advice saying that those who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate for just five days if they are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), made several media appearances following the CDC's announcement on Monday.</p>
<p>The isolation period <a>has been reduced from 10 days to five</a> for asymptomatic people and the CDC cited scientific evidence that people are most infectious two days before they develop symptoms and three days afterward.</p>
<p>After the five days in isolation, asymptomatic people are advised to wear a mask around others for a further five days.</p>
<p>However, the change has proven controversial with some <a>health experts taking to Twitter this week</a> to express dismay about the decision.</p>
<a>Jim Acosta</a> on Tuesday that the reason for the change "is that with the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don't have so many people out."
<p>He said if a person has symptoms, they should be out, but added: "if <a>you are asymptomatic and you are infected</a> we want to get people back to jobs—particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly."</p>
<p>He said he supported the CDC's "prudent" decision that would get "people back in half the time than they would have been out so they can get back to the workplace doing things that are important to keep society running smoothly."</p>
<p>The NIAID director reiterated to <a>MSNBC</a>'s Tiffany Cross that the CDC's decision was the right one and "based on science."</p>
<p>"Instead of keeping people out of action, out of work, out of society, for 10 days, if you're infected and without symptoms then you have five days of isolation and then you can go back out into society with a mask worn consistently," Fauci said.</p>
<p>MSNBC's Chris Hayes asked Fauci on Tuesday whether there was scientific evidence that infected people aren't still contagious after five days in isolation.</p>
<p>"Nothing is gonna be 100 percent," Fauci replied. "And this is one of those situations, when you're dealing with a very difficult situation, Chris, that we often say, you don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good."</p>
<p>"The fact is that we know that when you're infected, early on in infection for the first several days, you have more of a likelihood to have a high level of virus and to be capable of spreading it," he said.</p>
<p>Fauci said it was important to get people "back functioning in society because the alternative is something that no-one wants and that's to shut down completely."</p>
<p>During another appearance on CNN on Tuesday, host Michael Smerconish asked Fauci if the CDC's decision was due in part to the "risk" of shutting down the economy and society during a 10-day isolation period.</p>
<p>"When you shut down the country, you have people who have other diseases who don't have the opportunity to get their HIV test, to get their HIV meds, to get their mammograms, to get the colonoscopies," he went on.</p>
<p>"So I wouldn't just say it's an economic consideration," Fauci said.</p>

<p>Prince Andrew's lawyers say his accuser was over New York's legal age of consent during alleged sexual abuse by him at Jeffrey Epstein's mansion.</p>
<p>Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against the Duke of York saying she was <a>made to have sex with him</a> by Epstein and <a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a> when she was 17 and he was 41, in 2001.</p>
<p>The prince's lawyers <a>want the lawsuit thrown out</a> and attempted to heap pressure on his accuser by arguing she was of the legal age of consent at the time of the allegation. Giuffre's own court filings describe her as a child.</p>
<p>If considered a minor by the court, she would only need to prove sex took place between her and Andrew in order to have a case.</p>
<p>The duke's lawyers argued, however, that she was an adult under consent laws and therefore will need to actively prove she didn't consent in order for the claim to proceed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit relies on the New York Child Victims Act [CVA], which created a window in which child abuse victims could bring historic claims that would ordinarily be considered out of time.</p>
<p>The CVA requires a criminal offense to have been committed against a child under 18, while New York law records the age of consent at 17, creating a grey area.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew's team are arguing she may be classed as a child under the CVA, but not under consent laws and therefore she must prove she didn't consent.</p>
<p>The prince's lawyers argue Giuffre is seeking to establish a lack of consent through "implied threat," but suggested the case would be difficult to make 20 years on from the alleged incident.</p>
<p>The court filing read: "These highly subjective determinations are the kind most likely to be hampered by the passage of time, as memories fade, false memories are created, and witnesses die or otherwise become unavailable.</p>
<p>"Here, the only witnesses to the purported implied threats under which Giuffre allegedly engaged in unconsented sex acts with <a>Prince Andrew</a> are Epstein (deceased), Maxwell (incarcerated), Prince Andrew (the accused) and Giuffre herself."</p>
<p>Maxwell is currently on trial on Epstein-related sex-trafficking charges, which she denies.</p>
<p>An earlier filing by Giuffre's lawyer read: "On one occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused [Giuffre] in London at Maxwell's home.</p>
<p>"During this encounter, Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew forced [Giuffre], a child, to have sexual intercourse with Prince Andrew against her will."</p>
<p>It added: "On another occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused [Giuffre] in Epstein's New York mansion in this District.</p>
<p>"During this encounter, Maxwell forced [Giuffre], a child, and another victim to sit on Prince Andrew's lap as Prince Andrew touched her.</p>
<p>"During his visit to New York, Prince Andrew forced [Giuffre] to engage in sex acts against her will."</p>
<p>However, the duke's court filing accused Giuffre's lawyers of giving inadequate information about her allegations, suggesting she was being deliberately vague.</p>
<p>Their court filing read: "Giuffre's refusal to include anything but the most conclusory allegations is puzzling given her pattern of disclosing to the media the purported details of the same allegations included in the Complaint.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is Giuffre's tendency to change her story that prompted her to keep the allegations of the Complaint vague, so as not to commit to any specific account.</p>
<p>"Whatever the motivating factor, Giuffre's Complaint is deficient and fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."</p>

<div> News Coronavirus <a>CDC</a></div>
<p>Several experts on immunology and epidemiology have criticized the decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce the self-isolation period for those who test positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The CDC announced on Monday that those who test positive and are asymptomatic <a>should now isolate for five days instead of 10</a>, citing evidence that people are most infectious two days before they develop symptoms and three days afterward.</p>
<p>However, some health experts expressed confusion and apparent anger at the CDC's updated advice with one professor of immunology taking to <a>Twitter</a> to say the decision left him "baffled."</p>
<p>Epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina tweeted: "CDC's new guidance to drop isolation of positives to 5 days without a negative test is reckless."</p>
<p>"Some ppl stay infectious 3 days, Some 12," he wrote.</p>
<p>"I absolutely don't want to sit next to someone who turned Pos 5 days ago and hasnt tested Neg," he went on. "Test Neg to leave isolation early is just smart."</p>
<p>Mina criticized the idea that those with COVID should end isolation before testing negative and also took aim at the CDC's claims about when patients are most infectious, arguing that information predated the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"I am baffled at CDC's decision to shorten isolation," Bromage wrote. "Here are tests from the same person: day 0 (3 days after exposure) and day 8. The person still has a huge amount of virus in their nose 8 days after testing positive."</p>
<p>Bromage said he oversees the testing of thousands of people each week in workplace surveillance programs.</p>
<p>"As we do not want to have workplace transmission, we ensure that [w]hen we have a positive we do not return them to work too soon. Workplace transmission would shut us down (union rules) so we are cautious and use data to return people," he wrote.</p>
<p>Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist, <a>highlighted the surge in the Omicron variant</a> of the virus across the U.S. as he questioned the CDC's decision.</p>
<p>Feigl-Ding noted in a later tweet that CDC advice differs from the situation in the U.K. where two negative tests are required to exit isolation before 10 days.</p>
<p>"But somehow a 5 day exit with 0 negative test is okay in [the U.S.]? American exceptionalism does not apply to a pandemic virus," he wrote.</p>
<p>Patrick Hickey, chair and professor of pediatrics at Uniformed Services University, retweeted Feigl-Ding and added simply: "Co-sign."</p>
<p>The CDC advised on Monday that those who test positive but are asymptomatic should wear masks around other people for five days after leaving isolation.</p>
<a>wear masks around others for a further five days</a>.
<p>CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Monday that many cases of the Omicron variant "are going to be asymptomatic."</p>
<p>"We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science," she said.</p>
<p>Newsweek has asked the CDC for comment.</p>

<div> World Russia <a>Ukraine</a> <a>Vladimir Putin</a></div>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to rule out an invasion of Ukraine, stressing he will accept nothing less than "the unconditional security of Russia" in upcoming talks with the U.S. and <a>NATO</a>.</p>
<p>During his annual QA press conference on Thursday in Moscow, Putin appeared frustrated by a question from Sky News asking if he would rule out an invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a lengthy response, the Russian president framed his deployment of 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border as defensive and accused NATO members—particularly the U.S.—of instigating conflict.</p>
<p>"Our actions will depend not on <a>the negotiations</a>, but on the unconditional security of Russia, today and in the future," Putin said, referring to Russia-U.S.-NATO talks slated for early 2022.</p>
<p>"We have made it absolutely clear that NATO's expansion to the east is unacceptable," Putin said. "What's not clear about it?"</p>
<p>"We are not the ones that deploy missiles next to the United States. It's the other way around, the United States brought their missiles next to our borders."</p>
<p>"We are not the ones who are threatening someone, we are not the ones who came to the border of the U.S. or the U.K.; they came to us." Putin continued. "And now they're saying, 'We will have Ukraine as well.'"</p>
<p>"You should come up with guarantees, right now—immediately," Putin said, addressing the U.S. and its NATO allies.</p>
<p>The president condemned NATO for its <a>eastward expansion</a> since the end of the Cold War. Russia shares a border with five NATO nations—Norway, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia—four of whom have joined since the collapse of the USSR.</p>
<p>"They just cheated us," Putin said. "'Not a single inch to the east,' that's what we heard in the 1990s."</p>
<p>The president said NATO and the U.S., not Russia, are to blame for tensions in Eastern Europe. "Bases all around—this is true," he said.</p>

<p>Thousands of Russian troops have reportedly withdrawn from the Ukraine border after conducting month-long drills, as tensions remain high amid fears that Moscow may be planning an attack.</p>
<p>"We don't want a war," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a>said earlier this week.</a> "We don't want to take the path of confrontation. But we will firmly ensure our security using the means we consider necessary."</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> and Russian President
<a>Vladimir Putin</a> spoke by phone about the situation. During that call, the White House said Biden warned Putin that Moscow would
<a>suffer economic and diplomatic consequences</a> if it attempted an invasion.
<p>Separately, NATO allies last week urged Russia to withdraw its military presence near Ukraine and to instead pursue diplomatic negotiations. The organization has also said that Russia has no authority to determine Ukraine's fate within NATO.</p>
<p>"We are ready for meaningful dialogue with Russia," they added. "We reiterate our long-standing invitation to Russia for a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in the near future."</p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Russia, U.S. to Discuss NATO Expansion Next Week as Tensions Remain High With Ukraine</h1><div> By Erin Brady <time>On 12/27/21 at 10:09 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Russia and the United States will begin planned discussions regarding potential NATO expansion next week.</p>
<p>Separate from these talks is a meeting between NATO and Russia that is expected to be conducted on January 12. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will meet with the NATO-Russia Council to discuss the status of their bloc.</p>
<p>The names of those representing Russia and the U.S. in the upcoming talks have not been released.</p>
<p>Washington and its allies have refused to provide such pledges but said they are ready for the talks.</p>
<p>The demands are contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and NATO.</p>
<p>Lavrov said last week that, in addition to talks with the U.S., Moscow will start separate talks with NATO on the issue, as well as separate negotiations under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday confirmed the meeting will take place, calling talks with NATO "important," but said the details of the meeting are "in the works" and the date is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>A group of six Navy vessels was ordered to remain in the Mediterranean Sea instead of moving toward the Middle East to address continuing concerns about the buildup of thousands of troops at the border of Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>The decision to stall the USS Harry S. Truman and the five U.S. craft it is traveling with was made by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a defense official told <a>The Associated Press on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>The official said the decision was made because naval officials felt a "persistent presence" was needed in Europe to address fears of many in the intelligence and international community about Russia's plans to invade Ukraine next year.</p>
<a>NATO</a> officials early next year to discuss the country's demands that NATO rejects the admission of Ukraine into NATO, and that the U.S. and its allies reduce the size of their military presence in Ukraine.
<a>Vladimir Putin</a> spoke on a video call to discuss the issues being raised by both sides, and Biden reportedly warned Putin that his country would face strong sanctions if they acted in a hostile manner toward Ukraine.
<p>Keeping the ships in the Mediterranean is necessary in order to reassure U.S. allies and partners in the region, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military deployment details.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Western allies have watched as the buildup of Russian troops near the border grew to a peak of an estimated 100,000, fueling fears that Moscow was preparing to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia has denied any intention of launching a new invasion and instead has accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to use force to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels. Ukraine has rejected that claim.</p>
<p>The Truman strike group includes five U.S. ships —- the cruiser USS San Jacinto and the guided missile destroyers USS Cole, USS Bainbridge, USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham. Also with them is the Royal Norwegian Navy frigate HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen.</p>
<p>The Truman left its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on Dec. 1, and entered the Mediterranean Sea on Dec. 14. It had been scheduled to continue on into the Gulf region.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of "pulling" Ukraine into NATO, and risking "large-scale conflict" in the process.</p>
<p>Lavrov on Friday blamed NATO for creating agitation in Eastern Europe, where some 100,000 Russian troops backed by armored vehicles and artillery are deployed along Ukraine's borders.</p>
<p>Lavrov echoed his president's suggestion that NATO aggression, rather than Russian militarism, was to blame for the crisis in Ukraine in an interview published on Friday morning.</p>
<a>defensive</a>. NATO has long been considered an existential threat by Russian leaders, whether operating under the Soviet or federation flag. Ukraine, Putin has said, could act as a springboard for the alliance to invade Russia.
<a>urged the alliance</a> and the U.S. to speed up the process, arguing that Russian harassment will continue until Kyiv becomes a NATO member.
<p>"Ukraine has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security. And the decision on whether Ukraine can join NATO will be taken by Ukraine and 30 NATO Allies alone."</p>
<p>"Our actions will depend not on <a>the negotiations</a>, but on the unconditional security of Russia, today and in the future," <a>Putin said</a>, referring to Russia-U.S.-NATO talks planned for early 2022.</p>
