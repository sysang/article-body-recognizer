<div><span><div><span><div>By Maura Ewing</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Marisa Iati</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Timothy Bella</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>María Luisa Paúl</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><div><p>“Please keep all of these folks, and especially these children, in our prayers,” Mayor Jim Kenney (D) said at an emotional news conference. “Losing so many kids is devastating.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The siblings each had multiple children, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, but it remains unclear whether all of them were home at the time or how many of them may have died.
<div><div><p>“Everybody is still in shock,” Purifoy said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Firefighters said they arrived at the three-story, 2,300-square-foot rowhouse, operated by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, in the 800 block of North 23rd Street about 6:40 a.m. and saw flames shooting up from the second floor.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a news release Wednesday night that revised the number of dead, the city said firefighters removed “one child from the building, but the child did not survive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witnesses told local media that they were awakened by screams coming from the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Loved ones, many warmed by blankets, formed a prayer circle nearby. Vanessa Price, 46, said she was a cousin of a family that lived in the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s our brothers, sisters, daughters,” she said of the fire victims. “We just got to keep them in prayer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Price said it was particularly sad that so many were children. “They didn’t get a chance to experience life,” she said. “It’s a loss people don’t want to wake up to.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alice Wright, 80, said she cried in her home before walking three blocks to the scene of the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just wanted to see what I could do,” said Wright, a lifelong Philadelphian. “Provide clothes — something.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Red Cross said it is providing emergency assistance for a family of five people displaced by the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The blaze was brought under control about 50 minutes after the firefighters arrived, officials said. Officials had not determined the fire’s origin or how smoke detectors failed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The home had a number of working smoke detectors, powered by lithium batteries meant to last 10 years, at its last inspection, Murphy said, but several were not operating at the time of the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was unclear what started the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A Philadelphia museum kept the bones of a Black child killed in a police bombing. Decades later, it’s apologizing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This unimaginable loss of life has shaken all of us at PHA. It is too early for us to say more,” Jeremiah said. “Our primary goal right now is to support our residents in any way we can.”</p></div></div>
<a>Philadelphia Inquirer</a> and
<a>CNN </a>that the building has had no violations.
<div><div><p>The house is yards from an elementary and middle school and the Eastern State Penitentiary, a former prison, in a neighborhood that is home to several of the city’s museums.</p></div></div>
<a>the 1985 MOVE bombing</a> — which started a fire that killed 11 — and
<a>an inferno in 1850 that killed 44</a> in the Old City neighborhood.
<div><p>The child injured in the blaze was taken to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, while an adult was transported to Temple University Hospital. Hospital officials declined to describe their conditions as of Wednesday afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Everybody in this neighborhood gets along,” he said, standing by his porch with a cigar in hand. “It’s a good place to raise kids.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an anomaly to have so many people die,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The shock of the fire reverberated throughout the city.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This punched you in the gut,” Philadelphia City Council President Darrell Clarke told reporters, visibly shaken. “It’s just so tragic. I don’t know what to say.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neighbors said the shrieks woke them up early Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s something you can’t reverse time on,” he said. “It’s shocking to see something like this happen so close to home — and to know that these are faces I’ve seen for years.”</p></div>

<h1> How the opioid epidemic evolved </h1>

<div> <p>Predominant cause of opioid overdose deaths</p> </div>
<div>Note: For some years, there was no dominant opioid driving deaths.</div>
<div> <div> <p> Baltimore shares a similar pattern. By 2017, the Baltimore urban area would become one of the hardest-hit regions in the nation. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> As would the District of Columbia. </p> </div> </div>
<p> But not every county is the same. </p>
<p> In Duval County, Fla. , whose largest city is Jacksonville, prescription pain pills remained the primary cause of opiate overdose deaths until 2016. Fentanyl would eclipse pills the following year. </p>
<div> <div> <p> And in Lake County, Calif., about three hours north of San Francisco, prescription pain pills remained the dominant cause of overdose deaths, though the heroin and fentanyl waves happened in later years. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> Together, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin and fentanyl have killed more than 400,000 Americans since the turn of the century, a quarter of whom have died from fentanyl in just the last six years. </p> </div> </div>
<p> In Berkeley County, W.Va., for example, the trend closely mirrored national ones. Prescription pain pills were the main cause of overdose deaths through 2011. By 2013, drug users turned to heroin, which set the stage for fentanyl. </p>
<p> In D.C., which has been one of the hardest-hit regions in the nation, overdose deaths were primarily driven by heroin until 2016 when it shifted to fentanyl. </p>
<p> But not every county is the same. In Duval County, Fla., whose largest city is Jacksonville, prescription pain pills remained the primary cause of opiate overdose deaths until 2016. Fentanyl would eclipse pills the following year. </p>
<p> Together, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin and fentanyl have killed more than 400,000 Americans since the turn of the century, a quarter of whom have died from fentanyl in just the last six years. </p>
<p> For this analysis, The Post used an exclusive research agreement with the federal government to acquire incident-level death data to examine the predominant killers of citizens county by county, year by year. </p>
<p> Rather than telling the story of the epidemic through death rates, as others have done for years, this unique analysis illustrates how the citizens in these counties rapidly shifted their drug use as the opioid epidemic got worse. </p>
<div> <h3>Where pills were the dominant cause of overdose deaths</h3> <p>Pills remained the leading cause of opioid deaths in many counties in 2011. But by 2017, other drugs had taken hold, particularly in the eastern part of the country.</p> </div>
<div> <ul> <label>Pills dominance</label> <li> <b/> <label>leftarrow;Lower</label> </li> <li> <b/> </li> <li> <b/> <label>Higherrightarrow;</label> </li> </ul> </div>

<p> “It was like a fire hose of illegally diverted prescription medication,” said Allison, a 52-year-old writer. “It hit this community while we weren’t even looking. It hit us like the plague.” </p>
<p> In 2010, one week before he was set to graduate high school, Granju fatally overdosed on opioid pills. He was 18. </p>
<p> Heroin took over as the dominate drug in many areas already devastated by the pills, especially in the Rust Belt. </p>
<div> <h3>Where heroin was the dominant cause of overdose deaths</h3> <p>When pills became harder to find, heroin became a cheaper alternative, and by 2014, an increasingly prevalent killer.</p> </div>

<p> On Marissa King’s 18th birthday, she was raped. </p>
<p> King loved to volunteer backstage at theaters near her hometown of Kalamazoo, Mich. Then an older, married man got her drunk and assaulted her, said her mother, Nancy, a 61-year-old director of a nonprofit devoted to overdose prevention. </p>
<p> Although Marissa was already an addict at that point, the trauma pushed her over the edge, her mother said. </p>
<p> “That’s when things really got bad for her,” she said. </p>
<p> Friends told Marissa that she shouldn’t have gotten drunk or looked the way she did. </p>
<p> “That victim-blaming made her think ‘something is wrong with me,’ ” Nancy said. “She didn’t want to press charges because she thought it was her fault.” </p>
<p> After that, Nancy started noticing changes in her daughter. She was evasive, she constantly had migraines, she stayed out of the house. </p>
<p> “Now I recognize that was heroin and withdrawals,” Nancy said. “I didn’t get that at the time.” </p>
<p> Marissa, 21, died on Jan. 15, 2012. Since then, her mother has counseled addicts in Michigan. </p>
<p> “We’re talking about it more; we’re taking away that stigma so people know they can reach out for help and say they’re scared,” she said. “We need a war on trauma, not a war on drugs.” </p>
<p> The heroin death rate never surpassed that of prescription pills, but it served as a transition into the illegal market for many of those already addicted to pills. There, they would find an <a>even deadlier drug</a> awaiting them. </p>
<h3> Third wave: Fentanyl </h3>
<p> Fentanyl has been used in the United States for decades, most of that time as a legally prescribed medicine. The drug, an opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, had been given primarily to patients in excruciating pain. </p>
<p> Starting in 2013, it began to flow into the country illegally in unprecedented quantities, the vast majority of it coming from China. It found its way into the hands of drug users primarily by being cut with heroin. </p>
<h3>Where fentanyl was the dominant cause of overdose deaths</h3>
<p>The wave of heroin led to a steep increase in fentanyl overdoses by 2017. Because heroin was often cut with fentanyl, people were unknowingly taking a far more lethal drug.</p>
<div> <ul> <label>Fentanyl dominance</label> <li> <b/> <label>leftarrow;Lower</label> </li> <li> <b/> </li> <li> <b/> <label>Higherrightarrow;</label> </li> </ul> </div>
<div> <ul> <li> <b/> <label>Fentanyl not the dominant cause of opioid deaths</label> </li> <li> <b/> <label>No opioid deaths reported</label> </li> </ul> </div>
<p> He was 36, the vice president of a software company in Austin. </p>
<p> “We had West Elm furniture, cute dogs and jobs in the tech industry,” she said. </p>
<p> After she watched paramedics revive him at their home with naloxone, a drug that counters overdoses, she learned the truth and confronted him in a hospital. He promised Lauren he would stop. She believed him. </p>
<p> She had no reason not to: He was “the smartest person I’ve ever known,” she said. “Every time he made a promise, he never let me down.” </p>
<p> A week later, on June 18, 2015, Timothy took a dose of butyrfentanyl, a variant of the drug. This time, it was lethal. </p>
<p> From 2013 to 2017, fentanyl overdose deaths rose nearly tenfold to <a>28,869</a>. </p>
<p> Ohio, the center of the heroin crisis, rapidly became a center of the fentanyl epidemic. So did West Virginia, which was at the heart of both previous waves. The fentanyl belt ranges from western Ohio through southeastern West Virginia. </p>
<p> Nationally, <a>federal agencies were overwhelmed by fentanyl</a>, and so were first responders at the local level. </p>
<p> Firefighter and paramedic Andrew Morrow in Biddeford, Maine, had been to hundreds of overdose scenes. On Jan. 23, 2017, he found his daughter, Amber Pearl Morrow. White powder and a rolled-up $20 bill were on the counter. </p>
<p> “It didn’t feel like it was real,” he remembered. </p>
<p> She and a friend snorted what they thought was cocaine. It turned out to be pure fentanyl. Amber, who was transgender and worked at an assisted-living community, was 21. </p>
<p> On the day Andrew returned to his job after grieving for Amber, he responded to another overdose call. </p>
<p> While many resources across the country are going toward stemming the tide of fentanyl deaths, some experts say it is time to start paying attention to what may be the fourth wave of the crisis. </p>
<p> It does not involve another opioid. Instead, there is mounting concern about an older menace that is increasingly getting cut with heroin and fentanyl: methamphetamine. </p>
<p> Deaths from meth have more than tripled since 2014. Along with West Virginia and the Northeast, the Southwest and states like Alaska and Hawaii have all seen their death rates spike in recent years. </p>

<header><div><div><div><a>The Fix</a></div></div><h1>Contradictory and confusing White House statements offer an incomplete picture of Trump’s health</h1></div></header>
<div>Updated Oct. 7 at 4:55 p.m.</div>
<p>Information about President Trump’s condition has been incomplete, confusing and, at times, contradictory since early Friday morning when the commander in chief announced that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>[<a>Trump returns to White House, downplaying virus that hospitalized him</a>]</p>
<h3>Mixed signals on the severity of Trump’s illness</h3>
<p>“For someone sick enough to have required <a>remdesivir</a> and <a>dexamethasone</a>, I can’t think of a situation in which a patient would be okay to leave on Day 3, even with the White House’s medical capacity,” he said.</p>
<p>Conley and his team have also refused to discuss the president’s lung scans, saying only that “there’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.”</p>
<p>Statements are from Trump’s doctors, President Trump or other White House officials.</p>
<div>Friday afternoon<div><div>“As of this afternoon the president remains fatigued but in good spirits.”— Sean Conley, White house physician</div></div></div>
<div>Friday evening<div><div>“I’m going to Walter Reed hospital. I think I’m doing very well.”— President Trump</div></div></div>
<div>“At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made. Thursday he had a mild cough, and some nasal congestion, and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving.”— Sean Conley</div>
<div>Saturday night<div><div>“President Trump continues to do well, having made substantial progress since diagnosis. This evening he completed the second dose of Remdesivir without complication.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div>
<div>Sunday morning<div><div>“The president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation ... It was the determination of the team ... that we initiate Dexamethasone.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div>
<div>Monday afternoon<div><div>“I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.”— President Trump</div></div></div>
<div><div>“Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the president’s safe return home.”— Sean Conley</div></div>
<div>Monday evening<div><div>“I went and I didn’t feel so good, and two days ago, I could’ve left two days ago. I felt great … Maybe I’m immune, I don’t know.”— President Trump</div></div></div>
<div>Tuesday Oct. 6<div><div>Tuesday afternoon<div><div>“[Trump] had a restful first night at home, and today he reports no symptoms.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div></div></div>
<div>Wednesday Oct. 7<div><div>Wednesday afternoon<div><div>“He’s now been … symptom-free for over 24 hours.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div></div></div>
<h3>Unclear timeline of the initial diagnosis</h3>
<p>Trump was required to get a negative test result when he arrived in Cleveland for the debate last week, though enforcement of that rule was only through the honor system, and the White House will not definitively say that he did.</p>
<p>Conley sowed further confusion over the initial timeline when he suggested that Trump’s diagnosis could have come as early as Wednesday, a statement he has since clarified.</p>
<div>Friday Oct. 2<div><div>Early Friday morning<div><div>“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately.”— President Trump</div></div></div></div></div>
<div>Saturday morning<div><div>“Just 72 hours into the diagnosis now, the first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10 are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div>
<div><div><span>“<span>[<i>Asked how and when Trump became infected</i>] We’re not going to go into that. We’re just tracking his clinical course and providing the best care we can.</span>”</span>— Sean Conley</div></div>
<div><div>“I don’t know when he last tested negative… We’re not asking to go back through a bunch of records and look backwards.”— Brian Morgenstern, White House deputy press secretary</div></div>
<h3>Confusion on Trump’s oxygen levels</h3>
<i>that day. </i>But on Sunday, Conley revealed that the president’s oxygen levels had dropped twice and that he had been given oxygen, although it wasn’t immediately clear how many times it had been administered.
<p>Several news outlets reported on Saturday that Trump received supplemental oxygen Friday before being flown to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, information that Conley finally confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<div>Friday Oct. 2<div><div>Friday night<div><div>“This evening I am happy to report that the President is doing very well. He is not requiring any supplemental oxygen …”— Sean Conley</div></div></div></div></div>
<div>Saturday morning<div><div>“And the President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs.”— Sean Dooley, pulmonary critical care doctor</div></div></div>
<h3>Careful words about Trump’s fever</h3>
<p>The White House has also stumbled over even small details, such as when and if Trump was running a fever. The messaging, however, has been consistent on one thing: that he has been fever-free since Friday.</p>
<div>Saturday morning<div><div>“Thursday he had a mild cough, and some nasal congestion, and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving.”— Sean Conley</div></div></div>
<div><div>“Thursday night into Friday morning, when I left the bedside, the President was doing well with only mild symptoms … Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, President had a high fever”— Sean Conley</div></div>
<div>Monday Oct. 5<div><div>Monday afternoon<div><div>“The president continues to do very well … temperature of 98.1.”— Sean Dooley</div></div></div></div></div>
<p>The coronavirus diagnosis is not the first time the White House has failed to clearly explain Trump’s health; questions remain about an unplanned visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2019.</p>

<div><h1>Stephen Bannon trial set for July as defense promises legal brawl</h1></div>
<h2>Judge rejects bid to delay trial until just before next year’s midterm elections; defense vows to seek House, White House and Justice Dept. documents </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Spencer S. Hsu</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 3:33 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A federal judge on Tuesday set a July trial date for Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser indicted last month for refusing to testify before the Jan. 6 congressional committee.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>even if they are not relevant to his litigation — a move supported by news organizations citing First Amendment grounds.
<div><p>The big warning signal Stephen Bannon’s indictment sends</p></div>

<p>Ultimately, though, the GOP challenge will fail because Democrats hold more seats in the House and because a number of Senate Republicans have already recognized Biden’s win and are unlikely to support their colleagues’ effort.</p>
<div><div><p>Thune has indicated that he will vote to certify Biden’s win, drawing a rebuke from Trump, who called for South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) to run against him in a primary. She has said she will not challenge him.</p></div></div>

<p>“We are ready for every contingency,” she said in a Friday interview. “This isn’t like we just woke up this morning and said, ‘Oh, this is coming up!’ We’ve been working on this since Election Day.”</p>
<div><div><p>“I would very much hope it gets resolved on the 6th,” she added, but “it could go on for quite a while.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our democracy will prevail,” Klobuchar said. “I just think this is kind of a sad, sad statement that some members are putting their own fear of Donald Trump in front of our democracy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), herself in the middle of a hard-fought runoff election next week, campaigned with Cruz on Saturday, but she wouldn’t say that she supported his effort.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It falls on Democrats, she said, to pass these measures.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) said Jan. 6 is “a day for resolve to be determined to take action, legislative action.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>On the Senate floor, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) emotionally recounted what he witnessed on Jan. 6 and accused Trump of inciting an “attempted coup” on that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are in the business of words, but there are none to adequately capture the damage that he and his henchmen have done and [are] doing to our country,” Leahy said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Leahy recalled watching a man walk a few feet away from him and onto the Senate floor wearing a vest that said “Police” while carrying a submachine gun. Leahy was shocked.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>As officers rushed senators to a secure location, Leahy recalled how one grabbed him by the arm and said, “We’re going to watch out for you, Shamrock.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Leahy paused for a moment, emotional, before explaining that the moment stayed with him because “Shamrock” was the code name he received during the 2001 anthrax attacks, of which he was a target.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Leahy lamented how many of Trump’s followers were “callously used as cannon fodder” and made to believe that they were acting like patriots.</p></div></div>
