<h1> Supporting Student Parents' Success in College </h1>
<h2> Student parents face many challenges, not least of which is feelings of guilt. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Coping With Guilt </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<a>At least one-fifth of U.S. undergraduates are parents</a>, and make no mistake, they are rock stars: student parents earn higher average GPAs than all other student groups. But despite their success in the classroom,
<a>student parents take longer to earn their degrees</a>, if they finish at all. By some estimates, parents are up to 40% less likely to earn a degree compared to their classmates without children,
<a>a gap that will surely widen amidst the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
<a>parents spend over 10 hours more ­per day than their peers</a> on tasks like child care, paid work, and housework. On top of time debt, parents carry more than twice the financial debt of students without children. These debts create
<a>stress</a>, force parents to work full-time, and increase the risk that parents and their families will experience economic poverty. In fact,
<a>over half of student parents dealt with food insecurity in the past month </a>and over two-thirds have experienced housing insecurity in the past year.
<p>Student parent <a>guilt</a></p>
<a>Persistence Plus</a> to support college students, parents quite often mention guilt when giving advice to other student parents:
<li>"Your children come first and finding time to study can be difficult. My advice is to study when they're in bed. That way you don't feel guilty for taking time away from them."</li>
<li>"I find that I also schedule specific times and activities with the kids (no phones or distractions) so I can also feel less 'mum guilt' when I need to spend an hour here and there to focus on study."</li>
<li>"Don’t feel guilty for trying to do something for yourself. If a parent does a degree, the whole family does a degree."</li>
<li>"I too was feeling guilty about putting things on the back burner with my kids but they came to understand that what I'm doing is good and it's for all of us."</li>
<li>"Struggling with the guilt of studying during my only free time btw work family instead of being with my family ..."</li>
<li>"Spending time with my family and feeling guilty that I should be studying."</li>
<p>Alleviating achievement guilt</p>
<a>expressive writing</a> can help to subdue those emotions. At Persistence Plus, we’ve delivered this writing intervention via text message, and the stories we hear about how students support their families while continuing their
<a>education</a> are nothing short of remarkable:

<a>using behavioral science to improve practice and policy in higher education</a>, I’ve been working the past several months with a group of colleagues to explore how to best encourage behaviors that prevent the spread of
<a>coronavirus</a>. We were inspired, in part, by “
<a>President Trump’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America</a>,” a public health campaign launched in March 2020. This effort included postcards sent to U.S. households (
<a>at a cost to the USPS of $28 million</a>) featuring tips for slowing the spread of coronavirus, such as staying home as much as possible and having groceries delivered. Importantly, the postcards were branded with
<a>President Trump</a>’s name and logos for both the White House and the CDC. We wanted to know whether those decisions would affect how those guidelines were received. The first product of this research, published online today by the
<a>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</a>, demonstrates that who we say a message is from may make a big difference in how people react.

<p>Colleges are great at training students for the job hunt: resume workshops, cover letter reviews, mock interviews, etc. But absorbing those lessons may be easier for students following self-reflection on where they are in the process.</p>
<a>motivation</a> by introducing students to if-then plans: Have them explicitly consider things that could mess up their best intentions and come up with a Plan B ahead of time.
<a>embarrassment</a>, shame, or regret. Those about to graduate feel pressure from themselves and others to start their careers and make college “worth it.”

<h1> Who Is Generation Z? </h1>
<h2> Gen Z faces unique barriers to educational success. </h2>
<p> Posted December 8, 2020 </p>

<a>Dr. Corey Seemiller</a> of Wright State University and
<a>Dr. Vickie Cook</a> of the University of Illinois Springfield—discussed what makes this generation unique. I wanted to pass along what I learned about Gen Z, starting with the fact that they seem to be a fascinating blend of contradictions.
<p>Careers: For Love and Money</p>
<a>a period of staggering gains in income inequality</a>, and watched us millennials, hamstrung by debt,
<a>delay major milestones such as marriage and parenthood</a>. The average Gen Z student begins financial planning at age 13, and two-thirds of Gen Z students say financial stability is more important than a job that makes them happy. However…
<a>the environment</a>. In general, Gen Z students are oriented to act for the benefit of others, although sometimes to their own detriment when they become intensely focused on not letting others down.

<a>education</a> more than previous generations, and more of them are enrolling in college than ever before. They see the connections between their financial
<p>Challenges with Mental Health</p>
<p>There’s no However… here: Gen Z students need a lot of mental health support if they’re to succeed in college and beyond.</p>
<p>Supporting Gen Z Students</p>
<a>Dr. Nicole Stephens</a> and others have described first-gens in similar terms:
<li>First-gen students are driven to help others but motivated by gainful employment;</li>
<li>First-gen students are highly invested in their education but fearful of <a>embarrassment</a> (due to issues like <a>bias</a> and stereotype threat);</li>
<li>First-gen students struggle with mental health, especially when they must navigate traditionally middle-class and predominantly white campuses.</li>
<a>successful interventions for first-gen students</a> and extracting the active ingredients for Gen Z students’ benefit. For example,
<a>Utility-value interventions</a>, which have increased first-gen students’ persistence by helping them draw connections between their courses and their future careers, may also engage Gen Z students driven by the desire for stable employment.
<a>Self-affirmation exercises</a>, which have bolstered first-gen students’ STEM performance by buffering their self against
<a>identity</a> threat, will likely also benefit Gen Z students, who worry so much about failure and judgment. Likewise, exercises like
<a>advice giving or expressive writing</a>, which have helped first-gen students deal with issues related to social belonging and bias, may help Gen Z students cope with their worry and
<a>optimism</a> when it comes to educating this new generation. Although they may seem guarded and difficult to reach, Gen Z students are bursting with passion,

<li>That they have the potential to reach their teacher’s high standards;</li>
<li>That they will be provided with the resources and opportunities necessary to reach those high standards.</li>

<h1> Strategies to Re-Engage Students Sidelined by the Pandemic </h1>
<h2> My conversation with higher-ed experts reveals insights for boosting enrollment. </h2>
<li>A successful college re-engagement strategy requires consistency, patience, and letting students know that the door is open when they're ready.</li>
<li>Offering flexibility in class schedules, online and in-person learning, and access to support will attract more college students to return.</li>
<li>The most important way to bring students back to college and keep them motivated to stay is to help them to find their purpose for learning.</li>

<a>Persistence Plus</a>, we learned early in the pandemic that new learners expect to be kept in the loop regarding impacts on their education, but also expressed the greatest appreciation when their college inquired about their wellbeing.

<p>As Hadass noted, there are tons of majors that people have never heard of, and discussing those options through the lens of purpose for learning will expand students’ horizons and help them to consider degrees they would otherwise brush off.</p>
