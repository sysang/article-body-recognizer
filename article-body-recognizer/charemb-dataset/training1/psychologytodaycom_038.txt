<a>eating disorders on college campuses.</a>
<h2> Are eating disorders genetic? </h2>
<a>greater risk</a> of developing one themselves. For example, studies show that people are
<a>7 to 12 times more likely</a> to develop anorexia or bulimia if they have a relative with an eating disorder.
<p>Those genetic underpinnings may also help explain why eating disorders often overlap with certain conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>However, one’s genetic predisposition is only one piece of the puzzle. For most people, a triggering event would also be necessary to spur the development of a disorder.</p>

<h2> How do culture, media, and beauty ideals influence eating disorders? </h2>
<p>Eating disorders are prominent in Western cultures, which place a strong emphasis on thinness, weight, and beauty. This can lead young adults, especially women, to believe that their self-worth is tied to their weight.</p>
<a>Constant comparison can take a heavy toll</a> on self-esteem and body satisfaction.
<p>Cultural and media scripts may contribute to the development of an eating disorder. However, they cannot produce the condition on their own.</p>

<a>5 percent </a>of adolescent girls or nearly

<h2> Has the prevalence of eating disorders increased over time? </h2>

<li> What are the symptoms of an eating disorder? </li>
<h2> What are the symptoms of an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Each eating disorder has a specific set of symptoms:</p>
<li>Anorexia Nervosa: Restricting the amount of food eaten, leading to significantly low body weight, and intense fear of gaining weight.</li>
<li>Pica: Consistently eating nonfood items, such as paper, cloth, or hair, for at least one month.</li>
<li>Rumination Disorder: Consistently regurgitating food to chew, swallow, or spit out for at least one month.</li>
<li>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder: Not eating to the point of insufficient nutrition or energy, in the absence of anorexia or bulimia.</li>
<h2> How can you recognize if someone has an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>The clearest signs of eating disorders may be rapid weight loss, unusual eating patterns, and excessive exercise. But there are also more <a>subtle signs</a> that a disorder may be developing or underway.</p>
<p>One observable theme, as the signs above demonstrate, is the development of routines and rigidity around eating and exercise.</p>
<h2> When do eating disorders develop? </h2>
<a>median age</a> when anorexia and bulimia develop is 18-years-old and the median age when binge-eating disorder develops is 21-years-old, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.

<h2> Who can develop an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>There are no boundaries to who can be hurt by eating disorders. Women develop them more often than men, but eating disorders can still arise in people of any age, race, or gender.</p>
<p>Recent research found eating disorders affect women of <a>ethnic minorities just as much as they affect White women.</a> The risk factors for developing a disorder were also the same across all ethnic groups.</p>
<h2> Are women more likely to develop eating disorders than men? </h2>
<h2> How is an eating disorder diagnosed? </h2>
<a>mental health professional,</a> a primary care physician, or both. The diagnosis can encompass both a physical exam and psychological questionnaires to assess a person’s eating habits and relationship to food and weight.
<h2> At what point does a diet become an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>In today’s wellness-obsessed culture, it can be difficult to distinguish between occasional concerns around food, picky eating, a diet, and an eating disorder. Where can you draw the line between health and harm?</p>
<p>Orthorexia is a term that describes an obsession with healthy eating. People with orthorexia may adopt strict diets, cut out entire food groups, and develop anxiety about diseases or food purity. </p>
<a>orthorexia may mask a more traditional eating disorder.</a>
<p>Perhaps because focusing on healthy eating is more socially acceptable than being fixated on weight loss, orthorexia may in part function to camouflage symptoms of an eating disorder.</p>

<a>benefits of CBT for treating depression.</a> Research shows that CBT is often equally as effective as
<a>antidepressants</a>; patients who receive CBT may also be
<a>less likely to relapse</a> after treatment than those who receive
<a>medication</a>. CBT can provide patients with the inner resources they need to heal—and to prevent a depressive episode from recurring in the future.
<div> <h3> Can CBT help with anxiety? </h3> </div>
<a>treatment for anxiety disorders,</a> research shows. CBT provides the tools to alter the thoughts and behaviors that exacerbate anxiety. For example, someone with
<a>social anxiety</a> might think, “I feel so awkward at parties. Everyone must think I’m a loser.” This thought may lead to feelings of sadness,
<a>shame</a>, and fear, when then lead to behaviors like isolation and avoidance. CBT can help people learn to identify and challenge distorted thoughts, and then replace them with realistic thoughts, changing the cycle of anxiety.
<div> <h3> Can CBT help with sleep? </h3> </div>
<a>CBT-I, is a short-term treatment for chronic insomnia.</a> The therapy aims to reframe people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors around sleep. People with insomnia often enter a cycle of trying to make up the sleep they lost,

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Omega-3</h1> <p>Fish Oil, Fatty Acid</p> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Why You Need Omega-3s </li> <li> <a> Maximizing Omega-3s In Your Diet </a> </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> Why You Need Omega-3s </h2>
<a>nervous system</a>, omega-3s foster the development of brain circuitry and the speedy processing of information. Fatty acids play an important role in stabilizing mood and staving off
<a>cognitive decline</a>. Low levels of omega-3s are linked to poor
<a>depression</a>. Here's a look at the brain benefits:
<li>Builds nerve cell membranes maintain the fluidity of nerve cell membranes</li>
<li>Allows activation of receptor systems, including the visual receptor system</li>
<li>Makes many bioactive compounds like the anti-inflammatory resolvins and other neuroprotectants</li>
<li>Supports energy metabolism</li>
<li>Modulates sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, affecting cell excitability in brain and heart</li>
<li>Modulates apoptosis, or programmed cell death</li>
<li>Provides vascular protection against stroke and <a>dementia</a>.</li>
<li>Lower blood triglyceride</li>
<li>Maintain heart function</li>
<li>Regulate blood pressure</li>
<li>Diminish back and joint pain</li>
<div> <h3> Why are omega-3s especially crucial for the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>hormones</a>, and proteins back and forth. The human brain is approximately 66 percent fat, and about 20 percent of that fat is omega-3. Cells can turn omega-3 fatty acids into
<a>powerful anti-inflammatory</a> molecules, allowing the brain to heal from
<a>trauma</a>, infection, and oxidation or metabolic damage.
<div> <h3> What are the different forms of omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help reduce anxiety? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Yes. In research on substance use, when subjects were given more than 2 grams of <a>EPA per day</a>, they showed a statistically significant reduction in <a>anxiety</a> compared with those only receiving a <a>placebo</a>. </p> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help improve mood? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In studies with individuals who did not suffer depression or anxiety, increased intake of EPA improved their ability to handle <a>stress</a> and generated significant improvements in mood.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help treat clinical depression? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Low doses of a common SSRI combined with a combination of omega-3 fatty acids might prove useful in treating patients whose depression has been <a>resistant to conventional treatments</a>.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Are omega-3s good for joint pain? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Critical for anti-inflammation in the body, omega-3 fats protect against pain and disorders like arthritis and joint problems. In some studies, people with rheumatoid arthritis who took omega-3 supplements suffered less joint pain.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Maximizing Omega-3s In Your Diet </h2>
<p> Specific foods contain EPA and DHA, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, these are found primarily in fish. Coldwater and fatty fish are higher in omega-3s, but here is a shortlist.</p>
<ul><li>Salmon</li> <li>Mackerel</li> <li>Sardines </li> <li>Tuna</li> <li>Anchovies</li> <li>Herring</li> <li>Trout</li> <li>Seaweed</li> </ul>
<p>And specific foods contain alpha-linolenic acid, ALA. Plant foods like nuts and seeds are high in ALA, but some vegetables also contain it.</p>
<ul><li>Flaxseed</li> <li>Chia</li> <li>Walnuts</li> <li>Cashews</li> <li>Soy foods</li> <li>Pumpkin seeds</li> <li>Canola </li> <li>Brussel sprouts</li> <li>Spinach </li> <li>Broccoli</li> <li>Basil</li> </ul>
<div> <h3> Do plants contain EPA or DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are eggs a source of EPA and DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No, eggs are very <a>low in EPA and DHA</a>. Eggs that are marketed as being higher in omega-3 are actually higher in ALA. Remember that this form of omega-3 is very difficult for the human body to use.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What seafood is higher in omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<a>wild salmon</a> contains some 900 mg of EPA and over 1100 mg of DHA.
<div> <h3> Why is wild fish better than farmed fish? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Farmed and wild fish have about the same amount of omega-3s. However, farmed fish is often higher in omega-6s because of what these fish are fed, and <a>omega-6s work against omega-3s</a> in the human body.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Why must you balance omega-6s and omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<a>essential fats </a>will help keep inflammation at bay. The recommended intake of omega-3s may even be inflated because studies are conducted on people who likely consume higher levels of omega-6; the Western
<a>diet</a> is typically high in omega-6.
<div> <h3> Why is an excess of omega-6s bad for you? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Vegetable oils and nuts and seeds contain omega-6 fatty acids, unsaturated fats. While omega-6s are a good replacement for meats and dairy, a diet in excess of these fats isn’t healthy.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do vegans and vegetarians have low levels of EPA and DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a 2005 study, <a>compared to meat-eaters</a>, vegetarians were 28 percent lower in EPA and 31 percent lower in DHA. Meanwhile, vegans were 53 percent lower in EPA and 59 percent lower in DHA compared with meat-eaters.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Nutrients fuel the body and brain's energy needs. This fuel allows humans to function and flourish—to breathe, to speak, to play, to learn, and to reproduce.</p>
<p>Humans evolved under very different circumstances than today; sustenance was often in short supply, and it was advantageous to snatch up sugars and fats that could provide a boost of energy.</p>
<p>These evolutionary roots are at odds with the modern world, in which food is, in many places, overabundant. Cravings can be difficult to control. Rules can be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Food also carries cultural, social, and economic weight. Holidays and gatherings, for example, highlight food as the main event, which can change the meaning of a meal.</p>
<p>Food can elicit an array of psychological challenges, often related to weight management, eating disorders, and body image. Yet there are numerous ways to address these challenges and cultivate a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h2> Struggles of Diet, Weight, and Body Image </h2>
<p>A good diet contributes to optimal health, but not everyone has a positive relationship with food. Some people battle with their plate, with body image challenges and obsessions joining the fight.</p>
<p>The act of eating is often rife with strong emotions like boredom, stress, and guilt. Looking for relief, people may gradually adopt unhealthy patterns, such as a cycle of on-and-off, short-term dieting, emotional eating, or disordered eating.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes emotional eating? </h3> </div>

<h2> The Best Foods for the Brain </h2>
<p>A healthy brain is fed by a balanced diet and a variety of nutrients. But a few foods provide a special boost.</p>
<p>Through omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins, these foods play a role in maintaining memory and concentration as well as staving off cognitive decline, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.</p>
<div> <h3> What is nutritional psychiatry? </h3> </div>
<a>Nutritional psychiatry</a> asks questions such as how to create a healthy diet, which foods could be added or removed from a diet to benefit mental health, and the relationship between the
<a>microbiome</a> and mental illness.

<div> <div> <h1>Types of Eating Disorders</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Anorexia is up to 10 times more common in women than in men. It most often begins in adolescence or young adulthood, but a second peak seems to occur <a>after age 40.</a> </p>
<a>Anorexia emerges due to a combination</a> of genetics, life circumstances such as childhood trauma, and cultural beauty ideals—which can play a role but are never fully responsible.
<p>Yet treatment is key because bulimia can produce medical complications in addition to deep distress. People with bulimia can become dehydrated, lose electrolytes, erode their dental enamel, and have gastrointestinal problems.</p>
<h2> Binge-Eating Disorder </h2>
<p>Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Many people also <a>shift between different eating disorders</a> over the years, such as struggling with anorexia at one time and binge-eating at another. </p>
<a>shame and self-criticism about it.</a>
<p>Pica occurs when someone consistently eats things that aren’t food. This could include paper, soap, cloth, paint chips, crayons, dirt, or ice—foods that contain no nutritional value and may be dangerous to digest.</p>
<p>Rumination occurs when people consistently regurgitate their food after eating. They then chew it, swallow it, or spit it out. Regurgitation occurs without a sense of disgust, nausea, or involuntary gagging. </p>
<p>Rumination often occurs in infancy and childhood, but it can affect adults as well. Stress and anxiety are risk factors for babies and children, while anxiety and depression are risk factors for adults.</p>
<p>Some people describe the condition as habitual or out of their control, and therapy may focus on interrupting and reversing those habits.</p>
<h2> Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder </h2>
<p>ARFID is also distinct from anorexia; the food aversion that marks ARFID is not driven by fears around body image or gaining weight, as in the case of anorexia.</p>
<p>ARFID can be addressed by a nutritionist and aided by a variety of clinicians, including pediatricians, gastroenterologists, and psychologists, to understand and address the root of the disorder.</p>
