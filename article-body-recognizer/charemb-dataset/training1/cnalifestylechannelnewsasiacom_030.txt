<h1> Investing tips for women: How to start today and keep going </h1>
<div> <p>If you’ve been putting off starting to invest or are unsure about how to make your investments grow even more, these tips can help. In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vivian Teo </a> </div> </div>
<p>You work and play hard. You might even be saving hard, mindful that you should be squirrelling away some funds for the proverbial rainy day.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people do. And it’s mostly because of the perception that investing is complicated and that we don’t know enough. </p>
<p>There’s also the misconception that you need a lot of money to start investing in the first place – some feel they’ve not set aside enough funds to take the first step.</p>
<p>These were the findings from a survey that United Overseas Bank (UOB) did last year of 500 Singaporeans aged 21 to 45 years.</p>
<p>And the barriers are real. Speak to your friends and you’re likely to hear any of these reasons for them not putting their hard-earned money into instruments that would help their money grow faster and better. </p>
<p>And that includes women. Jacquelyn Tan, the bank's Head of Group Personal Financial Services, said that while three out of five customers who purchased unit trusts in 2020 were women, many of their peers still hesitate.</p>
<p>“Our research showed that a greater proportion of women than men admit to procrastinating when it comes to investing, even though women are more likely to place an emphasis on it,” she said.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a plethora of investment products out there, from “traditional” ones like stocks, property and bonds, to alternatives like commodities, cryptocurrency and collectibles like watches and antiques.</p>
<p>And yes, it can feel overly complicated and terribly daunting.</p>
<p>And yes too, we seem to end up with information overload when we start our research, watch those how-to-invest videos on YouTube, or listen to well-meaning friends and relatives.</p>
<p>But it really doesn’t have to be that way. Tell yourself this (and often): Investing isn’t hard. And investing is necessary.</p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle asked investment experts for tips on how a woman can navigate the world of investing, whether you’re a complete noob, have already dipped a toe in and are ready to dive deeper, or are an experienced investor. </p>
<p>Before you put your hard-earned money into any investment, do your research on the product to fully understand what you are buying. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Are you spending too much and saving too little? Here's how to figure things out</a></h3>
<p>Koh advocates the “Ask, Check and Confirm” method.</p>
<p>“Ask as many questions as you can,” she said. For example, how much do I need to invest? How long do I need to be committed? How easy is it for me to exit this investment? What are the fees and charges involved? What is the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>After that, check and confirm the information that has been provided and do not rely on verbal promises, she said.</p>
<a>Monetary Authority of Singapore website</a>. It’s also a good idea to go to the
<a>National Crime Prevention Council website</a> to check for scam alerts, including investment scams.
<p>KEEP AN OPEN MIND BUT ALSO BE WARY</p>
<p>Koh noted that while she personally prefers traditional investments like equities and bonds, you can still keep an open mind about products you are unfamiliar with, albeit cautiously.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Perks of that plastic: Here's how women can make the most out of their credit card</a></h3>
<p>Although non-traditional products do tend to come with higher risk, you can still identify value and earn a return on investment with the right information, said Stephen Lee, Senior Research Analyst at consumer research firm <a>ValueChampion</a>.</p>
<p>“The danger is when retail investors follow the hype behind certain investment products without doing their homework. This becomes more like gambling than a sound investment with a reasonable expectation of return,” he said.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, you should do enough research to feel comfortable with buying something where you understand the risk you are taking on versus the return you could reasonably expect.”</p>
<p>YOU DON’T HAVE TO START BIG OR BE TECH SAVVY</p>
<p>Some women may feel they need a large amount of capital or be digitally savvy to start investing but this is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Technology has sprouted convenient financial tools like robo advisors and easy-to-use trading platforms. Coupled with low minimum-deposit requirements, the barriers to entry for the securities market are relatively low, financial experts said. </p>
<p>“We believe that investing should be for everyone, regardless of how much they know about investing, how much time they have to keep track of their investments or even how much money they have set aside to invest,” she added.</p>
<p>Your goal and risk appetite will affect your investment plan: The type of products to invest in, the capital to put in and the investment duration.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Impulse buying: Why some people can't stop shopping and how not to overspend</a></h3>
<p>Investing guru Warren Buffett once said: “If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money.” Ideally, we should base our investing decisions on logic and reason rather than emotions, but this may be easier said than done.</p>
<p>To avoid investing based on your emotions, there are two strategies you can employ. Dollar-cost averaging and diversification when investing in the securities market.</p>
<p>Dollar-cost averaging simply means that you put a fixed amount of money into an investment at regular intervals, helping to even out the cost of your investment over time.</p>
<p>To keep emotions out of your investing decision, IFL’s Koh advises writing down what you like about the investment, what the risks involved are, and what your exit strategy would be.</p>
<p>BE PATIENT, HONE YOUR SKILLS</p>
<p>ValueChampion’s Lee highlights the need for patience, whether it is to see one’s investment returns or to build one’s skills in investment.</p>
<p>“Be realistic with your expectations for portfolio growth and the investment strategy you’ve implemented, and hone your investment skills and strategy over time with patience.”</p>
<p>Soejanto added that while the returns of money market instruments and short-term bonds are “probably fairly predictable”, it is “almost impossible” to predict returns on equity investments in the short term.</p>

<div> <div> <h5> Commentary: Falling birth rates are a problem but don’t blame women alone </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Commentary: Falling birth rates are a problem but don’t blame women alone </h1>
<div> <p>Policymakers sometimes accuse women of frittering away their fertility, but the problem is more complex, says the Financial Times’ Camilla Cavendish.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Camilla Cavendish </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: OMG, I forgot to have children!” says the ubiquitous cartoon, in which a pretty blonde with lots of lipstick smites her forehead.</p>
<p>Now the new head of an all-women Cambridge college is offering seminars on fertility to students she fears are taught to focus more on their looks and careers than their biology.</p>
<p>Dorothy Byrne, who was a successful TV executive before becoming head of Murray-Edwards college, is wonderfully honest about having put her career first and only woken up to her biological clock just in time to have her daughter at the age of 45.</p>
<h2>PLUMMETING BIRTH RATES</h2>
<p>Some women do, sadly, leave it too late. But others have actively decided not to start a family, are worried about cost or have not met the right partner.</p>
<p>Most young women I meet are very keen indeed to discuss whether to have a baby, and when.</p>
<p>Yet the death of birth is one of the biggest stories of our age. In 1950, the average woman on the planet had five children; today she has just below 2.5.</p>
<p>The birth rate in England and Wales has just hit a record low, with no sign of the rumoured baby boom from COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p>These women don’t need lectures about their fertility. When the Italian health minister tried just that, in 2016, she was met with outraged counter demonstrations.</p>
<p>On National Fertility Day, women marched through the streets carrying placards reading “siamo in attesa” – a play on “we’re expecting”: Affordable childcare and job protection.</p>
<p>Other governments have faced similar problems when trying to cajole women into having kids.</p>
<p>A hilarious Danish campaign urged women to “Do It For Denmark”, and to take romantic breaks because Danes have 46 per cent more sex on holiday (I have no idea where they get such precise statistics).</p>
<p>But women have been largely unmoved – perhaps because they don’t like being treated like prize cattle. </p>
<h2>MORE CHOOSING NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN</h2>
<p>It is important to recognise that, contrary to the evolutionary impulse, quite a few women – and couples – are choosing not to have children.</p>
<p>For many, being child-free is a liberation from societal expectations. Others feel, as one Singaporean couple put it to me, that kids “don’t pass the cost-benefit test”. </p>
<p>Far from being too casual about the topic, most young people I meet put a great deal of thought into the pros and cons of parenthood. As a soppy mother of three, I feel they may be overthinking it.</p>
<p>But if people are settling down later and carrying student debt into their 30s, the window to start a family is narrowing: Because we are stuck with female fertility fading from around 35.</p>
<h2>A DIFFERENT CALCULATION FOR MEN</h2>
<p>The calculation is different for men. It’s perfectly rational for a man to put off having children while he climbs the career ladder, especially given that many people seem to hit peak earning age in their forties.</p>
<p>It’s not ideal to be bug-eyed from lack of sleep just when the big promotions loom, especially if you’re up against colleagues who are not having to change nappies at night.</p>
<h4> <div>She felt a sense of "despair" each time she had to breastfeed. But there’s one thing that made all the difference in this difficult journey, this new mother says on Heart of the Matter:</div> </h4>
<p>Like many others, she is now grimly googling sperm banks. </p>
<p>While this raises its own ethical questions about later parenthood, it could enable women to store their eggs in their twenties, when they are at their most fertile.</p>
<p>It might make a difference to tell men that their fertility declines too. Research suggests that babies born to fathers over 45 have greater risks of being born prematurely, and of suffering from congenital diseases later in life.</p>
<p>That’s something that most of us really didn’t know. What a shame the Cambridge seminars are only for women. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Have we placed too much faith in science to solve all our fertility problems? </h1>
<div> <p>The greater support couples will receive for fertility treatment is to be welcomed but let’s not let up on the focus on fostering family-friendly work environments, says Dr June Goh.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> June Goh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The <a>lifting of the age limit</a> for assisted reproduction technology for women has been heartening.</p>
<a>changing patterns of marriages</a> where the median age of marriage for women has reached 28.5, the median age of women giving birth for the first time has risen to 30.3, and the number of babies born to Singaporean parents is also at its lowest for
<p>Clearly, the changes have been made with much consideration over advances in medical technology and care of the older women in pregnancy. </p>
<p>Although IVF success rates fall sharply after 40, these changes will still see some measure of success for women who have tried to conceive for some time to no avail.</p>
<p>LEGISLATION SHOULD SUPPORT NOT LIMIT FAMILY PLANNING</p>
<p>Without this choice in Singapore, some women attempt to undertake the treatment in other countries which adds to the difficulties they face as IVF treatment requires many visits.</p>
<p>This could impact their jobs and careers, and act as a source of pressure on the marriage.</p>
<p>Fertility treatment and assisted reproduction is a stressful and expensive process. Having a time limit imposed on treatments and having to make appeals add to an already fraught process.</p>
<p>A woman going down this path already has so many obstacles in her way that legislation should not be yet another thing to worry about. Taking away the age limit will take away a key stressor.</p>

<p>These changes in rules will also necessitate greater support for couples in making the right decisions.</p>

<p>However, much needs to be done to make a paradigm shift. While supportive government policies are essential, it also falls on society as a whole to create an inclusive and encouraging environment for parenthood.</p>
<p>Fathers have to be more involved. Shared parenting responsibilities should be a norm and not the rarity. We must make a concerted effort to break stereotypes and show that an equal partnership is beneficial.</p>

<h1> Commentary: The myth of COVID-19 vaccines and women’s fertility </h1>
<div> <p>Unvaccinated pregnant women risk being critically ill if they get COVID-19. And the data clearly shows that vaccination is safe and does not affect fertility or pregnancy, say two researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Michelle Wise </a> <a> Erena Browne </a> </div> </div>
<p>AUCKLAND: Some women are holding off on being vaccinated against COVID-19 because of concerns the jab could affect their fertility, at times taking to social media to voice their concerns.</p>
<p>Anti-vaccination campaigners appear to be fuelling these fears and misleading women into thinking the vaccine may affect their chance of getting pregnant now or in the future or increase their risk of a miscarriage.</p>
<p>But there is no research evidence to support these claims. The science shows COVID-19 vaccines have no effect on fertility, do not impact the chance of a miscarriage and are safe and effective while pregnant.</p>
<p>COVID-19, however, can cause severe disease in pregnant women. Currently one in six of the most critically ill COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom are unvaccinated pregnant women.</p>
<h2>WHERE DID THE FERTILITY MYTH COME FROM?</h2>
<p>Myths about the vaccine affecting fertility can be tracked back to websites in the United States, which highlighted a claim by a European doctor in December 2020, while the vaccine was in Phase 3 trials.</p>
<p>But the viral and placental proteins are not similar enough that we would expect this to happen; studies have now confirmed this.</p>
<p>There has not been a concurrent epidemic of infertility nor miscarriage.</p>
<p>Several populations of women have been followed up after vaccination. Women who have received COVID-19 vaccinations have no difference in markers of ovarian follicle, or egg, quality compared to unvaccinated women.</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated no difference in embryo implantation rate for women who had received vaccination against COVID-19 prior to having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) compared to unvaccinated women.</p>
<h2>WHAT ABOUT PREGNANCY AND FUTURE FERTILITY?</h2>
<p>Studies have also looked specifically at miscarriage. If antibodies against the spike did cause problems for the placenta, we would expect to see miscarriages. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Getting vaccinated at any stage of pregnancy will provide this additional benefit.</p>
<p>In other words, COVID-19 vaccines don’t stay in your body. After vaccination, you are left with antibodies ready to act in case you get exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the future. There is no link with infertility or miscarriage.</p>

<div> <p> Wellness </p> <h1> Why do babies get so many vaccination jabs? And what are they for? </h1> <div> <p>It may seem like your newborn is getting an injection every month. What are they for and why are they necessary?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>With news such as the detection of <a>polio in Sabah</a> and the <a>measles outbreak in Samoa</a> that took 72 lives – mostly infants – vaccination couldn’t be more pertinent. And Singapore isn’t immune to these diseases either. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Are two flu shots better than one when travelling with family during flu season?</a></h3>
<p>WHAT DISEASES ARE THE JABS FOR?</p>
<a>health issues they can cause</a>:
<li>Pertussis (whooping cough)</li>
<li>Haemophilus influenza type B</li>
<li>Pneumococcal infection</li>
<h3><a>READ: HPV can cause cancers in both genders – so should boys be vaccinated too?</a></h3>
<p>However, these combination vaccines don’t cover pneumococcal infection, human papillomavirus, as well as optional vaccines such as rotavirus disease and Hepatitis A, so parents should take note and discuss with the doctor to extend the coverage. </p>
<p>According to Dr Thoon, an alternative schedule with combination as well as additional and optional vaccines might look like this:</p>
<p>WHAT TO EXPECT DURING YOUR BABY’S JAB APPOINTMENT</p>
<p>Be prepared to soothe a crying baby for a few seconds after the injection as the needle does cause brief pain. What are also common are soreness, slight redness and even a small lump but they usually resolve on their own, according to HealthHub. </p>
<p>WHEN SHOULD YOU DELAY THE SHOTS?</p>
<p>However, charges apply to optional vaccines such as chickenpox, rotavirus, Hepatitis A and meningococcal, so it's best to check with the doctor at selected clinics and hospitals.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h5> 18 primary and secondary schools to undergo mergers due to declining birth rates, changing demographics </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> Singapore </p> <h1> 18 primary and secondary schools to undergo mergers due to declining birth rates, changing demographics </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Four pairs of primary schools and five pairs of secondary schools will be merged between 2022 and 2024, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Wednesday (Apr 7). </p>
<p>The names of the merged schools will be announced later.</p>
<p>These schools were identified based on enrolment trends, geographical proximity of the schools to be merged, suitability of merger partners and the receiving schools' infrastructure capacities, said Ms Liew. </p>
<p>The resident birth rate has dropped from around 46,000 per year in the 1990s to about 35,000 in recent years, said MOE at a briefing on Wednesday. </p>
<p>"At the same time, population demographics have changed in the newer estates, leading to an uneven distribution of students across the schools," said the ministry. </p>
<h3><a>WATCH: Schools prepare for largest merger exercise in 20 years</a></h3>
<p>For this round, all the mergers will take place in 2023 except for the merging of Juying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School (2022), and Fuchun Secondary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary School (2024).</p>
<p>Juying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School are located in mature areas, and enrolment in both schools have been "falling consistently" in recent years, said MOE in the press release. </p>
<p>The schools will merge in 2022 to "facilitate a revised alignment" of the Jurong Region Line, which will run through Pioneer Primary. </p>
<p>The merged school will be temporarily housed at Juying Primary School's current site, but will eventually move to new location in Tengah Plantation district from January 2025, said MOE in the press release. </p>
<p>This will meet "upcoming demand" for primary school places in Tengah and address the "declining demand" in the Jurong West area. This will be the first primary school in Tengah, said MOE. </p>
<p>The merged school will not admit new Primary 1 cohorts at its temporary site from 2022 to 2024, and will only admit its first batch after relocating to the new campus in Tengah. </p>
<p>Existing students of the merged school will continue to study at the Juying Primary School campus after the new campus opens, and the last batch of Primary 6 students will graduate in 2026. </p>
<p>"This means that from 2025 to 2026, the merged school will operate two campuses to minimise the need for their Primary 5 and 6 students to commute to the new campus in Tengah," the press release read. </p>
<h3><a>READ: MOE to relocate Yusof Ishak Secondary from Bukit Batok to Punggol</a></h3>
<p>As for Fuchun Secondary and Woodlands Ring Secondary, the rebuilding and improving programme for the latter was previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will only be completed in 2023. </p>
<p>The two schools will thus merge in 2024 to allow the merged school to take over the upgraded campus, said MOE in the press release. </p>
<p>In 2016, Fajar Secondary and Ping Yi Secondary also merged with Chestnut Drive Secondary and Bedok Town Secondary respectively. </p>
<p>The Education Ministry is "very mindful" that a merger is "not the best thing that can happen to a school", addressing questions on multiple recent mergers for these schools. </p>
<p>"But when we look at it we sometimes just have to accept that the local demographic numbers just don't permit us to hold back a merger," said the ministry. </p>
<p>Telok Kurau Primary School was formerly Telok Kurau English School, founded in 1926. Its alumni include former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former Malaysian Prime Minister Hussein Onn. </p>
<p>Teck Whye Secondary started as Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School in 1967. It was the second integrated school to be established in the Teck Whye neighbourhood and provided education in English, Mandarin and Malay.</p>
<p>"As with all previous mergers, there will be no retrenchment of MOE staff," Ms Liew said. </p>
<p>In the year leading up to the merger, there will be discussions across the two schools merging on what would be "a good mix" of staff members, and the new principal will be announced, said MOE in the briefing. </p>
<p>"Those (who) are not going to be part of the merged school, we obviously have plans for them to be posted, redeployed to other parts of the education system, typically in another school for teachers," the ministry said. </p>
<p>"That's our assurance and it's not an issue of numbers. We will ensure everyone will be redeployed." </p>
<p>The ministry will "work closely" with the affected schools to "ensure a smooth transition" to the merged school for students and staff, said Ms Liew. </p>
<p>"I know that every merger is a painful exercise. It's a painful exercise for the students, the alumni, the staff in particular and the school leaders," she added.</p>
<p>"MOE HQ is committed to work closely with them to ensure that this process is as smooth as possible and that they can see the resulting outcomes, which is a vibrant and a stronger school for the students that will be coming to their merged school." </p>
<p>"The history and heritage of both schools will be documented in a heritage space in the merged school building," MOE said in the press release.</p>

<p>SHANGHAI: For Chinese couple Ren and Fu (not their real names) in Shanghai, having a second child is akin to buying a sports car.</p>
<p>Can they afford its RMB1 million to 2 million (S$207,300 to S$414,600) price tag? Yes. But is it necessary? “After some thought, it seems that it’s not,” said the wife Ren, who works in advertising.</p>
<p>“Another factor is that both of us don’t really like children.”</p>
<p>It is more the sacrifices that come with having children, Fu chimed in. “Over the course of nurturing a child, you’re continually giving, and you don’t get much of a return,” the finance industry worker told the programme <a>Money Mind</a>.</p>
<p>“You give your time and money and a lot of capital … For this investment, one is enough.”</p>
<p>The couple, in their late 30s, got married in 2009 and had a son three years later.</p>
<p>Their sentiments, born of living in a frenetic and expensive metropolis, are not uncommon among China’s young urban dwellers and are a key obstacle to the country’s push to increase its birth rate, cite analysts.</p>
<p>Beijing announced this week that married couples may have three children, up from two, the limit allowed since 2016. Before that, the one-child policy had been in place since 1979 over fears of a population explosion.</p>

<h3><a>READ> China's new three-child policy draws scepticism, cost questions</a></h3>
<p>The three-child policy comes after China’s latest census showed that its population had increased by 5.38 per cent over the past decade — the smallest increase since the 1950s — to 1.41 billion.</p>
<p>Its 12 million births last year were also the lowest on record since 1961. The fertility rate was 1.3 children per woman, well below the replacement rate of 2.1.</p>
<p>If the experience of Ren and Fu is any indication, it may be a challenge getting couples to even have a second child.</p>
<p>The one-child policy was still in place when the university sweethearts first met. Soon after they married, couples were allowed to have two children if one party in the marriage was an only child.</p>

<p>While that condition no longer applied later on, Ren said households with more than two children typically belonged either to the uppermost or lowest classes of society.</p>
<p>The wealthiest can hire nannies to care for their children, while the poorest are willing to have more children because they “don’t have much capital”.</p>

<p>But for middle-income urbanites who work and have parents to look out for, one child is all they have energy for, Ren said.</p>
<p>She and her husband did not plan to have a second child from the start. To do so now would mean “we might have to push back our retirement by 10 years”, she added.</p>
<p>Fu mentioned other considerations, like property prices.</p>
<p>Middle-income families in Shanghai typically live in homes that are less than 100 square metres. At RMB80,000 to RMB100,000 per sq m, they may not be able to afford a larger space to grow their families, he said.</p>
<p>The average entry-level income for Shanghai’s white-collar families is around RMB5,000 to RMB10,000, he cited.</p>
<p>“Another point is the majority of couples in Shanghai are both working,” he added.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if Singapore has this ‘9-9-6’ saying — that means working from 9am to 9pm for six days (a week). In Shanghai, it could be from 9am to 12am or 1am and for seven days.”</p>
<p>He thinks the Chinese are “not against” having more children, but systemic issues and mindsets stand in the way.</p>
<p>“A bigger part of the problem is how to adjust the economic structure and how to allow people to stay at home more and not keep earning money,” he said.</p>
<p>‘INTERESTING’ CHOICES LIE AHEAD</p>
<p>China’s official Xinhua news agency said the three-child policy will come with measures such as lower educational costs, and more tax and housing support.</p>
<p>Without going into details, it also said Beijing will guarantee the legal interests of working women and clamp down on “sky-high” dowries.</p>
<p>China’s talent pool is deepening as more people graduate from universities. But its “insanely young retirement age” — women at 55 and men at 60 — means a “huge waste of human capital”, said Hang Seng Bank (China) chief economist Wang Dan.</p>
<p>She foresees another “interesting policy debate” in the next five years: Whether the country still wants to focus on developing large cities, where “people tend to have fewer children than in smaller cities and counties”.</p>
<p>“One risk associated with population decline is the housing market in some parts of China, because in the past 20 years, there’s been this build-up of residential housing in many of the mid-sized and small-sized cities,” she told Money Mind.</p>
<p>While the biggest cities are growing, “we’re seeing more and more shrinking regions, especially in the north-east and in the west, so the authorities need to figure out a way to stabilise the housing market in these regions”.</p>
<p>There is also a labour shortage in manufacturing, she noted, although this can be mitigated by robots and greater automation.</p>
<p>But more vocational schools could be built, and “one obvious area” where investment is needed is the healthcare industry, said Wang.</p>
<p>“China is lacking in its elderly care and healthcare in general, so it could learn so much from countries like Singapore, South Korea and Japan.”</p>

<p>The next decade may see another economic shift if businesses can cater for single women, she added. Their earning power will “partially compensate the lower consumption due to the low fertility rate”.</p>
<h3><a>READ> Commentary: China’s fertility crisis could kill its economic dynamism</a></h3>
<p>Whether China succeeds in raising its birth rate remains to be seen. Ren said the government has already tried to encourage a family-friendly society in some ways.</p>
<p>It set up zones in public places where children can play. It delayed school dismissal timings so that working parents can pick their children up, and does not charge school fees at public schools, she cited.</p>
<p>“No one wishes for the population number to decline, but everyone has their own choice,” she said.</p>
<p>“This is the attitude of the people now: Basically, get married if you find someone suitable; if there’s no one suitable, just stay single. It’s not a big deal — at least in the advertising circle, the culture is very diverse.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> More than 30 killed, bodies burnt in Myanmar's Kayah state </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>More than 30 people, including women and children, were killed and their bodies burnt in Myanmar's conflict-torn Kayah state on Friday (Dec 24), according to a local resident, media reports and a local human rights group.</p>
<p>The Karenni Human Rights Group said that they found the burnt bodies of internally displaced people, including elders, women and children, killed by the military that rules Myanmar, near Mo So village of Hpruso town on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We strongly denounce the inhumane and brutal killing which violates human rights," the group said in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>The Myanmar military said it had shot and killed an unspecified number of "terrorists with weapons" from the opposition armed forces in the village, state media said. The people were in seven vehicles and did not stop for the military, it said.</p>
<p>The Myanmar military could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Photos shared by the human rights group and local media showed the charred remains of bodies on burnt-out truckbeds.</p>
<p>The Karenni Nationalities Defence Force, one of the largest of several civilian militias opposing the junta that led a Feb 1 coup, said that the dead were not their members but civilians seeking refuge from the conflict.</p>
<p>"We were so shocked at seeing that all the dead bodies were different sizes, including children, women and old people," a commander from the group told Reuters, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>A villager who asked not to be named for security reasons said that he was aware of the fire on Friday night, but could not go to the scene as there was shooting.</p>
<p>"I went to see this morning. I saw dead bodies that had been burnt, and also the clothes of children and women spread around," he told Reuters by phone.</p>
<p>Civilians enraged by the coup and subsequent crackdown on protesters have been taking up arms. Many local resistance forces have sprung up across the country.</p>
<p>The military has outlawed many opponents, labelling them traitors or terrorists, including a self-proclaimed National Unity Government that seeks to lobby the international community and prevent the junta from consolidating power.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Berlin and Kremlin envoys to meet over Ukraine, says source </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BERLIN: Senior German and Russian government officials have agreed to a rare in-person meeting next month in an effort to ease political tensions over Ukraine, a German government source said on Saturday (Dec 25).</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's foreign policy adviser Jens Ploetner and Russia's Ukraine negotiator Dmitry Kozak agreed to meet after a lengthy phone conversation on Thursday, the source said on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The German government has not made any official comment. A spokesman for Kozak declined to comment.</p>
<p>There have been a flurry of phone calls between western leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent months over Russia's military build-up on the Ukrainian border and resulting fears of an invasion.</p>
<p>In-person meetings between senior Western and Russian government officials have been few and far between, though US President Joe Biden held talks with President Putin in Geneva last June.</p>
<p>Since taking office this month, Scholz has emphasised the need for dialogue with Russia over its military build-up on the Ukrainian border while joining western allies in backing sanctions should Moscow invade.</p>
<p>Berlin doubts more than Washington whether Russia actually wants to attack Ukraine and is keen to de-escalate tensions, two government sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>"The German side's goal remains to achieve a swift reactivation of the Normandy format," the German government source said, referring to multilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany.</p>
<p>SPD parliamentary leader Rolf Mutzenich told Reuters the party was not "naive" and knew who it was dealing with, adding that it still believes that engagement could help to de-escalate the Ukraine situation.</p>
