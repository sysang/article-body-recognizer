<p>What’s more, many Gen Z’ers are embracing life — especially if they’re vaccinated — and sort of tuning out:</p>

<h1>Biden urged to bow out while Democrats seek alternative for 2024</h1>

<p>If President <a>Biden</a> had not spent months touting the virtues of his massive <a>spending bill</a>, the capitulation would not seem as much of a defeat.</p>
<p>Now the nearly $2 trillion measure is not going to get a vote before the end of the year, which in my view means it may never pass, given that next year is all about the midterms.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Biden got his infrastructure bill by promising House progressives a vote on Build Back Better, and now, unable to devise any compromise that would satisfy <a>Joe Manchin</a>, it’s dead for 2021 – and perhaps beyond. </p>
<p>The decision to keep pushing this Medicare/climate change/tax credit/pre-kindergarten bill, rather than declare victory after getting infrastructure, is a monumental political miscalculation.</p>

<p>But the fact that he can’t drive the coverage – or get 48 Democratic senators (plus two independents who caucus with them) to support his top domestic priority – is a glaring sign of weakness.</p>
<p><a>PANDEMIC FATIGUE DEFIES VIRUS DEATHS FOR THOSE ACHING FOR NORMALCY</a></p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a wave of media stories expressing doubt that the beleaguered president will run for reelection, a full three years before said election. Biden insists he will seek a second term, at 82, but the doubts are growing louder.</p>
<p>What I said at the time is that it’s unlikely Biden has made a final decision, and if he had decided not to run again it would be insane to announce so far in advance.</p>

<p>Now comes New York Times conservative columnist Bret Stephens to <a>say</a> that Biden should tell the world, "much sooner than later, that he will not run for a second term."</p>
<p>Stephens concedes that this would turn Biden into an instant lame duck.</p>
<a>Democratic</a> field by not bowing to the inevitable. But Stephens, saying Biden’s performance ranges from "cogent" to "uneven" to "incoherent," insists: "Far from weakening him, it would instantly allow him to be statesmanlike."

<p><a><u>WHY TIME TAPPED ELON MUSK, MASTER INVENTOR AND QUIRKY ZILLIONAIRE</u></a></p>
<p>I think the age factor will make it difficult for Biden to run again, even if his political fortunes rebound, but am just addressing when he would go public with his plans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an earlier <a>Times</a> story essentially provided the 2024 handicapping for the Democrats if Biden stepped aside (though no potential contender is allowed to say that out loud). CNN's Chris Cillizza just posted his own list.</p>
<p><a>Kamala Harris</a> and <a>Pete Buttigieg</a> are in the Times story, of course, along with <a>Elizabeth Warren</a> (though she got clobbered last time) and <a>Amy Klobuchar</a> (who’s since had a bout with cancer).</p>

<p>Mitch Landrieu is getting a lot of notice from what the late Times columnist Russell Baker used to call the Great Mentioner, especially now that the former <a>New Orleans</a> mayor is now the infrastructure czar.</p>
<p>And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo also seems to have a direct line to the Great Mentioner.</p>
<p>The list goes on to greater long shots. And the media chatter is obviously a sign that many Democrats are hedging their bets or plotting their futures in case the nomination is up for grabs.</p>
<p>But that’s still better for Joe Biden than a premature abdication. </p>

<h1>Pelosi defends lawmakers trading stocks despite media exposé of conflicts</h1>
<h2>Nancy Pelosi simply tried to wave away any suggestion of conflicts of interest</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Howard Kurtz: Chris Cuomo firing rooted in anonymous accusation, collapse of relationship with Jeff Zucker</a></h4> <p>The ‘MediaBuzz’ host discusses the aftermath of the liberal CNN anchor’s termination from the network. </p></div></div>
<p><a>Nancy Pelosi</a> simply tried to wave away any suggestion of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>A journalist at her weekly briefing asked about a bombshell report in Business Insider that 49 members of <a>Congress</a> have violated federal law with their prodigious stock trading. Not to mention 182 senior Hill aides.</p>
<p><a>BIDEN URGED TO BOW OUT WHILE DEMOCRATS SEEK ALTERNATIVE FOR 2024</a></p>
<p>Should this sort of thing be allowed?</p>
<p>Sure, said the House speaker. "Because this is a free market," and "a free-market economy, they should be able to participate in that."</p>
<div> <div><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters at the Capitol in Washington. (Associated Press)</p></div></div>
<p>That is such an inadequate answer on so many levels. In fact, CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin called it "one of the most disappointing," and "disgraceful" comments he’s heard on the issue.</p>
<p>"What a disgusting comment," former government ethics chief Walter Shaub told Fox News. "This is the opposite of government ethics."</p>
<p>Yet the brief exchange was all but lost, drowned out by all the Jan. 6 investigation news and other stories.</p>
<div> <div><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conducts a news conference on Capitol Hill. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>Business Insider ran an <a>exposé</a>, prompting the question to the speaker, saying that 49 members of Congress – along with 182 senior Hill aides – violated a federal conflict-of-interest law. This, by the way, has been a bipartisan practice.</p>
<p>Among the findings: Almost 75 lawmakers holding stocks in Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson Johnson, which make the <a>Covid</a> vaccines, were trading those stocks in the early weeks of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another 15 lawmakers overseeing defense policy actively invest in <a>military</a> contractors.</p>
<p>And some members who rip "the media" invest in such companies as the New York Times, Disney, Comcast, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>The list goes on, from tobacco to <a>Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p><a><u>PANDEMIC FATIGUE DEFIES VIRUS DEATHS FOR THOSE ACHING FOR NORMALCY</u></a></p>
<p>This undermines faith in government. I don’t see why any member of Congress should be allowed to trade individual stocks, as opposed to diversified mutual funds.</p>
<p>At least one prominent <a>Democrat</a> agrees. <a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez </a>tweeted that it’s "absolutely ludicrous" for members to be able to own and trade stocks "with the info we have."</p>
<div> <div><p> U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. </p></div></div>
<p>Now insider trading is a hard rap to prove, requiring evidence that the person traded on non-public information and intended to break the law.</p>
<p><a><u>SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES</u></a></p>
<p>"We have a responsibility to report," Pelosi said at the presser. "If people aren’t reporting, they should be."</p>
<p>But the 45-day delay obviously doesn’t allow for real-time media scrutiny – and violators, when they’re caught, may pay minimal fines.</p>
<p>The only recent prosecution came in 2019, when then-<a>Republican</a> U.S. Rep. Chris Collins pleaded guilty to notifying his son about confidential information he’d obtained about a drug company’s failed trial, causing the stock to plummet.</p>
<p>I’m surprised Pelosi, whose husband owns millions in stocks, was so dismissive of a situation that reeks of unfairness.</p>

<a><u>report</u></a>, the allegations related to Westchester County involved a female state trooper in his security detail who alleged that Cuomo asked to kiss her. She said she obliged because she feared the consequences of denying the governor's request.
<p>According to the report, Cuomo kissed her and "said something to the effect of, ‘Oh, I'm not supposed to do that’ or ‘unless that's against the rules.’"</p>
<p>Another woman alleged publicly and to investigators for the DA's office that Cuomo grabbed her by the arm and greeted her with a kiss without seeking her permission at a high school event.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, prosecutors in Nassau County announced that Cuomo won't be criminally charged in another sexual misconduct allegation against him that fell under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>A statement from acting Nassau County District Attorney Joyce Smith at the time said that Smith's office had "concluded" its probe into an alleged incident from September 2019 that was said to have taken place at the Belmont Racetrack.</p>

<p>The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the <a>Capitol</a> is set to release an interim report on its findings by the summer of next year.</p>
<p>First reported by <a>The Washington Post</a>, the actions signal further investigative measures into allies of former President <a>Trump</a> and his administration as the 2022 midterm elections rapidly approach.</p>
<p><a>WILL THE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE SUBPOENA A SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS?</a></p>
<p>The Post reported the committee "plans to begin holding public hearings in the new year to tell the story of the insurrection from start to finish while crafting an ample interim report on its findings by summer."</p>
<p>In addition, the committee is weighing whether to propose legislative measures to "help prevent valid election results from being overturned in the future."</p>
<p>The panel, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, has interviewed more than 300 witnesses' testimonies and obtained more than 35,000 pages of records. The committee has also announced more than 50 subpoenas, many of which were defied.</p>
