<p>The labor market’s record churn reached new heights in November, with 4.5 million workers quitting or changing their jobs, the highest number in the survey’s history, according the Labor Department’s monthly report on job openings.</p>
<div><div><p>Overall, the numbers of people quitting or leaving to start new jobs represents 3 percent of the workforce, the new government data said.</p></div></div>
<p>The 10.6 million job openings dwarf the numbers of people currently listed as unemployed, at 6.9 million. The sheer size of the imbalance — there are about 1.5 jobs for every unemployed worker — has helped give workers more leverage.</p>
<div><div><p>The number of workers quitting in November was<b> </b>up from the 4.2 million who left or changed jobs in October and surpassed the previous record of 4.4 million in September.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, overheating and confounding economy of 2021.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly 7 percent of restaurant and bar workers changed or quit jobs in November, as did 4.4 percent of retail workers.</p></div></div>
<a>according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data</a>.
<div><div><p>On surveys ZipRecruiter has done, many job seekers report they are looking for new types of work and particularly for remote work, due to family, child care or safety concerns.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Wall Street hardly stirred this week amid the latest debt ceiling drama, reflecting both investor fatigue with how lawmakers handle the public purse and confidence in a financial system armored with cash.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even while an impasse on Capitol Hill threatened what President Biden warned would be “catastrophic” economic damage, the stock market held onto its 2021 gains and long-term Treasury bonds were stable.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Stoicism in the financial markets was born of experience. Two previous showdowns over raising the government’s borrowing limit, in 2011 and 2013, rattled investor nerves but ultimately fizzled short of default.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However scary it was at the time, those episodes handed market players greater confidence that they could weather a genuine crisis if the federal government had to delay repaying investors for a day or two.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have been through this song and dance multiple times,” said Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during earlier debt battles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite Treasury denials, bond traders expect the government to prioritize repaying bondholders under a plan shaped in the 2011 debt crisis.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A lunchtime newsletter featuring political analysis on the stories driving the day.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Olivier Knox</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Caroline Anders</p></div></div><div>Yesterday at 11:35 a.m. EST</div></div>
<i>Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to </i>
<i>. Via the Associated Press: On this day in 1925, Democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross became America’s first female governor after a special election in Wyoming. She succeeded her late husband, William.</i>
<div><div><p><i>Correction: An earlier version of this bit of political trivia misidentified Ross's home state as Wisconsin.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The big idea</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden's ‘breathrough’ problem</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>“If the booster shots work, why don’t they work?” House Judiciary Committee Republicans asked on their official Twitter account last week, as omicron cases soared. They later deleted that message with no explanation.</p></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Do they or don't they?</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis refused to say whether he’d had a booster shot, or to recommend others get theirs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the president hasn’t tackled the “breakthrough” problem in a particularly serious and sustained way – not in proportion to the systematic and organized manner the GOP has weaponized the phenomenon.</p></div></div>
<p>“I wish the White House would engage, and not just engage breakthrough as some level of failure we have to accept,” Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told The Daily 202 in a telephone interview yesterday.</p>
<div><div><p>Biden and his team should “instead be very proactive in saying vaccines are remarkably effective at turning something that is deadly into something that is manageable,” Jha said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To some degree, the president did that yesterday as he kicked off a meeting with his top pandemic advisers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the unvaccinated, it’s a different story. “Some will die – needlessly die,” the president said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most vaccines work by reducing the severity of illness, priming the body’s immune system to fend off an infection – and that’s what the covid shots do.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But Americans – including public health officials – saw “those original magical numbers” showing vaccines with effectiveness near 100 percent, coloring expectations about the protection they bestow, Jha said.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 21, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>The U.S. economy this year was strong and scary and not at all normal.</p>
<p>Theirs are tales of perseverance and adaptation, resilience and triumph.</p>
<p>“We don’t look at this as a classic recovery,” said Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist for SP Global Ratings. “We’re learning this as we go.”</p>
<p>But no one knows how the pandemic will affect next year. Few people even know how it will affect next week.</p>
<h6>Demand far beyond supply</h6>
<p>“You see that 2018 Nissan Altima sitting out there?” asked Joe Zeidan, who owns Z Auto Place, a used-car business in west Houston.</p>
<div><div><p>“For sure, 2020 was a disaster year for us, both financially and personally,” Zeidan says. “I lost a lot of money last year.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Toy cars line a shelf at Z Auto Place. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the year ends, Zeidan says the number of customers outstrips the availability of cars. </p></div></div>
<p>This year, customers are back, and prices are up. Way up. Zeidan estimates his business is booming 50 percent over 2020.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m not so unhappy that I had so many cars I couldn’t sell last year. Now, I’m selling them at a higher price than I could have gotten last year.”</p>
<p>How long does Zeidan expect the car-buying frenzy to continue?</p>
<p>“I give it another six or seven months. But you never know,” he said. “Nobody knows anything about which way the world is turning.”</p>

<p>Two hours and many leaps later, she couldn’t hold back: “I cried tears of joy.”</p>

<p>The dancers finally resumed full rehearsals this fall. After practicing for so long in small pods and via Zoom, she relishes being together. “I care about my colleagues even more because of that separation.”</p>
<p>She is thrilled that the audiences have returned in force. And as she pirouettes in a fantasyland of gently falling snowflakes, they watch her in spellbound silence.</p>
<p>“Being onstage again has been a really powerful feeling,” Cirio said.</p>

<h6>From paycheck to paycheck to pay dirt</h6>
<p>Kailey Kernick knew she was in trouble when yet another luxury-label boutique moved into Miami’s most chichi shopping area this month.</p>
<p>“They just opened a Chanel store a week ago,” she said. “And so that’s going to be dangerous for me.”</p>
<p>“Dior is my favorite thing. And I love Chanel. I have an insane shopping addiction,” Kernick said.</p>
<p>It’s an addiction she can afford, thanks to the supercharged cryptocurrency trading that has transformed and empowered her world.</p>
<p>Two years ago, she was in her hometown near Calgary, working as a waitress and “living paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “I barely had any savings.”</p>
<div><div><p>A woman toting bags from Loro Piana pauses outside a store in Miami's Design District.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People shop in the area's high-end boutiques. Kernick says she and her friends are all enjoying luxe lifestyles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Expensive fashion is on display in window after window.</p></div></div>
<p>Though she realizes the pandemic is still upending many lives, she expects to be ready to weather any future financial setbacks.</p>
<p>For now, she’s trying to persuade her parents in Canada to come visit. “They’re frugal people. They don’t really quite understand what I’m doing with crypto,” she said.</p>
<p>Kernick isn’t apologizing for the extravagance of her splurges — like the $4,000 pair of earrings from Cartier she recently bought.</p>
<p>“I think life manifests itself in the way you live it. I live the life I want to live, and I’m just going to keep inviting more luxury and abundance,” Kernick said. “You attract what you give out to the world.”</p>

<p>She’s tired, though there’s no question of walking away. Marcus Books, named for Black activist Marcus Garvey, remains her mission.</p>
<p>“It’s essential that any culture, any community has its own source of knowledge,” Richardson said. “For the Black community, this is it.”</p>
<p>The past two years have of course been challenging. When the pandemic forced shutdowns in California, the bookstore’s supporters responded with fundraising efforts and waves of phone orders to help keep it afloat.</p>

<h6>Big trucks, small parts and an economy hanging in the balance</h6>
<p>After pulling countless trailers of grain across the country during the pandemic, Mike Nichols’s truck was, at last, sitting still.</p>
<p>Parked at the shop, it needed a routine part — a length of aluminum tubing — just as the trucking industry was gripped by a parts shortage.</p>
<p>“Even the supply chain is affected by the supply chain,” said Nichols, 54, as he waited at his home in central Wisconsin. “It’s a week without revenue, so that hurts. But you need breaks, too, now and then.”</p>
<p>When truck traffic dipped in 2020, he had kept rolling, crisscrossing the country with 25-ton loads of grain. Corn from Iowa. Rice from Arkansas. Malted barley from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Yet now, trucks are crowding the interstates, heavy with the goods fueling a pandemic consumer binge.</p>
<p>Nichols has logged about 2.5 million miles without an accident since he began driving in the 1980s. More than ever, though, he feels the stress of crowded roads ­— a big rig to the left of him, to the right, behind him.</p>
<div><div><p>Nichols carries grain on his long hauls through the Midwest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nichols checks the map during a stop in Iowa.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An attendant walks to Nichols's truck while he waits to have his tank washed in Cedar Rapids.</p></div></div>
<p>On the biggest lot, he soon got stuck in a futile cul-de-sac of trucks. He had to back out. “They were in there like cordwood,” he said.</p>
<p>The second lot was smaller and also crowded with more vehicles than spaces. With his ELD ticking toward a break violation, he didn’t bother to check the third lot.</p>
<p>“You work all day, putting in 14 hours, and then you have to worry about where you are going to park your bed,” he said. “It’s almost like being homeless.”</p>
<p>His rig, recently purchased for $195,000, is set up with a microwave, fridge and bed. Its mud flaps read “Don’t tread on me.” His late wife’s name is painted across the back.</p>

<h6>With everything in flux, family comes first</h6>
<p>Dodging tumbleweeds, Christine Hilborn’s granddaughter slid between the rungs of an iron gate, tiptoed around piles of poop and stopped under a chestnut-colored horse’s dusty belly.</p>
<p>“He sees me!” the 4-year-old shouted.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s a huge adjustment,” Hilborn says of her decision to leave her job to care for her granddaughters. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hilborn, with Lavina, prepares to take Voodoo for a walk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly two years of juggling work and helping to care for her granddaughters pushed Hilborn into a tough job decision. </p></div></div>
<p>As 2021 comes to a close, she doesn’t plan to go back to the office. She’s starting a consulting business for group-home providers who care for foster children.</p>
<p>“I wanted to do it,” she said. “But at times it’s all so overwhelming.”</p>

<div><p>Rising prices, product shortages and labor market tumult are making for a surprisingly rocky economic recovery, testing the political skills of the Biden White House little more than one year before the midterm congressional elections.</p></div>
<div><div><p>More than 18 months into the pandemic, thorny economic challenges that directly touch voters represent political peril for a president with sagging public approval ratings.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As supply chain troubles mount, Biden to tout longer hours for L.A. port</p></div>
<a>quit their jobs at a record pace</a>, according to the Labor Department.
<div><div><p>The news offered further evidence that the pandemic has triggered economic aftershocks that policymakers are struggling to understand, let alone quell.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s not an off-the-shelf playbook for this kind of situation. I think they’re figuring it out as they go,” said Jason Furman, who was President Barack Obama’s top White House economist.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America’s broken supply chain</p></div>
<div><p>But interrelated price, supply and labor problems that were once expected to fade by Labor Day now appear likely to last well into next year, further complicating the Democrats’ already rocky path to the midterm elections.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans sense a political opportunity.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>, which depressed services spending and discouraged some people from returning to the workplace.
<div><div><p>Rouse played down the significance of a single month’s hiring. But she warned that even the recent three-month average of 550,000 jobs was likely to decline because it was distorted by unusually strong results in July.</p></div></div>
<div><p>America’s unemployed are sending a message: They’ll go back to work when they feel safe – and well-compensated</p></div>
<div><div><p>Still, the 4.8 percent unemployment rate is the lowest of the pandemic. And the record number of Americans quitting their jobs last month is a sign of ample opportunities for those who are able to work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The U.S. economy faces some high-class problems,” said Furman, now an economics professor at Harvard University. “Quits are not a concern at all. That’s a choice people are making.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The record number of people quitting their jobs, combined with survey data, suggests wages will increase at an annual rate of 4 percent to 4.5 percent, said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics.</p></div></div>
<p>But the tighter labor market — a significant problem for small businesses — threatens to keep inflation above the Fed’s long-run 2 percent target and become “a lasting drag on economic activity,” according to Pearce.</p>
<p>“The longer shortages continue to worsen and growth of the labor force remains sluggish, the more likely it is that the decline reflects more structural factors, such as an increased pace of retirements,” he wrote in a client note.</p>
<div><p>As meat prices continue to rise, Biden administration takes aim at Big Chicken</p></div>
<div><p>Still, economic data from September underscored how vulnerable the economic recovery remains to the pandemic — and how policymakers <a>underestimated</a> the threat posed by the delta variant when the surge began a few months ago.</p></div>
<a>speech</a>, Fed governor Lael Brainard cited builders who can’t get enough construction materials and North American auto production, which was paused by shutdowns in Malaysia and Vietnam.
<a>soaring home prices</a> have become a litmus test for whether price increases will stick even once the pandemic is over.

<b> </b>fresh stock market highs and a red-hot labor market, as voters increasingly focus instead on rising prices and product shortages in assessing President Biden’s performance.
<div><div><p>But public cheer over those gains is eclipsed by concern over an unusual economic rebound that is confounding hopes of a smooth return to full employment.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>medical crisis, many Americans are in no mood to wait. With elections to decide control of Congress one year away, the president and his team have little room for error.
<div><p>Inside America's broken supply chain</p></div>
<div><div><p>Biden officials are struggling to explain an economic recovery like no other.</p></div></div>
<p>When the country was emerging from previous recessions, the main economic problem typically involved getting people to buy. Now the problem is getting them to produce. Instead of a lack of demand, the economy suffers from inadequate supply.</p>
<div><div><p>Plus, most economists say the economy already has begun accelerating from its third-quarter lull, with Bank of America forecasters expecting annualized growth of 6 percent in the final three months of the year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a recent <a>CNBC survey</a>, 79 percent of those polled described the economy as “fair” or “poor,” even though jobs are plentiful and <a>coronavirus</a> case numbers are in decline.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even as Congress creeps closer to passing Biden’s centerpiece social spending and infrastructure bills, officials say individual provisions can be difficult to explain and may take years to bear fruit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In contrast, Americans already are feeling the effects of a clogged supply chain and inflation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Biden from the campaign on has positioned himself as a transformational president, like FDR,” she said. “You want to be transformational? You have to sell the policy.”</p></div></div>
<div><p><a>Snarled supply chains</a> are at the root of the administration’s political predicament. Soaring freight costs, delivery delays and product shortages are contributing to 5.4 percent inflation and eating into economic growth.</p></div>
<a>manufacturing disruptions</a> caused by the pandemic, cost it $6 billion in sales of iPads, iPhones and Mac computers and will cost it even more over the remainder of this year, CEO Tim Cook told investors.
<p>Across the administration, officials have convened a dizzying array of meetings to address the supply chain snags, but there is little the federal government can do to quickly alleviate the problems, the people familiar with the conversations said.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s all people talk about,” one senior administration official said.</p></div></div>
<p>But for millions of consumers, everyday metrics like the cost of food and shelter outweigh assurances that price pressures won’t last — especially with a gallon of gas at a seven-year high of $3.40, one dollar more than in January.</p>
<div><div><p>Supply concerns — congested ports, insufficient numbers of truck drivers, overwhelmed rail yards and warehouses — are drawing unusual attention at the highest levels of government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet that search proved unsuccessful, and 74 container ships remain stuck at anchor in San Pedro Bay, a flotilla that would have been unimaginable before the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are in crisis,” Mario Cordero, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, told reporters Wednesday. “There shouldn’t be any vessels at anchor.”</p></div></div>
<a>White House officials touted</a> what they said was a move by the Port of Los Angeles to begin operating “24/7” to clear overloaded docks.
<div><div><p>“They’ll operate around-the-clock,” said one senior administration official on an Oct. 12 press call, who could not be named under White House ground rules for the briefing.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>New White House supply chain ‘action plan’ aims to ease tremendous backlog</h1></div>
<h2>Modest steps reflect near-term challenge as White House attempts to speed up the flow of goods.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 9, 2021 at 4:19 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House announced a new “action plan” Tuesday aimed at expanding the capacity of U.S. ports and inland waterways, as persistent supply chain congestion slows goods deliveries and fuels rising prices.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America's Broken Supply Chain</p></div>
<div><div><p>In Savannah, more than 30,000 containers full of imported products for Americans are sitting on the docks, more than 50 percent above the port’s operational goal, according to the Georgia Ports Authority website.</p></div></div>
<a>were 8.6 percent higher than one year ago</a>, the sharpest increase in the 11 years that such records have been kept, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<div><div><p>Snarled supply lines accounted for 60 percent of the increase, according to economist Mahir Rasheed of Oxford Economics.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The persistent mismatch between supply and demand will remain a principal driver of elevated inflation as capital and labor shortages improve only gradually heading into 2022,” he wrote in a client note.</p></div></div>
<p>The Federal Reserve continues to expect inflation to ease next year, as does the Biden administration. But higher prices, for goods such as gasoline, food and rent, are taking a toll on the <a>president’s public approval</a> ratings.</p>
<div><div><p>“This is a much bigger problem than people had thought, and the lack of good information prevents importers and exporters from making sound decisions,” Reinsch said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal regulators will call for suggestions on how to standardize data exchange requirements, calling it “an important first step” in enabling more fluid cargo movements.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The toolmaker’s strategy illustrates how corporations are responding to the pandemic with some of the most consequential supply line makeovers since the onset of globalized production roughly three decades ago.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Biden administration struggles to address supply chains as holiday season looms</p></div>
<div><div><p>Amid congested ports, trucker shortages and rail yard delays, it now takes Stanley almost 90 days to get its products from factories in China to U.S. stores — three times as long as before covid-19, Allan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We think that’s going to be a nice little bump for us, probably late ‘22, early ‘23,” Joseph Cutillo, CEO of Sterling Construction in Houston, told investors earlier this month.</p></div></div>
<a>China</a> to Mexico. The cement and building products producer already is benefiting from the construction of new warehouses near the U.S. border, executives said.
<div><div><p>Today, about 40 percent of the Stanley tools purchased by Americans are made in the United States or Mexico. Allan wants to get that figure closer to 70 percent over the next two years.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden keeps many Trump tariffs in place, confounding businesses</p></div>
<div><div><p>More goods are coming to the United States, and they are coming from more places.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even before the pandemic, years of tariffs and geopolitical tensions had prompted many companies to diversify their goods and materials sourcing by adopting a “China-plus-one” strategy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But there are no perfect defenses against supply interruptions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But widespread supply bottlenecks meant that more than twice as much of the company’s inventory was in transit at the end of September, compared with a typical year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an unrealistic goal to think there will never be any type of disruption to their supply chain,” Shute said. “What’s realistic is to be able to react quickly.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>President Biden’s claim to have eased bottlenecks at a vital U.S. port complex marks an initial win in what is likely to prove a long campaign to free Americans from tangled supply chains.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Because of the actions we’ve taken, things have begun to change,” Biden said in a speech at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to buy gifts in a supply chain crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>Yet even as Biden took credit for the turnaround, industry groups and logistics specialists warned that a return to the smooth flow of goods that was typical before the pandemic remains a long way off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As supply hiccups escalated this summer, the White House formed a task force drawing on multiple Cabinet agencies and appointed a “ports envoy” to untangle the cargo jams.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The cost of delay</p></div>
<div><div><p>Citing significant improvement, the ports have now delayed implementation of the fines until Monday. But carriers, which face potential multimillion-dollar penalties, are hounding customers to collect their goods.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They send me an email every day. They’ve put on a lot of pressure,” said Craig Grossgart, senior vice president for Seko Logistics. “It’s very consistent. Every single day without fail.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fewer boots, more slippers: How a shortage of shipping containers is changing what shows up on shelves</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s going to improve the overall fluidity,” said Val Noel, chief operations officer for Trac Intermodal, a chassis provider.</p></div></div>
<a>China</a> and can only make a dent in the growing container pile.
<div><div><p>More than 100,000 metal boxes are stranded at the twin Southern California ports, slowing normal terminal operations, according to Matt Schrap, chief executive officer of the Harbor Trucking Association.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other administration initiatives have been less successful.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last month, the White House announced that the two California ports would begin operating around-the-clock, seven days a week to clear the cargo jam. But more than a month later, that remains only an aspiration.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No terminal at either port is truly open on a 24-7 basis. One of seven container terminals in Long Beach is open 24 hours, four days a week on a trial basis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From ports to rail yards, global supply chains struggle amid virus outbreaks in the developing world</p></div>
<div><div><p>For months, the most visible sign of supply chain dysfunction has been the floating traffic jam off the Southern California coast as container ships lined up to await an unloading berth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before the pandemic, ships typically sailed directly from Asia to a spot along the docks. But in recent weeks, more than 80 ships each day could be glimpsed swinging at anchor a few miles offshore.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Effective Nov. 16, a new queuing policy took effect, which essentially shifted the seaborne traffic jam farther from the coast. Instead of parking within sight of the docks, ships will now be forced to loiter 150 miles from shore.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The maritime industry groups that developed the new procedure, including the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, said the goal was “to improve safety and air quality” by moving container ships.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As holiday shipping volumes drop, the supply chain may get a temporary respite. But fresh headaches loom in 2022, including potential labor unrest before the expiration of the dockworkers’ contract at the end of June.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There also is little sign that Americans’ demand for imported goods is cooling. On Wednesday, White House economists noted that consumer spending on goods, as a share of total consumption, remains unusually high.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unless Americans devote a larger share of their spending to services such as restaurant meals, hotel stays and concert tickets, and buy fewer goods that need to be shipped to their homes, the supply chain will struggle.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Amid huge shortage, new truck drivers train for some of supply chain’s toughest jobs</h1></div>
<h2>Trucking industry moves 70 percent of nation’s freight but struggles to retain workers</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 16, 2021|Updated December 16, 2021 at 10:31 a.m. EST</div></div>
<b> </b>the other half of the instructor team here at SAGE Truck Driving School, yells encouragement.
<div><div><p>Turning such untrained talent into drivers who can safely command a 40-ton load at highway speeds takes four to six weeks of classroom instruction, observation, and practice behind the wheel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What it really boils down to is: Tell them, tell them and keep telling them,” Hanlon said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America's Broken Supply Chain</p></div>
<div><div><p>In February, the federal government for the first time will begin requiring that all new commercial driver license (CDL) applicants be trained in a registered facility using a standard curriculum.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is going to further negatively impact an already crippled supply chain,” said Kelly Krapu, director of safety for TrueNorth Compliance Services in West Fargo, N.D.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Department of Transportation disputes that view and promises that regulators will work with industry representatives to ensure a smooth process.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The government edict comes as driving schools scramble to make up for pandemic closures. SAGE last year fell about 20 percent short of its typical output of 4,000 new drivers, said Chris Thropp, the company’s president.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We’re very busy right now at the vast majority of our schools,” said Thropp, 61, a former corporate attorney who joined SAGE nearly a quarter century ago. “We’ve definitely seen an uptick in interest.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no one reason for the driver shortage, which means there is no one solution,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If that time was cut in half, all of those drivers would be that [much] more productive and you might not need more trucks on the road,” said Todd Spencer, the association’s president.</p></div></div>
<p>The $1 trillion infrastructure legislation <a>President Biden</a> signed last month includes a pilot apprenticeship program for drivers between the ages of 18 and 21, promotes the hiring of female truckers, and authorizes a compensation study.</p>
<div><div><p>Despite the long-term plateau in wages, trucking enjoys a reputation as a good-paying blue-collar occupation. Billboards along the nearby Lehigh Valley Thruway advertise truck driving jobs for $31 per hour, plus signing bonus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Through the first half of this year, states issued a monthly average of roughly 50,000 new licenses, 14 percent higher than the pre-pandemic rate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He’s heard that one trucking company is paying drivers up to $2,200 per week. Four of his friends have already landed jobs with FedEx. Eventually, he plans to run his own freight business.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Trucking is where it’s at. That’s what everybody tells me,” Nivar said. “The ball’s in my court, the way I see it.”</p></div></div>
<a>trucking companies</a> instead accept high turnover and the headache of near-constant recruitment, said Burks, who drove a tractor-trailer for a decade before becoming an economist.
<div><div><p>Some would-be drivers insist they are unfazed. Cameron Thomas, 26, and his wife, Reina, 24, started<b> </b>their training five days after getting married. They are eager to start a life together in the cab of a tractor-trailer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We already love spending time together,” Reina said. “And it would be good for money with both of us doing it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal safety regulations limit truck drivers to 11 hours per day behind the wheel. The Thomases figure they can keep their truck moving almost constantly if one of them sleeps while the other drives.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From ports to rail yards, global supply chains struggle amid virus outbreaks in the developing world</p></div>
<div><div><p>SAGE emphasizes one-on-one training. Hanlon, who said his father taught him to drive a truck using “the yell-and-scream method,” takes a calmer approach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Riding shotgun as Mason Mott, 18, steers a tractor trailer around the campus of Lehigh Career and Technical Institute, Hanlon mixes gentle correctives with praise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mott was inconsistent in his earlier parking attempts and concedes he has a tendency to fumble the clutch on the 10-speed manual transmission. But Hanlon is reassuring.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s all right. You got to make mistakes to learn,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wearing a baseball cap and hoodie, Mott successfully pilots the truck on several laps of the college, as Hanlon alternates between mild rebukes (“both hands on the wheel unless shifting”) and encouragement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, after Mott executes a tight left turn back into the lot, Hanlon applauds. “Beautiful! Very good. Good job. Perfect,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, inside a beige single-story building nearby, Sugeidy Sanchez, 24, is receiving her new-student briefing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A small Christmas tree, decorated with tiny white lights, sits on Borowski’s desk as he delivers a safety lecture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Think of these orange [traffic] cones out there as your brother, sister or children. If you run over one, you’ve killed someone,” Borowski said. “Try not to kill the cones.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sanchez nods. Eight members of her family are truck drivers, so she understands what the job entails. An uncle, who quit long-haul driving after just six months, tried to talk her out of it, saying the grind would exhaust her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Sanchez, the mother of a daughter, 6, and a five-month old son, wants to make as much money as she can, as quickly as she can. Then, she will buy her own truck and stay closer to home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m looking for something to bring more money into my family,” she said. “I feel this is it.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a ‘Made in the USA’ supply chain crisis</h1><h2>Shipping lines flock to Asia-to-U.S. trade lanes at expense of many developing nations.</h2></div>

<div><div><p>As the world’s largest cargo ships rush to the United States with all the clothes, furniture, toys and electronics that American consumers might want, Aditya Awtani is feeling neglected.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>he needs to make clothes in his high-ceilinged factory in Mombasa, Kenya.
<div><div><p>The shipping headaches, along with freight costs that have nearly quadrupled, are carving a hole in his profits, straining his relations with customers and threatening his 5,800 employees’ jobs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There are days when I walk into the factory and I see workers with their arms folded because the containers have not come, which is a very depressing sight to see,” Awtani said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America's Broken Supply Chain</p></div>
<div><p>As supply chains strain, some corporations rewrite production playbook</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Africa, sadly, I can’t think of any other continent that is last on the rung. Africa will be the last to come out of this,” Awtani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The resulting port congestion means it takes longer for each cargo ship, some carrying nearly 18,000 shipping containers, to make the round trip between China and the United States’ West Coast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at a time when more ships are needed, Africa is seeing fewer, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which tracks worldwide port calls by all types of vessels.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How crazed is the used car market? This auction sparked a frenzy over two-year-old minivan</p></div>
<div><div><p>African nations, including Kenya, Guinea, Angola and Namibia, also lost direct connections to some foreign countries, leaving their shippers reliant upon more expensive services that connect through a third port.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The rich countries are the least impacted,” said Frank Appel, CEO of Deutsche Post DHL Group. “We see delays in getting some products. It’s not that we don’t get the products.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>David Malpass, president of the World Bank, this fall said per-person income was growing 10 times as fast in the advanced economies as in the developing world, where the economic outlook is “grim.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Redeployment of tonnage never led to shortages,” Jan Tiedemann, senior shipping line and port analyst for Alphaliner, said. “The difference this time around is the market is sold out. There’s no more ships.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The number of container ships calling at African ports fell 2 percent during the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2019, according to UNCTAD.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But that figure masks differences among regions and vessel sizes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Including the smaller ships that are more common in many parts of Africa, Mombasa is still receiving as many vessels as it was two years ago, according to the Kenya Ports Authority, a state corporation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet ultimately, the number of vessels calling at a port is not as important economically as the amount of cargo moving through it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the third quarter, the port handled 7 percent fewer containers than it did during the same period in 2019, KPA said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>If shipping were more reliable, Awtani said, he would increase his weekly container order by 25 percent.
<div><div><p>Vessels that originate in Shanghai, able to hold almost 30,000 TEUs, are already full when they reach Colombo. So they skip the port, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They view the priority as USA for cargo,” added Dayananda, whose factories supply U.S. brands including Victoria’s Secret.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For competitive reasons, most carriers provide little public detail about specific deployment decisions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Carriers have redeployed ships according to where rates are the highest,” said Tiedemann. “It’s a big game of musical chairs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two-thirds of the roughly 70 vessels stuck outside the top U.S. import gateway in Southern California belong to those smaller carriers, according to Gene Seroka, executive director of the port of Los Angeles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many of the new players sail from China without a reservation at a L.A. terminal and thus go to the end of the floating queue. Some are ships that freight forwarders charter for big retailers such as Walmart or Home Depot.</p></div></div>
<p>Like many African economies, Kenya imports several times as many containers as it exports. Traditionally, that meant there were plenty of empties available for the country’s exporters to ship coffee, tea and apparel to foreign customers.</p>
<div><div><p>The supply chain disruptions are also making themselves felt on Nairobi’s Biashara Street, where shopkeepers decry high freight costs, shipping delays and the resultant price increases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kenya’s inflation rate has topped<b> </b>6 percent for the past five months, the longest it’s been above that mark in four years, according to the Central Bank of Kenya.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shah checks almost every day to see if he can afford to replenish his supplies.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>Economy</div></div><h1>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, overheating and confounding economy of 2021</h1><h2>Americans experienced highs and lows that were unique to the incredible disruption of pandemic life.</h2></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 21, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>The U.S. economy this year was strong and scary and not at all normal.</p>
<p>Theirs are tales of perseverance and adaptation, resilience and triumph.</p>
<p>“We don’t look at this as a classic recovery,” said Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist for SP Global Ratings. “We’re learning this as we go.”</p>
<p>But no one knows how the pandemic will affect next year. Few people even know how it will affect next week.</p>
<h6>Demand far beyond supply</h6>
<p>“You see that 2018 Nissan Altima sitting out there?” asked Joe Zeidan, who owns Z Auto Place, a used-car business in west Houston.</p>
<div><div><p>“For sure, 2020 was a disaster year for us, both financially and personally,” Zeidan says. “I lost a lot of money last year.” </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Toy cars line a shelf at Z Auto Place. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the year ends, Zeidan says the number of customers outstrips the availability of cars. </p></div></div>
<p>This year, customers are back, and prices are up. Way up. Zeidan estimates his business is booming 50 percent over 2020.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m not so unhappy that I had so many cars I couldn’t sell last year. Now, I’m selling them at a higher price than I could have gotten last year.”</p>
<p>How long does Zeidan expect the car-buying frenzy to continue?</p>
<p>“I give it another six or seven months. But you never know,” he said. “Nobody knows anything about which way the world is turning.”</p>

<h6>Dancing again — and hearing the applause</h6>
<p>Two hours and many leaps later, she couldn’t hold back: “I cried tears of joy.”</p>
<p>“You’d do one take and then say, ‘I have to do it again,’ ” Cirio said.</p>
<div><div><p>Cirio prepares for a piece she is choreographing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cirio is leading a new work for the Boston Ballet's ChoreograpHER Project.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A partner holds Cirio aloft during a rehearsal.</p></div></div>
<p>The dancers finally resumed full rehearsals this fall. After practicing for so long in small pods and via Zoom, she relishes being together. “I care about my colleagues even more because of that separation.”</p>
<p>She is thrilled that the audiences have returned in force. And as she pirouettes in a fantasyland of gently falling snowflakes, they watch her in spellbound silence.</p>
<p>“Being onstage again has been a really powerful feeling,” Cirio said.</p>

<h6>From paycheck to paycheck to pay dirt</h6>
<p>Kailey Kernick knew she was in trouble when yet another luxury-label boutique moved into Miami’s most chichi shopping area this month.</p>
<p>“They just opened a Chanel store a week ago,” she said. “And so that’s going to be dangerous for me.”</p>
<p>“Dior is my favorite thing. And I love Chanel. I have an insane shopping addiction,” Kernick said.</p>
<p>It’s an addiction she can afford, thanks to the supercharged cryptocurrency trading that has transformed and empowered her world.</p>
<p>Two years ago, she was in her hometown near Calgary, working as a waitress and “living paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “I barely had any savings.”</p>
<div><div><p>A woman toting bags from Loro Piana pauses outside a store in Miami's Design District.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People shop in the area's high-end boutiques. Kernick says she and her friends are all enjoying luxe lifestyles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Expensive fashion is on display in window after window.</p></div></div>
<p>Though she realizes the pandemic is still upending many lives, she expects to be ready to weather any future financial setbacks.</p>
<p>For now, she’s trying to persuade her parents in Canada to come visit. “They’re frugal people. They don’t really quite understand what I’m doing with crypto,” she said.</p>
<p>Kernick isn’t apologizing for the extravagance of her splurges — like the $4,000 pair of earrings from Cartier she recently bought.</p>
<p>“I think life manifests itself in the way you live it. I live the life I want to live, and I’m just going to keep inviting more luxury and abundance,” Kernick said. “You attract what you give out to the world.”</p>

<h6>A surge of interest as the nation reckoned</h6>
<p>She’s tired, though there’s no question of walking away. Marcus Books, named for Black activist Marcus Garvey, remains her mission.</p>
<p>“It’s essential that any culture, any community has its own source of knowledge,” Richardson said. “For the Black community, this is it.”</p>
<p>The past two years have of course been challenging. When the pandemic forced shutdowns in California, the bookstore’s supporters responded with fundraising efforts and waves of phone orders to help keep it afloat.</p>
<div><div><p>Marcus Books is the oldest Black-owned bookstore in the United States. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Richardson and a friend discuss whether to move a display for “A Promised Land,” by former president Barack Obama.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Books are rearranged in the store's front window.</p></div></div>
<p>“We find that people will now turn to us to order things they could very well get at another bookstore,” she said. Many tell her, “I didn’t want to shop at Amazon.”</p>
