<div><h1>Future of Work: Computer vision and machine learning may soon bolster restaurant jobs</h1></div>
<h2>Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol expects the restaurant industry to adopt more emerging technologies to deal with supply chain issues, worker turnover</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Danielle Abril</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Your next job interview could be scheduled over text message. And the next time you place a food order, a high-tech twist may have been added to your guacamole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These are some of the upcoming changes that Chipotle Mexican Grill, a fast-casual restaurant that specializes in burritos, tacos, quesadillas and bowls, is testing at its stores, says Brian Niccol, chairman and CEO of Chipotle.</p></div></div>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<div><div><p>But the future model for the restaurant industry won’t be just about machines and technology with no human interaction, Niccol says, but will require a sensitive balance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fast-food customers are back, but workers are not. It’s triggering major change.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Niccol shared his vision on the future of work and the role technology will play as the restaurant industry evolves. The following interview has been edited.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Learning from the pandemic</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What’s the biggest change Chipotle is making to its business this year?</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>Future of Work: Requiring workers to return to the office is a ‘doomed approach’</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What have you learned since raising workers’ wages — has it helped with employee retention? Is there still more work to be done there?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A:</b> We need more people, and the only way that works is if we’re investing correctly — that’s starting wages, career development and benefits. I don’t think this is a one-and-done situation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why restaurant workers are demanding better wages and working conditions</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Investing in more restaurant tech</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What role will technology play in Chipotle’s business moving ahead — and has that changed since the pandemic?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A:</b> It accelerated some of the technology we’ve been working on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>How can technology help retain or recruit workers in the restaurant industry, which has lost so many workers during the pandemic?</i></p></div></div>
<b>A:</b> We’re getting ready to pilot a process in which job recruitment gets done via text.
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>Are there any tech protocols in place to help restaurant workers feel safer as they go about their jobs?</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>How one restaurant’s experiment may help diners breathe safely</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>Workers have complained about Chipotle’s online orders that keep coming in despite the overwhelmed staff. Have you made any tweaks to your technology since then?</i></p></div></div>
<p>Frankly, we just had to do it because we don’t want to overwhelm our employees. It does us no good to burn them out. They get dissatisfied, and then you just create this cycle of being understaffed and providing bad experiences to customers.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What technology do you think will disrupt your industry in the future?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>Could there come a day when customers go to Chipotle and never interact with a human but rather solely machines or robots?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The future of restaurants</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What is the answer to luring more workers to your industry, given the health concerns and burnout?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>How is Chipotle handling the current supply chain pressures, and will it pass rising costs to customers?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>Has the current environment impacted your expansion/real estate plans in any way?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>What does the future of a Chipotle restaurant worker look like?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b><i>How do you expect the future of the industry — and Chipotle — to evolve?</i></p></div></div>

<a>metaverse</a>,” autonomous vehicles and greater repairability will take time to catch up to their hype, and companies must be careful not to overpromise, Milanesi said.
<a>we don’t trust companies</a> enough to share a whole lot of it, that technology gets stuck in the “my voice assistant still doesn’t understand me” phase.
<div><div><p>Here’s what we expect — and in some cases, hope — to see in 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A race into the ‘metaverse’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook parent company Meta may have generated the most buzz with its foray into the metaverse — a theoretical shared space where people can hang out in virtual reality — but the other tech giants won’t be far behind.</p></div>
<div><p>In 2021, tech talked up ‘the metaverse.’ One problem: It doesn’t exist.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The smart home will make a lot more sense</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Matter</a>. The aim: to ensure that the home gadgets you buy in the future all play nice with one another, regardless of who made them or what virtual assistant you want to use when interacting with them.
<div><div><h3><div>Electric vehicles are inching toward the mainstream</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 2022 tech trends are all about what’s <i>not</i> new. This year, electric vehicles will transition from cutting edge to standard issue — if you live somewhere with the infrastructure to support EV charging.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Tech companies want you to trust them more</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>People now trust companies more than traditional institutions like government and religious organizations, according to Forrester analyst Enza Iannopollo, but companies still tend to overestimate how much customers trust them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And customers have good reason to be skeptical. In 2021, <a>security breaches</a>, <a>data privacy problems</a> and <a>AI whistleblowers</a> dominated technology news.</p></div></div>
<a>people who identify bias in AI systems</a> and adopting technologies that partially anonymize personal data, Forrester research predicts.

<div><div><p>But fellow Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and backers say she represented only the worst of start-up culture.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes found guilty in landmark Silicon Valley fraud case</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This is someone who picked up these surface attributes and ignored a lot of what Jobs did right,” Cantrill said. “You gotta dig a little bit beyond the black turtleneck and secrecy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That goes for the way Theranos protected its secrets as well.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We can get it wrong,” Chen said, “but nobody worth their salt is investing in the absence of seeing any information.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Theranos failed, but other blood-tech companies are still trying to make testing faster and easier</p></div>
<div><div><p>In reality, Theranos was struggling with cash flow and with inconsistent test results, according to the case presented by prosecutors during the trial.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Far from running hundreds of tests from two drops of blood, Theranos was relying on third-party machines and a limited menu of tests that could be accurately run on its own technology, former employees testified.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In 2015, a Wall Street Journal investigation into the company unveiled a dysfunctional workplace and technology that was not working as promised. Theranos collapsed three years later, mired in regulatory and media investigations.</p></div>
<p>“I just don’t think some of that 2012 vibe would fly as brazenly as it did back then,” Jafarzadeh said. Nowadays, “companies at least have to pay lip service” that their products and practices offer something of value.</p>
<div><p><span>Elizabeth Holmes’s trial spotlights Silicon Valley’s thin line between hype and deceit</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes could have looked at Jobs’s trajectory and come away understanding the importance of pairing herself with skilled technologists who understood how things worked, something Jobs excelled at, Cantrill said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes defended herself on the stand, saying she genuinely thought the promising vision she sold to her investors was truthful and realistic.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>This year’s unorthodox CES raises valuable questions about the future of giant in-person business events.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since then, coronavirus tests have been even harder to come by in pharmacies, and testing facilities around Las Vegas have done their best to accommodate long lines of people anxious to learn whether they have been infected.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The South Korean game market is among the reasons Pearl Abyss started looking abroad.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“The only thing I’ve heard him say is he’s planning on running again,” said former senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), a Biden friend. “And I’m glad he is.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden approval hits new low as economic discontent rises, Post-ABC News poll shows</p></div>
<p>But interviews with 28 Democratic strategists and officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more frankly, show that the assurances have not stopped the internal debate over whether Biden will appear on the ticket.</p>
<div><div><p>Florida trial lawyer John Morgan, who was a top 2020 Biden donor, said he was unsure whether Biden would seek reelection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What is his health going to be in the next three years?” he wondered aloud. “All you have to do is look at the mortality tables in America to understand what I’m saying.”</p></div></div>
<a>health checkup Friday</a> — a day before his 79th birthday Saturday — at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that found the president to be “healthy,” “vigorous” and working out five days a week. His doctor
<a>described</a> a stiffer walking gait in recent years, which he attributed to spinal arthritis, and some acid reflux that has caused him to repeatedly clear his throat.
<div><div><p>His advisers say that health is not a current concern that would prevent another campaign.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He has told people privately that he plans to run and we will be ready for that,” said one Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The party does plan to review the order of nominating states in the primary calendar, a threat to the first-in-the-nation position of the Iowa caucuses, but <a>those efforts</a> do not assume a contested Democratic fight.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden deemed ‘vigorous’ by doctor after physical</p></div>
<p>Should Biden run and face a primary challenge in 2024, Democratic officials plan to side firmly with the incumbent, potentially frustrating challengers’ access to party data and resources, according to people familiar with the plans.</p>

<div><div><p>There is little sign at the moment of much appetite for a liberal challenge to Biden if he mounts another campaign. The president has won plaudits from liberal lawmakers this year for pursuing an ambitious domestic agenda.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“President Biden will enjoy strong support from many progressives when he runs for reelection. He will certainly have mine,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who co-chaired the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2020.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If he’s not running, I think absolutely there’ll be progressives — at least one,” he added, without predicting who might run in an open race.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Barry Goodman, a Democratic donor who served on Biden’s national finance committee for his 2020 presidential campaign, said many donors are “praying that Trump runs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think no matter who runs, a Democrat beats him,” he said of Trump. “At the end of the day, people are not going to put that despot in office one more time.”</p></div></div>

<p>Snell will have the sole right to make major decisions on behalf of the children, Arner said. Parnell will have partial physical custody of the children on three weekends each month. Parnell and Snell separated in 2018, according to court documents.</p>

<div><div><p>At a virtual fundraiser late last month, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) shared a blunt assessment about the Democratic Party.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Democrats are terrible at messaging,” she said, according to notes taken by one attendee. “It’s just a fact.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Josh Dawsey</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Michael Scherer</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jeremy Barr</div></span></div></span></div><div>November 29, 2021 at 10:24 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“Please let me help with the prep,” Cuomo wrote at one point to DeRosa, as the claims against the governor surfaced earlier this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On another occasion, the younger Cuomo texted DeRosa that he needed “all the best facts” for “reporters. Who can do it?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“On it,” Cuomo responded to the second request. About 40 minutes later, he wrote back, “No one has heard that yet.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The messages deepen questions about whether Chris Cuomo, one of CNN’s star anchors, crossed lines in his advocacy for his brother and misused his position as a prominent cable television anchor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I didn’t have a role on the team. I’m not on his team,” the CNN anchor said, according to transcripts released by James’s office. “I’m his brother and I’m a Cuomo.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The CNN anchor has also acknowledged at the time that he had assisted the governor’s office with advice about how to handle the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chris Cuomo has defended his behind-the-scenes work for his brother, saying he is about “family first, job second.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People at CNN, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics, said Cuomo is close with the chief of the cable network, Jeff Zucker, and has one of the network’s highest-rated shows.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How Cuomo’s flexing of political power became his undoing</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Andrew M. Cuomo, accused James of “abusing her government power” through what he called “manipulated release of hand picked witness testimony.”</p></div></div>
<p>The material shows a frantic effort by Cuomo’s team to fight back against his accusers, and a toxic work environment in which staffers frequently screamed and cursed at one another and some expressed deep frustrations with the governor.</p>
<div><div><p>“Going hard has gotten you guys to where you are now. Which is a bad place,” Smith responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In her interview with the attorney general’s team, DeRosa describes an interaction that she said she had with James at an event earlier this year, before the attorney general launched an investigation into the women.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DeRosa wrote that James approached her and told her that people were questioning the credibility of Lindsey Boylan, the governor’s <a>first accuser</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Melissa, you have to calm down. Everything is going to be fine,” DeRosa said James told her. Of Boylan, she said James said: “Nobody views her as credible.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The newly released messages show that Chris Cuomo was deeply immersed in an effort to track down information about his brother’s accusers.</p></div></div>
<p>“I have a lead on the wedding girl,” he writes to DeRosa on March 4, an apparent reference to Anna Ruch, who accused the governor of touching her improperly at a wedding in a story <a>published </a>by the New York Times on March 1.</p>
<div><div><p>At another point, the CNN anchor took credit when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie used particular words in a statement about the accusations. “Heastie used our language at least,” Chris Cuomo wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chris Cuomo also railed against the governor’s top aide for not looping him and other outside advisers into more aspects of the response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You need to trust me Lis and Jeff more,” he writes in one message to DeRosa. “Not these other people. We are making mistakes we can’t afford.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Here’s what he should have said,” Cuomo wrote. Then he provided commentary in the form of annotations to what he said was “Andrew M. Cuomo’s poor statement” about Bennett.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No resign no resign no resign,” Cuomo writes in one message to DeRosa.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DeRosa repeatedly asked the CNN anchor to find out information about a story that the New Yorker’s Farrow was working on about Boylan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rumor about Ronan getting ready to move,” DeRosa wrote to Chris Cuomo on March 9. “Can you check your sources.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cuomo texted back five days later to say that “if ronan has nothing better than Boylan thats a great sign.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DeRosa appears to respond by texting him a conference call number “to discuss rownan convo.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On March 15, DeRosa followed up again to ask, “Did u get any more intel?” Cuomo responded, “Story not ready for tomorrow.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Farrow story was <a>published </a>on March 18. The New Yorker journalist did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At another point, Chris Cuomo emailed information about Bennett, one of his brother’s accusers, to another Cuomo adviser.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cuomo acknowledged the requests from DeRosa when he was interviewed by investigators, according to transcripts released by James’s office.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I remember Melissa asking me at some point that either they wanted to know if I knew or could find out if more were coming or that she had heard that one or maybe two more were coming and could I find out,” he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He denied to investigators, however, that he conducted “oppo research” on accusers and said he “would never do oppo research on anybody alleging anything like this.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cuomo told investigators that he contacted “another journalist” to find out when the Farrow story in the New Yorker was coming out. He said he did not tell CNN about the effort.</p></div></div>

<i>Roe v. Wade </i>decision, which gave women nationwide a right to most abortions.
<div><div><p>Decades of political organizing by abortion opponents have transformed the Republican Party into a force for remaking courts, and a separate revolution in law schools has created the intellectual foundation to make it possible.</p></div></div>
