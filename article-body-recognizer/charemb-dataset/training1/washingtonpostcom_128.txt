<a><h2>Antonio Brown released by Buccaneers, who say he refused to reenter Sunday’s game</h2></a>
<p>Coach Bruce Arians said Antonio Brown was upset about how many passes were being thrown his way and refused to go back into Sunday’s game against the Jets, a starkly different version of the incident from what Brown recounted Wednesday.</p>
<a><h2>Antonio Brown says he had serious ankle injury against Jets: ‘I didn’t quit. I was cut.’</h2></a>
<p>Wide receiver Antonio Brown issued a lengthy statement through his attorney three days after Sunday's incident during the Buccaneers-Jets game at MetLife Stadium.</p>

<a><h2>Steelers give Ben Roethlisberger a nice parting gift with win over Browns</h2></a>
<p>The Steelers had nine sacks, including four by T.J. Watt, and beat the Browns, 26-14, in what Ben Roethlisberger acknowledged was likely his final home game.</p>

<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic used two exclamation points and an emoji of a flexed biceps Tuesday in announcing that he had been granted an exemption from coronavirus vaccination, enabling him to defend his Australian Open title.</p></div></div>
<a>Federer previously announced he won’t play</a>, but Nadal will, having already arrived in Australia to begin preparations. The tournament begins Jan. 17.
<div><div><p>Djokovic isn’t the only player to have been granted a medical exemption. Tournament officials acknowledged that “a handful” of others had but declined to say how many.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While Djokovic supporters cheered the news, the pushback was swift and strong from other quarters in the sport.</p></div></div>
<p>British doubles specialist Jamie Murray, asked his opinion of the decision <a>during a news conference at the ATP Cup in Sydney</a>, said, “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated, I wouldn’t be getting an exemption.”</p>
<a>One Twitter user asked</a> whether he could “swing an exemption for all the unvaccinated teachers, police officers, nurses…” Earlier this week,
<a>Victoria reported</a> 8,577 new coronavirus cases, passing the previous peak of 7,442 on Jan. 1.
<p>Oliver Brown, chief sportswriter for Britain’s Telegraph, argued that the decision showed Australia’s hard-line covid-19 protocols didn’t apply to the rich and famous and predicted widespread resentment toward Djokovic as a result.</p>
<a>tweeted</a>: “After everything Victorians have been through, Novak Djokovic getting a vaccine exemption is nothing short of a kick in the guts. All those lockdowns, all that suffering. Seriously?”
<div><div><p>Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said the criteria for evaluating applications for medical exemptions were “fair and independent.” Personal information was redacted from the application process.</p></div></div>

<a>confirmed</a> Saturday. The mandate invites continued questions about the status of defending champion Novak Djokovic as he pursues the men’s Grand Slam singles title record.
<div><div><p>Djokovic has expressed uncertainty about whether he would play in the Australian Open because of coronavirus restrictions, after Daniel Andrews, the premier of the state of Victoria, warned players in October to get vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<a>saying</a>, it “doesn’t really matter whether it’s vaccination or anything else in life. You should have the freedom to choose, to decide what you want to do.”
<a>who will miss next year’s tournament</a>. Djokovic missed the chance to claim the record, and complete the calendar-year Grand Slam, when he
<a>dropped September’s U.S. Open final</a> to Daniil Medvedev in straight sets.
<div><div><p>The 2021 Australian Open was pushed back three weeks, and with vaccines not yet widely available, <a>players were required to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks</a> upon arriving in the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 2022 competition is scheduled to begin on Jan. 17. It is the first Grand Slam tennis tournament to require that players be fully vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tiley said he hopes to see the defending champion back in Melbourne in January.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s had great success here in Melbourne and he’s always said the Australian Open is the event that puts the wind in his sails,” Tiley said of Djokovic. “So I hope we get to see Novak.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Border authorities then canceled his visa.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<div><div><p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison was equally resolute, citing the imperative of enforcing the country’s strict coronavirus protocols without favor.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>His announcement Tuesday that he had received an exemption to play made no mention of whether his opinion on the protocols had changed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tiley placed the onus on Djokovic to reveal the reason for his exemption.</p></div></div>
<a>Tiley said</a>, adding, “We’ve been through a very tough period over the past two years, and we would appreciate some answers to that.”
<div><div><p>Criticism of the exemption, with whispers of special treatment for the top player in Australia’s highest-profile international sports event, was swift, with skepticism giving way to indignant outrage.</p></div></div>

<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>

<a>Roger Federer</a>, and it’s time for that to change. Exactly how great does a player have to be before he wins full appreciation?
<a>7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (10-12), 6-4, 6-3 victory</a>. He roared and threw open his arms in a strong man gesture, to a courteous ovation, no more.
<p>“In the end when I finished the last point, I took out everything that was in me,” he said. “I still obviously don’t realize, you know, what kind of achievement it is.”</p>
<p>“You know, he’s not going to lose; I’m going to have to win if I want to lift that trophy,” Djokovic said.</p>
<p>What Djokovic did next was worthy of close examination — and admiration. How many players might have lapsed into an angry sulk, faced with two such opponents, Federer and the crowd? Instead Djokovic went into a place of determined calm. </p>
<p>“The quiet mind, the serene mind, wins the match,” he said. It was a remark typical of him, thoughtful and penetrating, further evidence that here is a man who deserves closer attention.</p>
<p>“It might look routine,” Federer said, “but I don’t believe that was the case.”</p>

<header><div><div><h1>Novak Djokovic equals his Grand Slam rivals with triumphant Wimbledon victory</h1></div></div></header>
<div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div>By Liz Clarke</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Cindy Boren</div></span></div></span></div><div>July 11, 2021 at 5:24 p.m. EDT</div></div></div></div>
<div><p>WIMBLEDON, England — Novak Djokovic took his place in tennis history alongside the rivals he has been chasing most of his career, overcoming a nervous start against a stylish Italian opponent in Sunday’s Wimbledon final.</p></div>
<div><div><p>With his 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Matteo Berrettini, Djokovic, 34, claimed his sixth Wimbledon championship and a 20th Grand Slam title to equal the men’s record shared by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic’s victory keeps intact his goal of standing alone atop men’s tennis history at season’s end, which he would achieve by winning his fourth U.S. Open in September.</p></div></div>
<p>“My plan was always to go to [the] Olympic Games,” said Djokovic, who would anchor the Serbian team. “But right now I’m a little bit divided. It’s kind of 50-50 because of what I heard in the last couple days.”</p>
<div><div><p>Steffi Graf is the only player to have won a Golden Slam, in 1988.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Djokovic fell flat on his back upon sealing the victory Sunday on Berrettini’s final backhand error, 3 hours 24 minutes after the first ball was struck, as a capacity crowd of nearly 15,000 at Centre Court stood and applauded.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Hearty cheers also rained down for Berrettini, 25, the first Italian to reach Wimbledon’s final.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Australia’s Ashleigh Barty tops Karolina Pliskova to earn Wimbledon title she has long coveted</p></div>
<div><div><p>Among tennis fans and pros alike, the debate over who is the greatest men’s tennis player was renewed.</p></div></div>
<p>Berrettini called him “the best player in the world”— not simply because he’s No. 1 in the rankings but because he backs it up week after week. “He’s really the toughest player to beat,” Berrettini said.</p>
<div><div><p>“I consider myself best, and I believe that I am the best,” Djokovic said in his post-match news conference. “Otherwise I wouldn’t be talking confidently about winning Slams and making history.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for the greatest in history, the Serb said he would leave it to others, noting the difficulty of comparing players across different eras, given the evolution in racket technology.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sunday’s Wimbledon championship was Djokovic’s 30th Grand Slam final — and Berrettini’s first. The difference in experience showed as the contest wore on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The match got underway shortly after 2 p.m. at the All England Club, with the Centre Court roof open and the Serbian and Italian ambassadors among the guests in the Royal Box.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic showed rare unsteadiness at the start, double-faulting three times in his first two service games, but soon righted himself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Berrettini’s unease was more glaring. His timing was off, and his normally reliable forehand blasts missed by feet rather than inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s what the Wimbledon final does to you! You lose your mind!” three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker blurted out on the BBC broadcast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After a hard-fought hold at 2-5, the Italian regained his faculties, broke Djokovic for the first time and claimed the opening-set tiebreaker.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At 6-foot-5, Berrettini boasts one of the game’s best serves and led all players in aces (101) through the tournament’s first six rounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Uncommonly fit and flexible, Djokovic is arguably the game’s best returner. He also has a keen sense of critical moments and the ability to rise to meet them, pouncing with a predatory drive he has likened to a wolf.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Whether riled by the crowd’s fervent cheers for Berrettini or rallied by self-belief, Djokovic bared his teeth to start the second set and reeled off the first four games.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From then on, he knew he was in charge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He has a lot of firepower, serve and forehand,” Djokovic noted. So the challenge was straightforward: get the Italian’s big serves in play, then dominate rallies from the baseline.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Through his six previous matches, Berrettini had been broken five times. On Sunday, Djokovic broke him six times.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other part of being a clutch performer, he said, is learning from each defeat and each experience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“As Michael Jordan used to say: ‘I failed, I failed, I failed. And that’s why I succeeded in the end,’” Djokovic said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But Berrettini is here for a reason and he was not giving up without a fight as the set progressed and Djokovic served it out and took a two sets-to-one lead in the match.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Berrettini, 25, is not to be taken lightly, though. He advanced to the U.S. Open semifinals in 2019, losing in straight sets to Rafael Nadal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Obviously the job is not done yet,” Berrettini said Friday after his semifinal win. “I want to get the trophy now that I’m here. But it’s just [a] really unbelievable feeling.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This has been an up and down season for him as he battled a recurring abdominal injury that left him unable to serve for a while. “I kind of saw those ghosts again of my body kind of struggling,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Again, I came back stronger. I think I fully deserve to be here. I want to enjoy [it] like I did today. It’s going to be a great atmosphere. My first final in Wimbledon, it’s just crazy to think about it.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Tournament officials announced Nadal’s participation Thursday morning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It marks the first time this century that one of the sport’s Big Three, who have set the standard for excellence in men’s tennis the past 15 years, has entered Washington’s hard-court classic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Nadal, 35, next month’s Citi Open will mark his return to competition after he took time off following his grueling French Open semifinal against Djokovic on June 11.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Even though he was getting steamrolled at the outset of Friday’s French Open semifinal against Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic wasn’t shaken.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nadal, 35, was gracious in defeat, acknowledging afterward that Djokovic deserved the victory and thanking the crowd for its support throughout.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s super emotional for me to feel the love of the people in the most important place of my tennis career,” Nadal said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He also acknowledged the points he regretted, such as his double fault on set point in the third set — an instant classic of its own — as well as being “super tired” in stretches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s true. There [were] some crazy points,” Nadal said. “The fatigue is there, too, no?”</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Stefanos Tsitsipas chases tennis's Big Three with an entire nation on his side</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Nonetheless, attendance was capped at 5,000, roughly one-third capacity, but the crowd bellowed like a full house when Nadal strode onto court, with Djokovic, the higher seed by virtue of his No. 1 ranking, trailing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The tone was set from the start. Every point was a battle, yet Nadal won the most important ones to bolt to a 5-0 lead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just kind of found my rhythm, found my groove,” Djokovic said. “There was no looking back. After [losing the first set], I felt like I was in the match.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By that point, nearly two hours had passed, and the all-out physicality of both men seemed unsustainable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is going into the canon of one of the great matches,” Courier said on the Tennis Channel broadcast. “It’s a ridiculous, eye-popping level of tennis.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chiming in via social media was two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who tweeted: “You cannot play better clay-court tennis than this. It’s perfect.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, serving at 5-6, saved a set point with a drop shot and went on to win the tiebreaker that followed to go up two sets to one.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fans exulted. Nadal got back to work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He got an early break in the fourth set, seemingly dug in for whatever was required to force a fifth set.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But after falling behind early, Djokovic roared back again, attacking every predictable second serve of the Spaniard while rarely missing on his own first serve.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From there, it was over quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And Djokovic, who declared himself deserving of a night’s celebration, has a full day to prepare for Tsitsipas, against whom he holds a 5-2 career edge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Friday’s first semifinal started out as a romp for Tsitsipas but turned into an odyssey as Zverev found the consistency he lacked early to claw back from a two-sets-to-none deficit and force a fifth set.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tsitsipas is the first Greek player to reach the final of a major, and he paid homage to his country during on-court remarks, fighting back tears.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“All I can think of is my roots, where I came from, a really small place outside of Athens,” Tsitsipas said. “My dream was to play here — to play on this big stage one day.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>And he underscored his national pride by tacking a sentiment onto the autograph victorious players customarily write on the broadcast’s primary camera lens, scribbling, “Let’s do it for the love of the country.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Roger Federer withdrew from the U.S. Open and expects to be sidelined for “many months” after he decided to undergo a third surgery on his right knee, the 20-time Grand Slam champion announced Sunday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federer’s decision comes one week after he turned 40 and at a moment when he is tied with Rafael Nadal, 35, and Novak Djokovic, 34, for the most Grand Slam singles titles in men’s tennis history.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Federer’s tone was upbeat when he shared the news with his fans via a 90-second Instagram video. But he made clear that his return to the pro tour is far from certain, given his age and the challenge of rehabilitation that awaits.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Nonetheless, Federer concluded that another surgery is the only “glimmer of hope” he has of competing again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federer explained his decision as follows:</p></div></div>
<div><p>For Roger Federer, the end came quickly at Wimbledon. Now come the questions.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Federer, ranked ninth, won his last major at the 2018 Australian Open.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he suffered a straight-sets, quarterfinal loss to 14th-seeded Hubert Hurkacz, failing to win a single game in the final set. He has not played since.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It’s Nadal vs. Djokovic — but not on the tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Nadal, speaking Thursday after winning a match at the Melbourne Summer Set ATP 250 tournament, <a>told</a> reporters that Djokovic knew the risks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s normal that the people here in Australia get very frustrated with the case because they have been going through a lot of very hard lockdowns,” Nadal said. Djokovic “makes his own decision,” he added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you are vaccinated, you can play in the Australian Open and everywhere,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, 34, who won the Australian Open last year, was <a>detained</a> by officials at the airport amid growing outrage over a decision to award the athlete a visa and medical exemption from vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia, once known for its tough <a>“covid zero”</a> policies to keep the virus at bay, is now grappling with the <a>omicron variant</a> and one of the world’s sharpest spikes in infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Nadal</a> and <a>Djokovic</a> have previously tested positive for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Djokovic situation has spawned debate on social media along with <a>memes</a>, as <a>airlines</a> offer the player a ride home and others <a>refer</a> to him as “Novax Djokovic.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rules are rules, and there are no special cases,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Thursday, as he thanked border officers and confirmed that Djokovic’s visa had been canceled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our government’s strong border protection policies, and particularly in relation to the pandemic, [have ensured] Australia has one of the lowest death rates of covid anywhere in the world,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>

<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic used two exclamation points and an emoji of a flexed biceps Tuesday in announcing that he had been granted an exemption from coronavirus vaccination, enabling him to defend his Australian Open title.</p></div></div>
<a>Federer previously announced he won’t play</a>, but Nadal will, having already arrived in Australia to begin preparations. The tournament begins Jan. 17.
<div><div><p>Djokovic isn’t the only player to have been granted a medical exemption. Tournament officials acknowledged that “a handful” of others had but declined to say how many.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While Djokovic supporters cheered the news, the pushback was swift and strong from other quarters in the sport.</p></div></div>
<p>British doubles specialist Jamie Murray, asked his opinion of the decision <a>during a news conference at the ATP Cup in Sydney</a>, said, “I think if it was me that wasn’t vaccinated, I wouldn’t be getting an exemption.”</p>
<a>One Twitter user asked</a> whether he could “swing an exemption for all the unvaccinated teachers, police officers, nurses…” Earlier this week,
<a>Victoria reported</a> 8,577 new coronavirus cases, passing the previous peak of 7,442 on Jan. 1.
<p>Oliver Brown, chief sportswriter for Britain’s Telegraph, argued that the decision showed Australia’s hard-line covid-19 protocols didn’t apply to the rich and famous and predicted widespread resentment toward Djokovic as a result.</p>
<a>tweeted</a>: “After everything Victorians have been through, Novak Djokovic getting a vaccine exemption is nothing short of a kick in the guts. All those lockdowns, all that suffering. Seriously?”

<div><div><p>SYDNEY — When tennis star Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, he stepped off the plane into a different country than the one where he’d won the Australian Open a year earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>
<a>movie posters</a> about people trapped at airports. One satirical website
<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The NFL suspended Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Antonio Brown and safety Mike Edwards for three games each after determining that they had misrepresented their vaccination status, the league announced Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All three players submitted fake vaccination cards, according to a person familiar with the findings of the NFL’s review. All three players are now legitimately vaccinated, that person said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Aaron Rodgers, starting QB for the unvaccinated, is really just looking out for No. 12</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Jerry Brewer</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>November 5, 2021 at 6:30 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<i>him</i>, not on matters that require deference or social responsibility or faith in anything other than his big ol’ ego.
<div><p>Aaron Rodgers lashes out against NFL, 'woke mob' in defense of vaccination status</p></div>
<div><div><p>He should have kept his mouth shut.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When a preamble uses “woke mob” and “cancel culture” as a throat-clearing exercise, buckle up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sally Jenkins: Aaron Rodgers is entitled to stay unvaccinated. He is not entitled to lie about it.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not some sort of anti-vax flat-Earther,” Rodgers insisted. “I’m somebody who’s a critical thinker. I march to the beat of my own drum. I believe strongly in bodily autonomy.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Fix: Aaron Rodgers and vaccine-skeptic whataboutism</p></div>
<a>making up plays in the huddle to win playoff games</a> and doing anything else he pleases. So how dare you persecute him for being the most brilliant of them all?
<div><div><p>“The great MLK said, ‘You have a moral obligation to object to unjust rules and rules that make no sense,'" Rodgers said, straining to use Martin Luther King Jr. to justify his decisions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He’d rather turn to horse medication than trust conventional science. Rodgers doesn’t fear being wrong, but he can’t stand someone else being right.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The right is going to champion me, and the left is going to cancel me,” Rodgers said of the politicization of his vaccination stance. “I don’t give a [expletive] about either of them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On so many levels, Rodgers simply does not care. Inside the great quarterback is a grating human being.</p></div></div>
<p>• Jenkins: <a>Antonio Brown put his pain on display for all to see. Instead of helping, the Bucs cut bait.</a></p>
<p>• <a>NFL Week 18 power rankings: The Packers are the new No. 1</a></p>
<p>• <a>Baker Mayfield hit a new low Monday, and it could force the Browns to move on</a></p>
