<div><p>QA with Ruth Marcus and Henry Olsen: What can we expect from the Supreme Court on abortion?</p></div>
<div><div><p>The justices have defied some earlier liberal predictions of catastrophe, but there’s reason to believe this term may be different — and if not this term, then one not far off.</p></div></div>

<i>Miranda, </i>the 1966 decision protecting the rights of suspects in custody, voted as chief justice to
<a>reaffirm</a> the ruling. Having
<a>found</a> in 1986 that it was constitutional for states to criminally prosecute private homosexual conduct, the court, in the span of a dozen years from 2003 to 2015,
<a>reversed itself</a> on that question,
<a>overturned</a> the Defense of Marriage Act protecting states from having to recognize same-sex unions and, finally,
<a>declared</a> the existence of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

<i>Roe </i>or checking off another item on the right’s legal bucket list — and those justices, led by Roberts, who might want to get to the same place but prefer to act more incrementally.

<div><p>Ruth Marcus: The Supreme Court’s crisis of legitimacy</p></div>
<b> </b>the court confronted cases touching on hot social topics —
<a>Oregon bakers</a> fined for refusing to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, abortion restrictions in
<i>Planned Parenthood</i> case, Roberts and Kavanaugh took pass after pass.
<b> </b>day of the term, for instance, Kavanaugh voted with the other four conservatives to
<a>reject</a> a theory that his mentor, Kennedy, had
<a>toyed with</a> for years: that partisan gerrymandering can be so extreme as to violate the Constitution. With Kavanaugh on the court, that door was firmly shut, and with it, a potentially powerful tool to combat political polarization was lost.
<a>voted with</a> Roberts 94 percent of the time, more than any other pair of justices, he demonstrated his willingness to break with the chief in several significant cases. In another decision on the term’s last day,
<a>voted</a> 5 to 4, Roberts joining with the liberals, to block the Trump administration’s effort to add a question about citizenship to the census; Kavanaugh sided with the conservatives.
<a>rebuffed</a> the Trump administration’s effort to undo immigration protections for “dreamers.” It
<a>struck down</a> a Louisiana abortion law, even more surprising, since Roberts had
<a>dissented</a> in an almost identical case invalidating a Texas law just four years before. Six justices, including Roberts and Gorsuch, who authored the opinion,
<a>ruled </a>that federal employment discrimination law protects gay, lesbian and transgender workers from discrimination; Kavanaugh dissented.
<a>lamented in an op-ed</a> in The Post. “At least for the moment, the conservative dream of a solid majority on the Supreme Court is dead.”
<a>received exemptions</a> from having to comply with anti-discrimination laws, even as states were
<a>required to provide equal benefits</a> to religious and secular private schools. In other words, churches could discriminate but could not be discriminated against.
<b> </b>courts considered the issue?
<div><p>Ruth Marcus: The Supreme Court doesn’t just suffer from political hackery. It’s more insidious than that.</p></div>
<i>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</i> upholding fines for failing to obtain smallpox vaccines.
<div><div><p>Even more than the tensions between the two men, however, the case underscored two new realities on the court. First, Roberts was no longer the pivotal player. He had been outvoted.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>weren’t any longer subject to attendance caps. Therefore, Roberts reasoned, the court had no need to issue “an order telling the Governor not to do what he’s not doing.”
<div><div><p>The new majority wasn’t buying it. “The applicants remain under a constant threat,” they said. After all, why put off deciding something until tomorrow if you’ve got the votes today?</p></div></div>
<b> </b>request that seemed at least
<a>urgent request</a>, arguing that the injunction “imposes a severe and unwarranted burden on Executive authority over immigration policy and foreign affairs."
<a>raced to the high court</a> seeking a stay. Then, the court, over Sotomayor’s objection,
<a><i>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</i></a>, decided on the last day of the term. This time, in a case about voting rights, the conservatives were united, with Roberts fully on board.
<i>” —</i> from the Justice Department. For decades, this provision safeguarded the votes of millions of minority voters — and drove Republicans in the South and other covered areas to distraction. In
<i>Shelby County</i>, Roberts led the charge to neuter the law.
<i>Brnovich.</i> Section 2 allows after-the-fact challenges to changes in voting procedures. In a 1980 decision,the court
<a>held</a> that Section 2 applied only to
<i>intentional</i> discrimination, not to practices that have the
<i>effect </i>of disadvantaging minority voters.
<a>Section 2 </a>prohibited any voting practice that “results in a denial or abridgment of the right ... to vote on account of race or color.”
<div><p>For years, that provision had taken a back seat to Section 5, because pre-clearance was<b> </b>such a powerful tool. But in the grim aftermath of <i>Shelby County, </i>voting rights advocates sought to expand the use of Section 2.</p></div>
<a>the high court’s first take on this<b> </b>effort</a> — and it did not go well. The case involved two Arizona voting rules: The first was a state policy that disqualified an entire ballot that was
<i>Shelby County </i>and the end of pre-clearance review, made it illegal to do so. Never mind the absence of evidence that the practice resulted in fraudulent votes.
<b> </b>“But the majority today lessens the law — cuts Section 2 down to its own preferred size. … No matter what Congress wanted, the majority has other ideas. This Court has no right to remake Section 2.”
<a>single appeals court case</a> that merely raised the issue in passing. The case was from 1981, the year
<i>before </i>Congress rewrote the law, and in doing so made clear that it allowed
<b> </b>private lawsuits. “It is intended that citizens have a private cause of action to enforce their rights under Section 2,” the
<a>House report</a> on the law stated.
<a>challenge to the Affordable Care Act</a>; it managed to
<a>a florist claimed</a> that her religious rights were violated when she was ordered to produce custom arrangements for same-sex couples or face fines — an issue the court had sidestepped in its earlier
<a><i>Masterpiece Cakeshop</i></a>ruling.
<div><p>Still, the majority’s boldness in <i>Brnovich </i>was a clear harbinger of more to come, and in other areas of the law. This much was clear in the smoking ruins of the Voting Rights Act: A court that could do this could do anything.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Even before the 2020-2021 term had drawn to a close, the court set the stage for the potentially watershed term now underway.</p></div></div>
<a>agreed in April</a> to decide its first significant gun rights case in a decade, clarifying the scope of its 2008 decision that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.
<a>The next month</a>, the court agreed to review an abortion law, although the case
<a> satisfied none of the usual criteria</a> for review: There was no split in the circuits, no conflict “with relevant decisions of this court,” no unsettled question of federal law.
<a>Asian students’ challenge </a>to Harvard’s admissions policies — and asking the
<a>commission on the Supreme Court</a> — even though that panel
<b> </b>wasn’t intended to do much more than head off demands from the left for radical changes such as expanding the size of the court. Perhaps
<a>first major public appearance</a>, went to, of all places, the (Mitch) McConnell Center at the University of Louisville with, of all people, the Senate minority leader himself, to
<a>declare</a>, “My goal today is to convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.”

<a>overplayed its hand </a>was suggested by the court’s belated agreement to hear two cases involving the Texas abortion law — one by abortion providers, the other by the Biden administration.
<a>The cases</a> did not raise challenges to the state’s ban on abortion after six weeks; rather, they concerned Texas’s effort to prevent the law from being reviewed in federal court at all by outsourcing enforcement to private vigilantes.
<a>court itself </a>was going to be consigned to standing by while its precedents were being blatantly evaded. And not just precedents the majority didn’t like — the

<a>prohibiting almost all abortions</a> waiting in the wings if
<i>Casey,</i>” the state’s
<a>petition</a> said. The latter referred to the 1992 case
<i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, </i>in which the court had reaffirmed the right to abortion.
<i>Casey </i>makes resolution of this case straightforward.” A single footnote raising that prospect became almost the entire brief.
<i>Roe </i>and would never have signed on to a finding that the Constitution includes a right to abortion. Three were all but guaranteed votes for overruling.
<b> </b>to take the momentous step of abandoning a nearly 50-year-old precedent, one that had been reaffirmed time after time? In advance of oral argument in
<i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization </i>on Dec. 1, that wasn’t at all clear. Just last year, Roberts had
<a>voted</a> for the first time to strike down an abortion law. Kavanaugh, at his confirmation hearings, had pledged that he
<i>Roe </i>“an important precedent of the Supreme Court,” and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had pronounced herself convinced that Kavanaugh would not vote to overrule it. Barrett was clearly no fan of
<i>Roe — </i>but she was a new justice; was she ready to take the plunge?
<i>Casey </i>would be overruled outright seemed shorter than ever.
<a>Roberts noted last year</a>, “
<i>Casey</i> reaffirmed ‘the most central principle of
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>,’ ‘a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability.’”
<a>argued </a>in their brief to the court, that “would leave women, state officials, and the lower courts at sea.”
<i>Casey</i> were overruled and that the Constitution no longer protected a woman’s right to choose.
<a>she asked</a>, “why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” Again, hardly the comments of a justice inclined to stick with the precedent.
<p>If six conservative votes make abortion the biggest issue at the Supreme Court this term, gun rights are close behind. No issue of constitutional law is simultaneously as politically potent and as legally undeveloped as the Second Amendment.</p>
<a><i>District of Columbia v. Heller</i></a>, that the court declared it protected an individual right to bear arms. Scalia wrote
<i>Heller</i>, but Kennedy provided the fifth vote.
<div><div><p>The opinion left a lot to sort out. Did <i>Heller </i>apply outside the home? What test should courts apply in deciding the constitutionality of gun laws? Could assault weapons be banned? What about licensing rules?</p></div></div>
<a>second-class right</a>,” in Thomas’s words.
<div><p>Ruth Marcus: The Supreme Court’s conservative majority returns to its passion project</p></div>
<a>dismissed the case</a> as moot — prompting a furious dissent from Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas complaining that the court was letting itself be “manipulated in a way that should not be countenanced.”
<a>oral argument</a> made evident. The court’s originalists seemed not at all troubled by abundant historical evidence of states restricting guns in public places.
<a>case</a> is even more significant, as a measure of the court’s eagerness to roll back the power of regulatory agencies.
<div><div><p>Or maybe not surprising at all. As the six have demonstrated, together or in shifting alliances, this can be a remarkably aggressive court.</p></div></div>
<p>The paradox of the court’s current moment is that elements of both sides in the fierce ideological debate over its direction are convinced that they are about to lose. Anticipatory garment-rending is not the province of any single faction.</p>
<b> </b>are unlikely to succeed might be less significant than the intensity with which they are being pressed, and what that augurs for the success of attacks on the court’s legitimacy.
<a>2020 decision</a> finding that the federal job-bias law protects gay and transgender workers.
<i>Roe</i> and might balk feels unthinkable to some. What was the point of the struggle of the past 30-plus years to build a conservative Supreme Court, if not that?
<div><div><p>But make no mistake: It is coming. The court, and the nation, will be worse off for it.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It seems a long time ago, but 2021 is the year Virginia became the first former Confederate state to abolish the death penalty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That, along with a decade of Democrats shutting out Republicans in statewide elections, prompted many media pundits to proclaim Virginia as solidly, perhaps permanently, blue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The November elections disproved that assessment.</p></div></div>
<a>fateful 12 words</a> in the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce/Schar School debate, analysts might instead be interpreting the outcome in the context of a long Democratic trend with no end in sight.
<div><div><p>The last time Democrats enjoyed such wall-to-wall power in Virginia was the late 1960s, before the state’s first elected Republican governor, <a>Linwood Holton</a>, broke their stranglehold.</p></div></div>
<p>This time, the Democrats’ dominance was fleeting because Republicans <a>turned out last month in unprecedented numbers</a> and because suburbanites who had leaned Democratic were unimpressed with what they saw from the party and wanted change.</p>
<div><div><p>It’s a stretch to say that Virginia is now right of the political center because of one election. Every election is different with campaigns litigated over ever-changing social, economic and governmental situations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2020, as with the three preceding years, Trump’s low esteem in Virginia’s educated, affluent suburbs that are closely tied economically to the federal government galvanized voters in support of Democrats.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Micheline Maynard</div></div>Contributing columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>827,000 dead</a> from covid-19. On Dec. 22, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued finalized data
<a>showing</a> that the U.S. death rate spiked 17 percent in 2020 and Americans’ life expectancy dropped by nearly two years, the largest one-year decline since World War II.
<div><div><p>A March 2021 <a>survey</a> by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 1 in 5 Americans said they had lost a relative or close friend to covid.</p></div></div>
<p>“If you are not a kinder, gentler company right now, you are going to be in trouble,” says Ti Adelaide Martin, co-proprietor of Commander’s Palace restaurant in New Orleans, whom I met when I interviewed her for an upcoming book.</p>
<div><div><p>Of course, most bosses have experience dealing with the family tragedies of individual workers, responding by sending flowers from the department, and attending wakes and funerals.</p></div></div>
<a>explored by Scientific American</a>, can be exacerbated by the drumbeat of covid reminders — the arrival of virus variants, renewed school shutdowns and other public health measures many thought were finished.
<a>Vickie Mays</a>, a professor of health policy and management at the University of California at Los Angeles, told the journal.
<div><div><p>Fortunately, a number of companies appear to be stepping up, whether from compassion or to protect their bottom lines, or both.</p></div></div>
<p><a>The Harvard Business Review</a> says this is “a new era for mental health at work,” a sharp contrast to pre-pandemic days of 2019, when employers were just starting to grasp the importance of emotional challenges faced by workers.</p>
<a>Hurricane Ida</a> visited more misery on New Orleans.
<div><div><p>Martin says a manager’s challenge is twofold: First to show they’re aware of employees’ feelings; second, to demonstrate that “there is light at the end of the tunnel and a path to it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She adds, “People are never going to forget how you treated them in these very hard moments.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While their elders may have gained fortitude by gritting their way through hard times and personal losses in the past, younger employees may lack the emotional tools to deal with what’s going on now.</p></div></div>
<p>Martin sees some benefit in the collective grieving that’s going on in many workplaces. She has gone to the extent of tracking down a priest, gathering her employees in a courtyard and urging them to share their feelings with the cleric.</p>
<div><div><p>It can take a herculean effort to stay focused when sadness seems to be everywhere. Given how tenuous the world has become, an effort to work while grieving may spell the difference between a business going on, or giving up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for paid bereavement leave, it’s worth considering that in 2017 even perennially criticized Facebook <a>instituted a policy</a> of allowing up 20 days to mourn the death of an immediate family member.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amid covid, companies need to heed her message that such policies can “improve their bottom line by increasing the loyalty and performance of their workforce.” Also, it’s just the right thing to do.</p></div></div>
