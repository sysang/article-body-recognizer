<p>Ouch, that’s gotta hurt.</p>
<p>“Halloween Kills” star Kyle Richards revealed she broke her nose while shooting her scenes for the upcoming flick.</p>

<p>The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” personality joins Curtis, 62, again for the new sequel of the acclaimed horror franchise and had a bit of unfortunate luck during filming.</p>
<a>told Us Weekly</a>. “I just knew I hurt myself, but I didn’t tell anybody. I didn’t want the stunt double to step in and have them be like, ‘Oh Kyle, you know, let the stunt double handle this.’ ”
<p>To ease her pain, Richards popped some Advil that an assistant director gave her and got back to her craft.</p>
<p>Richards also revealed how the accident happened in an interview with <a>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p>
<p>Curtis and Richards are joined by Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, Nancy Stephens and Anthony Michael Hall in the newest film adaption. James Jude Courtney returns as serial killer Michael Myers.</p>
<p>Scream queen Curtis’ Laurie Strode and her family must combat Michael’s obsession to kill her and wreak havoc on the town of Haddonfield once again.</p>
<p>“Halloween Kills” will come screaming into theaters and on <a>Peacock</a> on Friday.</p>

<p>Kyle Richards promises that screaming while running for her life from a psychotic killer is easier work than filming “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” reunions.</p>
<p>Richards reprises her role in the eagerly awaited “Halloween Kills” installment — out Friday in theaters and streaming on Peacock — and calls the experience “surreal.”</p>
<p>“My mom always taught me the squeaky wheel gets the oil, so I planted that seed and dropped a heavy hint,” she said with a laugh.</p>
<a>the legendary “Scream Queen” said</a> of Richards’ work in the new film. “She is a spectacular actress and beautiful even when covered in mud and blood.”
<p>Their film was postponed for a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and Richards is happy with the decision.</p>

<h1> YouTuber Adalia Rose Williams dead at 15: ‘She is no longer in pain’</h1>

<p>YouTuber Adalia Rose Williams, who was open with her fans about life with a rare genetic disease, has died at the age of 15.</p>
<p>Williams, who was diagnosed as a baby with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome — also known as the “Benjamin Button” disease — passed away Wednesday evening, according to her Facebook page.</p>
<p>Her family thanked Williams’ loyal followers that “love and supported her,” and asked for privacy as they mourn her loss.</p>
<p>Many fans left comments of love and support below the post, hoping that she “rests in peace.”</p>
<p>“I loved her so much,” one follower from India posted. “She has been an inspiration to many and has touched millions of lives.”</p>
<p>“What a beautiful bright light she was and will continue to be through all the lives she touched,” wrote a fan.</p>
<p>“She taught us how to live without limitations,” said another.</p>
<p>On Instagram, the 380,000 users that followed her handle expressed similar sentiments in response to the tragic announcement, which came just<a> three weeks after she lost her hearing</a>.</p>
<p>The syndrome currently lacks a cure and causes rapid aging, accompanied by slowed growth and hair loss. According to the Progeria Research Foundation, around <a>400 children worldwide</a> are currently living with the disease.</p>
<p>The Texas-based teen, who exceeded the average life expectancy for those with the condition upon making past 13 years old, began vlogging in 2012. Uploading her videos on YouTube, she eventually amassed 2.9 million subscribers.</p>
<p>She didn’t just post health updates — she dabbled in makeup tutorials, dances and skits featuring other members of her family.</p>
<p>“She touched MILLIONS of people and left the biggest imprint in everyone that knew her,” her family posted to Facebook.</p>

<h1> Why Taylor Swift ‘Fearless’ re-recording was worth it for her — but is it for us?</h1>

<div> April 9, 2021 12:02am <div> Updated <div> April 9, 2021 8:22am </div> </div> </div>
<p>That’s exactly how Taylor Swift feels about the songs that she wrote and recorded for Big Machine Label Group over six studio albums — from her 2006 self-titled debut to 2017’s “Reputation.” </p>
<p>But after Swift failed to negotiate a deal to buy her masters (the original recordings) from high-profile music manager Scooter Braun, who purchased Big Machine and its assets in 2019, she decided to embark on a journey to reclaim her music.</p>
<a>Maren Morris</a> (on “You All Over Me”) and
<a>Keith Urban</a>, whom Swift opened for in the “Fearless” era — there really isn’t much new about it. And that’s exactly the point.
<a>last year’s “Folklore.”</a>
<p>The heavy-metal gods signed a deal with Warner Music Group in 1994 that returned rights to all their master recordings in 2012. Then they launched their own label, Blackened Recordings, which now handles all of Metallica’s releases.</p>
<p><a>Bono</a> and company acquired the masters to all of their work with megabucks backing from Live Nation, with whom the band signed a 12-year deal in 2008.</p>
<p>After creating her own imprint under Roc Nation in 2015, Rihanna managed to acquire the masters of all her previous albums from her former label Def Jam. Go, RiRi!</p>
<p>Purchasing his masters and buying out the remainder of his contract from Def Jam, Ocean won the right to self-release his 2016 album “Blonde.”</p>

<h1> Swizz says DMX’s new album was tragically meant to be his big comeback</h1>
<div> May 28, 2021 7:46am <div> Updated <div> May 28, 2021 7:51am </div> </div> </div>
<p>For DMX’s longtime collaborator, friend and Ruff Ryders crewmate Swizz Beatz, making his posthumous album “Exodus” — which drops on Friday — was supposed to be the start of a big comeback for the late rapper.</p>
<p>Sadly, the New York native — born Earl Simmons in Mount Vernon and raised in Yonkers — <a>died at 50 on April 9</a> after suffering a heart attack on April 2 brought on by an overdose.</p>
<p>But the journey to “Exodus” actually began 10 months ago, after X appeared in a Verzuz battle with Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>“He was ready. And we just ended up staying in California at Snoop’s studio, where we did the Verzuz, and started and finished the album there.”</p>
<p>No doubt, “Exodus” is not the hastily compiled collection of leftovers that some posthumous albums end up being. You can hear all sorts of life in DMX, who sounds re-focused and re-energized throughout the LP.</p>
<a>Alicia Keys</a> (“Hold Me Down”) and Snoop Dogg (“Take Control”) to
<a>Nas</a> (both on “Bath Salts”) to Lil Wayne (“Dogs Out”) and even Bono (“Skyscrapers”).
<p>Now the album feels like a star-studded sendoff worthy of the rap king that he was. “Yeah, it’s really spooky about that,” said Swizz. “It’s almost like his 50th birthday party, you know?”</p>
<a>“Ruff Ryders’ Anthem.”</a> “But due to the circumstances, I made the executive decision to make it ‘Exodus.’ The word meant so much to him that he named his son that and he tatted it on his neck.”
<p>“He was my best friend. He was my brother.”</p>

<p>“And,” he added with a smile, “I’m about to sign Bono and the Edge to write the score.”</p>
<p>And so, in celebration — if that’s the word — of its 10th anniversary, here are some of my memories of the Greatest Flop on Earth.</p>
<p>At the end of the presentation, Taymor introduced her new producer, David Garfinkle. A chubby little guy walked out and — I swear to God — I thought, “Julie is going to eat him for breakfast and spit him out for lunch.”</p>
<p>“‘Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark’ is the most expensive and technically complex show ever produced on a Broadway stage,” <a>I wrote the next day</a>. “It may also turn out to be the most dangerous.”</p>
<p>I guess I was onto something, as “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” piled up so many injuries, I started calling it “Spider-Man: Call 911.”</p>
<a>scooping up millions on tour in New Zealand to help her fix it</a>.
<p>But I didn’t let up.</p>
<a>bought the spin and wrote a flattering profile of Taymor</a>, pointing out that I had “sensationalized” Kevin Aubin’s “minor injury.”
<p>Kevin, with two broken wrists, could not feed himself, bathe himself or go to the bathroom by himself for nearly a year without the help of an aide.</p>
<p>“Minor,” indeed. Well done, New York.</p>
<a>The show was muddled and pretentious</a>. The special effects weren’t nearly as magical as Mary Martin flying in “Peter Pan” back in 1960.
<a>More actors got injured</a>. Cohl fired Taymor, she sued, and
<a>they settled out of court</a>. A new director was brought in; the show closed down for a few months, and reopened to even more bad reviews. It played its final performance Jan. 4, 2014, by which time I had lost all interest in it.
<p>Bono looked at me, put his hands on his cheeks and said, “You’re the motherf–ker!”</p>

<h1> TikTok helps woman find her mystery lover — and his wife</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:21pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>He was found, all right.</p>
<p>When a Pennsylvania woman named Mica Renee took to TikTok asking social media sleuths to help her reconnect with the would-be love of her life, she ultimately ended up connecting with his wife. </p>
<p>“TikTok help me find this man I met in Miami,” she pleaded in her cyber search for her then-unknown Romeo, who’d approached her on the beach. </p>
<p>“He walked right into the ocean to introduce himself to me,” Renee wrote in the clip’s closed captions, emphasizing her elation with the heart-eyes emoji. </p>
<p>Her excitement notwithstanding, Renee went on to admit that she’d regrettably lost her happenstance honey’s contact information after their <a>brief rendezvous</a>. </p>
<p>“I was lit when he gave me his number,” she penned before telling her more than 16,000 followers, “I’m counting on [y’all to find him]. Hopefully he ain’t married!”</p>
<p>Well, here’s hoping she didn’t get her hopes up too high. </p>
<a>seaside sweetheart is married</a>, and that his wife of six years had contacted her through TikTok’s direct messages. 
<p>“He is indeed married and I won’t be reaching out to him,” Renee said. </p>
<p>She shared a screenshot of her chat with the man’s scorned spouse, Sharee, who jotted down her husband’s digits and said, in part: “Tell him Sharee gave you the number.”</p>
<p>Renee immediately apologized to the woman. </p>
<p>However, an unfazed Sharee was surprisingly happy to have learned of her hubby’s <a>extramarital escapades</a>. </p>
<p>Sharee, a mother of four from Michigan, also asked Renee to refrain from deleting the damning evidence of her groom’s not-so-discreet infidelity. </p>
<p>“Can you not delete the video,” she said. “I don’t want him lying about this too.” Renee eagerly agreed. </p>
<p>“I can only imagine what she is going through,” Renee told The Post of Sharee. “And I appreciate that we were able to communicate about the situation very respectfully.”</p>
<p>The married man’s messy Miami Beach madness didn’t end there. </p>
<p>Sharee’s overly friendly husband, a fitness trainer known as AJ, jumped onto TikTok insisting his innocence. </p>
<p>“You cappin’ hard,” he said, accusing Renee of lying about their supposed love connection. </p>
<p>“There was never no cheating, and never no <a>attempting to cheat</a>,” he added, noting that their one-off encounter happened five months ago. </p>
<p>AJ went on to suggest Renee seek professional counseling. </p>
<p>“I hope you get whatever mental help you need because that s–t is just a little crazy and very, very weird,” he continued. “Hope your life gets better.”</p>
<p>And in closing he swore, “Just for the record I definitely don’t cheat on my wife, she knows that.”</p>

<p>A man’s agonizing penis pain was blamed on COVID infection, as docs warned of the rare side effect.</p>
<p>Writing in a medical journal, the Iranian team described how the virus led to blood clotting in the poor man’s shaft. </p>
<p>The unnamed male had suffered penile pain for three days before being seen by a urologist in Iran, who referred him for tests.</p>
<p>The discomfort began following an erection while having sex, the 41-year-old married man told doctors.</p>
<p>He had not experienced any trauma to his pelvic area that might explain his symptom.</p>
<p>But he had a positive COVID PCR test three weeks prior, radiologist Seyed Morteza Bagheri and a colleague from the Iran University of Medical Sciences wrote in the journal Clinical Case Reports.</p>
<p>Nothing was out of the ordinary about his COVID illness. doctors noted.</p>
<p>He had mild <a>symptoms</a> including fever, cough and fatigue and did not need to take any medication.</p>
<p>Tests at the hospital showed the man had “thrombosis of deep dorsal penile vein” – blood clotting in a vein that runs along the top of the shaft.</p>
<p>The vein runs the whole length of the penis and is involved in supply of oxygenated blood to the organ.</p>
<p>An ultrasound showed “no [blood] flow in the vein” due to a clot around half way along the penis.</p>
<p>Immediately, doctors started giving rivaroxaban, a blood thinning medication used to treat and prevent blood clots. </p>
<p>“Two months after starting the treatment, patient’s symptoms were completely disappeared and he had no penile pain during erection and sexual disturbances anymore,” the medics wrote.</p>
<p>Everything was in working order “down there”, Mr Morteza Bagheri wrote.</p>
<p>However, the man still experienced a little pain under pressure at the site of the blood clotting.</p>
<p>Scientists have learned over the pandemic that the coronavirus does not just cause respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>One of its other features is to increase the tendency of blood to clot. In fact, this <a>is often the cause of death</a>. </p>
<p>“Roughly, 20 percent – 50 percent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection have abnormal coagulation tests,” Mr Morteza Bagheri wrote. </p>
<p>But he said the type of blood clotting this patient had was very rare. When it does occur, it’s usually in somebody who has a blood clotting disorder.</p>
<p>It could become life threatening if the blood clot breaks off and travels to the lung, causing pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>“Searching the literature showed no previously published similar case of deep dorsal penile vein thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and our patient is the first reported case,” Mr Morteza Bagheri said.</p>
<p>Thrombosis in another vein, the superficial dorsal penile vein, has been reported previously in men with COVID.</p>
<p>And a bunch of other complications in the male genitalia have been reported by doctors over the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p><a>A 69-year-old man in Ohio</a>, suffered a three-hour erection — a condition called priapism — due to blood clotting problems in his penis.</p>
<p>Medics reported in The American Journal of American Medicine that they believed COVID had caused clots to form in his penis, trapping blood in the erection chambers. </p>
<p>Doctors had to drain blood from the penis using a needle because ice packs did not work to bring the stiffness down.</p>
<p>He unfortunately died of COVID due to his lungs failing. </p>
<p><a>Another man in his 60s</a>, in France, had to go through the same procedure after COVID left him with a four-hour erection.</p>
<p>In this case, the doctors concluded that the man’s priapism had been triggered by COVID. He survived and hadn’t suffered priapism since discharge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, experts have found evidence that COVID may damage the blood vessels of the penis, making it harder to get an erection.</p>
<p><a>One man in his 30s</a> revealed he had struggled to get an erection after infection and, as a result, his penis had shrunk.</p>

<h1> Shocking video shows NYC school bus fatally striking 15-year-old</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 10:22am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Shocking video captured the moment a 15-year-old girl was mowed down by a school bus in Brooklyn this week. </p>
<p>The 20-second clip, obtained by The Post on Tuesday, shows the yellow bus turning the corner at Bedford Avenue and Avenue P in Sheepshead Bay on Monday morning — just as Antonina Zatulovska was crossing the street.</p>
<p>The driver, identified as Aleksandr Patlakh, 55, strikes Antonina and keeps driving — with a rear wheel of the bus rolling over the teen, the footage shows. </p>
<p>Hours later, Patlakh, also of Coney Island, was arrested at Neptune Avenue and West Sixth Street, about a half-mile from his home. </p>
<p>He was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care and released on a desk-appearance ticket. It remained unclear Tuesday whether Patlakh was aware that he had struck someone.</p>
<p>He could not be reached by The Post.</p>
<p>Antonina’s dad, Boris Zatulovksa, 63, described his daughter as “a beautiful girl, innocent, crossing a crosswalk.”</p>
<p>She has two half-brothers in their 30s from her father’s previous marriage, he said.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s crying right now,” he said. “Everybody knew her spark, her smile.</p>
<p>“My wife is doing pretty bad. Everybody’s suffering right now. You couldn’t believe it.”</p>
<p>He said that as an Uber driver, he knows the area well and “can’t imagine that people drive like this in New York.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he described the police conducting the investigation as “very good, very supportive.</p>
<p>“They’ve giving me any information, any possible support,” the teen’s dad said. “They’re great guys.”</p>
<p>The family is planning a Jewish funeral for Antonina, he said.</p>
<h1> I watched the FBI become so woke it can’t call out terrorism</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:48pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>What happened to the FBI?</p>
<p>The HRT is the world’s premier domestic-counterterrorism team. It knows what it’s doing. </p>
<p>The 11-hour standoff concluded thanks in large part to the heroism of Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who hurled a chair at the abductor before escaping with fellow hostages. FBI-HRT then entered, neutralizing Akram.</p>
<p>And this is when things got kooky.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes investigations take time, and we don’t want to release inaccurate information. Yet this was a ground ball.</p>
<p>The White House asserted the FBI’s course correction a day later, allowing that, of course, the Colleyville synagogue hostage-taking was “terrorism-related.” Duh.</p>
<a>describe criminal suspects’ race</a> for fear of being tagged “racist.”
<p>I was there for the genesis of the FBI’s transformation, when we ceased calling things what they are and began to use nebulous and ambiguous terms so as not to offend.</p>
<a>San Bernardino terror attack</a> and the Pulse nightclub massacre.
<p> And while we were dealing with a multitude of lone-wolf radical Islamist inspired or directed terror cases, we were directed to place more of our finite resources into the domestic-terror realm. The media helped <a>distort the narrative</a>.</p>
<a>mainstream conservatives</a>.”
<a>drops in its favorability</a> ratings, the vast majority of its agents and professional support employees continue to toil in obscurity and work damn hard to keep Americans safe. We need them.
<a>FBI senior executives</a> who made a mockery of the obvious: Call things what they are. Stand up to those who disingenuously employ definitional distortions. I am tired of apologizing. Make us proud again, FBI.

<h1> World’s oldest man dies at 112 — months after breaking record</h1>

<div> January 18, 2022 7:05pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:20pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>It was a long life well lived.</p>
<p>The world’s oldest man, Saturnino de la Fuente García from León, Spain, has died at the age of 112 and 341 days.</p>
<p>García broke the Guinness World Record for longest person living back in September 2021. The publication announced his passing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>De la Fuente García once told Guinness World Records his secret to a long life: “Do not hurt anyone.”</p>
<p>According to Guinness, he was born in Puente Castro, Leon, on Feb. 11, 1909,</p>
<p>He was affectionately also known as “El pepino” during his lifetime. (“El pepino” is a shortened version for the moniker “Peña,” the name of de la Fuente García’s mom.)</p>
<p>He “lived a quiet life” with his wife Antonina Barrio Gutiérrez, whom he married in 1933, he told Guinness. </p>
<p>He is survived by his seven daughters, 14 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren. </p>
<p>He only stood at 4.92 feet tall, which was able to help him avoid enlisting in the 1936 Spanish Civil War. He opened up a growing shoemaking business during the war instead.</p>
<p>De la Fuente García’s craft skills allowed him to fashion boots for the army, earning him a reputation as an artisan in his hometown. </p>
<p>Another passion of Garcia’s was playing soccer. He was a supporter of Leon’s team <a>Cultural Leonesa</a> and even co-founded Puente Castro’s local soccer team. For his 110th birthday, the latter paid homage to him.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records posted a TikTok celebrating Garcia last year. They presented him with a birthday cake and the certificate showing off his honor. </p>
<p>Garcia will be <a>buried</a> at a local cemetery in León on Wednesday. </p>
<h1> ‘I escaped a Jewish cult that wanted me to marry my 12-year-old cousin’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:14am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 12:04pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>When Mendy Levy was 15 years old, he had never thrown a baseball, seen a stuffed animal, watched television or held a cellphone. </p>
<p>But the teenager reached his breaking point in September 2018. Lev Tahor’s leader, Nachman Helbrans (whose late father, Shlomo Helbrans, founded the group), allegedly commanded Levy to marry his 12-year-old first cousin.</p>
<p>Levy didn’t feel he could say no. “I feared, I would be charim [Yiddish for ostracized],” he said. “I feared that they could lock me up and beat me.”</p>
<p>According to sources, Lev Tahor was formed in Israel during the 1980s with the intention of practicing Judaism as it was 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Levy was far from the only member who claims he was forced into or threatened with marriage at a young age.</p>
<p>Nachman Helbrans’ attorney declined to comment for this story. Lev Tahor’s leaders have previously denied accusations of wrongdoing or mistreatment of its members.</p>
<p>“They said that for doing the wrong things, you would go to hell. And the sins were removed when they hit you.”</p>
<p>In 2014, questions from Quebec authorities over the group’s lack of secular schooling, according to Levy, led the 300 members to orchestrate a nighttime move to Ontario.</p>
<p>After a year, the group relocated to Guatemala, where, Levy said, they believed they could practice more freely.</p>
<p>Then he was called to meet with the group’s leaders, along with his cousin.</p>
<p>Levy said that he was told: “You do not need to marry her here. First we will send you to Canada. Then we will send her. You will live a beautiful life there.”</p>
<p>He saw his mother one last time. “She was crying and did not know what they would do with me. But she and I did not hug. You are not allowed to hug your mother.”</p>
<p>Levy was then taken to a hotel and given a phone that he was shown how to answer, “so they could call me in the event of an emergency,” he said. </p>
<p>The man asked Levy for his location. But Levy, who now believes that the phone contained old contacts yet to be deleted, had no clue. The man promised to find somebody who could help.</p>
<p>Looking over his shoulder, he made his way downstairs and handed the phone to a front-desk clerk, who gave the address to the man on the other end of the line. Shortly after, Levy said, “A taxi pulled up and I jumped inside.”</p>
<p>These days, Levy attends synagogue voluntarily: “I go for fun. I have friends there and I live a secular, open-minded life.”</p>
<p>Nine of his siblings remain in Guatemala with Lev Tahor, while his older brother managed to escape to Israel. Recently the two “met in Guatemala to give testimony to legal authorities about what goes on there with Lev Tahor,” Levy said.</p>
<p>At home in Quebec, Levy is planning to attend college and perhaps major in psychology. “I went through a lot,” he said. “I think I can help people.”</p>

<h1> Abandoned home with no bedrooms sells for $2M</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 6:51pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:04pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Fixer-upper is an understatement. </p>
<p>An abandoned San Francisco townhouse with zero bedrooms, mismatched floors, boarded up windows and a staircase that just might collapse on a windy day has sold — for a shocking $1.97 million. </p>
<p>“This the worst house on the best block,” the candid listing for the home on 320 Day St. states. </p>
<p>Located in the upscale Noe Valley neighborhood, the decrepit property initially went up for sale for $995,000 and is described in the listing as a “contractors special.” </p>
<p>The wood-frame home, which comes with only one bathroom, went for auction in a conservatorship sale last month. It sold on Jan. 7 for $600,000 above the starting bid.</p>
<p>Homes in the sought-after southern neighborhood average $2.6 million. They also typically sell in 11 days, with property over 3,000 square feet routinely going for more than $4 million, according to the Real Deal. </p>
<p>“This property is likely to require cash only due to its extreme deferred state,” the listing notes. </p>
<p>It continues: “Surrounded by many multimillion-dollar homes; this is the best opportunity on the block and your chance to make it shine as bright as the neighbors.” </p>
<p>Currently the most expensive listing in the neighborhood is a 6,000-square-foot modern build on a lot that spans double the size of the Day Street house. </p>
<p>Todd Wiley and Kim Wiley with Compass represented the seller. </p>
<p>“We thought the property would sell at $1.6 million — we had data for that,” Wiley told <a>Insider. </a>“But then the human spirit of competition took over.”</p>
<p>The home is 120 years old and currently features boarded-up windows, mismatched flooring and an oversized square bathtub.</p>

<h1> Playboy model says she’s too beautiful for love: ‘Men are scared to date me’</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 11:43am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 12:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This Playboy playmate claims she’s so centerfold sexy, she can’t get a date.</p>
<p>A model might seem like they’d be fending off guys 24/7. However, Elizabeth Marie Chevalier reportedly finds it nearly impossible to find suitors — which she attributes to men being intimidated by her hotness. </p>
<p>The San Diego resident finds this particularly unfortunate because she’s “actually very sweet and loving, so if they took the time to get to know me they would realize that.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the majority of Chevalier’s dates haven’t been able to see past her bikini.</p>
<p>And while the hot social media star would “100% date a fan,” every guy she’s met through the ‘Gram has reportedly treated her “like a commodity,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s not just shallow males who judge Chevalier based on appearance: The influencer claimed that “jealous” women often assume that she will “steal their boyfriends” because of her looks. </p>
<p>“She started screaming in my face and I’m not a confrontational person at all, so I just ended up leaving,” Chevalier added.</p>
<p>Despite insisting that she’d never purloin someone’s paramour, the fear has nonetheless made it difficult for her to make female friends, Jam Press reported.</p>
<p>“Luckily, I have a very solid group of girlfriends that have known me for years who I can count on,” the glamour gal said. </p>
<p>As for what constitutes the ideal guy, Chevalier says she prefers a “strong but silent” fellow who’s tall, dark and handsome with green eyes. </p>
<p>The singleton also finds assertiveness attractive, claiming: “He [a prospective date] would just have to come up and say ‘Hello, beautiful — can I ask you on a date?'”</p>
<p>“I like a guy who is very forward and knows what he wants,” she added.</p>
<p>Being swelteringly sexy might scare away the lads, but it isn’t without its perks, according to Chevalier. </p>
<p>The model reportedly joined OnlyFans in 2020, raking in $20,000 in just two weeks before leaving the site, according to Jam Press. She reportedly reopened her account this year.</p>
<a>a German model claimed</a> that she was uninvited from her friend’s wedding because she looked “too good” in her bridesmaid’s dress. Meanwhile, a TikTok mom
<a>was reportedly shamed by her fellow parents</a> in October for getting gussied up in a glamorous outfit to take her son to a playground.
<p>And an <a>Instagram model was jettisoned from Tinder</a> after the dating app reportedly mistook her salacious snaps for catfish bait.</p>

<h1> ‘New sheriff in town’: Virginia’s attorney general fires 30 staffers before taking office</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 2:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:01pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Virginia’s new attorney general reportedly fired 30 staff the night before he was sworn into office — then proudly declared that “there’s a new sheriff in town.”</p>
<p>Jason Miyares told 17 attorneys and 13 other staffers that they were no longer needed late Friday, hours before he took office Saturday, his office told 13News Now.</p>
<p>They included the solicitor general and deputies who served under Miyares’ predecessor, Democrat Mark Herring, the report said.</p>
<p>Miyares spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita confirmed the shakeup to Fox News, saying it was a necessary change because the newcomer and his predecessor “have very different visions for the office.”</p>
<p>After taking office Saturday, he joined new Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin in tackling some of the progressive policies they both <a>campaigned against </a>during their elections.</p>
<p>Miyares, also a Republican, announced separate investigations into the<a> troubled Loudoun County school board</a>, which was accused of covering up sexual assaults, as well as the soft-on-crime policies within the parole board.</p>
<p>“The message is: There’s a new sheriff in town,” he <a>told Fox’s “The Ingraham Angle”</a> on Monday night.</p>
<p>He insisted drastic changes were needed to recover from the “far-left, liberal monopoly that has been in control for two years and they passed a series of laws and they made Virginians less safe, less secure.”</p>
<p>He <a>tweeted a link</a> to his interview, writing, “It’s a new day in Virginia.</p>
<p>“Virginians voted for change – and I’m tackling the criminal first, victim last mindset head on.”</p>
<h1> Donald Trump’s lawyer says ruling in Prince Andrew case not applicable to niece’s suit</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:47pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:48pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Donald Trump’s lawyer says a ruling in the sex-abuse case against Prince Andrew can’t be used by the former president’s niece as an argument in her unrelated inheritance battle.</p>
<p>Mary Trump is suing her ex-commander-in-chief uncle and other family members, contesting a settlement agreement she signed in 2001 over her inheritance and wanting more dough.</p>
<p>The former president is arguing that since his niece signed the pact, she doesn’t get another bite at the apple.</p>
<p>Then last week, a lawyer for Trump’s niece <a>notified a judge</a> about a recent ruling in Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s <a>civil case against the royal</a>.</p>
<p>That ruling had rejected the Duke of York’s arguments that Giuffre’s suit should be tossed based on Prince Andrew’s claims he was legally protected against her by her 2009 settlement agreement with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Mary Trump’s camp is suggesting that the ruling could pave the way for her own unrelated suit to continue. </p>
<p>But Donald Trump’s lawyer, James Kiley, said in a new filing that the cases aren’t analogous.</p>
<p>Kiley told The Post, “I think Mary Trump’s counsel is grasping at straws with the reference to the Prince Andrew case, which is palpably distinguishable and irrelevant to Mary’s case.</p>
<p>“The attempt is an example of her effort to sensationalize the case in the press and distract from the weakness of her legal arguments.”</p>
<p>Mary Trump’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a request for comment.</p>
<h1> McDonald’s employee reveals difference in round and folded eggs in viral TikTok</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 6:29pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 6:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A McDonald’s employee has revealed how the fast food chain makes two types of eggs for its breakfast sandwiches in a now-viral TikTok video. </p>
<p>Over the weekend, TikTok user @essentialmcdonalds posted a video on the social media platform showing the difference between McDonald’s folded egg and its round egg. </p>
<p>In the clip, the TikTok user explains that folded eggs come pre-cooked in squares. The user then explains how McDonald’s employees cook the folded eggs for serving.</p>
<p>When the video switches to show how the round eggs are made, the clip shows a tray of uncooked eggs beside the grill. </p>
<p>TikTok user @essentialmcdonalds says: “These are the round eggs. So they’re cooked fresh every day.”</p>
<p>The clip shows the TikTok user cracking an egg right onto a round mold on the grill.</p>
<p>Once all the rings are filled with eggs, the TikTok user breaks all the yolks. </p>
<p>“We pop all the yolks, pour some water in the top so it steams the yolks and the egg,” the TikTok user says in the clip. “We pull them out of the ring molds and scoop them up with the same egg tool.”</p>
<p>Since it was posted over the weekend, the video has been viewed more than 7.8 million times. </p>
<p>Commenters on the clip were divided as to which type of egg is better, with some people saying that the round eggs are better.</p>
<p>“At least something is fresh,” one person said. </p>
<p>Another commenter wrote: “I always sub for round eggs.”</p>
<p>Someone else said: “The folded eggs have the weirdest texture to me.”</p>
<p>However, other commenters said they still choose to get folded eggs. </p>
<p>“Still prefer the square ones,” someone wrote. “Too many times I’ve eaten eggshells.”</p>
<p>Another person said: “Folded egg wins every time. I don’t care that it’s premade. So is 95% of all food products in fast food restaurants. Your burgers come premade.”</p>

<h1> Disney slammed for price hikes at theme parks, longer wait times</h1>

<div> January 18, 2022 1:35pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:13pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“The Most Magical Place on Earth” is being rebranded as “The Most Expensive Place on Earth” by angry customers who slammed Disney for price hikes at its Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. </p>
<p>Disney customers took to Reddit over the past week to rip the Mouse House’s theme parks over higher admission fees, as well as a subpar experience that includes more expensive, lackluster food and staffing shortages.</p>
<p>Disney, which has been <a>hit hard by the pandemic</a>, has been increasing prices in order to make up for the loss of business.</p>
<p>According to <a>Inside the Magic</a>, even prices for ice cream have been jacked up. The Mickey’s premium ice cream sandwich and chocolate-coated premium bar rose from $5.69 to $5.99</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in its<a> fourth-quarter earnings call</a>, Disney said it would reduce food portion sizes at its parks in order to maximize profits and avoid hefty entrance fee hikes.</p>
<p>But those hikes are already hitting both parks, according to Disney fan blogs, <a>WDW News Today</a> and <a>Inside the Magic</a>, which report entrance and parking fee increases, as well as a rise in the price of food and merchandise.</p>
<p>Other complaints included Disney World <a>skimping</a> on lobster meat in its $17 lobster roll, as well as <a>dirtier bathrooms and longer lines</a>, according to Inside the Magic.</p>
<p>Disney did not return requests for comment.</p>
<a>slammed by fans</a> as subpar and too expensive. 
<p>For example, <a>a two-night stay on the “Halcyon starcruiser” </a>starts at $4,809 on weeknights for the most modest package, a two-guest cabin, <a>according to the voyage’s website</a>.</p>
<p>For a three-guest cabin, the price rises to $5,299, and for a four-guest cabin it’s a $5,999 “voyage total.” Suite pricing for four or more passengers was not listed on the website.</p>
<h1> Teen charged with murder of ex-girlfriend who was shot 22 times</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:56pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:56pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A 17-year-old boy was arrested Monday and charged with murder for allegedly shooting his ex-girlfriend 22 times as she walked her dog in a Houston park last week, authorities said.</p>
<p>Diamond Alvarez, 16, was lured to the park last Tuesday after she received a text message from the suspect, Frank Deleon Jr., asking that she meet him there, the victim’s mother Anna Machado said.</p>
<p>Soon after, Alvarez’s family heard the gunfire from their house and rushed to the nearby green space when their dog, Peanut, returned home alone, relatives said.</p>
<p>The family found Alvarez’s body and the mother tried to revive her daughter by performing CPR, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Police said the teen couple’s relationship ended after Alvarez learned Deleon was cheating on her.</p>
<p>Machado said her daughter and her alleged killer dated “on and off” for about a year.</p>
<p>“My daughter was always crying about him,” the mother said.</p>
<p>Machado said she visited a makeshift memorial honoring her daughter after learning of the arrest in the case.</p>
<p>“I went up over there again, crying and said: ’Baby you have justice. It’s not done yet. It’s not over yet. But at least we know a name,’” she said.</p>
<p>Deleon was being held in Harris County Jail and prosecutors are seeking a $250,000 bond.</p>
<p>But Machado wants the suspect held without bond.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t even deserve a high bond. He executed my daughter,” the mother said.</p>

<h1> Nancy Pelosi makes millions off tech stocks – and scoffs at push to ban congressional trades</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 7, 2022 9:42pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 9:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Nancy Pelosi is scrambling to quash bipartisan efforts to ban stock trading by Congressional lawmakers — even as she and her husband have raked in as much as $30 million from bets on the Big Tech firms Pelosi is responsible for regulating.</p>
<a> stock picking by lawmakers, claiming it was part of the “free-market economy”</a> — comments that made Democratic insiders “blood boil,” people close to the speaker told The Post.
<p>“Key policy makers can be rich but they shouldn’t own individual companies,” Jeff Hauser, a self-proclaimed progressive Democrat and founder and director of the Revolving Door Project, told The Post.</p>
<p>Stock picking by elected officials “gets worrisome about whether legislators have access to insider information or whether your stock purchases will consciously or unconsciously impact policy making,” Hauser added.</p>
<p>Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, is a businessman who runs the venture capital and investment firm Financial Leasing Services and has made countless bets on high-profile companies his wife is supposed to regulate, like Amazon, Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In addition to Paul Pelosi’s recent round of trading in December, the couple has raked in millions from individual stocks over more than a decade.</p>
<p>The Pelosis’ exposure to tech stocks, however, may have actually hurt them in 2021, when their portfolio underperformed the SP 500 by 15.5 percent, according to FinePrint. </p>
<p>Walter Shaub, the former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics during both the Obama and Trump administrations, called this defense “absolutely insulting.”</p>
<p>The Pelosis’ current holdings include between $5 million and $25 million of shares in both Amazon and Apple, as well as between $1 million and $5 million worth of Google stock options, according to their most recent disclosures. </p>
<a>refusing to take calls from Mark Zuckerberg in 2019</a> after Facebook declined to remove a doctored video of her.
<p>Earlier this year, she also seemed to praise antitrust legislation saying, “There has been concern on both sides of the aisle about the consolidation of power of the tech companies, and this legislation is an attempt to address that.”</p>
<p>But privately, Pelosi has continued her relationships with Big Tech executives. According to a New York Times report, Ms. Pelosi has spoken with Apple CEO Tim Cook about the legislation.</p>
<p>“It’s not a good look for the Speaker of the House to simultaneously profit directly from the companies she is supposed to rein in,” another source close to the situation told The Post.</p>
<p>Pelosi has conceded Members of Congress should follow the rules and report trades but insisted they should “be able to participate” in the stock market.</p>
<p>The issue of congressional stock trading has taken on new urgency since the beginning of the pandemic, when suspiciously timed stock trades by lawmakers in both parties provoked outrage and led to multiple investigations.</p>
<p>While Pelosi receives extra scrutiny as the Speaker of the House, she’s far from the only member of Congress to trade shares of individual companies. </p>
<a>traded hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares</a> in several chipmakers including Nvidia. 
<p>To date, no one has been charged in connection with STOCK Act investigations undertaken by the Justice Department and the Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The 2012 law was passed with bipartisan support in the wake of a stock trading scandal. Yet in the nearly 10 years since it was enacted, no one has been prosecuted under it even as many members continue to conspicuously trade.</p>
<p>“It’s not a political issue on the right-left spectrum, but a greed issue.” Shaub said.</p>
<h1> Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg admits he’s had ‘challenging 2 weeks’ in office</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 4:12pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 5:06pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>New Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg admitted Sunday that his first two weeks in office have been “challenging” — amid backlash over his progressive prosecutorial policies.</p>
<p>“It has been a challenging two weeks, church family. Challenging,” he told congregants during morning service at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.</p>
<p>But still, Bragg, a former federal prosecutor, insisted he was the right man for the job.</p>
<p>“I want to be clear and unequivocal that public safety is paramount,” he added.</p>
<p>Bragg also acknowledged missteps in his “Day One” memo to staff detailing his objectives.</p>
<p>“And it may be a long conversation. [I’m] harboring no illusions that the storm will end soon.”</p>
<a>is seeing an uptick in nearly every category of major crime.</a>
<p>New NYPD Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell has said she <a>fears Bragg’s policies put cops and the public at risk</a>, while local Republicans have backed an online campaign to<a> oust the top prosecutor from office</a>.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Bragg, Manhattan’s<a> first black DA</a>, said his strategy of restorative justice and diversion programs would help “make us safer.”</p>
<p>“We make these investments, we will reap the fruits of safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Bragg also briefly mentioned <a>the fatal Saturday morning subway shove</a> in Times Square.</p>
<p>“We have safety on the trains we need to secure,” he said.</p>
<p>Bragg’s comments to the pulpit come a day after <a>The Post reported </a>that at least nine prosecutors have quit his office amid a “radical shift in policy.” </p>
<p>Rolon’s armed robbery charges <a>were downgraded to misdemeanors </a>in line with Bragg’s criminal justice reforms.</p>

<h1> TikTok user shares mind-blowing way she found out husband cheated</h1>

<p>A new TikTok trend has users exposing the wild ways they found out their ex-spouse was cheating on them — and one woman’s tale wound up being a less-than-happy anniversary gift.</p>
<p>TikTok user Ami Addison, who goes by @aaddison01, shared how she discovered her husband was living a double life about a week before their 10th wedding anniversary. </p>
<p>In the video, which has garnered more than 803,000 views, the mom of four explained that she was reading the local paper one day when she stumbled upon her husband’s name listed as a new father in the birth announcements. </p>
<p>Digging deeper, she searched for his name and the other woman’s first name on the local hospital’s website, which posted photos of the newborn babies. </p>
<p>Her suspicions were confirmed. </p>
<p>“Sure enough, they had a baby boy a few days prior,” she said. </p>
<p>Oh, but there was more. </p>
<p>“Not only that, they had a baby girl about a year and a half before that,” she said before wrapping up her shocking story. “So, yeah, that’s how I found out I was being cheated on.”</p>
<a>red flags were there</a> all along and
<a>how she confronted him</a> — as well as
<a>“the sidechick.”</a>
<a>complicated Starbucks patrons</a> to
<a>“unreasonable” UPS customers</a>. For the latter, TikTok user
<a>Uncle Dave</a> shared his reply to user
<a>Steveioe</a>‘s question, “What is an unreasonable request from someone you were trying to help at your job?”
<p>UPS driver Uncle Dave goes on to recount the time a man attempted to get him to fulfill a huge request — to take away his fully assembled couch that he was still using.</p>

<p>Talk about keeping it in the family — yikes!</p>
<p>A scorned woman is going viral for unabashedly blasting a former boyfriend for cheating on her with his high school-age stepsister. </p>
<p>“As soon as I saw the video I started crying, and my first thought was ‘What the f–k?,’ ” she said. </p>
<p>Copenhagen, a freshman at Michigan Technological University, originally detailed the disturbing incident in a now-trending TikTok tell-all. </p>
<p>“I was going out to lunch with his mom because it was her birthday and I wanted to celebrate it with her,” said Copenhagen. “And that’s when the stepsister (a high school student named Ashley) sent me the SnapChat.”</p>
<p>“His mom just looked at me and said, ‘I need to leave,’ ” Copenhagen explained. “I’m assuming she went home to confront her kids about it.”</p>
