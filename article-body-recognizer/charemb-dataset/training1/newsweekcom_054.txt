<div> News Sudan <a>Mining</a></div>
<p>Rescue workers in Sudan have recovered at least 31 bodies from the Darsaya gold mine, where 38 people are believed to be killed when it collapsed earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Sudanese Mineral Resources Limited Company, a state-run mining company, said rescue workers and villagers are continuing their search of the mine in the West Kordofan province's Fuja village, looking for more bodies or even possibly survivors.</p>
<a>Facebook</a> Tuesday showing hundreds of villagers watching as at least two rescue workers searched for bodies and survivors. Others show villagers preparing graves for any dead they recover.
<p>Sudan is a major producer of gold, but the industry has struggled with corruption. The Al-Jazeera report said gold mine collapses are common in Sudan because of a lack of enforcement for safety regulations.</p>
<p>The transitional government has begun regulating the industry during the past two years.</p>
<p>As many as 1,900 metric tons of food had been stored at the warehouse, meant to be distributed to people in need in the area, the WFP said.</p>
<p>"Such an attack severely impedes our ability to deliver to the people who need it the most," she said.</p>
<p>Sudan is one of the poorest counties in the world, with at least 14.3 million people in need humanitarian assistance, according to U.N. figures.</p>
<p>The attack on WFP's warehouse came after another one on a former base for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in el-Fasher last week. The base, handed over to Sudanese authorities on December 21, was also looted, the U.N. said.</p>

<p>Six German men who are accused of stealing at least $129 million in jewels have received their trial start date.</p>
<p>The trial of the men, whose ages range from 22 to 28, accused of stealing from the Green Vault Museum in the eastern German city of Dresden will begin on January 28. The museum was the site of a massive break-in that occurred on November 25, 2019.</p>
<p>The men have been charged with organized robbery and arson, with the final suspect arrested in May.</p>
<p>The identities of four of the accused men have not been publicly released. However, brothers Abdul Majed and Mohamed Remmo have been identified in connection with the incident due to their history of crime.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to the Green Vault Museum for comment.</p>
<p>The Green Vault is one of the world's oldest museums. It was established in 1723 and contains the treasury of Augustus the Strong of Saxony, comprising around 4,000 objects of gold, precious stones and other materials.</p>

<p>Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has dismissed the U.S. as a power "in decline," as negotiators from both nations try to find a way to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal at talks in Vienna.</p>
<p>"We are certain that Nicaragua too can overcome the U.S.'s threats and sanctions since today the U.S. is in decline, and is growing weaker day by day," Raisi told Ortega, according to a readout published by Iran's state-owned PressTV.</p>
<p>"The [international] hegemonic system cannot impose its will on the Islamic Republic and Nicaragua since the countries rely on their peoples' votes and support, and can [therefore] stand up to hegemonic powers' excessive demands," Raisi added.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s administration introduced new measures against the Nicaraguan Public Ministry and nine Nicaraguan government officials.
<p>Ortega told Raisi that Nicaragua "stands by the Iranian nation on all international arenas."</p>
<p>The long-time close ties between the two nations have raised concerns in the U.S. that Nicaragua is offering Tehran a window into the Americas, particularly for Iranian-allied armed proxy groups such as Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Iran, too, remains under a wide range of American sanctions following Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA. Talks to revive the deal resumed on Monday in Vienna: the eighth round of negotiations.</p>
<p>American and European representatives have warned that time is running out to reach an accord, while U.S. and <a>Israeli officials</a> have been hinting at <a>military action</a> absent a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>Iranian and Russian diplomats have, however, reported positive developments from the latest round of talks.</p>
<a>crude oil</a>—a vital contributor to government income—have been particularly punishing.
<p>Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA, and the assassinations of <a>Major General Qassem Soleimani</a> and <a>nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh</a>, prompted Iran to move further and further from JCPOA limits.</p>

<div> World Taiwan <a>China</a></div>
<p>Over 70 percent of respondents in a recent survey in Taiwan said they would fight <a>China</a> if it tried to force "unification" with the island.</p>
<p>The strikingly high willingness to oppose Beijing "if China uses force against Taiwan"—72.5 versus 18.6 percent—may be a reflection of the question's framing, which usually doesn't include a specific hypothetical circumstance.</p>
<p>It's a departure from the generally ambivalent public attitude toward the perennial debate about the likelihood of war across the Taiwan Strait and the society's response.</p>
<p>Announcing the survey results at a press conference, TFD linked the sentiments to "China's increasingly tough attitude toward Taiwan and intensifying tension between the United States and China."</p>
<p>The ESC is one of Taiwan's index pollsters and has been tracking the island's political attitudes and national identities since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The general survey collected 1,098 telephone interviews with Taiwan residents above the age of 20 between November 25 and December 9.</p>
<p>In the same Global Views survey in November 2020, 66.3 percent of respondents said China would not achieve unification with Taiwan in the next 10 years.</p>

<p>Paleontologists have identified a new species of dinosaur in Brazil that is toothless and walks on two legs.</p>
<p>The paleontologists dated the remains, which were uncovered between 2011 and 2014, to between 70 and 80 million years ago. The small dinosaur measured around 3 feet in length and 2.5 feet in height, researchers said.</p>
<p>Berthasaura leopoldinae belongs to a large group of dinosaurs called Theropoda that walked on their hind legs and ranged in size from the 2-foot-long Microraptor to the 40-foot Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>
<p>Most theropods—members of the group Theropoda—were believed to be carnivores. But puzzlingly, the new species has a beak-like mouth with no teeth.</p>
<p>"That was a real surprise," the paleontologists said in a statement released by Brazil's National Museum.</p>
<p>The researchers said the find was one of the most complete <a>dinosaur</a> skeletons found in Brazil, and the first toothless theropod to be found in the country.</p>
<p>The fact that the dinosaur is toothless is intriguing, indicating that it may not have only eaten meat, like most theropods.</p>
<p>"The toothless part raises doubts about what kind of diet this animal had," said researcher Geovane Alves Souza, one of the study's authors with the National Museum, said, <a>according to AFP</a>.</p>
<p>"It doesn't necessarily mean it didn't eat meat, though. Lots of birds, such as falcons and buzzards, eat meat with beaks. Most likely, it was an omnivore living in an inhospitable environment where it had to eat whatever it could."</p>
<p>The new species was named after Bertha Lutz (1894-1976)—a biologist of the National Museum and one of the main leaders in the fight for the political rights of Brazilian women—and Empress Leopoldina (1797-1826), the first empress of Brazil.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, news emerged regarding the discovery of <a>more than 100 dinosaur tracks</a> dated to around 150 million years ago at a renowned site in Colorado.</p>
<p>Clean-up crews discovered the tracks at the Picket Wire Canyonlands, located in the southeast of the state, after flooding, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported on Tuesday, citing U.S. Forest Service officials.</p>
<p>Picket Wire Canyonlands is home to the largest dinosaur track site in North America.</p>
<p>When the team from Lincoln Conservation first came to uncover some plaster around the room, the wall paintings were revealed.</p>
<p>"We were speechless," Dr. Anna Keay, the director of The Landmark Trust, said in a release. "It was clear at once that these almost certainly dated to the Tudor period. But still we only had specks."</p>
<p>Members of the Lincoln Conservation team were given two days to remove the plaster. When Keay returned at the start of the second day, she found that the team uncovered artwork on three full walls.</p>
<p>"Floor to ceiling, wall to wall, a complete, highly decorated Tudor chamber, stripped with black and red and white and ochre," Keay recalled. "Mythical creatures and twining vines, classical columns and roaring griffins."</p>
<p>She went on to say that she never experienced this type of discovery throughout her 27 years of experience working in historic buildings.</p>
<p>Paul Croft, a research fellow with Lincoln Conservation, told Newsweek it was the first time the two organizations worked together.</p>
<p>He explained the team received permission to open a number of small areas on the walls and they were able to take a look at the wall paintings.</p>
<p>Croft said it is unclear whether they will work together on the conservation efforts, but believed they will be involved in the process in some way.</p>
<p>She said that prints and engravings influenced by Renaissance design made their way to England and likely inspired the unknown creator behind the wall paintings of Calverley Old Hall.</p>
<p>As the organization continues to investigate the history behind the paintings, it is looking to raise money to conserve the paintings, according to a release sent to Newsweek from The Landmark Trust.</p>

<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Giant Prehistoric Shark Teeth From 60-Foot Ocean Monster Unearthed in Desert</h1><div> By Joseph Golder, Zenger News <time>On 11/20/21 at 9:00 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Extensive mining operations and looting by treasure hunters had led to possibly hundreds of teeth from megalodons and other prehistoric artifacts being sold on the black market, said Quilodran.</p>
<p>"Although in Chile fossils are protected by law, for many years one of the most spectacular localities, the Bahia Inglesa Formation, was the victim of destruction by deregulated mining operations and from looting by illegal fossil hunters," he said.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, he said some looted artifacts have been returned to Chile in recent years, allowing it to build the world's most impressive collection.</p>
<p>"With this, we undoubtedly have one of the largest scientific collections of megalodon teeth in the world."</p>
<p>How is it teeth from a marine animal were found in the middle of a desert?</p>
<p>"In short, the sea has receded, but the ground has also risen as a result of earthquakes and subduction of plates, phenomena that we Chileans know and experience so well."</p>
<a>Charles Darwin</a> reported having found some megalodon teeth during his trip to Chile in 1835, Quilodran said, while recent discoveries had put the total number of different shark species found in the area to 25.
<p>"In the case of sharks, it is not only megalodon; we recently found a new sawshark record for the area, which adds up to more than 25 different species of shark that have been found in the sector."</p>
<p>A lot of these discoveries were apparently due to sheer luck. "Many of these findings are fortuitous and did not respond to systematic scientific activity," Quilodran said.</p>
<p>But future discoveries will likely be subject to more rigorous planning, due to the recent creation of the Atacama Paleontology and Natural History Research and Advancement Corp.</p>
<p>"For example, what and how did it eat? New estimates of body size, growth speed, whether it was solitary or gregarious, internal temperature and paleo-environmental data, are among many other topics that may be addressed.</p>
<p>The recently discovered megalodon teeth will eventually end up in a museum, where the public will be able to view them.</p>
<p>Might the megalodon still exist? No, Quilodran says: "The megalodon became extinct due to possible climatic changes around 2 million years ago."</p>
<p>Still, it "is always possible to find new species and animals that have gone unnoticed by science, but at 16 meters [52 feet] long, it would be very difficult to have not detected it," he said.</p>
<p>Despite megalodon being the largest shark of all time, it's possible an even larger predator of another species preyed on it.</p>

<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Treasure Trove of Dinosaur Fossils Could Rewrite Prehistory</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 12/3/21 at 10:14 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>The skeleton of Bruno, found at Villaggio del Pescatore near Trieste, in northeastern Italy, is the most pristine and complete dinosaur fossil ever found in Italy, a country not known for its dinosaur remains.</p>
<p>The discovery could shake up what paleontologists know about the reign of dinosaurs, between 230 million and 66 million years ago, as this region of the ancient Mediterranean isn't a famous site for large dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The scientists dated the site and its fossils to an era of Earth's history called the Cretaceous period, meaning Bruno and Antonio are likely around 80 million years old.</p>
<p>The team's findings were reported in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>The discovery that Antonio is an <a>adolescent</a> example of a much larger dinosaur could revise what we understand about the geology of the ancient Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The researchers who made the finding believe the presence of larger dinosaurs could indicate that land bridges existed to the small island that would become the region around Villaggio del Pescatore.</p>
<p>That means that what is now northeastern Italy could have been connected to western Europe and Asia. There could have been many migratory routes that allowed large terrestrial animals like the dinosaurs to cross over to these small islands.</p>
<p>The fossils collected from the site are now on display in Trieste at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale.</p>
