<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Samantha Pell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 3:02 p.m. EST|Updated today at 3:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Thoughts raced through Jensen’s head: Could he play in the NHL? Would he get sent to the minors?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, nearly three years after the Capitals acquired Jensen from the Detroit Red Wings at the 2019 trade deadline, he’s flourishing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jensen had a strong campaign last season and continued his steady play into this one, averaging, 19:31 of ice time. He has three goals and seven assists in 32 games, and his plus-minus of plus-19 is one of the best in the league.</p></div>
<div><p>From October: Capitals defenseman Nick Jensen has carried over his strong finish to last season</p></div>
<a>healthy scratch </a>at points in the 2019-20 season, raising questions about his future in Washington. Now it’s all about working on the finer points of his game.
<div><div><p>At his low points, he tried to leave his struggles at the rink.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jensen is highly self-aware of his in-game skills. He knows he is not a player who will force offense, nor does the team need or want him to. Jensen is more focused on maximizing each shift and being a dependable defender.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the offensive zone, he knows he excels when he’s moving his feet, cycling the puck and keeping his head up. If he’s staring at the puck and worried about losing it, he knows his confidence is starting to slide.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A look at the Capitals’ long climb toward an all-time goal differential of zero</p></div>
<p>“You are the last guy back on the blue line, and if you have the confidence to do it, try to shake and bake a guy at the blue line, that is a pretty good sign … [and] probably right where I find most of my confidence,” Jensen said.</p>
<p>Some of that comes from the change in coaches from Todd Reirden to Peter Laviolette. MacLellan said Laviolette has more confidence in Jensen than the previous staff did, allowing Jensen more leeway and flexibility as he adjusted to a new system.</p>
<div><div><p>This season, Jensen’s solid play has continued with Dmitry Orlov.</p></div></div>
<b>Note:</b> Forwards T.J. Oshie and Nicklas Backstrom returned to practice Thursday after both missed
<a>Sunday’s overtime loss to New Jersey</a> with a non-covid-19 illness. Orlov also returned to practice after sitting out Wednesday with an upper-body injury.
<p>Laviolette said Orlov should be available for Friday’s game at St. Louis. Laviolette said he didn’t know whether Oshie or Backstrom would travel for the Capitals’ two-game road trip; Washington visits Minnesota on Saturday.</p>
<div><div><p>Forwards Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Carl Hagelin and defenseman John Carlson also missed Thursday’s practice. The Capitals said all four took “maintenance days.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>KFC and Chipotle launched new plant-based products nationwide. They probably won’t be the last.</h1></div>
<h2> The chains’ announcements come amid an expanding landscape for plant-based alternative meats</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Firozi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:12 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Two restaurant chains announced this week that they are expanding plant-based menu options nationwide, the latest sign that alt-meat is having its moment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As grocery prices rise, alt-meat takes a bigger bite of Big Meat’s burger</p></div>
<a>impact</a> of animal-based products, he said.
<div><div><p>Nestle said the companies “must think there is a market for plant-based alternatives and want to bring people who want these alternatives into their stores.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It may bring in new consumers who may have otherwise objected to buying fast food. It can also help a restaurant overcome the “veto vote,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let’s say someone is bringing a bunch of kids for a fast meal,” he said. “If you don’t have products that will speak to everyone … you might lose out.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Chipotle, this is an extension of what it has already been doing, he added. Chipotle said the plant-based chorizo is its “second-ever vegan protein on a national stage.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For people curious about plant-based proteins, seeing the option at a restaurant they frequent may be enough to push them to try it, experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both companies signaled that while the new products will be available for a limited time, they will evaluate and consider whether to offer them again or longer-term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cash noted that KFC and Chipotle are not the first chains to offer plant-based menu items.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The more chains go into this, the easier it is for more chains to try it,” he said.</p></div></div>

<h2>Alexandra Wylie, 14, and Riley Vinson, 10, hope to compete one day at Nationals and maybe even the Olympics.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Fred Bowen</div></div>KidsPost sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:25 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The United States Figure Skating Championships are being held this week in Nashville, Tennessee. The top male and female skaters will move on to the Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, next month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>World-class figure skaters such as defending U.S. champions Nathan Chen and <a>Bradie Tennell</a> do not just happen. They work for years to get to the medal platform.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I feel like I’m flying when I do my jumps and spins,” she says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it is not all flying and fun. Skating is hard work. Riley practices six days a week for an hour or two a day. Some practices are off-ice to get her in the physical condition needed for skating.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Riley’s work seems to be paying off. When I spoke to her, she had just finished fifth against athletes who had been skating much longer. Riley will definitely keep at it. “I want to skate for another 20 years,” she says.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Alexandra continued skating when the family returned home. She loves being on the ice, because, she says, “I feel free and can express myself.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alexandra is working on her double axle (a skating jump) and wants to be able to land triples by the time she is 18 years old. Those skills will help her compete at a national level.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Practicing these difficult jumps means Alexandra falls “a lot.” But, she says, “skating teaches me to be resilient and to not stop trying.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Who knows, someday Riley and Alexandra may compete in the Nationals or even the Olympics. Until then, they will be happy feeling like they are flying and being free.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>How Virginia’s I-95 fiasco led to a 93-year-old driver’s 39-hour odyssey</h1></div>
<h2>James Murphy got trapped on an icy Interstate 95 and then got lost. A radio reporter, travel planner, police officer and hotel workers helped him on his way.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Katherine Shaver</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:17 p.m. EST|Updated today at 7:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Murphy left Albany, N.Y., about 8:30 a.m. Monday. He didn’t get to sleep again — or eat another meal following a brief Monday lunch break — until almost 11 p.m. Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If not for a half-dozen people who went above and beyond,” Kathleen said Wednesday, “he’d probably still be sleeping in his car.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>I-95 reopens in Virginia after snowstorm forced closure that stranded hundreds of motorists</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s 93,” she said, “but good Lord, we can’t stop him.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While heading through Northern Virginia on I-95 in the early evening, her father later recounted, he suddenly hit a wall of traffic that would eventually stretch for miles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He wouldn’t budge for another 17 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was nowhere to go,” he said. “All I could do was sit there and try to stay warm.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Was he ever bored? Tired? Hungry?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yes,” he said. “But there’s nothing you can do about it, so you just put up with it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In all the hours that she checked in by phone, Kathleen said, “he never complained, not once.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was very, very worried,” Kathleen said. “My dad is a very strong, smart and stable guy, but it was alarming for me. He’s 93. He’s my person in the world.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Calls grow for examination of how Virginia handled a snowstorm that paralyzed I-95</p></div>
<div><div><p>With her father still stuck early Tuesday morning, Kathleen emailed the radio station’s traffic tip line. She was surprised when traffic reporter Mary DePompa wrote back, saying she wanted to help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DePompa said later it was the worst meltdown she’d seen in 20 years of traffic reporting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We began to feel like a crisis help line,” DePompa said. Unable to tell motorists when the standstill would end, she said, “I just let people talk. … It was awful.”</p></div></div>
<p>When Kathleen’s email said her father was 93 and stranded in the cold alone, “I thought, ‘I’ve got to help her,’” DePompa said. “Put yourself in her shoes. Could you imagine if that was your dad?”</p>
<div><div><p>DePompa suggested Kathleen direct her father to a gas station or church for assistance after he got off the highway. She tried to help determine his exact location and plot routes around the mess.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Timeline: How a snowstorm brought I-95 to a standstill for 48 miles</p></div>
<div><div><p>Angela Stott, branch manager at Murphy’s home AAA office in Albany, said she understood the frantic tone in Kathleen’s voice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The first thing I thought of was what if this was my father,” Stott said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stott’s colleague eventually found a hotel room at a conference center in Warrenton, Va., while Stott studied mapping software for the best route.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Murphy was on the phone with Kathleen, Howser said, and “just seemed done.” He said he’d been stuck on I-95 “forever” and was trying to reach his hotel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My heart went out to him,” Howser said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re 93 or 25. It’s terrible to be in your car for so long with no resources.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By Wednesday afternoon, he was nearing Charlotte. Traffic had slowed to a crawl again, but he didn’t seem to mind. He arrived at his destination Thursday evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The weather is nice here,” he said while in North Carolina. “I’m doing fine.”</p></div></div>

<h3>Fu Manchu and the Asian ‘threat’</h3>

<p>Fu Manchu, with his sinister nature and goal of conquering the world, ticked all the propaganda boxes.</p>

<p>“She knew that I was a Black man going to march for people who looked like me, but she just didn’t want me to get hurt,” he said. “She didn’t like the Black men being killed. She didn’t want that to be me.”</p>

<div><div><p>The relegation of musicians of color to separate categories is not a new problem in the U.S. music industry, said Youngdae Kim, who has taught classes on pop music at the University of Washington and Lewis Clark College.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Instead of walking down the aisle, I booked a one-way trip to Hong Kong. It all happened when I got a job offer the day before my fiance and I were supposed to sign the contract for our wedding venue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I come from a long line of women who stayed home to take care of their families. My great-grandmother had her feet bound, and my grandmother attended charm school — all to be good Chinese wives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All those plans were scrapped when Hong Kong came along.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So we found a compromise: We’d stay together but wouldn’t do long-distance for more than two years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After a year and a half apart, for the first time in my life, I prioritized a guy over a job and decided to move back. I couldn’t afford to lose him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Right after I moved to Florida to be with him, I called our wedding venue. They had dates available right away, so instead of waiting again, we would do it, even though we had only three months to resume planning.</p></div></div>

<div><div>Thousands who ‘followed the rules’ are getting covid. They shouldn’t be ashamed.</div></div>
<div><p>The pandemic proves we all should know ‘psychological first aid.’ Here are the basics.</p></div>
<a>Asian American Psychological Association</a>, and it can be difficult to find Asian therapists in some areas of the country, especially the South.
<div><p>Asian Americans see shooting as a culmination of a year of racism</p></div>
<a>2020</a>, the percentage had grown to more than 86 percent. And the
<a> Census Bureau</a> found that in June, during the height of the racial protests, Asian Americans with symptoms of anxiety or depression increased from 28 to 34 percent, a spike that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.
<a>American Psychiatric Association</a>.
<div><div><p>This study cites “feelings of shame, stigmatization, and an unwillingness to burden others” as reasons Asian immigrants and Asian Americans did not seek out therapy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Nobody came, nobody helped’: Fears of anti-Asian violence rattle the community</p></div>
<a>Hollaback</a>, an anti-harassment nonprofit, teamed up with
<a>Asian Mental Health Collective</a>, a nonprofit that seeks to bridge the gap between the Asian community and such resources, created a database of Asian therapists. New grass-roots organization
<a>Stand With Asians</a> recently held a discussion on the new social media platform, Clubhouse, asking community members to take off from work on Friday in solidarity. And the
<a>Asian Mental Health Project</a> has been hosting Instagram Live sessions, including one after the shootings that addressed how to cope with the trauma of hypersexualization in the Asian American experience.
<div><p>It’s race, class and gender together’: Why the Atlanta killings aren’t just about one thing</p></div>
<p>With all of this “ugliness right now,” said Hsu from the <a>Asian American Psychological Association</a>, it’s important for Asians to take steps to feel more in control, whether they’re ready to seek therapy or not. </p>
<div><div><p>She advised turning off the news, getting more sleep and spending more time with family. Another important step is to grant oneself or others the permission to process feelings of trauma. </p></div></div>
<p>When a community feels threatened and under siege, said Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University professor and one of the co-founders of <a>Stop AAPI Hate</a>, it often turns to what he calls the F’s: fighting, fleeing or freezing.</p>
<div><div><p> But the most important “F” that he recommends to his students is flocking to one another to share what they’re feeling. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Storytelling has power,” said Cheah. “It emboldens others to share their stories as well,” she added.</p></div></div>
<p> Sharing her story is what especially helped Kim, the social worker from South Korea. Although she grew up in a culture that did not promote speaking out, she said, the candid conversations she had with her friends were a source of relief.</p>
<div><div><p>It’s created a “ripple effect,” she said. “When we’re able to have this conversation with one person, it gives us the strength to have more.” </p></div></div>
