<div>Scarce labor is likely to squeeze U.S. business long after Covid</div>
<div>(c) 2022, Bloomberg · Jan 05, 2022 - 1:34 PM</div>
<p>What's less widely understood is that, in many industries, worker shortages will likely persist for years -- or even decades -- after Covid-19 is gone. </p>
<p>The labor force is projected to grow by just 6.5 million workers through 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's down from almost 10 million for the ten years ending in 2019, and even bigger numbers in previous decades.</p>
<p>"Call it a crisis if you will, but it's been building," says William Emmons, an economist at the St. Louis Fed. "We have a problem. Where are the workers going to come from?"</p>
<p>Similar demographics across developed economies have fueled a debate about whether decades of low inflation may go into reverse, as fewer workers enjoy more bargaining power and wages rise.</p>
<p>Businesses got a preview of the labor squeeze in late 2019 as the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%. The Fed's regional survey for November that year reported a worker shortage that "spanned most industries and skill levels."</p>
<p>Even some giant companies able to offer higher pay can see looming limits.</p>
<p>"The foundation of the economy is labor," Elon Musk said in a video interview with The Wall Street Journal Dec. 6, explaining why Tesla is working flat-out to develop robots. "There are not enough people. I cannot emphasize this enough."</p>
<p>Along with health-care and social services, as baby-boomers age, the BLS says leisure and hospitality will be the fastest-growing employer in the coming decade. </p>
<p>That means plenty more demand for workers such as Xochitl Anguiano, a Mexican immigrant who's now a legal permanent resident and a hotel guest-room attendant in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>What's more, Anguiano's family is symbolic of how many of the children of immigrants are achieving higher levels of education, meaning they're unlikely to step into their parents' jobs.</p>
<p>As a member of Culinary Workers Union Local 226, Anguiano enjoyed benefits -- from health care and pension to legal assistance with immigration issues -- that helped her focus on family life and her children's education. </p>
<p>Now, one of her daughters has a degree in biology from the University of Nevada, and plans to take medical-school entrance exams in March, while another is finishing up a business degree at the same university.</p>
<p>Slowing labor-force growth means companies will have to reorient their hiring for just about every profession, looking for candidates from different types of schools and family backgrounds than they are accustomed to. </p>
<p>There's a lot of work to do on that front, says Jacob Martinez, founder of Digital NEST in California, which seeks to help people from rural areas find work in technology and similar industries.</p>
<p>"I can't get to the heads of Google and Twitter," Martinez says. "They are working with big universities as they look for talent."</p>
<p>Business groups point to the need for more labor from outside the country, to work the kind of jobs Anguiano has.</p>
<p>"Hotels have always been a major employer of immigrants," says Curt Cashour, vice president of media relations at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. "Our current immigration system is not working."</p>
<p>Such conditions could prevail "for some time," says Nick Bunker, North America research director for the Indeed Hiring Lab. "There's slower population growth, and we are just going to have fewer people in those younger-age cohorts."</p>
<p>What that would likely mean in practice, as it did late last decade, is that longstanding barriers to work -- from racial bias to criminal records -- melt away as companies compete to hire.</p>
<p>Kaji, the employment-agency chief, has seen some of those trends in action, with demand for semi-skilled manufacturing workers on fire. </p>
<p>Drug tests are being waived, as are conviction records, in some cases. Employees taken on as temps are getting permanent jobs within three months or less, instead of as long as nine.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h3>This tree has stood here for 500 years. Will it be sold for $17,500?</h3> By Juliet Eilperin </div> </div> </div>
<div>This tree has stood here for 500 years. Will it be sold for $17,500?</div>
<p>This mammoth tree plays an outsize role in the Tongass National Forest, which holds the equivalent of 9.9 billion tons of CO2 - nearly twice what the United States emits from burning fossil fuels each year.</p>
<p>Walking around its 15-foot-wide base, Marina Anderson, the Organized Village of Kasaan's tribal administrator, pointed out a plethora of plants her ancestors, the Haida and Tlingit peoples, have used over the centuries.</p>
<p>The spruce's fortunes as ever, are bound in the politics of timber and climate change thousands of miles away in Washington, D.C. Its blue death mark might as well be a question mark: Is this tree worth more to us alive? Or dead?</p>
<p>Anderson knows what her answer is.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 282 parts per million.</p>
<p>When the United States bought Alaska from Russia on Oct. 18, 1867 - over the objections of the Tlingit - it had more to do with asserting U.S. influence in the Pacific than commandeering the riches of its forests.</p>
<p>Soon enough, officials such as J.W. White, a captain in the U.S. Revenue-Marine Service, began to eye Alaska's trees, writing in 1876, "When the forests of Oregon and Washington are gone, Alaska will be our permanent supply."</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 315 parts per million.</p>
<p>To harvest big trees more easily, however, the government had to build roads across Prince of Wales. In the mid-1960s it constructed one about 200 yards away from the old spruce, paving it with shot rock from a quarry.</p>
<p>For companies seeking to supply the growing market for paper and for rayon, made from cellulose, these large trees were ideal.</p>
<p>And Alaska Native corporations, the companies established in 1971 after receiving a small portion of their original homelands, also chopped down old growth. Within three decades, just a fraction still stood.</p>
<p>Michael Kampnich, who grew up in dairy country in Upstate New York, found work as "a feller" in 1980 on Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>"I was 21, and single and this sounded like a terrific adventure," recalled Kampnich, 62. "I just fell in love with the place. I loved working in the woods. I still look back on those days fondly. It was kind of an exciting time."</p>
<p>"You've got a few of these dominant spruce that were, eight, nine feet. I cut a few like that. You know, it was a thrill to cut timber, especially big trees. It's challenging. It's very hard work. There's a fairly high degree of danger to it."</p>
<p>But others kept coming, especially as logging became more difficult in the Pacific Northwest. Keith Landers had worked in Oregon for two decades, taking the leftover timber for shingles, but the old growth was running out.</p>
<p>"It has to be old timber," he explained. "I mean, we can cut second growth, but the people on the other end are not going to like it. It's just not going to last."</p>
<p>Landers was undeterred. He heard about a small mill for sale near Thorne Bay, and in 1994 decided it was time to move.</p>
<p>Public officials made it clear that they wanted loggers like Landers to reap the island's bounty. A few years after his arrival, they paved the road running past the massive spruce to make it even easier to transport the giant logs.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know what Ted Stevens is worried about," the president remarked.</p>
<p>Barack Obama's administration tried to forge a compromise, to shift over time to logging "young-growth" trees that were half-a-century old. But once Donald Trump was elected, it was clear the plan would be scrapped.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 405 parts per million. And the spruce on Prince of Wales faced the prospect of the ax once more.</p>
<p>Marina Anderson's father made his living off logging. The family's native corporation, Shaan Seet, clear-cut much of the old growth on its land before she was born, and her dad helped build many of the roads crisscrossing Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>By the time Jimmy Anderson died in 2014, attitudes about logging had begun to change. Marina emerged as the one who would uphold her family's Haida and Tlingit traditions, reviving a way of life.</p>
<p>"It's so hot," she groused, twisting her long auburn hair into a bun and placing a broad-brimmed cedar hat atop her head.</p>
<p>"Kinda stinky, right?" she asked, smiling before ripping it out of the earth to show them the small grains sticking to the roots. "You see that? It's all rice. We all know how much of a bummer it is if you've got fish and no rice."</p>
<p>Walking through the forest, Anderson stopped to marvel at the power of old growth, the ancient trees above her, the rich and spongy ground beneath her feet.</p>
<p>The notion of cutting them down for high-end houses infuriates her.</p>
<p>"We have to stop," she said. "There is not enough left for everybody, and we're not going to let any go."</p>
<p>Her friend and colleague, wood carver Michael Chilton, hovered so closely to watch as his father carved wood that it amounted to an implicit ultimatum: "It was either teach me, or I'll get myself cut."</p>
<p>Chilton, now 30, began carving at the age of nine. His dad, now 56, had done the same, pestering his uncles as a kid in Juneau to teach him even the basics of the craft.</p>
<p>A tattoo on her rib cage captures one of her father's favorite sayings: "Being Haida is not about the things that you do. Being Haida is about the way you do things."</p>
<p>This is the sort of small-scale employment that Meredith Trainor, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, sees as sustaining the shift away from logging.</p>
<p>"The answer is that it's many things that get stitched together," Trainor said. "And that makes us safer."</p>
<p>"Some of what they were saying, I saw it happening," he said. "The conservationists were right."</p>
<p>Kampnich knows that on Prince of Wales, many people are wary of stopping logging altogether. But he thinks there is room for small operators like Landers to stay in business.</p>
<p>"Viking is a big supporter of the city of Craig," he reminded them. "We provide them with heat for their middle school, and elementary and swimming pool. The reason we can do that is because we've got a high-value log."</p>
<p>"You don't force business into doing something different because it's socially unacceptable," Dahlstrom argued.</p>
<p>But when Joe Biden won the presidency in November, it was clear the roadless rule would be back. And Forest Service officials on the ground, for their part, are exploring what the agency can do to support the economy beyond holding timber sales.</p>
<p>"They just see the timber," she said. "They don't see all the other projects."</p>
<p>"In a climate emergency, you want to hold onto that carbon, you don't want to put it into the atmosphere," DellaSala said. "You want to absorb it, but you want to hold onto it as well."</p>
<p>The enormity of the moment stunned her. Alaska's ancient trees would be spared. And she rejoiced.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 412.5 parts per million and rising.</p>
<p>Several miles away, the battered crown of the spruce towered over the landscape. The blue death mark remained, but under the new policy, the timber sale that signaled its demise was canceled.</p>
<p>The venerable tree was safe. For now.</p>

<p>The United States is on the verge of a major achievement, one that almost no one seems to have noticed.</p>
<p>The United States, despite its exceptional wealth, has remained an outlier. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>Was this all a bit kludgy? Sure. But the law did massively expand access to health care.</p>
<p>Enter the Build Back Better bill, which has the potential to finally complete the unfinished business of Obamacare.</p>
<p>I say "virtually" universal because, unfortunately, some people would remain uninsured.</p>
<p>So, this bill still wouldn't represent the same permanent, moral commitment to health care as a human right that other countries have already delivered. But even if our achievement is temporary, it's still worth highlighting and celebrating.</p>
<p>Assuming Democrats can get their act together and pass the darn bill, that is.</p>

<div><h1>Biden campaigns from his basement. Harding ran for president from his porch.</h1></div>
<h2>In 1920, thousands flocked to Warren Harding’s home in Marion, Ohio, to hear him speak.</h2>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ronald G. Shafer</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 3, 2020</div></div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ronald G. Shafer</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 3, 2020</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you want to be elected, stay at home during the campaign,” a U.S. senator from Colorado joked to the presidential candidate.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Live from his basement, Joe Biden pushes for visibility as Democrats worry</p></div>
<div><p>As impeachment hung over a president’s head, he went on a wild rally tour</p></div>
<div><div><p>Harding’s campaign theme was “a return to normalcy” after the turmoil of World War I and the <a>1918 flu pandemic</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead of going to the people, he had the people come to the large, curving front porch of his wood-frame house in Marion, a town of about 30,000 residents.</p></div></div>
<p>At the first gathering in mid-July, an airplane flew over the house and dropped a floral wreath. Harding gave a speech calling for unity. A headline in one Montana newspaper declared: “On Front Porch, Harding Voices His Platitudes.”</p>
<div><div><p>Later, Harding made news by promising to create a Department of Public Welfare. He hinted that he would name a woman to the Cabinet post. He called for “equal pay for equal work.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another day five delegations of “Negro Republicans,” including several Baptist ministers, came to the porch. The visitors pleaded for an end to lynching.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why Congress failed nearly 200 times to make lynching a federal crime</p></div>
<div><div><p>The affable Harding and his wife, Florence, eagerly shook hands. Florence Harding, known as “the Duchess,” posed for an estimated 10,000 photographs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meantime, Harding’s Democratic rival, Ohio Gov. James Cox, was campaigning by train in 36 of the 48 states. Cox was the publisher of the Dayton Daily News, and his running mate was New York’s Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Harding left his front porch on occasion, speaking in 16 towns in Iowa and Nebraska. In Des Moines, he declared his view on the League of Nations: “I favor staying out.” His policy, he said, was “America first.”</p></div>
<p>By October, Harding was far in the lead. His front-porch campaign had drawn more than 600,000 people. He eventually went on a two-week speaking tour to the South and New York and through Ohio to help Republican House and Senate candidates.</p>
<div><div><p>There was one more speech in Marion on Nov. 5, when thousands of supporters stormed the Harding porch to celebrate the senator’s landslide victory.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harding didn’t make it to the end of his first term. In the summer of 1923, after a bout of flu, the president took a cross-country train trip. On Aug. 2 in San Francisco, he died after a heart attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harding’s legacy was tarnished by scandal following his death. In 1927, it was ruled that his interior secretary secretly sold drilling rights to federal oil wells in Teapot Dome, Wyo., to private oil interests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>In 1918, the Spanish flu infected the White House. Even President Wilson got sick.</a></p></div></div>

<div><p>Long Island, Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts will probably see a few hours of heavy snow, with the Cape and Islands under the heaviest band for at least three or four hours while it pivots offshore on Friday afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Timing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Interstate 68 corridor in the Panhandle of Maryland could see snow as early as 8 p.m. Thursday. The snow will reach the D.C. to Baltimore stretch shortly after midnight.</p></div></div>
<p>Philadelphia should see snow around 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, reaching New York City and overspreading the Long Island Expressway around 5 a.m. From there it expands into southern New England, the heaviest coinciding with the time of the morning commute.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Totals</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The storm will continue out to sea over the weekend, explosively intensifying southeast of Greenland with an air pressure rivaling that of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>The Republican president who called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre</h1></div>
<h2>Warren G. Harding’s comments about race and equality were remarkable for 1921</h2>

<div><div><p>He would use that moment in 1921 to seek healing and harmony — and several months later in Alabama, he would go much further with daring remarks about equality.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That was how a Republican president addressed racially fraught events nearly a century ago.</p></div></div>
<p>“Despite the demagogues, the idea of our oneness as Americans has risen superior to every appeal to mere class and group,” Harding declared. “And so, I wish it might be in this matter of our national problem of races.”</p>

<div><div><p>Then he turned to two of the day’s most controversial subjects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He also spoke briefly about Tulsa and offered up a simple prayer: “God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fact that Harding chose a black university to make his only comments about the catastrophe spoke volumes about his intentions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After he concluded, eyewitnesses reported, he congratulated every graduate individually “and shook hands with each one of them.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>That fall Harding became the first president to go into the Deep South since the Civil War. And in a speech that the city of Birmingham, Ala., thought would help celebrate its semicentennial, he instead <a>veered</a> dramatically.</p></div>
<p>Half of his audience erupted in cheers. The other half was thunderstruck. Some whites openly booed and hissed. A Mississippi congressman in attendance denounced Harding’s words as “a blow to the white civilization of America.”</p>

<div><div><p>History buffs and moviegoers may recall that this house in the District’s Kalorama neighborhood played a role in the formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p></div></div>
<p>Randall H. Hagner, a Washington real estate developer, built the house in 1915. He hired architect Clarke Waggaman to design it and S.H. Edmonston Co. to build it. Waggaman’s drawings of the house are on file at the Library of Congress.</p>
<div><p>The first owner is believed to have been A. Mitchell Palmer, who was appointed U.S. attorney general by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. Palmer is best known for overseeing the Palmer Raids during the Red Scare of 1919 and 1920.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Followers of the Italian anarchist Luigi Galleani, who advocated murdering government leaders to provoke an anti-capitalist revolution, began a bombing campaign after World War I. Palmer was the target of at least two bombs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The house had a star turn in the 2011 movie “J. Edgar.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Palmer sold the house in 1924 to Edith S. Vanderbilt, widow of George Vanderbilt, who built Biltmore House in North Carolina. Anthony Muto, the Washington representative for 20th Century Fox and Fox Movietone News, bought it in 1944.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Gladstone Williams, a newspaper columnist known as the “master of prophecy” for his accurate election predictions, bought the house in 1960. His widow remained there until her death in 1993.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Hickory said he bought the house not because of its history but because it had the ideal layout for his purposes. He wanted to run his orthodontics practice out of the first floor and live on the upper levels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is kind of a European-style house, where the ground floor is not the main floor,” Hickory said. “It was really ideal for a home office.”</p></div></div>
<p>It took him 3½ years to renovate the house with the help of architect Don Hawkins, who preserved many of its historical features. One of the challenges Hawkins faced was relocating the kitchen from the first floor to the second floor.</p>
<div><div><p>“He came up with the idea of that counter to extend the kitchen area but preserve the overall look of that room,” Hickory said. “For entertaining, it’s amazing.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The six-bedroom, eight-bathroom, 8,000-square-foot house has a “diplomatic overlay,” a zoning provision that allows it to be used as an embassy. It is listed at just under $5 million.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The results appear to have flipped some judges’ sentencing tendencies, given their backgrounds. Chutkan is a former public defender, and McFadden is a former Justice Department official, prosecutor and police officer.</p></div></div>
<div><p>When prosecutors asked for a two-month home confinement sentence for a defendant from Oklahoma<b> </b>who climbed into the Capitol through a broken window and pleaded guilty to parading, McFadden instead gave her two months of probation.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think the U.S. attorney would have more credibility,” McFadden said, “if it was evenhanded in its concern about riots and mobs in this city.”</p></div></div>
<p>Chutkan stands out in exceeding government requests in seven of her eight cases so far, sentencing defendants who pleaded guilty to unlawful parading to prison terms of 14 to 45 days — above prosecutors’ requests for no time or 30 days.</p>
<div><div><p>“There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said in an October sentencing.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>judges Royce C. Lamberth and Reggie Walton, both Republican appointees, have repeatedly sentenced below government recommendations in misdemeanor cases.

<div><div><p>“I hope others will follow your lead,” he said, in giving the man three months of home detention — a month shy of the government request.</p></div></div>
<p>Howell said that was why she rejected government requests for two to 12 weeks of jail time for four defendants in lieu of two to three years of probation. For one, she added two weeks of detention in a halfway house to get around the restriction.</p>
<div><div><p>As Howell has, Jackson chose to give him home detention and probation instead of the two months in jail sought by prosecutors, in part because he had started going to therapy, stopped using drugs and started a new job.</p></div></div>
