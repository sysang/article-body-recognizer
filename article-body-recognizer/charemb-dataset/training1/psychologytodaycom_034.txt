<h2> Being immersed in a virtual world can help you master CBT techniques. </h2>
<li>A newly approved virtual reality device is designed to boost cognitive behavioral therapy.</li>
<li>All pain is processed in the brain. The brain can also release its own painkillers, including endorphins and adrenaline.</li>

<p>Do you have lingering pain in your lower back? You’re hardly alone. About a quarter of Americans had low back pain in the last three months. If it lasts for that long, your pain may be diagnosed as chronic.</p>
<p><a>Cognitive-behavioral</a> <a>therapy</a> (CBT), training to change your emotions and thoughts about pain, may help you keep moving and cut your pain. </p>
<h3>How the new device works</h3>
<p>The device gives you physical feedback as you learn and practice various principles of CBT over 8 weeks. Each of 56 sessions is 2-16 minutes in length.</p>
<p>The results: In the study that convinced the FDA, almost half of the participants using EaseVRx reported that their pain had dropped by more than half, compared to only a quarter of a control group that didn't use the device.</p>

<h1> Chronic Pain: A Sore Subject </h1>
<h2> Five myths about pain that can be difficult to confront. </h2>
<li>Care for chronic pain continues to evolve, but it is slowed down by persistent myths.</li>
<li>Five of the most stubborn myths about pain should be called into question for further examination. </li>
<li>The reasons we defend these failed ideas include trying to validate our pain experience and control what feels unmanageable. </li>
<a>anger</a>, leading to resentment and broken relationships that, in turn, can increase pain.
<h3>Myth #1: Objectively measuring pain would help me. </h3>
<p>Alterative: Trust that the sensation is real and no further evidence is needed. Ask, how can I support my healing experience on all levels? Open to how you can shift your relationship to pain so that it is not the enemy. </p>
<h3>Myth #2: Others need to understand the considerable pain I am in. </h3>
<p>This myth maintains that in order for our situation to improve, we need others to know how bad it really is. Can others know, and do they really need to? </p>
<p>Alternative: Validate your own experience with unconditional kindness. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Pain is like a finger trap: you can move most freely when you stop struggling.</div> <div>Source: Victor Moussa/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Myth #3: I need my pain to go away before I can live my life the way I want to. The only other alternative is to push through.</h3>
<p>Alternative: Meet Life on Life's terms. The pain is here now, I will neither pull it toward me or push it away. Ask, how can I work with it as is?</p>
<h3>Myth #4: If I am still hurting, I must be doing something wrong. </h3>
<p>Alternative: Stick with a healthy routine that is simple and flexible, letting go of pain as a measuring stick.</p>
<h3>Myth #5: Pain is a personal problem. </h3>

<h1> Differentiating Fibromyalgia, Depression, and CFS </h1>
<h2> Understanding the relationship between chronic invisible illnesses. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Depression? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome depression</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic and widespread pain and tenderness throughout the body. </li>
<li>The overall stress of living with an invisible chronic illness such as fibromyalgia can take a toll on an individual’s mood and add to anger. </li>
<li> Neuroticism, which is often seen in individuals with fibromyalgia, is also known to play a role in developing depression. </li>
<h3>The relationship between chronic fatigue syndrome and depression</h3>
<li>Difficulty with <a>memory</a>, focus, and <a>concentration</a></li>
<li>Dizziness that worsens with moving from <a>lying</a> down or sitting to standing</li>
<li>Unexplained muscle/joint pain</li>
<h3>Is there a connection between fibromyalgia and depression?</h3>
<a>chronic pain</a> and tenderness often result in reduced physical activity, leading to isolation and social withdrawal. Chronic fatigue is also a symptom of fibromyalgia, which can negatively affect an individual’s mood over time. The overall
<a>stress</a> of living with an invisible
<a>chronic illness</a> such as fibromyalgia can take a toll on an individual’s mood and add to
<a>neuroticism</a>, which is often seen in individuals with fibromyalgia, is also known to play a role in developing depression.
<h3>Common signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia and depression</h3>
<p>Psychological stressors may trigger episodes of either depression or fibromyalgia, and there are several symptoms common to both disorders that are listed below:</p>
<ul><li>Fatigue/decreased energy</li> <li>Loss of <a>appetite</a></li> <li>Difficulty concentrating</li> <li>Memory impairment</li> <li><a>Insomnia</a></li> </ul>
<h3>Treatment modalities for fibromyalgia and depression</h3>
<a>Antidepressants</a>, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are often used to treat fibromyalgia symptoms, with or without the presence of depression.

<p>Chronic pain is a rare condition with the ability to disrupt ALL levels of Maslow’s hierarchy. Beyond the unpleasant experience of pain itself, consider some of the ways that chronic pain affects our human needs:</p>
<li>Pain limits our ability to maintain our family roles as breadwinners, parents, and spouses. <a>Guilt</a> is a common experience among patients with chronic pain when they feel inadequate as parents or romantic partners.</li>
<li>Pain increases our dependence on others. Over time, many patients with chronic pain come to feel like burdens.</li>
<li>Pain creates uncertainty about the future, upsetting financial stability and future goals. Anxiety and <a>fear</a> are the most common emotional responses to chronic pain.</li>
<li>Pain harms relationships with family, friends, and work. Patients with chronic pain frequently become isolated and disconnected from others.</li>
<li>Pain often steals sources of <a>happiness</a>, contribution, and achievement as a patient’s ability to engage in hobbies, work, and recreational activities is reduced.</li>
<p>The result is that chronic pain adds many sources of stress—while simultaneously subtracting many of our sources of reward and meaning.</p>

<a>fear</a> of causing more pain. Over the long term, that just means more pain, unfortunately.
<p>1. Create SMART <a>goals</a> for yourself.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these types of questions to help you think through the steps you need to take. It's hard to move past your chronic pain if you don't know where you're headed, so make a SMART goal for yourself. </p>
<p>2. Exercise, but pace yourself.</p>
<p>PS—Don't forget, exercise improves your mood!</p>
<p>I know: It's easier said than done. But people with chronic pain often live in a perpetual "fight or flight" state, where their bodies are tense. The tension actually creates more pain, so learning relaxation tools can be really helpful.</p>
<p>I recommend downloading some <a>meditation</a> apps on your phone and using them once per day. My personal favorite is Insight Timer. It has thousands of free meditations. Check out some focusing on progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery. </p>

<a>optimism</a>: Research confirms that we can exert some control over pain by taking charge of emotions, thoughts, beliefs, attentional processes and coping behaviors using treatments like
<a>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT), biofeedback, and
<a>Mindfulness</a>-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) (Cherkin et al, 2016; Kerns et al, 2011; Nahin et al, 2016; Sturgeon, 2014). These interventions have a robust evidence-base that grows every day. Additionally, providing patients with pain
<a>education</a> may reduce pain and disability, increasing understanding of pain while reducing fear of movement and activity-avoidance (Louw et al., 2013; Louw et al., 2016).
<p>Knowledge is power. Let’s empower our patients—and each other—to find integrative solutions that work.</p>

<a>chronic pain</a> is that the extra mass or amount of tissue on your body puts a heavier load on your bones and joints.
<p>Just like an overloaded piece of equipment, your joints can start breaking down faster than normal. They might change shape or rub on each other in ways that cause pain. You might also stand, sit or walk differently.</p>
<p>If you have obesity, your body has many fat cells. These cells are active, releasing substances that cause a constant, low level of inflammation in your body. This contributes to chronic pain and <a>high blood pressure</a>.</p>
<p>Weight Loss Reduces Chronic Pain</p>
<a>eating foods that stop inflammation </a>can also reduce obesity, so your body becomes healthier over time.
<p>Learning your BMI can also help. Determining your BMI is important to see if you are at a healthy weight. The easiest way is to find a <a>BMI calculator</a>. You will need to know your height and weight.</p>
<p>Maintaining a Positive Perspective</p>

<a>attention</a> to people who meet very specific standards of beauty. This usually includes being thin or skinny (underweight).

<h1> The Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Pain </h1>
<h2> Effective, non-opioid treatment for chronic pain exists. </h2>
<p> Posted December 9, 2018 </p>
<a>American Pain Society</a>, the
<a>American Chronic Pain Association</a>, the
<a>American Academy of Pain Medicine</a>, and many others, there has been no consistent recommendation for treating
<a>chronic pain</a>. Compounding the problem, because clinicians are untrained in pain
<a>management</a>, opioids have become the major approach by default. Opioids, however, are ineffective in chronic pain, often fraught with harmful and sometimes deadly side effects (1).

<h2> What is the role of genetics in depression? </h2>
<h2> Can genes for depression be modified? </h2>
<a>the nutritional supplement SAM-e</a>, a synthetic version of a compound found in the body, contains a substance that chemically augments the activation and deactivation of genes. Some studies show it is effective against symptoms of depression.
<h2> What happens in the brain with depression? </h2>
<p>Reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, which interprets and regulates emotional signals coming from the amygdala, accounts for the difficulties in decision-making and the cognitive fog that depressed people experience.</p>
<h2> How does lack of sleep alter brain function? </h2>
<a>sleep deprivation makes people emotionally reactive</a>, increasing activity in the amygdala and decreasing it in the emotion regulation center of the prefrontal cortex. Sleep deprivation impairs the brain’s ability to control negative thoughts.
<h2> How does the brain regulate mood? </h2>
<p>Under normal conditions, moods are relatively stable. But the persistence of negative mood in major depression suggests something is amiss in the nerve pathways between the amygdala and cortex.</p>
<a>the sleep-wake cycle</a>. Disturbances in biological rhythms are known to disrupt mood, and studies of depressed patients find that they exhibit abnormal patterns of many body functions, from temperature regulation to hormone secretion.
<h2> What role does serotonin play in depression? </h2>
<a>mediates many mental capacities important in social life</a>.
<h2> Does dopamine play a role in depression? </h2>
<a>implicated in depression</a>. It is associated with two of the most prominent features of depression—anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure, and appetite alterations.
<h2> How does nerve cell communication go awry in depression? </h2>
<a>The prolonged or excessive release of stress hormones</a> can lead to a failure of activation of key nodes in neural networks or impair the strength of signals between them, especially when processing emotion-related or reward stimuli.
<p>It’s important that depression is now seen as a nerve circuit disorder, because that influences the search for effective treatments.</p>
<h2> How does stress affect the brain? </h2>
<a>can disrupt many aspects of brain function and lead to depression</a>.
<h2> How does childhood stress affect adult brain function? </h2>
<p>Nevertheless, adult brains retain the capacity for neuroplasticity. Although it takes effort, and often the guidance of psychotherapy, people can learn to overcome many of the ill effects of early adversity.</p>
<h2> What areas of the brain play a role in depression? </h2>
<a>the amygdala,</a> which flags emotion-related stimuli; the prefrontal cortex, which analyzes and interprets experience, modulates emotional reactivity, and controls attention; and the two-way network of nerve fibers that connect them.
<h2> What does brain imaging look at in depression? </h2>
<a>whether and where there are problems in the way the brain processes specific types of information</a>.
<h2> How does depresson itself change the brain? </h2>
<a>changes in the network of brain areas involved in processing physical pain</a>, and the degree of hyperactivity in such areas as seen on brain scans correlates with the severity of depression that patients experience.
<p>Recent studies show that like other neurodegenerative conditions, longstanding depression <a>increases levels of inflammatory substances in the brain that further impair its function</a>, affecting many brain regions and circuits of connectivity.</p>
