<p>With the rise of racially charged police shootings seen over the past few years, the call for Crump's services has also been on the rise.</p>
<p>Crump, 52, obtained his law degree at Florida State University. After a number of years of practicing, Crump's notoriety increased in 2012 when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a neighborhood watch coordinator.</p>
<p>After continuing to take on more civil rights lawsuits throughout the decade, Crump cemented his place on the national stage in 2020, when he represented the families of numerous high-profile victims of police violence.</p>
<a>George Floyd</a>, who was murdered by Minneapolis police officer
<a>Derek Chauvin</a> in May 2020 after he knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin's murder conviction and subsequent sentencing became a catalyst for continuing racial justice reform across the U.S.
<p>Beyond Floyd's case, Crump also represented the family of <a>Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot and killed in her Kentucky apartment by Louisville police officers who forced entry into her residence during a drug investigation.</p>
<a>Jacob Blake</a>, another case that Crump represented. Blake was shot in the back by Kenosha police while attempting to climb into his girlfriend's car, and although Blake survived the shooting, the officer who shot him was not charged.
<p>While some on social media have characterized Crump as an opportunist, simply taking high-profile cases whenever he can, the critics have not stopped the attorney from continuing to represent grieving families.</p>
<a>Daunte Wright</a>, who was shot and killed by Minneapolis police officer Kim Potter after she said she mistook her gun for her taser. Potter was convicted of first- and second-degree manslaughter earlier in December.
<p>Crump also has a number of other ongoing civil rights cases, and looks primed to remain one of America's most famous lawyers in the near future.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to Crump's office for comment.</p>

<p>The suspect in a Christmas Day double homicide of a wife and her 13-year-old disabled daughter has been shot dead by Detroit police officers.</p>
<p>Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters on Tuesday afternoon that officers had shot dead suspect <a>Dwayne McDonald</a>, 62, during an exchange of fire at an apartment in Owen Street, east of Woodward Avenue, at about 3 p.m. the same day.</p>
<p>McDonald had earlier been named as a person of interest <a>over the double homicide</a> of his wife Elaine Fizer, 57, and her disabled daughter Daunya, both of whom were shot dead at their home on Christmas Day morning.</p>
<p>White said Detroit officers arrived at the apartment to serve a search warrant. <a>McDonald then shot his gun</a> and attending officers "returned fire," according to the police chief.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media, he said: "As you can see, this is an active scene and we are still gathering information."</p>
<p>The chief said his officers were investigating "heinous acts that occurred on Christmas morning where the mother and her 13-year-old handicapped child were murdered inside of their home."</p>
<p>He later added: "The officers attempted to make access to one of the apartments where they were greeted by Mr. McDonald who was armed. A shot was fired at which time officers returned fire striking Mr. McDonald and he is deceased at the scene."</p>
<p>Following the shooting, White praised his officers: "Not the outcome we had hoped for but the officers were courageous. They've worked tirelessly for 24 hours plus since the heinous act that occurred in our city."</p>
<p>Elaine was Daunya's adoptive mother and a "caregiver" as well as a "person who loved children and loved giving back to the community," White said.</p>
<p>A GoFundMe has been set up for the mother and daughter to help their funeral costs, according to a woman called Margaret, who claimed to be Elaine's daughter.</p>
<p>On the page, she said: "Hi this is Margaret daughter of Elaine Fizer this had been [an] unfortunate situation for me that not only has my mother been taken away from me, but my sister too.</p>
<p>"I trying to raise as much money as soon as possible to help me in the process of grieving so we can have the proper burial services for my mother [and] sister."</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, the GoFundMe page had raised more than $3,000 out of a $10,000 target.</p>
<p>The homicide task force and Michigan State Police will now handle the investigation into the shooting.</p>

<p>A Tennessee man has been arrested after the body of his roommate was found in a suitcase left near a Memphis dumpster, according to police.</p>
<p>Julian Summers, 30, has been charged with second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse after the body of his roommate Bruce Jeffries, 63, was found in a suitcase on December 12, according to WREG.</p>
<p>Jeffries' body was positively identified on December 20 by police officers, the network added.</p>
<p>Officers said that when they opened the suitcase, they found that Jeffries had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
<p>According to WREG, a witness told investigators they saw Summers drag the suitcase Jeffries body was found in through an alley in Pine and Eastmoreland in Midtown at about 10 a.m. on December 12.</p>
<p>Police said the witness alleged Summer attempted to throw the suitcase in the dumpster, but that it was too heavy.</p>
<p>When the suspect noticed he had been watched, he allegedly dropped the suitcase and ran down the alley towards Union Avenue, according to the network.</p>
<p>Memphis police investigators said they found a blood trail that led to the Broad Moor apartment complex on South Cleveland.</p>
<p>Upon searching the apartment, investigators said they found signs of a struggle and blood inside, according to WREG.</p>
<p>Authorities told the network that Summers and Jeffries had been roommates for the past two years.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the Memphis Police Department for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the body of a missing pregnant woman <a>was found stuffed into a suitcase</a> in North Carolina.</p>
<p>According to warrants obtained by <a>CBS</a> 17 in February, the body found inside the suitcase near the Neuse River in Wake County was that of missing 28-year-old Brittany Smith.</p>
<p>Thomas Clayton Johnson and Emmalei Grace Trevathan were arrested by Wake County Sheriff's Office police during a traffic stop in Raleigh.</p>
<p>Both were charged with murder, murder of an unborn child and concealment of a body.</p>
<p>In September, the body of a former Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detective was found inside a California garage freezer.</p>
<p>The body of Miriam E. Travis, 87, <a>was found inside a Riverside home</a> after concerned out-of-state family members called the police when they did not hear about her for a while, according to ABC7.</p>
<p>During their search of the house, officers found Travis' body inside a freezer inside the garage.</p>
<p>Police described the home as being disheveled, similar to hoarder conditions, according to the network.</p>
<p>"They caught up to him as they saw him get into somebody's vehicle, somebody was driving into the parking lot, he jumped into the passenger side of that vehicle," Smith said.</p>
<p>Officers then approached him and saw that he had a firearm, according to Smith.</p>
<p>"Officers fired multiple rounds at the suspect, striking the suspect to protect the civilian that was still in the vehicle," Smith said.</p>
<p>The civilian ran from the vehicle as the officers "began to engage the suspect." They then took the man into custody and brought him to the medical center for treatment.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the man was attempting to steal the civilian's car, but they are still investigating for confirmation, Smith said. He added that he believes the man has a previous criminal history, but could not immediately provide specifics.</p>
<p>They are not yet sure whether the man has any connection to the apartment complex where he was detained but plan to uncover that information in their investigation.</p>
<p>Smith said that the man did not shoot at the officers first, but they opted to open fire to protect the motorist whose vehicle he entered. The civilian and all the officers involved in the encounter were unharmed.</p>
<p>Police did a sweep of the area after the incident and knocked on doors of residents to make sure that nobody else had been injured. Smith said that it is not currently known how many shots were fired during the encounter.</p>
<p>He added that the incident underlines the importance of "see something, say something," since the residents of the apartment complex notified authorities of their concerns, and officers were then able to respond quickly.</p>
<p>"This is just an unfortunate incident but it's one that we responded to in order to protect our citizens," Smith said.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.</p>
<p>Five officers who were involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>A woman was arrested in Phoenix on Sunday after allegedly running onto an airport tarmac in an attempt to halt a plane that was about to take off without her.</p>
<a>KNXV-TV</a> identified that area as the tarmac. Signs in at least two languages that warn members of the public against trespassing were visible around the area Meyers allegedly entered, according to the station.
<p>"There was no impact to airport operations," police told Newsweek.</p>
<a>KSAZ-TV</a> that showed a woman standing on the tarmac beside an airport employee who was wearing a reflective vest. The video then showed police walking out onto the tarmac toward the woman and later leading her back inside.
<p>"She decided to go out the emergency exit doors onto the tarmac and start arguing with the ground crew why she should be let onto the plane still," Jones told the station.</p>
<p>When reached for comment on Wednesday, airport officials told Newsweek they did not have any additional information about Meyers' alleged dash onto the tarmac and referred all inquiries to Phoenix police.</p>
<p>A police officer from Vicksburg, Mississippi was temporarily suspended and ordered to take an anger management class after a video surfaced of him forcefully kneeling on a man's back.</p>
<p>Officer Eddie Colbert is facing a 15-day suspension without pay and 45-day probation. He then will be required to attend the anger management classes once he returns to work, The Vicksburg Post reported.</p>
<a>Facebook</a> and shared with Jackson's
<a>16 WAPT News</a>, shows Colbert throwing the suspect, John Dolley, to the ground. After Dolley appeared to say something to him, Colbert knelt on his back as another officer handcuffed him.
<p>Dolley was charged with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace, both misdemeanors. He is currently out on bond.</p>
<a>Police</a> Department Chief Penny Jones said that Colbert's suspension was originally supposed to be with pay before being changed to unpaid.
<p>"The behavior of the officer was indefensible, in my opinion, but it did not rise to a level of termination," Flaggs said after the meeting. "There was an opportunity where [Dolley] could have been arrested way before Officer Colbert arrived."</p>
<p>The mayor urged anyone with additional video from that day to submit it to the Vicksburg Police Department, adding that the department is reviewing social media videos as well as body camera footage.</p>
<p>Flaggs said both Colbert and Dolley are Black.</p>
<p>News outlets reported Colbert was shot in the face in December 2020 while working as a security guard at a nightclub in Jackson.</p>
<p>Kristy Siple, a Georgia woman who reported her young daughter missing earlier this month, has been arrested and charged in the girl's death, Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Authorities had already charged 37-year-old Jeremy Tremaine Williams with capital murder for the 5-year-old girl's killing.</p>
<p>After Williams was arrested, a judge issued a gag order that restricts public comments on the case. Taylor did not say what events or knowledge prompted the new arrest of Siple on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement released to WRBL Tuesday night through a spokesperson, the girl's father, Corey Holland, called Siple a "monster."</p>
<p>"A real mother protects and would die for her children...My family and I will continue to wrestle with the loss of losing our angel Kamarie. We will ask that you continue to make your news about her and the justice she deserves," it added.</p>
<p>Siple was ordered to be held without bond during a hearing before Judge Walter Gray on Wednesday morning, the Ledger-Enquirer reported.</p>
<p>Taylor said additional charges against Williams are expected.</p>
<p>Court records were not available to see if Siple has an attorney.</p>
<p>Siple had told police that when she woke up at 5:50 a.m. on December 13 that her daughter was gone and the front door of their Columbus, Georgia home was open, Taylor said earlier this month.</p>
<p>A sheriff's deputy was found dead on the side of the road in Illinois on Wednesday morning and a suspect has since been taken into custody.</p>
<p>The Wayne County Sheriff's Office identified the victim as Sheriff's Deputy Sean Riley and said that he was found dead this morning after responding "to a motorist assist on Interstate 64."</p>
<p>The sheriff's office said that Deputy Riley's squad car was missing from the scene, but was eventually located "abandoned on Interstate 64," near the Indiana border.</p>
<p>The Wayne County Sheriff's Office directed Newsweek to the Facebook post after reaching out for comment.</p>
<p>Shortly after the sheriff's deputy was pronounced deceased, Indiana State <a>Police</a> Public Information Officer Sergeant Todd Ringle announced on <a>Twitter</a> that "the Wayne County Illinois murder suspect is in custody."</p>
<p>Ringle directed Newsweek to his tweets after reaching out for further comment on the arrest.</p>
<p>Before the suspect was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon, the St. Peters Police Department in Missouri said that they believed the suspect who killed Riley was involved in a carjacking and shooting incident at a QuikTrip gas station.</p>
<p>The St. Peters Police Department said that the suspect was considered armed and dangerous, and urged residents to avoid the area.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the Illinois State Police for comment.</p>
<a>court documents</a> released Wednesday.
<p>Kuachua Xiong, 25, was pulled over by a Cass County Sheriff's Department officer on December 22, according to an arrest affidavit. Xiong had been stopped after he was observed swerving in between traffic, speeding, and driving aggressively.</p>
<p>Upon an examination of Xiong's car, officers found that the vehicle appeared to be "lived in" for an apparent cross-country trip. Xiong told police that he was planning on visiting the White House to photograph the landmark.</p>
<p>When officers asked if Xiong was planning on getting a hotel room in Washington, D.C., he replied that it would "not be necessary," according to the court documents.</p>
<p>Xiong then proceeded to go on a rant to Cass County officials about an alleged sexual abuse ring being run by Democratic politicians, including President <a>Joe Biden</a>. This claim has been widely debunked as a far-right conspiracy theory.</p>
<a>Google</a> Maps app on his phone.
<p>Xiong continued by saying that he was not having suicidal tendencies, but would "act in self-defense" if necessary and had money set aside for his funeral.</p>
<p>Xiong was brought to the Cass County Sheriff's Office for an interview with the United States Secret Service (USSS).</p>
<p>During an interrogation by USSS investigators, Xiong expanded on his alleged plans. He wanted to travel to D.C. in order to "combat evil demons in the White House" and "kill persons in power," according to investigators.</p>
<p>Xiong's cell phone reportedly showed that he had multiple notes on his calendar application, including "silencer order," "save USA," and "rifle pickup."</p>
<p>Most alarming to USSS officials, however, was an alleged "hit list" compiled of videos from the social media platform TikTok. With nearly 100 videos, the list included prominent Democratic politicians and public figures.</p>
<a>Bill Clinton</a>, infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, and
<a>Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Additionally, Xiong stated that he would kill President Biden if he did not comply with his unspecified demands.
<p>The biography on Xiong's TikTok account states that "I will not let my Family be slave I ready to kill enemies who harm the USA [sic]."</p>
<p>Xiong added that if he were to be released from custody, he would simply continue on his journey towards Washington and that he planned on dying while attempting his White House invasion, according to investigators.</p>
<p>The Cass County Sheriff's Office told Newsweek that they did not have any further information on potential charges against Xiong.</p>

<p>A woman was brutally attacked and killed by her four dogs in her own California home, according to police.</p>
<p>The dogs attacked the woman, believed to be in her 20s, in Elizondo Street in the unincorporated East Valinda area of the San Gabriel Valley, at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, according to Fox11.</p>
<p>Industry Sheriff's Station Sgt. V. Munshi told the network the woman was in the backyard of her home with her son when they were both attacked.</p>
<p>He added both the mother and her child were bitten and taken to a nearby hospital where the woman was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>According to the network, the woman suffered major injuries to her head as well as one arm.</p>
<p>The woman's son was treated for his minor injuries, according to Fox11.</p>
<p>Sgt. Munshi told the network that the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Control officers took the dogs into custody.</p>
<p>He did not know what breed the dogs were and the name of the victim was not released to the public.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the Industry Sheriff's Station for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a man from Montana was found dead after he was killed by a pack of dogs, according to his family.</p>
<p>Duke Little Whirlwind, 58, was found just before noon on Sunday on a dirt road near his home in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation of Lame Deer in Rosebud County.</p>
<p>His niece, Avalee Little Whirlwind, told KRTV that her uncle had left at about 11 a.m. that morning in order to fetch a bicycle that he repaired.</p>
<p>But, Whirlwind never returned home and his body was later discovered by a neighbor.</p>
<p>In October a boy who was mauled by a dog in his backyard <a>died from his injuries, his parents said</a>.</p>
<p>James McNeelis had been playing with his new rescue dog at his home Kiefer, Oklahoma when his parents called him inside for dinner.</p>
<p>According to KJRH, the child's body was later found by his father.</p>
<p>A statement from the Creek County Sheriff's Office said the rescue dog was taken to an animal control facility and an investigation by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife indicated the child was attacked by the family dog.</p>
<p>According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, more than 4.5 million people are bitten each year in the U.S.</p>
<p>It claims almost one in five people bitten by dogs need medical attention and that children are the most common victims of dog bites and are "far more likely to be severely injured."</p>

<p>A spike in homicides and violence has caused Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf to push to stop planned cuts to the city's police department.</p>
<p>"When those messages and services are not effective ... the consequences must be swift and certain," Schaaf told reporters Monday on a Zoom call. "There is nothing progressive about unbridled gun violence."</p>
<p>This decision comes after three people were killed this weekend, making the total number of homicides this year 127.</p>
<p>Along with the shifting of funds, the Oakland City Council voted to spend $18 million of programs targeted at stopping street crime and aiding homelessness back in June.</p>
<p>Diverting funds from the police was a move many cities took after the killing of <a>George Floyd</a>, but some, like Oakland, are having to reverse it due to increased crime.</p>
<p>The Portland City Council and the mayor removed millions of dollars from the police budget in June 2020. However, the council recently passed a budget increase that added $5.2 million to the $230 million budget allotted for police.</p>
<a>Black Lives Matter</a> protests and have a long history with police brutality, to increase their police budgets, as well.
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. </p>
<p>Schaaf said efforts to shift lower-level policing to other departments and efforts aimed at diverting those convicted to other services have not been enough.</p>
<p>Police staffing has also fallen one officer below a 2014 voter-approved measure that requires the police department to have at least 678 sworn officers on staff. Schaaf said the department will boost its recruiting efforts.</p>
<p>That measure requires the city to have at least 678 officers to access funding from a parcel tax.</p>
<p>The union that represents Oakland police called the dwindling number of officers "yet another broken promise to Oakland residents by the "defund-the-police" majority on city council."</p>
<a>killed by a stray bullet on an Oakland freeway</a> while he slept in his car seat as his mother drove on a Saturday afternoon. Officials say the vehicle likely got caught in the crossfire of two vehicles exchanging gunfire.
<p>Oakland <a>Police</a> Chief LeRonne Armstrong said in a news conference last week that the police department needs help and asked city council members to "step up" and put aside their political differences to address crime, KPIX-TV reported.</p>
<p>Update (12/01, 5:11 PM): This story's headline and opening graph were changed to better reflect the circumstances around funding for police and the mayor's role in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Minneapolis' first Black police chief, Medaria Arradondo, announced he will retire next month after more than three decades with the department.</p>
<p>On Monday, Arradondo, who notably led the department during the tumultuous year in the wake of George Floyd's death, announced he would not seek a third term as Minneapolis' top officer when his current term expires in mid-January.</p>
<p>"After 32 years of service, I believe that now is the right time to allow for new leadership, new perspective, new focus and new hope to lead the department forward in collaboration with our communities," Arradondo said at a news conference.</p>
<p>"This, at the end of the day, is what I feel is best for the department as well as my personal well-being," he added.</p>
<a>Police</a> Officer Mohamed Noor after she called 911 to report a possible assault behind her home.
<a>Derek Chauvin</a>, who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was convicted of murder and sentenced to over 20 years in prison.
<p>Arradondo guided the Minneapolis Police Department as Floyd's death and the city of Minneapolis became the focal point of a nationwide rallying call to end police brutality and demand racial justice.</p>
<p>The city saw weeks of unrest as thousands flooded to Minnesota's most populous city to protest the events of May 25, 2020.</p>
<p>Over the last year, the city's police department has seen hundreds of officers leave their posts amid a violent crime surge.</p>
<p>Announcing his departure, Arradondo said "the impacts of Floyd's killing will stay with me forever," but that they did not factor into his decision to retire.</p>
<p>The chief said he's "open to exploring next chapter" but has no plans to enter political office, nor is he considering applying for a police chief position elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the news conference, Minneapolis Mayor <a>Jacob Frey</a> said he will announce an interim chief this week.</p>
<p>"I can assure everyone in this city that there will be continuity and leadership in the weeks and months ahead," Frey said.</p>
<p>Last month, in a crushing defeat for the Defund the Police movement, a ballot initiative to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a reimagined public safety department failed. Arradondo publicly opposed the measure.</p>
<p>In the fall, the chief requested an additional $27 million in funding and the department announced plans to hire 90 police recruits.</p>
<p>Keechant Sewell, current Nassau County, New York, police chief of detectives, was named the next New York City police commissioner and is set to make history as the first female to hold the position once she starts in the new year.</p>
<p>Eric Adams, the city's mayor-elect, announced that he had chosen her for the job on Wednesday, with the two appearing together at a news conference in Queens.</p>
<p>Sewell and Adams will both begin their new positions on January 1. Sewell, 49, will replace Dermot Shea, who is retiring.</p>
<p>Sewell said she will be "laser-focused on violent crime" as commissioner, especially centering on gun violence, which has been trending upward not just in the city but across the nation.</p>
<p>"We are in a pivotal moment in New York as our city faces the twin challenge of public safety and police accountability," Sewell said at the news conference. "They are not mutually exclusive."</p>
<p>Being only the third Black commissioner in New York City's history, Sewell also said she plans to focus on making the <a>NYPD</a> more diverse.</p>
<p>"I bring a different perspective, committed to make sure the department looks like the city it serves, and making the decision, just as Mayor-elect Adams did, to elevate women and people of color to leadership positions," she said.</p>
<p>"She's the woman for the job," Adams, himself a former New York police captain, declared as he appeared with Sewell at the news conference.</p>
<p>"She carried with her throughout her career a sledgehammer, and she crushed every glass ceiling that was put in her way," Adams said. "Today, she has crashed and destroyed the final one we need in New York City."</p>
<p>Adams praised Sewell for her "emotional intelligence," describing her as "calm, collected, confident" and someone who has risen through the ranks.</p>
<p>Adams, the co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, an advocacy group that sought criminal justice reform and spoke out against police brutality, has pledged new strategies to fight crime, including the return of foot patrols.</p>
<p>He has pushed back against progressive calls to defund the police and has defended the controversial stop-and-frisk police strategy as a useful tool that has been abused. He has also pledged to diversify the NYPD's ranks.</p>
<p>Among about 35,000 uniformed members of the department, about 45% are white, 30% are Hispanic, 15% are Black and 10% are Asian.</p>
<p>Sewell on Wednesday reiterated that promise to diversify the force.</p>
<p>Sewell was named Nassau County's chief of detectives in September 2020, overseeing a staff of about 350 people. The NYPD has about 35,000 officers.</p>
<p>Adams acknowledged Sewell has been leading a much smaller force in her current role, but said Wednesday she helped make Nassau County one of the safest communities in the country.</p>
<p>She started with the department as a patrol officer in 1997 and worked her way up the ranks to become a precinct commander, to head the department's bureau of major cases and to serve as the chief hostage negotiator.</p>
<p>The New York Post first reported the selection of Sewell on Tuesday night.</p>

<div> U.S. Crime <a>Police</a></div>
<p>Police departments in several U.S. cities with the highest crime rates reported workforce shortages heading into the final months of 2021, as forces wrestle with the challenges of both bolstering and retaining their forces.</p>
<p>In most cases, the shortfall did not occur suddenly, but instead demonstrates a rising trend that police departments across the nation have identified over the last several years.</p>
<a>Police</a> Foundation (NPF), told Newsweek that police departments are experiencing issues with recruitment and retention. Recruitment has been a problem "for many years," Burch said.
<p>"I think what is a little bit different about it today is, we have a continuing recruitment—I'll call it a crisis. But at the same time, we have an attrition problem," he said.</p>
<a>2021 Retail Security Survey</a>. Law enforcement leaders cited staffing shortages as a reason police were having difficulty responding to some 911 calls,
<a>during a November meeting</a> with congressional lawmakers.
<a>Seattle</a>—all cities included on the NRF's list—have also struggled with shortages this fall, with some departments seeking to bring new officers in from out of state in an attempt to boost recruitment numbers.
<p>Baltimore, which placed ninth on the NRF's list, had more than 200 budgeted positions open with its local police department at the start of the fall season, according to the Baltimore-based news station <a>WBFF</a>.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Police Department also recently told Newsweek it was dealing with staffing shortages.</p>
<p>Many of the U.S. cities that have the highest per-capita percentage of reported violent crimes are also experiencing staffing issues within their police departments.</p>
