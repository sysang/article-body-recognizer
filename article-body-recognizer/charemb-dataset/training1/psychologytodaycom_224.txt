<div> <div> <h1>Signs and Symptoms of Addiction</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h4>On This Page</h4> <ul> <li> Signs of Addiction </li> <li> <a> The Experience of Addiction </a> </li> </ul> </div>
<div> <h3> What are common behavioral signs of addiction? </h3> </div>
<p>Substance use disorder is marked by a pattern of pathological behaviors related to use of the substance. As listed in the DSM, they include:</p>
<p>• Being unable to stop taking a substance, even when wanting to cut down or regulate use or having tried several times</p>
<p>• Worrying about the next dose or getting a consistent supply of the substance</p>
<p>• Experiencing intense cravings at any time, but especially in places where the drug was once obtained or used</p>
<p>• Devoting considerable time to getting, taking, or recovering from drug</p>
<p>• Neglecting roles and responsibilities such as work, school or home obligations</p>
<p>• Experiencing interpersonal problems as a result of substance use</p>
<p>• Changing social patterns, withdrawing from family, friends and activities in order to use a substance</p>
<p>• Facing risky situations to become intoxicated or maintain a supply of drug</p>
<p>• Using a substance despite knowing it causes physical or psychological harm to oneself</p>
<p>• Developing tolerance, requiring more drug to get an effect; a common but not invariable feature of addiction, sometimes called adaptation</p>
<p>Along with the diagnostic signposts of addiction, those addicted typically display a number of other behavioral characteristics:</p>
<p>• Secretiveness about activities and relationships as well as private space, to conceal drug use</p>
<p>• Sudden changes in activity patterns, refusing participation in activities once enjoyed</p>
<p>• Lying about whereabouts, absences, consumption habits; making excuses for unusual behavior</p>
<p>• Loss of energy or motivation</p>
<p>• Neglect of appearance</p>
<p>• Stealing to support drug purchases.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the psychological signs of addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>psychology of addiction</a> is a sense of powerlessness, and it always a sign that better stress-management skills are needed.
<div> <h3> What are physical signs of addiction? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does addiction cause personality change? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is addiction in the mind or the body? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> When does substance use become an addiction? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are there early warning signs of addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>five early warning signs of addiction</a>.
<p>• rationalization: justifying use because of a “real need” the substance is serving, whether it is aiding social experience or fostering sleep.</p>
<p>• personality changes: unpredictable displays of hostility, suspicion, or irritability, or rapid mood swings</p>
<p>• relationship shifts: wearing out longstanding relationships, rapidly turning to new sets of friends</p>
<p>• deteriorating work performance: increasing difficulties concentrating on work showing up in simple mistakes and, often, new difficulties with coworkers</p>
<p>• emergence of a “shadow self”: violating deep values as drug use affects the prefrontal cortex of the brain.</p>
<div> <h3> How do you know if you’re addicted? </h3> </div>
<p>You look forward to getting high. You devote increasing amounts of time planning to get drugs or worrying about where your next dose is coming from. You find yourself rummaging through other people’s medicine cabinets in search of drugs.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between addiction and substance use disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I tell if someone has a problem drinking or taking drugs? </h3> </div>
<a>warning signs</a> is a tendency for those experiencing problems to deny or get highly defensive about observed changes in behavior.
<h2> The Experience of Addiction </h2>
<div> <h3> Do you have to be addicted to experience problems? </h3> </div>
<p>While consumption of any illicit drug can be dangerous from a toxicological perspective, it can also create problems from a behavioral perspective. Intoxication with alcohol is a major cause of traffic accidents and violence to others.</p>
<div> <h3> What does physical dependence mean? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does psychological dependence exist? </h3> </div>
<a>There is no real difference between physical addiction and psychological addiction.</a> Addiction is one of those conditions that demonstrates it is not possible to distinguish between physical and psychological aspects of behavior.
<div> <h3> What do drug cravings mean? </h3> </div>
<a>a highly focused urge to seek the substance</a>.
<div> <h3> Do all drugs create withdrawal symptoms? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between mild addiction and severe addiction? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can people get addicted to any drug? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do I feel like I’ll never be able to stop? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why does my body shake when I go without drugs for a while? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is wet brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the course of addiction? </h3> </div>
<p>Addiction is often marked by multiple periods of abstinence and relapse. It is common for people to make many attempts at recovery before succeeding, and many experts in fact view relapse as a normal part of the recovery process.</p>
<div> Clearly, there are many problems Big Tech needs to be held accountable for. But spreading the untruth that our devices are controlling all of our brains doesn't help anything. </div>

<h6> <a> Defense Mechanisms </a> </h6>
<h1> Is It Weak Conscience or Strong Self-Rationalization? </h1>
<h2> Consciences are impotent when we get very good at self-rationalization. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Defense Mechanisms? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>What seems a weak conscience may be a strong capacity for self-rationalization that assuages it. </li>
<li>A behavior is really the product of appetites and what we can get away with internally and externally.</li>
<li>One can fall into a culture that encourages and promotes self-rationalization.</li>
<a>conscience</a> than you do. Or maybe they’re just better at self-rationalizing their way out of it. Or maybe they’re around more temptations to be nasty. Or maybe they had allies who encouraged their unconscientious behavior.
<p>It’s far too easy to think of behavioral traits like “sweet tooth” or “conscience” as a thing one has to one degree or another. It’s more complicated, though not by a lot.</p>
<p>But we’re not passive trains rolling down a railroad track. Driving, we have our impulses and self-discipline, our inclinations and our <a>self-control</a>.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you eat more sweets than other people, you might have a big old “sweet tooth,” but that’s not the only possible explanation. </p>
<p>Internal tendency: A stronger sweet-tooth impulse.Internal constraint: Less self-control, for example, more capacity for rationalizing eating sweets.External tendency: Easier access to sweets. External constraint: Less social discouragement. </p>
<p>Pathological liars can invent a justification for anything in an instant. It’s a creative and self-benefiting talent. If they need an excuse they can always make one up instantly. </p>

<div> <div> <div> <div>The dark triad as a circular self-rationalization</div> <div>Source: Created by author.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Since I’m elite (by any locally popular standard) I must beat. To beat I can cheat (including claiming I’ve won when I’ve lost) Since I beat I’m elite. </p>
<p>Round and round the circular argument goes, generating self-rationalizations that fatten the inner weasel right up. The conscience may still be there but it doesn’t matter. It’s impotent drowned out by insta-self-rationalization. </p>

<h1> The Deceptive Promise of Alcohol </h1>
<h2> Is alcohol costing more than you think? </h2>
<li>Alcohol promises us an entrance to the land of fun, excitement, belonging, connection, relaxing, romance, sex, and treating ourselves. </li>
<li>But more people are discovering that sobriety is delivering everything that alcohol promises but fails to deliver.</li>
<li>All that is required is a shift in perception.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: PinkBadger/Depositphotos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But in the last five years, coinciding with the popularity of Instagram, more and more people are sharing their sobriety stories. And none of them looks like someone who struggles with an alcohol problem. That’s the first thing to notice.</p>
<h3>I believe it’s because more and more people are recognizing the alcohol lie.</h3>
<a>rationalize</a> that our drinking is not the dangerous kind. Many of us would be wrong about that.
<a>sex</a>, and treating ourselves. And this promise is reinforced by our peer groups, culture, and media. Culturally we believe alcohol is the best way to get to this land, and who the hell wouldn’t want to go there? I know I want to.
<h3>What is obscured is the cost of drinking, and I’m not just talking about money.</h3>
<p>That sucks, right? No one wants to do that. That’s why lots of people <a>spend years</a> trying to manage their drinking in the irrational belief that if they find the right balance, they can drink without any of the consequences. </p>
<h3>Becoming alcohol-free requires a shift in perception.</h3>
<a>boring</a>) was something we absorbed without examination. Much is revealed to us when we stop drinking. Not only do we get our mental bandwidth back, but we also begin to perceive things differently.
<p>I call this the great, big, sober secret. Who knew we could party, have fun, dance, and celebrate, all without alcohol, and that those experiences are far better than anything we could have imagined? </p>
<p>But now the secret is not so secret anymore. And sobriety is not just for rock-bottom alcoholics; it’s for people who want full access to their bandwidth and the expansive life that allows. </p>
<a>mindful</a>, thoughtful, powerful,
<a>grateful</a>, beautiful, useful, blissful. No wonder so many people are talking about it.
