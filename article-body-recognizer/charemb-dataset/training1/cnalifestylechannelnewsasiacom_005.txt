<p>FIND MOMENTS FOR OPTIMISM</p>
<a>Humour, relaxation and optimistic thinking</a> can all help evoke positivity and facilitate coping in the midst of tough times, according to studies dating back to the 1990s. In our pandemic era, that might mean settling in with friends or family for a

<h1> Commentary: Why do some children choose unhealthy food when they get older? </h1>
<p>From birth to preschool, most children’s meals are carefully curated. The struggle begins once they step into a school canteen but getting them to make healthy choices can be easy, says Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Mary Chong.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Mary Chong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: We breathe a sigh of relief seeing our children enter primary school. Gone are the days of dealing with fussy eating and agonising over what they eat.</p>
<p>Convincing our children to listen and adhere to advice on eating healthily, being more physically active and having less screen time becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p>What’s more, with them spending a large proportion of time out-of-home, we find ourselves struggling to be fully aware of their activities and have less control of what they choose to consume or do.</p>
<p>Two years ago, my team and I conducted focus group discussions with 55 primary school children, aged nine to 12. We gleaned some invaluable insights into how they think and act when it comes to food.</p>
<p>In general, all the children we interviewed demonstrated a good understanding of healthy eating and were able to share why it is important.</p>
<p>Instead, food and taste preferences appeared to be the key factors determining food choices.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: When is your child’s fussy eating a serious medical problem?</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: 1 in 3 young children undernourished or overweight: UNICEF</a></h3>
<p>Existing research bears that out - children’s food intake intentions and behaviours tend to be influenced by habitual responses and emotional factors such as whether the food is pleasant, enjoyable or disgusting, and less by cognitive persuasion.</p>
<p>This is likely because children have yet to develop the cognitive abilities to understand concepts like nutrition, health and care much less about how it will affect them in the future.</p>
<p>PARENTS ARE CRITICAL ROLE MODELS</p>
<p>One thing that came up quite clearly is how much children look up to parents as role models.</p>
<p>Several described that their parents would forbid the storage of “junk foods” at home. But these less healthy foods would be provided as rewards when children engaged in physical activities or consumed vegetables.</p>
<p>In response to the strict restrictions, a few children said they did all this appease their parents, while some chose to consume the restricted foods in secrecy.</p>
<p>Practices like these often do not teach children how to self-regulate their food consumption. Instead, they undermine a child’s perceived importance of adherence to healthy eating and lead to increased preference of the less healthy reward foods.</p>
<p>OUTSIDE INFLUENCES: TEACHERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: How to sabotage your child’s future – five dangerous notions about life, careers and education</a></h3>
<p>Besides learning about healthy eating as part of the school curriculum, some children spoke of how their teachers would monitor their intakes during recess time and snack time.</p>
<p>This showed the importance of ensuring consistency of healthy eating messages across home and school, as conflicting ones may confuse children and hinder their ability to make prudent dietary choices.</p>
<p>For example, one student cited the video advertisement from the Let’s Beat Diabetes campaign as one that left a lasting impression and even tried re-enacting it.</p>
<p>At this age, children are still cognitively immature and are particularly open to messaging from advertisements and social media.</p>
<p>More can be done to engage online social media platforms frequented by children, to deliver health promotional messages, to positively influence their food choices, and at the same time, counter-balance the marketing appeal of less healthy foods.</p>
<p>We also spoke to parents and many of them shared the immense challenges they faced when instilling healthy eating habits in their children.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: There is no shame in being a Tiger Parent</a></h3>
<p>This may mean having to eat out more frequently or order in take-aways, which sometimes end up being fast-foods.</p>
<p>Some also mentioned that grandparents’ or their spouses’ dietary preference for less healthy food often undermine their own efforts in being good role models for their children.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, families can do their best. One way is to get children involved in the food preparation process. It can be helping with the cooking, going grocery shopping and even being exposed to urban farming and gardening.</p>
<p>Studies show such activities increase children’s willingness to try new foods, being aware of different fruits and vegetables and these translate into positive dietary behaviours.</p>
<h3><a>READ: High on ease, low on nutrition: Instant noodle diet harms Asian kids</a></h3>
<p>Teaching children self-regulate their food consumption by providing guidance and routines, setting limits, and considering the child's perspectives are much better alternatives. </p>
<p>Balancing healthier meals during the weekdays with some weekend takeaways or occasional fast-food treats make a good compromise.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Wellness </p> <h5> Is gluten-free bread really healthier than regular bread? </h5> </div> </div>
<section> <div> <p> Wellness </p> <h1> Is gluten-free bread really healthier than regular bread? </h1> <div> <p>It may not be necessarily so if you think the gluten-free version contains fewer artificial ingredients.</p> </div> </div> </section>
<p>As is often the case with nutrition questions, the answer will depend on your individual circumstance, said Jerlyn Jones, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and a registered dietitian in Atlanta.</p>
<p>But for most people, choosing a gluten-free bread instead of a wheat-based bread is not an inherently more nutritious option, she added.</p>
<p>And, gluten-free breads can be harder on your wallet, she said, since they are often more expensive and have a shorter shelf life.</p>
<p>Gluten is a protein found in the grains of wheat, barley and rye. In traditional bread made from wheat flour, gluten forms a protein network that makes dough cohesive and stretchy and gives bread that quintessentially satisfying, chewy texture.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how many people have this condition, called non-celiac wheat sensitivity, but it may be more common than celiac disease.</p>
<p>A third, much less common wheat-related condition is a wheat allergy, which can cause allergic reactions like diarrhoea, vomiting, facial swelling or difficulty breathing within minutes to hours after eating wheat.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Gluten-free bread manufacturers often add sugar, fat and salt to their products to make them taste better. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Among their top motivations: Wanting to reduce inflammation or consume fewer artificial ingredients, believing that gluten-free products were healthier or more natural, and thinking that such products would help with weight loss.</p>
<p>Making bread without gluten is a technological challenge, and manufacturers tend to rely on ingredients like refined rice, potato or tapioca flours, which contain much less protein and fibre than wheat flours, Dr Lee said.</p>
<p>Most of the refined wheat flours used in the United States are enriched with iron and the B vitamins folic acid, niacin, riboflavin and thiamin, while the flours used in gluten-free products generally don’t contain these added nutrients.</p>
<p>“If you do a gluten-free diet where you’re using foods that are naturally gluten-free, like all these wonderful grains, then your diet can be incredibly healthy,” she said.</p>
<p>But if you’re craving a sandwich, you’ll need bread. The good news is that gluten-free products have improved – “they’re better than they were even five years ago,” Dr Lee said.</p>
<p>To identify better gluten-free breads, Dr Lee recommended comparing their nutrition labels with those from whole wheat breads.</p>
<p>“If your first ingredients are water and tapioca starch, put the bread back on the shelf,” Dr Lee said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Obesity rate rises to highest level since 2010; MOH urges public to exercise and adopt healthier diet </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vanessa Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s obesity rate has risen to the highest level since 2010, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Nov 18), as it urged residents to increase their physical activity and adopt a healthier diet.</p>
<p>Binge drinking also increased among residents last year, particularly among men and younger adults.</p>
<p>However, MOH acknowledged that the survey did not capture the subsequent impact of COVID-19 as the survey was stopped in March last year.</p>
<p>Among its findings, the survey found that during the period of 2019 to 2020, 10.5 per cent of Singapore residents were obese. This is the same obesity level as in 2010.</p>
<p>In comparison, the crude prevalence of obesity was 8.6 per cent in both 2013 and 2017, when data on obesity was collected.</p>
<p>“Increases in obesity prevalence between 2017 and 2019-2020 were mostly among the older adults aged 50 to 74 years, males and Malays,” the report said.</p>
<p>More than two in 10 respondents, or 20.7 per cent, also had high risk Body Mass Index (BMI), the survey showed, up from 18.7 per cent in 2017.</p>
<p>The survey also found that fewer Singapore residents engaged in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week - the recommended level prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) - last year.</p>
<p>According to the report, 76.4 per cent of respondents achieved the recommended level in 2020, “significantly lower” than the 80.9 per cent recorded in 2017.</p>
<p>This, MOH said, was despite a 4 percentage point increase in the number of people who engaged in leisure-time regular exercise, which refers to any sports or exercise for 20 minutes or more at least three days a week.</p>
<p>“An observed increase in prevalence in obesity and high risk BMI can potentially increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. Aside from genetic factors, obesity can also result from a lack of physical activity and an unhealthy diet,” said MOH.</p>
<p>To encourage residents to be more active, MOH said it will continue to improve accessibility to its regular exercise programmes, such as by bringing them online and creating more exercise sessions in community spaces.</p>
<p>Programmes such as the National Steps Challenge also aim to get residents to lead more active lifestyles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) is planning to ramp up efforts to spur reformulation of reduced-sodium sauces and seasonings, with the latest survey results showing that residents are consuming saltier diets.</p>
<p>HPB will also embark on a nationwide campaign to encourage residents to reduce sodium consumption in their diets, with more details to be released in the coming months, said MOH.</p>
<p>“We've extended the period for the industry to implement that because of the shifts and the disruptions brought about by COVID,” said HPB.</p>
<p>It added that it is also working on extending those measures to freshly prepared beverages.</p>
<h2>SMOKING RATES DOWN WHILE BINGE DRINKING GOES UP</h2>
<p>Results from the latest survey showed a decrease in smoking prevalence, in line with trends observed over the past decade.</p>
<p>The crude prevalence of daily smoking was 10.1 per cent in 2020, a drop from 11.8 per cent in 2017.</p>
<p>According to the report, the decline was more pronounced in men compared to women, with the latter’s prevalence remaining relatively constant at around 3 per cent in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2020, 17 per cent of the men surveyed had smoked daily, compared with 3.4 per cent for women.</p>
<p>The report also found that daily smoking was most prevalent in adults aged between 50 and 59 years and least prevalent among older adults in the 60 to 74 years age group.</p>
<p>Responding to a question from the media about factors that may have contributed to the decline in smoking rates, MOH said the decrease can be attributed to its “holistic” approach.</p>
<p>This includes increasing education and outreach efforts - from pre-schools to institutes of higher learning - about the harmful effects of smoking.</p>
<p>“There are innovative ways that we reach out to the different age segments for them to understand the message as well as to be the influence to the family to help with smoking reduction,” said MOH.</p>
<p>“Over and above that, HPB actually works with many of our community leaders to reach out in a more (culturally) acceptable way to have the various population segments actually embarked on or start thinking about smoking cessation,” MOH added.</p>
<p>It added that it will continue efforts to keep smoking prevalence low, such as enhancing education in mainstream schools and through smoking cessation programmes.</p>
<p>On the flip side, binge drinking continued to increase from 8.8 per cent in 2017 to 10.5 per cent in 2020.</p>
<p>The survey defines binge drinking as five or more alcoholic drinks for men and four or more alcoholic drinks for women in a session.</p>
<p>"Binge drinking was more prevalent among males (14.6 per cent) than females (6.5 per cent); and among Chinese (11.6 per cent) and Indians (11.4 per cent) compared to Malays (1.7 per cent)," said MOH.</p>
<p>The report also showed that younger adults in the 18 to 39 years age group were more likely to binge drink compared to the other age groups. In particular, among the men surveyed, about one in five had a habit of binge drinking.</p>
<p>MOH said it will monitor binge drinking trends in Singapore and continue efforts to reduce it by raising awareness in schools and collaborating with agencies to include messages on responsible drinking.</p>
<h2>GO FOR REGULAR SCREENINGS</h2>
<p>MOH also reiterated the importance of regular health screening for early detection of disease.</p>
<p>As part of Screen for Life (SFL) programme, MOH said eligible Singapore residents are offered “heavily subsidised” screening tests for cardiovascular risk factors including obesity and diabetes, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>“We will continue our efforts to reach out to the unscreened population, to encourage Singaporeans to participate in screening regularly,” MOH added.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Parts of California get a White Christmas after snowfall </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LOS ANGELES: Parts of California are getting a White Christmas after all, with snowfall pounding mountains across the state.</p>
<p>Other areas of California, however, saw a wet and rainy Christmas as storms continue to drench the state, causing flash flooding and evacuations in some areas over the holiday period.</p>
<p>A 113km stretch of interstate over the top of the Sierra Nevada was closed Saturday when a storm that dropped nearly 60cm of snow on some ski resorts around Lake Tahoe overnight got a second wind.</p>
<p>Interstate 80 connecting Reno, Nevada, to Sacramento, California, over the Sierra was closed in both directions due to poor visibility from the Nevada-California state line to Colfax, California.</p>
<p>“The worst part of the storm is here so expect long delays,” the California Highway Patrol in Truckee tweeted Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Friday night into Saturday, 50cm of snow fell at Homewood on Tahoe’s west shore. About 30cm was reported at Northstar near Truckee, California and 25cm at the Mount Rose ski resort on the southwest edge of Reno.</p>
<p>There has been at least 3m recorded so far this month, according to The Mercury News, with more expected over the next 72 hours.</p>
<p>In the San Bernardino National Forest, crews are working on a US$4.2 million emergency project to repair a section of State Route 18 that washed down a hillside late Thursday after heavy rain, according to The San Bernardino Sun.</p>
<p>The roadway is a major route to Big Bear Lake and the closure near Panorama Point could be “several days if not weeks,” the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles area is likely to see rain and mountain snow for the next week, according to the National Weather Service, with temperatures significantly below normal through the middle of the week.</p>
<p>The San Diego region should see scattered showers, with heavy snow in the San Bernardino and Riverside County mountains, with precipitation possibly going into Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the San Francisco Bay Area is predicted to have rain showers through Monday before cold and drier conditions arrive through the middle of next week, the weather service said.</p>
<p>Rain and snow records broke in Nevada and state officials in Oregon declared an emergency ahead of the freezing temperatures, snow and ice.</p>
<p>Recent forecasts show at least an inch of snow is likely to fall Sunday in the Seattle and Portland regions, which don’t typically see snow.</p>
<p>The 4.2cm of rain that fell at the airport in Flagstaff on Friday shattered the old record of 2.2cm set in 2019. The 2.5cm that was recorded in Phoenix Friday broke the old record of 2.4cm in 1944.</p>
<p>It also was the wettest day for the city since Feb 22, 2020, when just over an inch fell.</p>

<h1> Greying, thinning hair woes: Do special shampoos, supplements and hair serums work? </h1>
<div> <p>Here are answers to some pressing questions about what’s going on with your hair and what treatments may be worth trying.</p> </div>
<p>Most people expect their hair to turn grey, but hair actually goes through myriad changes as we age, becoming less dense and more unruly, brittle and harder to grow long.</p>
<p>Aside from getting hair transplants, “you can’t just do something and stop”, said Dr Gary Linkov, a hair restoration and facial plastic surgeon in Manhattan. “You have to keep it up if you want to maintain your results.”</p>
<p>Here, we answer some of the most pressing questions about what’s going on with your hair and what treatments and products may actually be worth trying.</p>
<p>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS TO HAIR AS WE GET OLDER?</p>
<p>For starters, there’s a loss of melanin, which is why hair becomes grey or white, said Dr Marnie Nussbaum, a dermatologist in Manhattan and the Hamptons.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Hormonal shifts – specifically in women, less oestrogen and progesterone – also decrease the production of sebum, the natural emollient that coats hair and makes it appear shiny, Schwartz said.</p>
<p>And because hair isn’t protected and moisturised, it is more prone to breakage and damage from heat styling and, say, colouring those greys.</p>
<p>SINCE I HIT 50, I CAN’T GROW MY HAIR PAST MY SHOULDERS. WHAT GIVES?</p>
<p>MY HAIR IS FRIZZY AND UNMANAGEABLE ALL THE TIME. SHOULD I SWITCH PRODUCTS?</p>
<p>Argan Oil Taming Serum from Hair Biology, a Procter Gamble line that targets women over 50, uses argan oil and silicones to improve manageability of haywire strands, another complaint of many in the 50-plus set.</p>
<p>“We know that the fibre curvature of hair changes and gets less regular as we get older, but we don’t know exactly why that happens – just that it happens,” said Thomas, who is also a principal scientist behind Hair Biology.</p>
<p>“Most hair problems are self-inflicted,” Barrett said.</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT SHAMPOOS, SUPPLEMENTS AND SERUMS? DO THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY WORK?</p>
<p>They can, but choose wisely. Most specialty shampoos and serums, like the Scalp Stimulating Booster from Curlsmith, a hair-care line headquartered in Britain, work by improving blood flow to follicles.</p>
<p>Curlsmith’s serum includes ginger and guarana, which have been shown to improve circulation, said Afope Atoyebi, a trichologist in London who has consulted for the company.</p>
<p>Linkov underscored that the only topical solution with significant medical research behind it is minoxidil, sold under the brand name Rogaine, which works by dilating blood vessels and may extend hair’s growth phase.</p>
<p>Finasteride should not be taken by women who are pregnant or could become pregnant. Schwartz prescribes a compound serum made of finasteride, minoxidil and biotin to patients who are not going to become pregnant.</p>
<p>“It has robust clinical studies and a reputation for good results among dermatologists,” said Dr Marina Peredo, a dermatologist in Manhattan and on Long Island.</p>
<p>Engelman likes Prose, which makes supplements that are tailored to age, hair type, lifestyle and other factors, and the prescription drug spironolactone, which is an androgen blocker and can also help with acne.</p>
<p>“I call it the beauty pill,” Engelman said.</p>

<div> <div> <p> Wellness </p> <h5> Why we should declutter: The mental wellness benefits of letting go of things </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Why we should declutter: The mental wellness benefits of letting go of things </h1>
<div> <p>It is one way of tackling our irrational fear of running out of things, or the guilt or sentiment that makes it hard to part with useless gifts from people we love or admire.</p> </div>
<p>Many of us took advantage of the long, lonely hours of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns to cleanse our closets, drawers and cabinets of clothing from a bygone era, packaged foods long past their expiration dates and files no longer relevant.</p>
<p>At first, I was among them and enthusiastically tackled the low-hanging fruit: Ill-fitting dresses and suits, shoes I could no longer walk in, hundreds of empty plastic and glass containers.</p>
<p>It felt good initially, but I soon lost interest in decluttering and lacked the mental and physical energy to tackle what remained.</p>
<p>But when a leaking pipe recently saturated the carpet in my finished basement, where for decades I’ve stored everything I didn’t know what to do with but couldn’t bring myself to throw out, I was thrown back into action.</p>
<p>There’s nothing like a crisis, minor or major, to force one to come to terms with an unmanageable accumulation of stuff.</p>
<p>People like me, who fill storage areas as long as the living spaces remain orderly, do not rise to the seriousness of being a hoarder, which is considered its own psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p>But clutter has its own risks. Among them are the chronic and repeated stresses that can arise, for example, while searching frantically through stacks of miscellany for an important paper or racing to clear piles of junk before visitors arrive.</p>
<p>Costly truckloads of clutter had to be carted away. I’d like my family to have better things to fret or chuckle over when I die.</p>
<p>I never forgot what a neighbour said when, in the midst of a block party, she was asked where she kept her extra paper towels. “In the store,” she replied.</p>
<p>Some also feel compelled to hold on to the past, like a friend who keeps the programmes of every event he’s attended over the last six decades.</p>
<p>Out of guilt or sentiment, some find it hard to part with useless gifts from people they love or admire. “What if they come over one day and discover it’s gone?” is a common rationale.</p>
<p>When I realised it was time to part with decades-old professional files, I enlisted the aid of a helper, instructing them not to let me see anything that was being discarded from my drawers.</p>
<p>Now to do the same with the hundreds of work-related books I’ll never open again!</p>
<p>TIPS TO TACKLE DECLUTTERING</p>
<p>■ Establish a plan. You may want to go room by room or focus on a category like jackets or shoes, but avoid changing course midstream before you’ve finished the task you started.</p>
<p>■ Set reasonable goals based on your available time and stamina. If a whole closet is too intimidating, even as small a task as clearing items from a single drawer or shelf can get you started in the right direction.</p>
<p>■ If a more gradual approach is more manageable, keep a container in each room to house giveaways. When my friend Gina tries something on that no longer fits or looks good, it goes directly into the donation bag, not back in the closet.</p>
<p>■ Get help from a friend, family member or paid consultant. They won’t have the same attachment to your possessions.</p>
<p>■ Create three piles – keep, donate and discard. Don’t second-guess your initial assessment; immediately trash the discard pile and schedule a pickup for the donations or take them to a worthy destination.</p>
<p>■ If you’re storing items for other people, give them a deadline to pick them up. Or suggest they rent a storage locker.</p>
<p>■ Avoid backsliding. Resist refilling the spaces you clear with more stuff.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Trickle-down misery: How Afghanistan's asset freeze hurts everyone </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KABUL: Afghan businessman Shoaib Barak is struggling to pay his workers and suppliers, unable to access funds from a banking system crippled by the freezing of the nation's overseas assets.</p>
<p>They, in turn, can't pay their bills - and so the country's economic woes trickle down and hurt everyone along an unbroken chain of misery.</p>
<p>"I feel very ashamed," said Barak, who until recently employed some 200 people across the country - mostly in his construction business.</p>
<p>"For me, for every Afghan, it's really disgusting. I do not even have the ability to pay salaries for my staff."</p>
<p>To avoid giving the Taliban access to Afghanistan's reserves, Washington froze an estimated US$10 billion held by the central bank abroad after the hardline Islamists seized power on Aug 15.</p>
<p>Equating to around half what the country's economy produced last year, that move in turn starved banks used by Afghan businesses and citizens of access to dollars.</p>
<p>Even if limited funds were released, the bulk could be tied up in the American legal system for years while subject to claims by victims of the Sep 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda attacks on the US.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the reserves could be dipped into to pay overdue government bills and development projects, but the freeze has trickled down to the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>"Just release the reserves," Barak pleaded.</p>
<p>"If you have a problem with ... the Taliban, don't take revenge on the nation, the people."</p>
<p>Barak's cash flow crisis illustrates the problems faced by tens of thousands of Afghans who simply can't access most of their money.</p>
<p>He says he has around US$3 million tied up in Afghan banks - money earned over the years from lucrative private and government contracts, which were paid in dollars as aid poured into the public purse under the pre-Taliban regime.</p>
<p>But with local banks limiting weekly withdrawals to five per cent of a business account's balance - up to a maximum of US$5,000 - Barak is months behind on both invoices and salaries to his staff.</p>
<p>Ahmad Zia is one of them.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old engineer was earning 60,000 Afghanis per month - equivalent to US$770 before the Taliban took over and the currency plunged 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Four months later, Zia is struggling to make ends meet and fears his once comfortably-off family of six will only "eat one or two times" per day.</p>
<p>It isn't just Barak's employees who are suffering.</p>
<p>Ehsanullah Maroof's now-defunct law business relied heavily on a monthly retainer from Barak's construction company.</p>
<p>"The kids went to a very good school," he told AFP, noting proudly that his nine-year-old daughter Rana topped her year.</p>
<p>But now he can't afford the right medicine for an epileptic son, and Rana has been expelled because the family can't pay school fees.</p>
<p>The misery trickles down even further - to the Maroof family maid, who is now jobless.</p>
<p>Gulha, 42, earned 8,000 Afghanis a month and was the main breadwinner in her seven-strong family.</p>
<p>Now she is two months behind on rent and running out of food.</p>
<p>"I have 14kg of rice, 20-21kg of flour and some oil," she told AFP in a one-room apartment where she allows neighbours to share the nightly warmth of a wood-burner as winter descends.</p>
<p>Once that is gone she will join millions of her compatriots who are utterly dependent on aid.</p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a US resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands - a move welcomed by the Islamists as a "good step".</p>
<p>But whether enough cash arrives to contain the unfolding humanitarian disaster ultimately still depends on "the viability of the banking system", said Hanna Luchnikava-Schorsch, Principal Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit.</p>
<p>Many Afghan banks are "pretty close to collapse", she told AFP, and overseas institutions will probably be "terrified" of falling foul of sanctions despite the UN resolution.</p>
<p>For many ordinary Afghans, any relief will come too late.</p>
<p>International organisations warn one million Afghan children could die this winter, Barak notes.</p>
<p>"Who do you think will be blamed - the Taliban, or the US?"</p>

<div> <p> Advertorial </p> <h1> When cutting-edge technology and heritage come together </h1> <div> <p>Fifty-three year-old Capitol Optical works with ZEISS to offer quality eyeglass lenses and advanced digital eye examinations. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Brand Studio </a> </div> </div>
<div><div> <h6> Brought to you by </h6> </div> </div>
<p>Mr Delvyn Wong, chief executive officer of Capitol Optical, said that viruses can survive on the surface of lenses, and that spectacle wearers may touch their eyewear many times a day, to adjust the frames or to clean the glasses.</p>
<p>“The new ZEISS AntiVirus Coating provides an extra layer of protection to minimise the transmission of viruses and bacteria from the outside world to one’s home, keeping us and our loved ones safer,” said Mr Wong.</p>
<p>From sunglasses sold off a pushcart at Change Alley to a thriving chain of eyecare boutiques, Capitol Optical has come a long way and built up a loyal community of customers.</p>
<p>AN EXAM YOU’LL WANT TO TAKE</p>
<p>At selected Capitol Optical stores, customers can undergo an integrated eye examination and consultation via the ZEISS Vision Analysis process, which utilises a suite of ZEISS equipment to conduct an end-to-end digital eye examination.</p>
<p>“It’s like an individualised optical offering dedicated to the customer, and not the other way around where the customer needs to adapt to the lens,” Mr Wong said.</p>
<p>MANAGING MYOPIA, THE FUSS-FREE WAY</p>
<a>one in five children myopic</a> before starting primary school and four out of five adults suffering short-sightedness. Beyond the inconvenience of constantly needing to wear spectacles or contact lenses, myopia can also result in a
<a>higher chance of suffering eye disorders</a> such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment as the years go by.
<p>MAKE CONTACT WITH A GREENER FUTURE </p>
<a>97 per cent of contact lens packaging</a> – which does not biodegrade easily – is thrown into the trash instead of being recycled.
<p>To help reduce waste, Capitol Optical has partnered the National Environment Agency and Sembcorp to offer free recycling bags to customers online and in-stores.</p>
<p>As Capitol Optical continues to bring new, cutting-edge products and services to Singapore, customers can be assured that their vision-related needs are met throughout every stage of their life.</p>
<p>Celebrate Capitol Optical’s 53rd and ZEISS’ 175th anniversaries and receive a limited-edition gift set when you purchase ZEISS lenses with frames at any Capitol Optical store (while stocks last). <a>Make an appointment today</a>.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Wellness </a> </p> <h5> Does high-intensity exercise affect our hearts, minds, life spans or waistlines? </h5> </div> </div>
<section> <div> <p> Wellness </p> <h1> Does high-intensity exercise affect our hearts, minds, life spans or waistlines? </h1> <div> <p>HIIT has been tested, tried, talked about and sometimes derided. So, what's the verdict?</p> </div> </div> </section>
<p>For the past five years or so, high-intensity interval training or HIIT has been one of the most popular and controversial forms of exercise.</p>
<p>Gym franchises and online classes specialise in HIIT. Dozens of scientific studies every month explore its benefits and drawbacks. By almost any measure, HIIT is hot.</p>
<p>But plenty of questions remain about HIIT. Is it particularly good for our hearts? Minds? Life spans? Waistlines? Is it better for us, long term, than taking a brisk daily stroll? And what does “intense” exercise even mean?</p>
<p>With HIIT, you strenuously ride, run, swim, hop, crunch or otherwise push yourself aerobically for a few minutes or even seconds, slow or stop to rest for a few more minutes, and repeat that sequence three or four times, or more.</p>
<p>This exercise approach is not new, of course. Athletes looking for performance boosts have threaded interval sessions into their broader training since time immemorial.</p>
<p>But today’s HIIT is often promoted as the only exercise you have to do – and not an add-on to other, longer, moderate sessions.</p>
<p>A higher VO2 max is strongly associated with greater longevity, he added, suggesting intervals are likely to have a more potent influence on our life spans than, for instance, gentle walks.</p>
<p>HIIT also may help to reduce fat stores around our midsections as effectively as longer, easier exercise, and it seems uniquely beneficial for our brains.</p>
<p>“HIIT improves memory in younger and older adults” in ways that standard, moderate exercise cannot, said Jennifer Heisz, a professor at McMaster University and the author of the book, Move The Body, Heal The Mind, which will be published in March.</p>
<p>The moderate exercisers, who topped out at about 12 hours of exercise altogether, showed improved measures of fitness and healthfully remodelled the inner workings of their muscle cells.</p>
<p>But the HIIT riders, who completed 12 total minutes of intense exercise, grew just as fit or fitter and showed even more molecular alterations inside their muscles.</p>
<p>When we skip working out, even if we did HIIT the day before, our blood sugar and blood pressure control may slip, undercutting the long-term metabolic gains from those earlier intervals.</p>
<p>So, if you decide to do HIIT, plan to schedule other types of exercise, he said, such as moderate walking, cycling, swimming, jogging or calisthenics on most other days of the week.</p>
<p>'IT' RATHER THAN 'HIIT'?</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest impediment to HIIT for many people, though, is that name. “I wish we would start using the more-encompassing term ‘interval training’,” rather than HIIT, Dr Gibala said.</p>
<p>“So many people are intimidated because they think HIIT has to be this all-out, hard-as-you-can-go, gut-busting workout.” It does not, he said. On a green-yellow-red spectrum of physical effort, he said, it is “yellow”.</p>
<p>“You should be able to have short conversations with another person” during a typical interval, Dr Wisloff said. “But if that person asks you to sing, you should not be able to.”</p>
<p>In practice, this level of effort could mean walking up a hill instead of on level ground, Dr Wisloff said. Interval walking, in fact, can be an ideal introduction to this kind of exercise.</p>
<p>In a large-scale experiment a few years ago in Japan, almost 700 middle-aged and older adults walked for 30 minutes, some at their usual pace, while others alternated three minutes of up-tempo walking with three minutes of strolling.</p>
<p>KEEP IT SIMPLE. CONSIDER FARTLEKS</p>
<p>Interested in trying HIIT now? Good, Dr Wisloff said. “I would say that everyone should aim for at least one HIIT session per week, for the sake of health,” he said.</p>
<p>Use the natural contours of the landscape to shape your exercise. “This is perfect to do outside the gym,” he said, with little expense or experience needed.</p>
<p>Just dash toward the tree until it recedes behind you, pick another landmark ahead, and you’ll be “HIITing” health and fitness goals.</p>
