<p>There is a distinct possibility the Federal Reserve is about to hit a wall, and that its very constitutional underpinnings will soon come into question.</p>
<p>The theory and the data behind the R* have always been dubious, even if academic critiques have thus far had no success in overturning the theory. Developments taking place in the economy today, however, may finally threaten its regal hegemony.</p>
<a>what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said just two weeks before the FOMC meeting</a>.
<p>This explains the inconsistency. Jerome Powell is talking out of two sides of his mouth because he cannot do otherwise. There is no easy option, no obviously correct choice.</p>
