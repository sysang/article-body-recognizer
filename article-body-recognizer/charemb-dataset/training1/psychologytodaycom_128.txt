<h1> 7 Creative Ways to Reduce Anxiety </h1>

<li>Research shows that imagination is as effective as reality for decreasing anxiety.</li>
<li>Because anxiety is often increased or even caused by our imagination, we can use the power of imagination to reduce it.</li>
<li>These fun and creative techniques can help decrease anxiety and may be used by adults as well as children.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>I learned to use my imagination...</div> <div>Source: Chris Gilbert, M.D., Ph.D.</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>When I was a child, alone in my room at night, I had a lot of anxieties. To decrease these anxieties, I learned to <a>fantasize</a> about having an extraterrestrial friend with me.</p>
<a>imagination</a>, nobody could take him away from me. With him, I learned to fall asleep with a smile, and he helped me tremendously throughout my
<a>childhood</a> as an only child.
<h3>Using our imagination is a fantastic way to decrease anxiety, whether we are children or adults.</h3>

<p>Dr. Charlotte Reznick, a child and adolescent psychologist, agrees with Reddan and describes inher book, <a>The Power of Your Child’s Imagination</a>, several techniques to reduce children’s anxiety, all of which use imagination. </p>
<p>Here are several techniques to lower anxiety (some of them being quite beautiful) based on imagination:</p>
<h3>1. Start with the “balloon breath,” and then imagine a beautiful place.</h3>
<p>Start with what Dr. Reznick calls “balloon breath,” an easy way to center yourself and access your imagination:</p>
<p>Imagine a balloon inside your abdomen a couple of inches below your belly button. Breathe in slowly to a count of three, and the balloon expands. Then breathe out slowly, and the balloon deflates. </p>
<p>Within three to 10 breaths, you will likely find yourself calm and centered, and ready to connect with the <a>wisdom</a> of your imagination.</p>
<p>When you are relaxed, imagine a beautiful place that you would love to be in, whether you have been there in the past or not. Visualize it. Is it by the ocean, on a remote island, on top of a mountain, in a forest, or somewhere else?</p>
<p>What sounds can you hear there? Animal sounds, water sounds, wind sounds, somebody’s voice, or something else? What can you smell? Ocean smell, floral <a>scent</a>, or something else?</p>
<p>You will be surprised by how fast your anxiety decreases.</p>
<h3>2. Visualize a protective animal, person, or wizard.</h3>
<p>Imagine you are protected by a fantastical animal or an imaginary person or wizard. What kind of animal, person, or wizard is it? Visualize that. Maybe you want more than one protector. </p>
<p>How many do you imagine, and what do they look like? Are they big or small? What color are they? What gift(s) do they offer you to help with your challenges? </p>
<p>Think of a color that you would like and that de-stresses you. What color would it be? Imagine being surrounded by that color all around you. Breathe in and out deeply while bathing in that color.</p>
<h3>4. Consider body movement</h3>
<p>Imagine a dance or movement that relaxes you. What would it be? Explore those different movements and experience which one works best to decrease your anxiety.</p>
<h3>6. Try drawing or painting.</h3>
<p>Draw or paint the place you would love to be in, the animals or wizards you would like to protect you, the colors you like. If you don’t know how to draw, just use colors to symbolize those.</p>
<h3>7. Envision your fantasy scenario.</h3>
<p>If anything were possible, what would you wish to happen? What is your fantasy scenario? Visualize the details of your fantasy scenario as if it were happening right now, and take the time to savor those details.</p>

<p>Visualizing the impossible will make it possible in your brain and will relieve your anxieties. And who knows? After imagining the impossible, the impossible might really become possible.</p>
<p>Use those deliberate imagination techniques often for a healthy, happier life.</p>

<a>anxiety</a>, or other pre-existing problems. Substance use and gambling disorders not only engage the same brain mechanisms, they respond to many of the same treatment approaches.
<h2> Myths About Addiction </h2>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Symptoms of Addiction </h2>
<p>Recurrent use of a substance, or engagement with an activity, that leads to impairment or distress, is the core of addictive disorders. The clinical diagnosis of an addiction is based on the presence of at least two of a number of features:</p>
<li>The substance or activity is used in larger amounts or for a longer period of time than was intended.</li>
<li>There is a desire to cut down on use or unsuccessful efforts to do so.</li>
<li>Pursuit of the substance or activity, or recovery from its use, consumes a significant amount of time.</li>
<li>There is a craving or strong desire to use the substance or engage in the activity.</li>
<li>Use of the substance or activity disrupts obligations at work, school, or home.</li>
<li>Use of the substance or activity continues despite the social or interpersonal problems it causes.</li>
<li>Participation in important social, work, or recreational activities drops or stops.</li>
<li>Use occurs in situations where it is physically risky.</li>
<li>Use continues despite knowing it is causing or exacerbating physical or psychological problems.</li>
<li>Tolerance occurs, indicated either by need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect or markedly diminished effect of the same amount of substance.</li>
<li>Withdrawal occurs, manifest either in the presence of physiological withdrawal symptoms or the taking of a related substance to block them.</li>
<p>Research makes it clear: There is no way to predict who will develop compulsive substance use or gambling behavior.</p>
<a>dopamine</a>. Another factor appears to be the nature of the body’s
<li><a>Gender</a>. Males are more likely to develop substance use disorder than females, although the so-called gender gap may be narrowing for alcohol use disorder, and females are more subject to intoxication effects at lower doses of alcohol.</li>
<li>Personality factors. Both impulsivity and <a>sensation seeking</a> have been linked to substance use and gambling disorders. Impulsivity may be particularly related to the risk of <a>relapse</a>.</li>
<a>attention deficit disorder</a>, and post-
<a>traumatic</a> stress disorder (
<a>PTSD</a>) increase the risk of addiction. Difficulties managing strong emotions are also linked to substance use.
<a>sibling</a> with an addictive disorder raises the risk, as does a lack of parental supervision or support. Poor-quality or troubled parent-child relations and family disruptions such as
<a>divorce</a> also add to one's risk, as does
<a>emotional abuse</a>. Research shows that
<a>marriage</a> and taking on child-raising responsibilities mitigate the risk of addiction.
<li>Accessibility factors. Easy availability of alcohol or other substances in one’s home, at school or work, or in one’s community increases the risk of repeated use.</li>
<a>adolescence</a>. Positive social relationships, on the other hand, are known to strongly protect against substance use.
<li>Employment status. Having a job, and developing the skills for employment, exerts pressure for stability and provides financial and psychological rewards that mitigate addiction risk.</li>
<h2> Treatment of Addiction </h2>
<a>management</a> of recurrent use.
<p>Treatment can include any of a number of components, which are often deployed in combination and are likely to change over the course of recovery:</p>
<li>Detoxification, conducted under medical supervision, may be needed but is only the first stage of treatment.</li>
<li>Medications that reduce or counter use of illicit substances are suitable for some individuals, or medications may be used to target co-occurring disorders such as anxiety and depression.</li>
<li>Motivational Interviewing, which is a short-term counseling process to help a person resolve ambivalence about treatment and find and hold onto incentives for change.</li>
<li>Cognitive Behavior <a>Therapy</a> (CBT) can help a person recognize and cope with situations that trigger the desire to use substances.</li>
<li>Group therapy and other peer-support programs leverage the direct experience of many to support individual recovery and prevent the recurrence of substance use.</li>
<li>Family therapy helps individuals repair any damage done to family relationships and to establish more supportive ones.</li>
<li>Life skills training, including employability skills, may be part of an individual's treatment plan.</li>
<li>Good treatment programs also feature the regular monitoring of individual progress.</li>
<li>Patients undergo comprehensive medical and <a>psychiatric</a> screening.</li>
<li>Treatment addresses individual needs, including co-occurring conditions, whether <a>chronic pain</a>, anxiety, or hepatitis.</li>
<li>Families are involved in treatment.</li>
<li>There is continuity of care via active linkages to resources in subsequent phases of recovery.</li>
<li>The facility maintains a respectful environment.</li>
<li>Treatment services are evidence-based and reflect best practices.</li>
<li>Staff members are licensed and certified in the disciplines they practice.</li>
<li>The program is accredited by a nationally recognized monitoring agency.</li>
<li>Patient response to treatment is monitored and the program or facility offers outcome data reflecting treatment performance.</li>
<h2> Substance Use Disorders </h2>
<a>insomnia</a>, flushed face, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling thoughts and speech, cardiac rhythm disturbances, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation.
<li>Cannabis Use Disorder: Cannabis use disorder is highest among 18-to29-year-olds (4.8 percent) and prevalence of the disorder decreases with age.</li>
<li>Phencyclidine and Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder: These substances alter perception. Phencyclidine is commonly called “angel dust” or PCP and produces feelings of separation of mind from body.</li>
<a>sleeping</a> pills and anti-anxiety medications falls into this category. Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants. Rates of the disorder are highest among 18-to-29-year-olds.
<a>methylphenidate</a>, best known as the prescription drug Ritalin; and cocaine. Stimulant drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of
<a>attention</a>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. In the U.S., cocaine use is highest among those aged 18 to 25.
<li>Tobacco Use Disorder: The nicotine in tobacco acts as a central <a>nervous system</a> stimulant. Studies show that 68 percent of adult smokers want to quit, and 50 percent have made attempts to quit.</li>
<li>Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder: Substances ranging from antihistamines, betel nut, and cortisol to steroids may also have effects on the central nervous system that lead to compulsive use causing serious problems.</li>
<h2> Gambling and Other Compulsions or Addictions </h2>
<a>goals</a> and create harmful consequences, from the loss of large sums of money to the disruption of important relationships.
<p>Behaviors indicative of gambling disorder include:</p>
<li>The need to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement.</li>
<li>Restlessness or irritability when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.</li>
<li>Repeated unsuccessful efforts to cut back or stop gambling.</li>
<li>Preoccupation with gambling.</li>
<li>Feelings of emotional distress leading to gambling.</li>
<li>Gambling losses followed by attempts to make up for them.</li>
<li><a>Lying</a> to conceal the extent of one's gambling.</li>
<li>Gambling that jeopardizes important relationships or work, school, or other obligations.</li>
