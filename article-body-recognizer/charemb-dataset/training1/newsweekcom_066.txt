<p>Though the Christmas Day schedule may be disrupted, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday the league has "no plans" to pause the season.</p>
<p>That same day, Silver had an interview with ESPN where he said the league looked at multiple options but found no reason to halt play.</p>
<a>ABC</a> windows for Saturday's games, which means the slots at 2:30, 5 and 8 p.m. Eastern. For now, those games, in order, would have Boston at Milwaukee, Golden State at Phoenix, and Brooklyn at the Los Angeles Lakers.
<p><a>The other games on the Christmas schedule</a> are Atlanta at New York at noon Eastern, and Dallas at Utah at 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Both of those games are scheduled to be shown on ESPN.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt those five Christmas Day games are important," Silver said. "But as you know, we play many games every day."</p>
<p>The league is allowing teams to sign replacements to hardship contracts when a player tests positive for the virus, with hopes such moves can minimize the need for postponements.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Atlanta teammates Danilo Gallinari and Clint Capela joined a Hawks list that already included Trae Young, raising questions about their availability for Christmas.</p>
<a>Pfizer</a> or Moderna shots, then a booster — and that those people have largely been asymptomatic or experiencing no worse than mild symptoms.
<p>Silver also said that the Omicron variant is a "beyond dominant" player in the rise of positive tests within the NBA in recent days, estimating that somewhere around "90% of the positive cases we're seeing right now are Omicron."</p>
<p>"We're comfortable with the protocols we're following right now," Silver said.</p>
<p>"This virus, unfortunately, isn't going anywhere," Silver said.</p>

<div>Tanner Ainge, the son of Celtics general manager Danny Ainge, is running for Congress in Utah and had encouraged NBA star Gordon Hayward to stay with the Utah Jazz.</div>
<p>Danielle Bush knew the routine by heart, until the music changed.</p>
<p>In a video that has now been seen millions of times, Bush, a dancer for the Utah Jazz basketball team, was on the court Monday when the team played the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
<p>While going through her usual motions, her fellow dancers flipped the script and she tried to follow but looked surprised. Bruno Mars' song "Marry You" then came on over the loudspeakers.</p>
<p>That was when her boyfriend, Brandon, snuck onto the court and shocked Danielle. She held her hands over her mouth as he got down on one knee with a small box in hand, removed an engagement ring and proposed.</p>
<p>The two shared some words in secret as the dancers and crowd looked on. Brandon received the OK to put on the ring, followed by an embrace and joy from the dance squad.</p>
<p>Originally, Bush said, she thought she was losing her job. Little did she know that the moment was planned weeks in advance by Brandon and the Utah Jazz dance coach, Ashley Kelson.</p>
<p>"I wanted to make it big and special for her for sure," Kelson said. "Making it a part of the routine was so much fun."</p>
<a>Instagram</a> page. "It was absolutely love at first sight the night I met you and almost 3 years later, I still feel those butterflies every time I come home from practice or work."
<p>She also thanked her coach and fellow dancers "for making this the most epic night of my life."</p>
<p>On the <a>Jazz Dancers' Instagram</a> page, they posted a video of the proposal with the comment: "What a night! Congratulations Danielle and Brandon! We loved sharing this moment with you."</p>
<p>Frank Zang, spokesperson for the Utah Jazz, told Newsweek, "The proposal was not only a surprise, but turned into a moment of pure joy that we were thrilled to share in front of a sellout Jazz crowd and beyond during this holiday season."</p>
<p>"Something falls off ur costume, keep going," the user said. "But this?! Hilarious sweet rolled into one."</p>
<p>User MissTGoldie echoed those words, saying, "Love it! She was like? What is happening? She was really into her steps and trying to appear as if nothing was wrong!!!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the <a>George Washington</a> men's basketball game against Maryland-Eastern Shore scheduled for Wednesday was postponed due to COVID-19 issues with the Colonials. The teams will work to reschedule the game.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>The Playoff's Executive Committee approved the plans this week as professional and college sports are both moving to handle rising COVID cases, causing the postponement or cancellation of several games in recent weeks.</p>
<p>There are no scenarios outlined in the plan where either semifinal game would be rescheduled, but the championship game could be pushed back as far as January 14.</p>
<p>If neither team has enough players for the national championship to take place from January 10 to January 14, the title will be declared vacated with no official champion.</p>
<p>Not long before the CFP announced its contingency plans, Alabama announced offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien and offensive line coach Doug Marrone had tested positive for COVID-19 and were isolating with mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Also, Texas AM became the first team to drop out of a bowl game, citing COVID-19 issues and season-ending injuries as the reasons it would not have enough available players for the Gator Bowl against Wake Forest on December 31.</p>
<p>As college basketball faced a wave of cancellations and postponements due to the Omicron surge over the last week, it seemed only a matter of time before the surge impacted bowl season.</p>
<p>The contingency plans were agreed to by the CFP management committee, comprised of the 10 Football Bowl Subdivision conference commissioners and Notre Dame's athletic director.</p>
<p>Semifinals participants were scheduled to arrive at their bowl sites as soon as Christmas Day and no later than December 26.</p>
<p>Now, all bowl activities will be optional, and the teams are permitted to arrive at their sites as late as December 29.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Alabama coach Nick Saban said more than 90% of his team was vaccinated with a booster shot, and players were being allowed to go home for a few days before the defending national champion Tide travel to Dallas on December 26.</p>
<p>At Michigan, the plan was for all the players to get booster shots as a team on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The CFP policies said schools would be allowed to use whatever protocols they used during the season, leading up to the games.</p>
<p>The high vaccination rates helped major college football sail through the regular season with no games being canceled or postponed, unlike last year when the disruptions were constant.</p>
<p>Last season, more than 100 regular-season games were postponed or canceled because of COVID-19 issues with one or both teams, and only 25 bowl games were played out of the 42 that had been originally scheduled.</p>
<p>The College Football Playoff was completed without delays.</p>
<div> News College Football <a>College Sports</a> <a>NCAA Football</a></div>
<p>Currie said he is "heartened" by the teams that have reached out, including one team that has already played in a bowl game.</p>
<p>The team did not provide specific numbers for COVID-positives or injuries.</p>
<p>The Aggies (8-4) were scheduled to leave for Jacksonville on Sunday.</p>
<p>Wake Forest (10-3) is holding out hope of finding another team to play in the Gator Bowl to cap a 10-win season that included winning an Atlantic Coast Conference division title.</p>
<p>The Aggies had an up-and-down season in which they went 4-4 in Southeastern Conference play. They beat Alabama on Oct. 9 when the Crimson Tide was ranked No. 1 but wrapped up the season with a disappointing 27-24 loss at LSU.</p>
<div> U.S. College Football <a>Ncaa</a> <a>NCAA Football</a></div>
<p>Once the policy is enacted, teams with the highest Academic Progress Rate scores get the first opportunity to fill the spot, and the NCAA said Rutgers is at the top of that list among 5-7 teams.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, Wake Forest athletic director John Currie said at least five teams had already reached out to the school about replacing the Aggies as an opponent in the Jacksonville, Florida, bowl game.</p>
<p>The NCAA committee also announced Thursday that any bowl game with similar issues could be rescheduled as late as January 10 so the original teams have a chance to stay in the bowl game.</p>
<p>Rutgers is atop the Academic Progress Rate list, though the NCAA did not release the full APR rankings to allow schools to privately decline a bowl bid.</p>
<p>Neither Rutgers nor the Gator Bowl confirmed that the school's Scarlet Knights would be playing in the game or even if it would still be played on December 31.</p>
<p>Having Rutgers replace Texas AM on short notice was not a foregone conclusion for the oversight committee—even after Rutgers officials informed decision-makers on Wednesday that they believed the team could be reassembled quickly.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Knights have not played since Thanksgiving weekend, and the team has not been practicing or working out together.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the committee chose to adhere as closely as possible to existing policy under unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>If Rutgers accepts the opportunity, it will be making its first bowl appearance since 2014, its first season as a member of the Big Ten Conference.</p>
