<h2>Suspects pose as Water Department employees to lure elderly victims out of their homes</h2>
<h4><a>Chicago dispatcher: 'Crime is out of control'</a></h4>
<p>Chicago 911 dispatcher Keith Thornton Jr. joins 'Fox Friends First' to discuss the record level of crime in the windy city and how it's led to a police shortage and overall lack of support from city officials</p>
<p>A team of <a>thieves</a> has come up with an elaborate new plan to target the elderly in northern <a>Chicago</a> this month, the Chicago Police Department said in a notice to residents on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Two to three <a>suspects</a> will approach a senior citizen and lure them out of their home by posing as Water Department employees, saying that there is damage to their home or garage. </p>
<p>Once the victim is outside, other <a>burglars will enter</a> the "home and take purses, jewelry and money." </p>

<p>"It does appear that this is the box we expected," Kate Ridgway, the lead conservator for the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, told reporters. </p>
<p>Records maintained by the Library of Virginia suggest that dozens of Richmond residents, organizations, and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, including Confederate memorabilia. </p>

<p>Along with several waterlogged books, pamphlets and newspapers, the box contained an envelope of Confederate money, which conservators carefully separated, and two carved artifacts — a Masonic symbol and a Confederate flag.</p>
<p>Conservators also pulled buttons, coins and Minié balls, a type of bullet used in the Civil War, from the box. A bomb squad had checked the capsule Monday, partly to make sure there was no live ammunition.</p>

<p>The omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa last month, is rapidly spreading in the United States. It was responsible for <a><u>73.2%</u></a> of all new cases for the week that ended Dec. 18.</p>

<h1>Harry Reid International Airport: Las Vegas likely to rename air hub in honor of former senator</h1>
<h2>The FAA still has to give its approval</h2>
<h4><a>Harry Reid warns Dems to take Trump serious before it's too late</a></h4>
<p>The aerial gateway to Sin City may soon go by a new name, as McCarran International <a>Airport</a> will likely be rechristened to honor former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada.</p>
<p>The bustling Silver State <a>air hub</a> would be rebranded as Harry Reid International Airport in tribute to the Democrat and former Senate majority leader, the Associated Press reports. Reid retired from the Senate in 2016, after serving 30 years.</p>
<p>The Clark County Commission approved the move with a unanimous vote on Tuesday, directing staff to file a name change request with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The resolution answers longtime calls to rename the transit hub.</p>
