<h3>4. Depression and Anxiety</h3>
<a>stress</a> can cause brain fog. Those experiencing depression may have difficulty thinking through problems or remembering things. Under chronic stress, our bodies flood our systems with
<a>hormones</a> that keep our nervous system on high alert. And this can negatively affect all of our organs, including our brain.

<p>Finally, some patients have found improvements in brain fog symptoms with some home remedies and lifestyle changes. These include:</p>
<li>Avoiding common distractions.</li>
<li>Establishing a strong support system.</li>
<li>Stress-reducing practices, such as <a>meditation</a> and yoga.</li>
<li>Learning personal limits and respecting them to avoid feelings of <a>burnout</a>.</li>
<li>Using reminders, including diaries, calendars, Post-it notes, cell phone alerts, and lists.</li>
<li>Learning when cognitive skills are sharpest and completing important tasks during those times.</li>
<li>Keeping a food log and paying attention to whether eating certain foods has an effect on cognitive function.</li>
<li>Playing mind strengthening games, such as word or matching games, puzzles, and crosswords.</li>
<p>The right clinician can help you learn how to reduce, cope with, and manage your brain fog.</p>

<p>I had been in this scenario before but never in the middle of the night, where it was much quieter with fewer distractions and fewer other pressing issues to attend to as a resident.</p>
<p>I went to the child’s bedside and examined him. It was clear he had little brain function, and his imaging study showed the markings of lack of oxygen. It was clear the prognosis was not favorable.</p>
<p>I looked over at the parents sitting on the bench by his bed. Their eyes, bloodshot and teary, were staring right at me. Their eyes were pleading. They wanted to be told the opposite of what their hearts already knew. </p>
<p>We sat there for hours together – I still am not sure how long it was. I did not say a word.</p>
<p>At first, I felt I was acting inappropriately for a doctor. But I could not think of what to say nor what to do. I did not say anything. I did not do anything.</p>
<p>I realized I was doing what they needed now – at this moment. I was bearing witness to their indescribable pain.</p>
<p>Bearing witness to the pain of others helps them to acknowledge the reality of the pain and allows us the space to submerge into the pain. It is the only way to survive the inevitable suffering of life events. </p>
<p>We are neighbors and part of a larger community. We all experience joy, <a>fear</a>, and sadness. We all have wants, needs, and hopes for the future. But life can bring tragedy and pain, and it is important we stand and hold space for one another. </p>
<p>When the sun arose, the parents thanked me for sitting with them. The mother has since sent me cards over the years. And I learned a great deal about my role as a physician and human. </p>
<p>You will never regret being present for others in their times of pain. </p>

<h1> Living With Chronic Illness </h1>
<h2> Suffering from chronic illness can change our lives in significant ways. </h2>
<ul> <li>Chronic disease can change the quality of lives. </li> <li>Chronic disease is often invisible to those around us. </li> <li>We must hold hope and have compassion for ourselves while we search for answers. </li> </ul>
<p>They describe stories of their visits and being told that it was due to stress, <a>anxiety</a>, or <a>depression</a>. At times, they are told it is because of their age or even their weight. This seems to happen disproportionately to women. </p>
<p>When we suffer physically for a long time and when physical symptoms change the way we live our lives, it is no surprise our mental health is affected.</p>
<p>These illnesses are often invisible, though not always. When not obvious to those around us, we may feel obligated to repeatedly tell people about how we feel and why we cannot participate at a level that we wish we could. </p>
<p>Our lives are compromised.</p>
<p>But we know that is not always true.</p>
<p>Basic labs and testing are usually normal and too often the investigation stops there.</p>
<p>It takes curiosity and a side of compassion and <a>empathy</a> to continue to pursue answers for those that are suffering. There are answers to be had and there is usually a common root that is causing the continued and persistent symptoms.</p>
<p>When we suffer, we need—and deserve—validation. When we are validated and believed, we are motivated to find ways to dive deep into our bodies and figure out what is happening and how best to advocate for ourselves. </p>
<p>Advocating for ourselves means we learn how to present our symptoms to physicians while at the same time recognizing their limitations in our current health care system. </p>
<p>We can also feel comfortable to ask in return what the physician’s initial thoughts and concerns are with regards to our health and what the initial plan for diagnosis may be. </p>

<p>Picture a cartoon showing a newborn baby emerging from the womb. He rubs his eyes, looks up at the doctor, and utters two words: “Now what?”</p>
<a>anxiety</a> can occur at any time and at any age and can even become downright insidious and painful. Experts in human behavior have long theorized that being squeezed from our mother’s uterus is one of the most
<a>traumatic</a> incidents of our lifetime. Everything as we had formally known it is suddenly gone. Those weeks and months of calm and quiet, sheltered in the lazy,
<a>guilt</a>-free privacy of the womb, are ripped away when a doctor’s cold rubber glove grabs us and pulls us into the glaring light of this harsh reality called life. We literally get slapped into a new world.

<p>We all encounter struggles. They might arrive in the form of an illness, a <a>divorce</a>, the death of a loved one, a job loss, an <a>addiction</a>, or pick a struggle, any struggle. They often harshly slap us.</p>
<ul><li>What was the trauma meant to bring into my life?</li> <li>Why did this happen?</li> <li>What am I supposed to learn from it?</li> </ul>
<p>The difficulties, of course, come without warning. The rewards come through discovering appropriate lessons and flourishing. </p>
<p>If there’s one basic thing I’ve learned, it’s this: Problems don’t happen to us. They happen for us.</p>
<a>positive thinking</a>, and that suggests a huge step forward.
<p>Let’s take the metaphor to another stage. Let’s see if you can define exactly where you are in your struggle by answering these questions:</p>
<li>What is your empty plate? What are you losing? What is being taken away from you?</li>
<li>What is your fork? What are you holding onto that you have previously learned? What gives you hope?</li>
<li>What is your napkin? Who and what can you count on to catch you if and when you fall?</li>
<li>What is the dessert that is coming? What is on the menu for your future?</li>

<p>Many of us have heard about the importance of living with purpose. We often associate that with the type of job we have or our work. Although that may be part of it, I see living with purpose as being able to express who we are in everything we do.</p>
<h3>What is living with purpose?</h3>
<h3>You're more valuable to yourself and others when you operate as a whole self and purposeful self.</h3>
<a>anxious</a>. The less whole you feel, the fewer options for responses you will have, and the more susceptible to feeling vulnerable and helpless you will be.

<h1> Weathering the Storm </h1>
<h2> Failure destroys some people. Others rise from the ashes, only to come back stronger. A guide to surviving tough times. </h2>
<p> By Bruce Grierson published May 1, 2009 - last reviewed on December 20, 2020 </p>
<a>loneliness</a> of having so little expected of me, and the pain of being overlooked and forgotten," as he put it to the assembly, was time for careful
<a>career</a> for which others thought he was the most ill-suited—poetry.
<p>The voltage that shot through the plainspoken language was unlike anything Schultz had produced. He called the collection, simply, Failure. On its cover: a bent nail in a board. Last year, it won the Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<a>rage</a> spilled into the streets in 10 countries.
<a>conscientious</a> and working hard—the formula our parents, and their parents, took to the bank.
<a>wisdom</a>. Some psychologists, like the University of Virginia's Jonathan Haidt, go even further, arguing that adversity, setbacks, and even
<a>trauma</a> may actually be necessary for people to be happy, successful, and fulfilled. "
<a>Post-traumatic growth</a>," it's sometimes called. Its observers are building a solid foundation under the anecdotes about wildly successful people who credit their accomplishments to earlier failures that pushed them to the edge of the abyss.
<a>bias</a>" drives learning, at least from teenagehood on up.
<a>spirituality</a>, and legacy. When one dimension fails us—we lose "achievement," say, when we're laid off—the remaining three get stronger.
<p>"Failing better" boils down to three things. It's a matter of controlling our emotions, adjusting our thinking, and recalibrating our beliefs about ourselves and what we can do in the world.</p>
<p>People who believe intelligence is fixed are less resilient. If you don't believe you can learn anything from your mistakes, you won't welcome failure with open arms.</p>
<a>self-esteem</a> that short-changes it all."
<p>But the great payoff in failing is it gives us another chance, as Alex Trebek encourages his Jeopardy contestants who risk everything and crash down to zero to "start building." To begin again from scratch is itself part of the American script.</p>
<a>fear</a> everyone had, and were
<a>grateful</a> for having the entree to talk about.
<p>"It's interesting how many people are coming up to me and talking about their relationship with failure," he says. "Everyone thinks they're a failure. The only people who don't are the ones who really are."</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Aquamethods/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Some people learn from failure and bounce back stronger. For others, failure destroys them. Be one of the ones who rise from the ashes. </p>
<a>embarrassment</a> today makes for an entertaining story tomorrow.
<p>3. Feel guilt, not shame.</p>
<a>Martin Seligman</a> advocates disputation, in which you think of your mind as a courtroom where negative thoughts are instantly put on trial.
<p>5. Ask not what the world can do for you... </p>
<p>6. Scale down your expectations for yourself.</p>
<a>goals</a> you set for yourself, then one way to avoid failing is to revise those now-outdated goals. That way, instead of failing on a stage you once mastered, you're still succeeding on a more modest stage.
<p>7. Harness the Bridget Jones Effect.</p>
<a>optimistic</a> and less hostile.
<p>8. Don't blame yourself.</p>
<p>Failure is an opportunity to change course. Seize it.</p>

<h1> The Art of Resilience </h1>
<h2> Research on resilience breaks down the myth that a troubled childhood leaves us emotionally crippled as an adult. </h2>
<p> By Hara Estroff Marano published May 1, 2003 - last reviewed on June 9, 2016 </p>
<p>Resilient people do not let adversity define them. They find resilience by moving towards a goal beyond themselves, transcending pain and <a>grief</a> by perceiving bad times as a temporary state of affairs.</p>
<a>traumas</a> in your life. In reality you have considerable capacity for strength, although you might not be wholly aware of it.
<p>Resilient people don't walk between the raindrops; they have scars to show for their experience. They struggle—but keep functioning anyway. Resilience is not the ability to escape unharmed. It is not about magic.</p>
<a>discrimination</a> and poverty.
<a>alcoholism</a> and abuse in the homes they grew up in. Of the remaining two-thirds, many were troubled as teens, typically turning to petty
<a>crime</a>. But by the time they reached their 30s and 40s, they had pulled themselves together, determined to not repeat their parents' lives.
<a>self-esteem</a>. Troubled families make their children feel powerless and bad about themselves. Resilience is the capacity for a person to maintain self-esteem despite the powerful influence of the parents.
<a>conscience</a>. Resilient children often hang out with families of untroubled peers. As adults, the resilient children of alcoholics marry into stable, loving families with whom they spend a great deal of time.
<p>Survivors cultivate insight, the mental habit of asking themselves penetrating questions and giving honest answers. They also take the initiative. They take charge of problems, stretching and testing themselves.</p>
<p>Relationships foster resilience, Wolin contends. Resilient people do the active give-and-take work necessary to derive emotional gratification from others.</p>
<p>There are lessons in her tale for everyone, Wolin insists. You re-examine your life story to see how heroic your acts were as a child. You go back to an incident, find the strengths, and build self-esteem from the achievement.</p>
<p>Psychologist Edith Grotberg, Ph.D., believes that everyone needs reminders of the strengths they have. She urges people to cultivate resilience by thinking along three lines:</p>
<li> I Have: strong relationships, structure, rules at home, role models; these are external supports that are provided; </li>
<li> I Am: a person who has hope and faith, cares about others, is proud of myself; these are inner strengths that can be developed; </li>
<li> I Can: communicate, solve problems, gauge the temperament of others, seek good relationships—all interpersonal and problem-solving skills that are acquired. </li>

<p>When a threat arrives, we tend to focus our initial <a>attention</a> on it. As we narrow our attention, the threat is magnified, and our sense of <a>anxiety</a> heightens.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick self-assessment. Answer the following questions as Generally True (GT) or Generally False (GF):</p>
<li>I am able to adapt when changes occur.</li>
<li>I can deal with whatever comes my way.</li>
<li>I try to see the humorous side of things when I am faced with problems.</li>
<li>Having to cope with stress can make me stronger.</li>
<li>I tend to bounce back after illness, injury or other hardships.</li>
<li>I believe I can achieve my <a>goals</a>, even if there are obstacles.</li>
<li>Under pressure, I stay focused and think clearly.</li>
<li>I am not easily discouraged by failure.</li>
<li>I think of myself as a strong person when dealing with life’s challenges and difficulties.</li>
<li>I am able to handle unpleasant or painful feelings like sadness, <a>fear</a>, and <a>anger</a>.</li>
<p>If you answer ‘GT’ to most of the questions (adapted from the <a>Connors-Davidson Brief Resilience Scale</a>), you may consider yourself a resilient individual.</p>
<a>psychological resilience</a> has been around for a while. Like other big concepts in psychology (such as
<a>For instance</a>, at-risk children demonstrate resilience if they nevertheless achieve certain social competencies (e.g. the ability to trust others) or developmental tasks (e.g.: school success).
<a>Ann Masten and Norman Garmezy</a> focused their study on three related resilience phenomena: good outcomes in high-risk children, sustained competence in children under stress, and recovery from
<a>trauma</a>. They defined psychological resilience as, “the process of, capacity for, or outcome of successful adaptation despite challenging or threatening circumstances.”
<a>well-known study </a>conducted after 9-11 examined the prevalence of resilience (defined as having either one or no

<a>dynamic, reciprocal process</a>, responsive to circumstances and contextual conditions. In a
<a>adolescence</a>, indicators of child resilience, such as the behavioral and
<a>emotional self-regulation</a> characteristic of good mental health, and the cognitive
<a>self-regulation</a> characteristic of high intelligence contributed to later competence.” And yet, the authors note, “the effects of such individual resilience did not overcome the effects of high environmental challenge, such as poor
<a>parenting</a>, antisocial peers, low-resource communities, and economic hardship.“ Social conditions matter.

<a>attachment</a> has long been
<a>linked in the literature</a> to higher resilience, in part as it
<a>self-efficacy</a> and self-care practices. Masten and Garmezy famously
<a>found</a>, “Children who experience chronic adversity fare better or recover more successfully when they have a positive relationship with a competent adult.”
<a>childhood</a> relations play an important role in resilience, current
<a>social support</a> is probably even more important, and research
<a>suggests</a> that both the size and quality of the social support network are linked to resilience. Social support aids resilience via multiple psychological and behavioral mechanisms.
<a>For example</a>, it may motivate people to adopt healthy behaviors, help them appraise
<a>stressful</a> events as less threatening, and improve their self-esteem.
<a>literature</a>, perhaps the best way for us to understand resilience is as a “bidirectional relationship between systems-level resilience…and individual resilience.”
<a>In other words</a>, one is more likely to choose effective strategies (such as
<p>The take-home message from this rough summary is two-fold:</p>
<p>Second, some aspects of your resilience are indeed up to you. The decisions you make during stressful times matter. Among the most useful are:</p>
<li>Rather than isolate—nurture and invest in your social relationship (intimate, familial, communal); be useful to others.</li>
<li>Rather than self-flagellation—increase self-care; become intentional about incorporating into your routine those activities that give you a sense of meaning, joy, peace, and solace.</li>

<h1> How to Build Your Resilience </h1>
<h2> Resilience is more like a muscle than you think. </h2>
<p> Posted September 18, 2017 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Resilience? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The band Journey tells us to not stop believin’, Kelly Clarkson preaches what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and of course, Gloria Gaynor will survive. What do they have in common? A crazy little thing called <a>resilience</a>.</p>
<a>stress</a> and misfortune. The troubles you face may be long-term, like having an
<a>addiction</a> or financial struggles. It also may be a short, dramatic strike of tragedy—a life-threatening illness or a
<a>setbacks are exclusively individually based</a>, when in fact they often come from systemic barriers, like
<a>racism</a>, sexism, economic inequality, or other injustices.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: BK on Flickr</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Tip #1: Let yourself feel lousy every once in a while. </h3>
<p>You heard that right. We’ve all heard the cliché encouragement: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!” But rah-rah motivational slogans often feel useless, like sunglasses on a cloudy day.</p>
<p>True resilience doesn’t mean you never get discouraged. If you never encounter painful struggle, you never get to discover your resilience. This is why pain is almost universal among the resilient—it happens.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Know that you’re the only one who can control your fate. </h3>
<p>In 1955, the psychologist Dr. Emmy Werner began a study that would last more than 40 years. She and her colleagues began to follow every child—almost 700 of them—born that year on the Hawai’ian island of Kaua’i.</p>
<p>Again, it’s complicated. Some of it was luck, some of it was having at least one emotionally stable and loving family member to look out for them, and some of it was finding an emotional home in a civic organization, at school, or at church.</p>
<p>How can you apply this to your life? In short, take decisive action. It’s tempting to use fate as an excuse for your future, but take control as best you can.</p>
<h3>Tip #3: Keep yourself value-centered. </h3>
<a>having a moral compass</a>—an internal system of values and ethics—goes along with higher resilience. Strong ethics and
<a>morality</a> seems to give purpose to our lives, which in turn gives rise to resilience. So maybe in the bigger picture that Boston cream doughnut was nothing to get worked up about?
<h3>Tip #4: Recharge with a workout. </h3>

<p>Exercise is often a mini metaphor for life’s larger challenges: We set short-term goals that build mental momentum to reach larger goals in the long term. Pushing through on both good and bad days is resilience in action.</p>
<a>motivation</a> levels, which directly relieves stress and puts us in a more positive mindset. It’s the ultimate recharge, with the added bonus of feeling a little better about the aforementioned Ben Jerry’s.
<h3>Tip #5: Don’t set unrealistic goals. </h3>
<a>career</a> goals for themselves. If we set too many lofty goals, when we fall short of them we will blame that failure on ourselves. So keep the scale of your goals reasonable. Challenge yourself and aim high, of course, but be fair to yourself.
<h3>Tip #6: Express your feelings. </h3>
<a>burnout</a>. They were able to continue the tough emotional work their job required. So tell people you trust how you really feel. Be honest and authentic rather than trying to please everyone and you’ll come out feeling relieved and sane.
<p>It’s only when obstacles arise that your resilience skills are called on. Even Barry Manilow made it through the rain. And so can you, with a secret weapon called resilience. </p>
