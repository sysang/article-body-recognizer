<p>The achievement is a step forward in scientists' desire to harness the fusion that occurs at the heart of the Sun and reproduce it on Earth in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Should they succeed, fusion power will provide the world with a safe, sustainable, environmentally responsible and abundant source of energy.</p>
<p>Fusion is a cleaner process as it creates no radioactive waste, and proceeds with light and abundant materials such as hydrogen, which can be obtained from seawater, rather than expensive and rare elements, such as uranium or plutonium.</p>
<p>Theoretically, one liter of water could provide enough raw material for fusion to produce as much energy as the combustion of 300 liters of oil.</p>
<p>Nuclear fusion devices such as KSTAR, known as tokamaks, replicate plasma, a state of matter created under the massive gravitational pressure and intense heat of stars like <a>the Sun</a>.</p>
<p>In this super-hot stellar plasma, hydrogen atoms smash together at high velocities creating helium atoms. In the process, these fusions create the vast amounts of energy radiated by stars.</p>
<p>To copy this, tokamaks—often referred to as "artificial suns"—must heat heavy hydrogen (deuterium) with lasers to temperatures as high as millions of degrees Fahrenheit, confining it within powerful magnetic fields.</p>
<p>To generate fusion energy, these artificial suns have contained the plasma at these temperatures long enough for atomic nuclei to begin smashing together.</p>
<a>the Sun</a> when fusion processes occur (about 60 million °F), but because researchers here on Earth can't replicate the intense pressure generated by gravity at the heart of a star, temperatures in an artificial
<a>sun</a> must be much greater to compensate.
<p>That means heating plasma to at least 180 million °F in a tokamak for atomic nuclei to smash together rapidly enough to kick-start nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>KSTAR was the first device to break this limit, generating these temperatures in plasma for just 1.5 seconds in 2018.</p>
<p>The team improved on this 2019, maintaining plasma at this temperature for 8 seconds. KSTAR upped the ante on this again in December 2020 by generating plasma at this temperature and maintaining it for 20 seconds.</p>
<p>While KSTAR's new record can't beat EAST's record in terms of time, what the researchers on the project have managed to do is heat plasma to this important temperature of 180 million °F.</p>
<p>The KSTAR team was also able to constrain this plasma for a record 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The Korea Institute of Fusion Energy will now seek to improve KSTAR to increase the time that it can maintain plasma at a temperature of 180 million °F. The aim will be to achieve containment of this super-hot plasma for at least 300 seconds.</p>
<p>Correction 11/26/21, 9:00 a.m. ET: This article was updated to clarify that deuterium is heavy hydrogen.</p>
<p>NASA, which wants to build a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, announced Friday that it is accepting proposals for an initial system design.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that NASA is working with U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory to create the power source, independent from the sun, for missions to the moon by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>"Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp," Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted until February 19. The plan is to build the reactor on Earth, then send it to the moon.</p>
<p>Fission surface power systems could provide sustained power no matter the moon's environmental conditions, according to AP. If the power plant is successful on the moon, NASA's next goal would be to put one on Mars.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>Additionally, when launched from Earth to the moon, it should fit inside a 12-foot (4-meter) diameter cylinder that's 18 feet (6 meters) long. It should not weigh more than 13,200 pounds (6,000 kilograms).</p>
<p>The car-sized rover landed on Mars in February and has remained active on the red planet.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>China Warns Joe Biden's Nuclear Submarine Pact 'Intensifies Arms Race'</h1><div> By John Feng <time>On 9/16/21 at 5:52 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<a>Australia</a>, seeing the new pact—called AUKUS—as pointedly targeting Beijing and its growing military capabilities.
<p>Unveiling the new trilateral security partnership, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the naval vessels would be built in Adelaide, and that Australia had no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons or a civil nuclear capability.</p>
<a>Boris Johnson</a> described the undertaking as "one of the most complex and technically demanding projects in the world," while President
<a>Joe Biden</a> said the three countries had taken the "history step" to formalize their alliance in recognition of "the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term."
<p>The AUKUS leaders did not mention China in their remarks, but the regional implications of the new defense pact appeared to have been felt across the Pacific.</p>
<p>Zhao called the export of "highly sensitive" nuclear submarine technology "extremely irresponsible behavior."</p>
<p>In a pre-announcement press briefing, senior Biden officials said the new partnership was "not aimed or about any one country."</p>
<p>They stressed the "exceptional" and "one-off" nature of the decision to share sensitive propulsion technology with Australia—a "time-tested" American ally, according to a transcript released by the <a>White House</a>.</p>
<p>The administration officials called the establishment of AUKUS a fundamental decision "that binds decisively Australia to the United States and Great Britain for generations."</p>
<a>People's Liberation Army</a> Navy already posses a small fleet of nuclear-powered and -capable submarines, which analysts say already constitutes a credible sea-based nuclear deterrent.
<p>In 2016, Australia signed a deal with <a>French</a> contractor Naval Group—worth 90 billion Australian dollars ($65.7 billion)—to produce a fleet of diesel submarines. The latest U.S. and U.K. involvement means the agreement will be scrapped.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by Australia's <a>ABC</a> News, Naval Group called the announcement a "major disappointment."</p>
<p>"Tonight, Beijing will have realised the pressure on Australia has triggered a response. This is a powerful answer to those who thought the US was pulling back and the propaganda claiming Washington wasn't a reliable ally.</p>
