<h1> My Evolution From Childless Woman to Unabashed Elder </h1>
<h2> One woman's journey from marginalization to single, lusty elderhood. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Hillary Peralta/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>On the cusp of my seventieth birthday, I’ve become an unabashed, childfree elder, a vigorous and vital woman who’s reclaimed her body just as it has begun its decline.</p>
<p>I found my voice in time to be well heard. My heart is wide open to care for more people than I’ll ever meet, in ways I never imagined. My life now hangs together as a fairly well-integrated whole, flaws and all.</p>
<a>infertility</a> treatments, with sex on demand and hopes dashed by monthly failures to conceive. Over the years after we quit trying, my decades-long
<a>marriage</a> grew ever more distant. I found myself single again at 64.
<a>singlehood</a>, especially as a non-mom, is shocking and stark. Once part of a network of twosomes, I became a lone ranger, rounding out the odd-numbered table in hopes of staying in touch with those couples that stuck with me through the
<a>attention</a> on the other couples. Instead of clamming up and labeling myself inferior, I worked hard to find my voice and befriend a small cadre of likewise single compatriots.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Laura Fehrman/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>You might say I fell in love with me. I think that’s a sign I’d graduated from fledgling to full-throated elder, ready to grab life again and squeeze out all of what’s left. Finally, I feel whole and healthy.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in urban, rural, and suburban environments and changed careers at least half a dozen times. So many transitions, becoming and unbecoming who I was and now am.</p>
<a>Therapy</a> supported deep and sustained work to heal the wounds of infertility and feelings of failure. I carried these wounds over years of losing loved ones to mothering, then grandmothering. Those were dark,
<a>lonely</a> days, much more so than those spent living alone during a pandemic.
<a>online dating</a>. This ghastly forum of public exposure offered options to learn, with often flattering, yet sometimes brutal feedback from prospective matches, and a means to discover what’s crucial in matters of the heart.
<p>My “divorce virginity” was lost at age 67, and I rediscovered the lusty physicality I’d feared was lost. I no longer compromise who I am to find the love I now generate from within.</p>

<a>wisdom</a> to take time out to reflect. Or seek guidance from those who might know. My own elders’ wisdom has proven particularly powerful.
<p>When we find the courage to speak up about not having kids, we change lives—our own and those who open their hearts to hear and heal. We see one another and discover what it feels like to belong.</p>
<p>With so much high-quality information available on so many platforms, we’re teetering on the tipping point of change. I just might live to see the day when it’s considered perfectly normal to be an adult who doesn’t have kids.</p>
