<h2> Why Workplace Dynamics Matter </h2>
<div> <h3> What makes employees happy at work? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are good team dynamics? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are there different approaches to workplace conflict? </h3> </div>
<a>shy</a> away from conflict and others seem to revel in it.
<div> <h3> Why is workplace happiness declining? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why does workplace bullying happen? </h3> </div>
<a>bullying</a> can happen for a wide variety of reasons—for example, the
<a>bully may have high levels of narcissism</a> or
<a>workplace bullying is a kind of “degradation ceremony”</a> that punishes the transgressor while strengthening the bonds between other in-group members.
<div> <h3> What does it mean to bring your “whole self” to work? </h3> </div>
<a>“bring their whole selves”</a> to work. In theory, this means that employees do not feel pressured to hide elements of their
<div> <h3> Should I “bring my whole self” to work? </h3> </div>
<a>authenticity</a>. Instead, such experts recommend bringing your “best self” to work, rather than your
<a>“whole self,”</a> by focusing on putting your best foot forward while staying true to your values.
<div> <h3> What is psychological safety? </h3> </div>

<h2> How to Identify an Unhealthy Workplace </h2>
<p>The term “toxic workplace” can be used to describe any workplace in which negative dynamics harm employee well-being, foster conflict between coworkers, or slow productivity. Possible signs of a toxic workplace include:</p>
<li> <p>Verbal abuse. Insulting language is frequently used, employees are belittled or threatened by superiors, disagreement is not tolerated, or malicious rumors are spread.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Poor communication. Priorities are disputed, instructions are vague, or employees do not feel comfortable communicating bad news to superiors for fear of a negative response.</p> </li>
<p>Imbalanced workloads. Some employees have little to do, while others must work extra hours on their off-time to keep up with their workload. This can breed resentment among coworkers and may lead to overburdened employees leaving a company.</p>
<a>laughing</a> is rare, or no one seems to care about what they’re doing, it will likely have long-term effects on morale and well-being.
<div> <h3> What are the consequences of working in a toxic environment? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>, or worsened physical health; many workers also experience burnout, losing their drive and feeling unable to complete even basic tasks.
<div> <h3> How can I tell if my job is bad for me? </h3> </div>
<a>toxic work environment</a> and would potentially be better off searching for a new job.
<div> <h3> Why don’t people report workplace harassment? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can bosses be abusive? </h3> </div>
<a>attention</a> or attempts at sexual coercion can also be classified as abusive behavior on the part of a supervisor.
<div> <h3> Can I fix a toxic workplace environment? </h3> </div>
<p>Employees should, first and foremost, prioritize their own well-being. This means getting enough sleep, engaging in self-care behaviors, and/or <a>seeing a therapist</a> to discuss feelings of anxiety or sadness.</p>
<p>When all else fails, setting firm boundaries such as leaving at a set time each day, or not checking email on off-hours can reduce the likelihood that the negative effects of a toxic workplace will bleed into other areas of one's life.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I know when it’s time to quit my job? </h3> </div>
<a>quit a job</a> is rarely an easy, black-and-white decision—all jobs have pros and cons, and nearly everyone will experience difficult periods at work. However, if you feel as if
<h2> How to Improve Workplace Dynamics </h2>
<div> <h3> How can organizations improve employee mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>self-help</a> programming may also be used to teach employees coping mechanisms and address minor problems, such as communication challenges or coping with disappointment. 
<div> <h3> How can companies foster psychological safety? </h3> </div>
<a>reinforce a culture of psychological safety</a> by prioritizing trust and transparency—sharing the
<div> <h3> How can managers improve work environments? </h3> </div>
<a>empathy</a>—always remembering that they’re humans with lives outside of work, rather than productivity robots. Many experts also advise that managers make an effort to
<a>handle their own stress productively</a>; shutting down or lashing out at employees can foster negative feelings and decrease team morale.
<div> <h3> How can managers address bullying amongst their staff? </h3> </div>
<a>education</a> in their workplace, and advocate that bad actors across all levels of the organization be held accountable.
<div> <h3> When should I take a mental health day? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How should I respond to a difficult boss? </h3> </div>
<a>When dealing with a cruel and controlling boss</a>, it’s important—albeit challenging—to avoid directly expressing
<div> <h3> What can I do at home to improve my well-being at work? </h3> </div>
<a>Getting enough sleep</a>, eating a healthy
<a>diet</a>, and taking time to exercise can all improve your mood and make you more
<a>resilient</a> to the daily stressors of work life.
<a>Talking to a therapist</a> about feelings of burnout or other common on-the-job struggles, such as

<h2> An experience we often try to avoid has important lessons to teach us. </h2>
<ul> <li>Most of us want to avoid failure, but we can learn a lot from the experience.</li> <li>Failure can teach us what matters most to us; it can point to what we need to be successful.</li> <li>Failure is an opportunity for a fresh start.</li> </ul>
<h3>1. Failure shows us what we are missing.</h3>
<p>When we fail at something, it’s often because success required something we did not have. It might be a certain skill or capability we don’t possess or even a set of resources we do not have.</p>

<li>Clemency, says Seneca, is a leader's most important quality.</li>

<h1> The Work of Rest: Investing in Yourself With a Sabbatical </h1>
<h2> Reboot your New Year by doing less. </h2>
<li>It has become a cultural norm to feel that rest and play are the enemy—they are slothful, guilty pleasures—but our inner child knows better.</li>
<li>Rest is essential to keeping one's mind and body fertile, creative, and well. </li>
<li>Everyone is unique with varied needs and circumstances, so all Sabbath moments will look different. </li>
<p>As the New Year approaches, we resolve to be changed—healthier, more patient parents, more present partners, and to embrace a life that fills us with joy and meaning. What if one change could help make all the others possible?</p>
<p>That is what the last year has brought me. And, I hope sharing my story can help make your coming year a little brighter.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>As we resolve to make our lives healthier, happier, and more full of joy and meaning, a few small changes can have a big impact.</div> <div>Source: Getty Images</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Stepping Into the Unknown</h3>
<p>For months now, I’ve been on a slow walk back to myself. What I call a sabbatical.</p>
<p>Other times, a mental craving would pop into my head and say, “I want to paint!” or “Can we dance?” like a buried child within me, learning to trust that maybe this time I would listen to her longings.</p>
<a>gaslighting</a> that child and creating a path to a life of
<p>“What are you going to do?” “What’s your plan for the time?” Baked into their questions was the clear assumption that I should achieve something with my time.</p>
<p>“Maybe a book!?” multiple people suggested.</p>
<p>I wanted to agree. I wanted to promise them something, a product to prove my worth at the end of a period of rest. Some type of tangible evidence that I wasn’t completely wasting my time, and by proxy, that I was not a waste.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Small moments of rest and connection with nature and music can help create a Sabbath moment.</div> <div>Source: Getty Images</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Resting in a Busy World</h3>
<p>We expect so much of our minds, but they are not meant to be machines, and their highest purpose is not to merely crank out work as instructed but to understand complexity, human needs. And <a>we need rest </a>to keep them fertile. </p>
<p>But I also knew that they were right in some ways. That I would need some structure to be able to truly relax.</p>
<p>With this, I decided on my curriculum—a checklist of sorts. Each day I would, in any order, attempt to complete the following activities.</p>
<li>Play (e.g., do or create for the sheer enjoyment)</li>
<li>Relax (e.g., nap, read quietly on the couch)</li>
