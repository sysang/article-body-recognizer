<p>As the Taliban prepares to announce the formation of a new government, the status of north-central Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the sole outpost of resistance to Taliban rule, hangs in the balance.</p>
<a>erupted</a> in Kabul amidst reports that the Taliban had seized control over the National Resistance Front (NRF) opposition stronghold. Rumours swirled that NRF founder Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh had fled to Tajikistan.
<p>Saleh <a>refuted</a> these rumours on Friday afternoon via a voice message to the <a>BBC</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm calling you from the Panjshir Valley, from my base," the messages said. "I'm with our commanders, with our political leaders. Of course, it's a difficult situation. They have suffered casualties. We have suffered casualties."</p>
<a>s</a>aid has shuttered telecommunications, electricity, and inflows of medicine, while preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the region.
<a>confidently predicted</a> that "it is impossible for Taliban rule to last long in Afghanistan," due to the unacceptability of the Islamic Emirate to the Afghan people.
<p>He explained this prediction in our interview.</p>
<a> stated</a> that he was 80% confident that a political solution could be achieved. This fueled speculation that Panjshir Valley would remain free from Taliban rule, much as it did from 1996-2001.
<a> stated</a> that he was 60% hopeful that a resolution could be found through talks with "ulema [a body of Muslim scholars] and former jihadi leaders." On September 1, the head of the Taliban guidance commission Amir Khan Muttaqi
<a>admitted</a> that talks with the NRF had broken down, paving the way for renewed violence.
<p>When asked about the nature of talks between the NRF and the Taliban, Saleh challenged Muhajid's assertions, and argued that they dealt with a much more expansive range of issues than the future of Panjshir Valley.</p>
<p>"We aren't negotiating for the fate and status of Panjshir Valley," he said. "The resistance is for values and rights. Zabiullah Mujahid's wording is thus wrong."</p>
<p>After Saleh articulated the NRF's goals, our interview turned to Pakistan's involvement in the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Saleh has been a long-standing critic of Pakistan's involvement in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"Pakistan can't hide anymore," Saleh tweeted recently. "They are in the war and on the side of the terrorist Taliban."</p>
<p>In our interview, he delivered a damning indictment of Pakistan's Afghanistan policies.</p>
<p>"I am tired of saying how the international community should sanction and punish Pakistan," Saleh said. "The Western intelligence agencies know well how deep Pakistan is involved in sponsoring extremism and terrorism. You may ask them."</p>
<a>recently lambasted</a> President
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, claiming that it converted the U.S. from a "superpower to a mini-power."
<p>He expanded on that argument in our interview.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to his frustrations with President Biden, Saleh <a>has </a>welcomed words of support from Republican lawmakers, such as Florida Congressman Michael Waltz, and was <a>interviewed</a> by <a>Sean Hannity</a> on <a>Fox News</a> on August 28.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a>'s February 2020 deal with the Taliban played a bigger role in precipitating the Taliban's seizure of Kabul, he did not offer his opinion.
<p>"I don't know," he responded.</p>
<a>was non-committal</a> about Russian assistance.
<p>This was not surprising, as he had been highly critical of the Moscow-format peace talks, which made the Taliban regular visitors to Russia in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>Saleh was more optimistic about what Western countries could do to help the NRF, saying, "If there is a will, there will always be ways."</p>

<h1>TikTok Feeds Covid Misinformation to Kids Minutes after They Sign Up</h1>
<h2>'He gets the va**ine and he dies after three days! What do you think?'</h2>
<p>Although TikTok says it prohibits children younger than 13 from using the platform, children as young as nine were easily able to sign on with no coaching from an adult.</p>
<p>A Slippery Slope: Misinformation flows fast and free on TikTok</p>
<p>The spokesperson also provided information from TikTok's COVID-19 information webpage, as well as its community guidelines, its first quarter 2021 transparency report, and a blog post about "age-appropriate" experiences on TikTok.</p>
<p>The false claims that TikTok fed to the nine young participants in NewsGuard's investigation included these claims:</p>
<p>● COVID-19 vaccines kill people</p>
<p>● COVID-19 vaccines are "fake"</p>
<p>● The "damage" of COVID-19 vaccines is being "hidden"</p>
<p>● Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19</p>
<p>● Eating a charred orange and brown sugar will restore your taste and smell after contracting COVID-19</p>
<p>● COVID-19 vaccines contain graphene oxide</p>
<p>● 80 to 90 percent of COVID-19 patients in Israeli hospitals are fully vaccinated</p>
<p>● Natural immunity to COVID-19 is better than getting the vaccine</p>
<p>● People with O-type blood are less likely to contract COVID-19</p>
<p>● COVID-19 is "the name of the international plan for the control and reduction of populations."</p>
<p>The content, amount, and severity of the COVID-19 misinformation the participants were fed varied, but the danger inherent in feeding it to children was consistent.</p>
<p>After half-an-hour on TikTok, this young teenager was almost exclusively shown misinformation, including anti-vaccine content and anti-government conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>He later said about his experience using TikTok: "After having been on TikTok, I think even more than before that it is a complete waste of time and that it is full of fake news and theories on the [COVID-19] vaccine that might affect people."</p>
<p>Other participants described their feelings before the exercise as "calm," "curious," "normal," "expectant," "worried," and "interested." After the exercise, their feelings included "surprised," "dizzy," "tired," "satisfied," and "cautious."</p>
<p>TikTok's rapid growth has been fueled by the young</p>
<a>130 million monthly active</a> users in the
<a>Bloomberg</a> has reported that approximately 30 percent of French TikTok users are under 18, as are a third of Italian users and nearly one-quarter of German users.
<a>2020</a>, App Annie reported.
<p>Methodology: Simulating typical TikTok activity</p>
<p>From Musical.ly to TikTok: How we got here</p>
<p>Although TikTok says that users must be at least 13 years old to use the app, as noted above, it is easy to circumvent this rule by providing a false date of birth.</p>
<p>Participants were also shown some reliable information and videos by medical professionals, although no distinction was made between these videos and those containing misinformation.</p>
<p>TikTok says that it prohibits "content that's false or misleading, including misinformation related to COVID-19, vaccines, and anti-vaccine disinformation more broadly," according to its <a>COVID-19 information section</a>.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of health misinformation online before TikTok began gaining widespread popularity, and until recently, the app has not been as closely scrutinized as more established platforms such as <a>Facebook</a> and Twitter.</p>

<p>The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</p>
<a>Supreme Court</a> has started to look a lot better for the White House.
<a>thought the country was going in the wrong direction</a>. Resurgent
<a>Republicans</a> were poised to test the
<p>Republican <a>Glenn Youngkin</a>'s victory in Virginia's gubernatorial election did not bode well for Democrats ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, nor did the <a>razor-thin victory</a> by Democratic Governor Phil Murphy in New Jersey.</p>
<p>By Wednesday morning, the Biden presidency appeared to be in real peril.</p>
<p>During the climate summit in Glasgow, Biden had an exchange with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who asked him how he was doing.</p>
<p>Democrats took pride in their ability to pass a bill that would revamp the country's infrastructure, pointing out that the Trump administration was unable to do so.</p>
<a>Adam Schiff</a> tweeted Sunday: "For four years,
<a>Donald Trump</a> and Republicans in Congress proclaimed that it was 'infrastructure week.' They promised a big investment in roads, bridges, and highways. And they never delivered. We did. And that's a Big F-ing Deal."
<a>divide between moderate and progressive Democrats</a> had widened after Biden announced a new framework to the reconciliation package that included less emphasis on climate provisions due to
<a>Senator Joe Manchin's opposition</a> to quickly replacing coal and gas power plants with climate-friendly alternatives.
<p>But on Friday night, moderates suggested they would vote for the Build Back Better Act in its current form after the Congressional Budget Office releases fiscal information by the week of November 15.</p>
<p>Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said in a statement Friday:</p>
<p>On Sunday, Representative Josh Gottheimer, a moderate Democrat from New Jersey, said he <a>expects the CBO score to "match up"</a> with the White House's analysis.</p>
<a>made progress with new pills</a> to treat people with COVID and decrease the risks of the disease. Pfizer on Friday announced that its oral antiviral has an 89 percent efficacy in preventing COVID hospitalizations, while U.K. regulators
<a>approved the use of Merck's molnupiravir</a> on Thursday.
<a>half a million new jobs were added</a> in October, a significant rise from
<p>Another win for Biden this week came when Supreme Court justices <a>Brett Kavanaugh</a> and <a>Amy Coney Barrett</a>—conservatives appointed by Trump—expressed skepticism about the controversial Texas abortion ban that went into effect last month.</p>
<p>On Monday, Kavanaugh and Barrett <a>questioned the structure of the law</a>, suggesting that it was formed in a way that evades federal law and doesn't allow abortion providers to offer a "full constitutional defense."</p>
<p>In early September, Biden condemned the Texas law, saying it "blatantly violates the constitutional right established under Roe v. Wade and upheld as precedent for nearly half a century."</p>
<p>Overall, Biden's hard work to pass his agenda—and some happenstance—turned in his favor, placing him on the cusp of a presidential comeback.</p>
<p>But experts say that the president has to work on keeping the support he has gained as he moves forward.</p>
<p>"Biden will have to work to maintain support and reasonable enthusiasm among progressives and liberal activists," Quirk said on Sunday. "They will be inclined to write the party off as 'no better than the Republicans.'"</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Ron Klein said Sunday the administration must maintain support by addressing the economy and the pandemic.</p>
