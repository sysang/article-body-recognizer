<h1> Daniel Radcliffe will play ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic in biopic</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:02pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:14pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The boy who lived will soon be the man who sang “Eat It.”</p>
<p>Daniel Radcliffe, 32, is playing “the king of spoof” parody musician “Weird Al” Yankovic, 62, in a new biopic. Called “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,” the movie will stream exclusively on the Roku Channel. </p>
<p>“‘WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story’ takes audiences on a truly unbelievable journey through Yankovic’s life and career, from gifted child prodigy to the greatest musical legend of all time.”</p>
<p>“I never thought that I’d make a living being Weird Al,” he told The Post in 2014. “I thought I’d have to grow up and be an adult. That hasn’t happened yet.”</p>
<p>In the past, Radcliffe has said his early success with “Harry Potter” has given him the freedom to explore roles that he connects with — regardless of the paycheck. </p>
<a>told The Post</a> in 2019. “I’ve done comedy onstage, so some people have seen me do it. But not for an audience this wide. So I was really excited to try and show that side of myself as an actor.”
<p>A premiere date for “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story” has not yet been announced. </p>
<h1> Sundance Film Festival cancels in-person event due to Omicron</h1>
<div> January 5, 2022 3:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 5, 2022 4:04pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Sundance Film Festival has been canceled in-person for the second year in a row, organizers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sundance, a high-profile independent fest that kicks off the year in movies, was due to take place in Park City, Utah, from Jan. 20 to 30.</p>
<p>While it will still go in a different form online, just as it did in 2021, this year’s large-scale gathering has been axed due to concerns over the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>It joins the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Grammy Awards and the Critics Choice Awards in either canceling or postponing big comebacks.</p>
<p>The 40th edition of Sundance will still be viewable on its special streaming platform and feature films by high-profile names, such as Lena Dunham and Jesse Eisenberg and a four-hour documentary about Kanye West. </p>
<p>Only instead of getting an ovation on a stage, the stars will likely be filming Zoom “thank you”s from their homes. Again.</p>
