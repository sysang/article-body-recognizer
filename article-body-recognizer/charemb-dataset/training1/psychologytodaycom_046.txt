<h1> The 3 Challenges for Parents of Adult Children With Autism </h1>
<h2> Navigating the differences between manageable struggles and outright avoidance. </h2>
<li>The CDC identified one in 44 children at age 8 in the U.S. with autism. As they reach adulthood, their parents struggle to help them cope. </li>
<li>Adult children with ASD struggle to initiate and complete tasks while internally struggling, yet they are often seen as not caring. </li>
<li>Patience and understanding versus reflexively enabling, go a long way for parents to help their adult children with autism.</li>
<a>depression</a> and anxiety. He lashes out at his parents (and takes his frustrations out on them) because, deep down, he knows there is a short list of people who will love him no matter what–his mom and dad are at the top of it!
<a>stressful</a> to adults on the spectrum.
<h3>Autism in Adult Children Is a Growing Problem</h3>
<p>According to the <a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), combined with my clinical observations over thirty years, the main signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) common in adult children include:</p>
<li>Finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling.</li>
<li>Getting highly <a>anxious</a> about social situations.</li>
<li>Being obsessed with a topic and obsessively talking about it.</li>
<li>Finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on their own.</li>
<li><a>Autistic</a> inertia, which is the notion that when people with ASD stop doing a task, they have a hard time resuming it. Further, once they have started working on a task or project, it can be really difficult to stop.</li>
<li>Seeming blunt, rude, or not interested in others without meaning to.</li>
<li>Finding it hard to say how they feel.</li>
<li>Taking some things very literally.</li>
<li>Not understanding social "rules," such as not talking over people,</li>
<p>All of these above challenges can be synthesized into three main challenges for adult children who are on the spectrum.</p>
<h3>The Three Struggles for Parents of Adult Children With Autism</h3>
<p>1. Losing Sight of the Challenges of ASD</p>
<p>I have worked with many children and adult children who show strong signs of ASD, yet they (and their beleaguered parents) tend to overlook that it is at the core of the challenges related to it. This can occur for varied reasons:</p>
<li>ASD-related struggles become the "not-so-new normal" over many years, and the parents and adult children feel worn down and burnt out from the myriad of related stressors and challenges. </li>
<li> ASD had been diagnosed, but parents minimized or denied it ("We don't want to upset them by saying anything").</li>
<li>The adult child denies or minimizes their ASD because they yearn to feel more neurotypical ("All I have is some <a>ADHD</a>").</li>
<li>They were never formally diagnosed with ASD. Often I have seen situations where ASD "was suggested by someone at their school along the way," but this never led to a formal diagnosis. </li>
<p>2. Communicating About Necessary Tasks and Getting Them Done</p>
<p>Navigating the demands of the neurotypical adult world can be daunting for many adult children (and for their parents as the messengers who get "shot down"). They have a hard time achieving goals that would help them be more independent.</p>
<li>Fewer than 20 percent of college students with autism had graduated or were even on track to graduate five years after high school. That number goes up to 39 percent after the students are seven years out of high school.</li>
<li>Challenges with <a>motivation</a> loom large for adult children on the autistic spectrum. As mentioned above, autistic inertia gets in the way of initiating tasks, resuming them when interrupted, and completing them. </li>
<li>Identify whether it is, "Cannot or Choose Not." Slow down, step back and do your best to objectively ask yourself if your adult child needs to work through a specific struggle on their own or with your support. Don't just rush in and enable. </li>
<li>An autistic person may find it hard to understand their own emotions and those of other people, including their frustrated parents. </li>
<li>Emotions of others are interpreted by subtle messages sent by facial expression, eye contact, and <a>body language</a>. Adult children on the spectrum may find themselves frustrated by not tracking these emotions in others.</li>
<li>Because emotions are often missed or misinterpreted by an autistic person, others may mistakenly perceive them as rude or unfeeling. </li>

<h3>How to Help Adult Children With ASD</h3>
<p>Given the complexity of challenges facing adult children on the spectrum, there is clearly no quick fix. What concerned, supportive parents can do, however, is to:</p>
<li>Embrace the gifts that come with their adult child being <a>neurodiverse</a> and be tuned in to their struggles to reduce a sense of unwittingly expressing blame or <a>shame</a>. </li>
<li>Do what you can to help your adult child on the spectrum get counseling and <a>psychiatric</a> care if warranted. </li>
<li>Be patient and <a>empathetic</a> to their differences–don't be locked into seeing your child's ASD as necessarily a negative thing.</li>

<div> <div> <h1>Theories of Autism</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<p>In this theory, there is a spectrum between hypomentalism, which manifests as autism, and hypermentalism, which manifests as psychosis. Between these poles are more common thinking styles that range from mechanistic to mentalistic. </p>
<p>The theory has its roots in how one’s genes are expressed: Autism results from greater paternal gene expression, and psychosis results from greater maternal gene expression.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the imprinted brain theory? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does the diametric mind theory explain savant syndrome? </h3> </div>
<a>savant syndrome.</a> By contrast, people prone to psychosis may also exhibit remarkable abilities, as increased mentalism may allow verbal and social skills to flourish.
<div> <h3> What evidence supports the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Who developed the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<h2> The Extreme Male Brain </h2>
<p>Research from Baron-Cohen’s team suggests that people with autism may be exposed to more testosterone in utero, which could affect brain development. Other research, however, calls that hypothesis into question.</p>
<div> <h3> What do “systemizing” and “empathizing” mean? </h3> </div>
<p>Systemizing is the tendency to <a>organize the world into systems</a> or develop rules or principles to understand complex systems. Empathizing refers to social skills, understanding others’ emotions, and feeling sympathy and empathy.</p>
<div> <h3> Who developed the extreme male brain theory? </h3> </div>
<p>Previously Baron-Cohen had focused on <a>theory of mind</a> as it related to autism and published the book Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind in 1995.</p>
<div> <h3> What are critiques of the extreme male brain theory? </h3> </div>
<a>sex differences may not exist or be as substantial as needed</a> to support the theory—they may be very small. Assessment tools may also center around topics that boys are socialized to use, such as machines.
<div> <h3> How does the extreme male brain theory relate to the imprinted brain theory? </h3> </div>

<li> What is neurodiversity? </li>
<h2> What is neurodiversity? </h2>
<a>Tourette’s syndrome, epilepsy, dyslexia, and bipolar disorder.</a>
<h2> What are the benefits of thinking differently? </h2>
<p>Differences in thinking have helped humanity progress in science and art throughout history. When everyone thinks about a problem the same way, someone with autism might <a>approach it differently and identify the solution.</a></p>
<p>The fixation with <a>patterns, systems, and routine</a> characteristic of autism can be valuable in the workplace. People with high functioning autism may be excellent in positions of software testing or quality control, for example.</p>
<h2> Why is neurodiversity controversial? </h2>
<a>undermines the struggles they experience on a daily basis.</a>
<a>balance between the two perspectives.</a> Scientists and clinicians should continue to develop effective and affordable therapies for autism. At the same time, society should combat stigma and make schools, offices, and housing more accommodating.

<h2> How do I get tested for autism as an adult? </h2>
<a>a diagnosis can provide a valuable foundation</a> from which to understand those challenges and find support.
<h2> I was just diagnosed with autism. What do I do? </h2>
<p>Allow yourself time to process this change. A late diagnosis of <a>autism can change your self-concept</a>—often for the better—but recognize that it may take time to fully understand or embrace.</p>
<h2> What is it like to be diagnosed with autism in adulthood? </h2>
<a>“finally solving a lifelong riddle.”</a>
<h2> Should I camouflage my autism in social settings? </h2>
<p>Research has shown that authenticity is an integral part of mental health and well-being. Yet many people with autism are taught, or teach themselves, to modify their behavior to conform to social norms and expectations.</p>
<a>cultivate dignity, connection, and self-acceptance.</a>
<h2> What are housing options for autistic adults? </h2>
<p>People with autism live independently, with family members, in autistic communities, or group homes. Housing options depend heavily on the severity of the person’s condition.</p>
<h2> How should people with autism pick a college? </h2>
<h2> Which schools have neurodiversity programs? </h2>
<p>Landmark College in Putney Vermont is exclusively for neurodivergent students, those with autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. Other universities, including William Mary and Drexel University, have also begun to <a>establish neurodiversity programs.</a> </p>
<p>In <a>choosing a college, people with autism</a> may want to consider what is most important to them. That might be attending a top-tier engineering program, for example, or being surrounded by other neurodivergent students.</p>

<p>Children with autism can face an array of challenges at school, from keeping pace in a busy class, to forming relationships with their peers, to struggling with sensory overload in the classroom, hallway, or cafeteria.</p>
<li> How do I get services for my autistic child? </li>
<h2> How do I get services for my autistic child? </h2>
<a>To be eligible for an individualized education program (IEP),</a> children must have a disability, such as autism, that prevents them from learning successfully in the existing classroom environment.
<h2> What is an individualized education program? </h2>
<a>individualized education program</a>, which establishes a child’s academic goals and includes the support they need to achieve those goals.
<a>better served in special education classrooms</a>.
<h2> How can I prepare for my annual review meeting? </h2>
<h2> What’s the difference between an IEP and a 504 Plan? </h2>
<h2> How can I advocate for my autistic child at school? </h2>
<a>sharing a summary of their IEP</a> and a little information about their strengths, weaknesses, and personality. Case managers coordinate the IEP, so make sure your case manager has a strong understanding of autism.
<a>Explore an after-school activity</a> that the child is genuinely interested in, such as band or chess club, where he can practice his social skills and learn to function in a group setting.
<h2> What information would help my child’s teacher? </h2>
<a>tips to your child’s general education teacher about autism</a> can be helpful.
<h2> How can teachers help students with autism? </h2>
<a>Implementing widespread autism competencies</a> for teachers would ensure that every educator is equipped to serve autistic students.

<div> <div> <h1>Parenting a Child with Autism</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<h2> What do I do if my child is diagnosed with autism? </h2>
<a>explore behavioral therapies</a> with your child’s doctor as soon as possible. These may include applied behavioral analysis, speech therapy, and occupational therapy.
<a>keep organized records</a> of your child’s medical appointments to create a complete picture of your child at different stages. You may also want to take notes on developmental milestones, improvements, and health conditions.
<p><a>Connect with your child</a> in any way you can, such as by talking, reading, or showing educational videos, even if it seems like your child isn’t paying attention. Read accounts that other parents and autistic adults have written.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, take care of yourself. Set aside time to recharge. Seek out positive people and avoid those who drain your energy.</p>
<h2> How do I handle the stress of raising a child with autism? </h2>
<p>Many features of autism—tantrums, aggression, language deficits, limited family opportunities, and the inability to gain independence—contribute to the <a>deep and distinct distress</a> that many caregivers experience.</p>
<h2> How can I help teach my child social skills? </h2>
<p>Parents can discuss social situations the child sees on TV or ones they’re likely to encounter at school. The parent and child should take turns role-playing, so that the child practices playing both individuals in the scenario. </p>
<p>Scheduling play dates with kids in a support group can allow children to practice social skills while providing parents an opportunity to discuss strategies with other parents.</p>
<h2> How should I talk to my child about autism? </h2>
<h2> How should I discipline my autistic child? </h2>
<p>Parents may then seek to implement a system of rewards for positive behavior and punishment for negative behavior. Following this plan consistently can help the child understand the consequences of their actions.</p>
<h2> How can parents avoid blaming themselves? </h2>
<a>reject the premise that there is anything to be blamed for,</a> believing that autism is not a disorder but a different way of thinking and being.
<h2> How does having a child with autism affect a marriage? </h2>
<a>study found no difference:</a> 64 percent of children with autism had married parents, and 65 percent of children without autism had married parents. The idea that
<a>couples divorce due to autism</a> may be overblown, or at the least, it merits more research.
<h2> How does having a child with autism affect their siblings? </h2>
<p>Nevertheless, siblings of children with autism can also come to embody countless positive traits, such as empathy, cooperation, tolerance, altruism, maturity, and responsibility.</p>
<h2> How much does it cost to raise a child with autism? </h2>
<p>Raising a child with autism costs around <a>$60,000 each year</a>, according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks. Costs may be higher if the child’s autism is more severe.</p>
<p>Finances are devoted to obtaining therapies, education, caregiver time, and health care. Parents may also face financial strain because a partner may decide to leave work to care for the child full time.</p>
<h2> Does insurance cover autism services? </h2>
<a>may not reimburse the full cost</a> or the length of time a child really needs.
<p>Children with autism are <a>eligible for educational services</a> through their public school system. They may develop an individualized education plan or a 504 plan, both of which aim to help kids fully participate in their education.</p>
<p>Joining a local support group can be extremely helpful for parents of children with autism. In addition to emotional support, members have <a>expertise in navigating available services in their state</a>.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Autism and Related Conditions</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Autism is often accompanied by a range of medical or psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, ADHD, epilepsy, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal problems. The scientific understanding of this overlap is often elusive.</p>
<p>Addressing co-occurring problems won't eliminate the core features of autism. Yet treating specific symptoms that people are struggling with can tremendously improve daily life for those on the spectrum.</p>
<a>30 to 80 percent</a> of children with autism meet the criteria for ADHD, and 20 to 50 percent of children with ADHD meet the criteria for autism. Clinicians can now provide a dual diagnosis for children with both conditions, per the DSM-5.
<p><a>Autism and ADHD</a> can look very similar, as both involve struggles with communication, social cues, attention, and impulsivity. Scientists are currently investigating the biological and genetic roots that the conditions may share.</p>
<a>40 percent</a> of children with
<p>Parents of children struggling with anxiety can aim to identify what specifically triggers anxiety in their child, and then plan for or modify those triggers. They may explore treatment options such as medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p>
<h2> Autism and Depression </h2>
<p>People with autism are <a>four times more likely</a> to suffer from depression than neurotypical individuals. This trend may be due to genetics as well as the <a>loneliness,</a> bullying, or rumination that some with autism face.</p>
<h2> Autism and Sleep Problems </h2>
<a>twice as common</a> for children with autism than for neurotypical children. People with autism can have
<a>trouble falling asleep or staying asleep</a> throughout the night. Even worse, a poor night of sleep may exacerbate symptoms of autism, like social impairments and repetitive behaviors.
<p>Sleep problems may be due symptoms of autism such as sensory sensitivity or the conditions that often co-occur with autism, such as ADHD, anxiety, and digestive problems. The genetic underpinnings of autism may also play a role.</p>
<a>Good sleep hygiene,</a> especially keeping a consistent bedtime routine, can help people with autism get a good night’s rest
<h2> Autism and Gastrointestinal Problems </h2>
<a>fuel digestive problems.</a>
<p>Parents or individuals with autism should consult their doctor about which diets or programs they can explore. Anecdotally, some parents have reported that cutting out wheat, gluten or dairy has been helpful.</p>
<h2> Autism and Highly Sensitive People </h2>
<h2> Autism and Fragile X syndrome </h2>
<a>genetic causes of autism.</a> Other genetic disorders linked to autism include Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis.
