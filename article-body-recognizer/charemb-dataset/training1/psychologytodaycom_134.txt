<h2> What Is a Heuristic? </h2>
<p>Heuristics are not unique to humans; animals use heuristics that, though less complex, also serve to simplify <a>decision-making</a> and reduce cognitive load.</p>
<div> <h3> Do heuristics make us more successful? </h3> </div>
<a>freeing up cognitive resources</a> for more complex planning and problem-solving endeavors.
<div> <h3> Why do we use heuristics? </h3> </div>
<p>The human brain and all its processes—including heuristics—<a>developed over millions of years of evolution</a>. Since mental shortcuts save both cognitive energy and time, they likely provided an advantage to those who relied on them.</p>
<div> <h3> Are evolved heuristics useful in modern life? </h3> </div>
<a>may not be universally beneficial today</a>. The familiarity heuristic, for example—in which the familiar is preferred over the unknown—could steer early humans toward foods or people that were safe, but may trigger
<a>anxiety</a> or unfair biases in modern times.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Different Kinds of Heuristics </h2>
<p>Since then, researchers have continued their work and identified many different kinds of heuristics, including:</p>
<ul><li> <p>Familiarity heuristic</p> </li> <li> <p>Fundamental attribution error</p> </li> <li> <p>Representativeness heuristic</p> </li> <li> <p>Satisficing</p> </li> </ul>
<div> <h3> What is the anchoring heuristic? </h3> </div>
<a>bias</a>, occurs when someone relies more heavily on the first piece of information learned when making a choice, even if it's not the most relevant. In such cases, anchoring is
<a> likely to steer individuals wrong</a>.
<div> <h3> What is the availability heuristic? </h3> </div>
<a>based on how readily examples come to mind</a>. People tend to overestimate the probability of plane crashes, homicides, and shark attacks, for instance, because examples of such events are easily remembered.
<div> <h3> What is the representativeness heuristic? </h3> </div>
<a>based on how similar they are to known entities</a>—assuming someone described as "quiet" is more likely to be a librarian than a politician, for instance. 
<div> <div> <h3> What is satisficing? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>Satisficing is a decision-making strategy in which the <a>first option that satisfies certain criteria is selected</a>, even if other, better options may exist.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2> When Heuristics Are Wrong </h2>
<p>Heuristics, while useful, are imperfect; if relied on too heavily, they can result in incorrect judgments or cognitive biases. Some are more likely to steer people wrong than others. </p>
<a>parenting</a> practices. Understanding commonly unhelpful heuristics, and identifying situations where they could affect behavior, may help individuals avoid such mental pitfalls.
<div> <h3> What is the fundamental attribution error? </h3> </div>
<a>while attributing one’s own behavior more to external or situational factors</a>.
<div> <h3> What is an example of the fundamental attribution error? </h3> </div>

<p>“How often do you and your partner have sex?”</p>
<p>It’s a question that comes up often, albeit tentatively, exposing some of our deepest insecurities about our intimate relationships.</p>

<p>The Most Common Response</p>
<sup>1</sup> This reported frequency was found to be about nine sexual interactions a year lower since a similar study was conducted in 1990. The sample included those who were single,
<a>dating</a>, married, and cohabitating. When the authors looked at married couples specifically, the average sexual frequency was slightly lower, at 51 sexual encounters a year, or just less than once a week on average.

<h1> Employees Are Rewriting the "Psychological Contract" </h1>
<h2> What does this new deal mean for organizations and managers? </h2>
<li>Pre-pandemic, the psychological contract between employee and employer had grown transactional, with each party focusing on their own interests.</li>
<li>With employers dealing with worker shortages and resignations, employees now have leverage to ask for more.</li>

<a>normal</a>. Instead, they are looking for a new arrangement, and given the ongoing labor shortage, they may now be in a position to rewrite the psychological contract.
<h3>Redefining the "psychological contract"</h3>
<p>Organizations and managers should be <a>mindful</a> of the following points to successfully navigate this new reality and help create a better psychological contract.</p>
<h3>1. Schedule flexibility</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of debate lately about what schedule works best for employees. Whereas some have advocated for a <a>four-day workweek</a>, others have suggested that <a>5-hour workdays</a> are optimal.</p>
<h3>2. Meaning and balance</h3>
<p>It has been widely reported that companies have responded to the worker shortage by offering recruitment and retention bonuses and increasing <a>pay</a>. These are positive developments, as wage stagnation has been a problem for too long.</p>
<h3>4. Relational psychological contracts</h3>
<a>employee commitment and performance</a>.
<h3>5. Patience and understanding</h3>
<p>As such, managers should be patient and understand that a straightforward return to normal is unlikely. Instead, they should recognize that there may be some trial and error as employees adapt to the post-pandemic context.</p>

<h1> How to Make Good New Year's Resolutions </h1>
<h2> It is easier to make them than to resolve them. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Motivation? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<ul> <li>Self-efficacy is one of the predictors of a positive outcome.</li> <li>Prioritize and write down your goals.</li> <li>It is okay to get professional help when you have difficulty formulating and/or achieving your goals.</li> </ul>
<a>self-efficacy</a> (generally speaking, it is a belief in our ability to succeed), skills to change, and readiness to change. Also, the successful subjects employed more
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> processes, less self-blame and wishful thinking. So how to make a good New Year's resolutions?
<h3>Start with a gratitude</h3>
<a>gratitude</a>. Find a quiet moment in your day and reflect on what you are grateful for this year. It was a very difficult year and if you are alive and healthy, it already is a huge accomplishment.
<p>Not all of our goals are equally important. This year you may be concentrating on improving your health or your family relationships or reaching your financial or educational goals. Take a moment to put them in an order.</p>
<p>Write down your goals and put them in a place where you will easily find your notes if you need a reminder or you need to revise them. Life gets unpredictable sometimes and it is okay to revise your goals.</p>
<p>The research says that getting support is important. If you can share your goals with family and friends, it will help you in the long run. Your friends and family may become a motivational factor in reaching your goals.</p>
<h3>Do not play a self-blame game</h3>
<h3>It is okay to get professional help</h3>
<a>shame</a> in asking for professional help when you have difficulties. Even in these quite difficult times, you can always find a professional who takes new patients. Most therapists do
<a>telemedicine</a> now and it does not really matter where your therapist practices if she is licensed in your state of residence and is contracted with your health insurance company.

<h1> Difficult People Have a Place in Our Lives </h1>
<h2> Who are the difficult people in our lives, and why don’t we ditch them? </h2>
<p> Posted November 7, 2017 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Dean Drobot/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Then, in the key question, participants were asked to name the people whom they “sometimes find difficult or demanding.”</p>
<p>Professors Offer and Fischer separated the difficult people into two categories:</p>
<p>1. Nothing but trouble. (This is my name for them. The authors called them “difficult-only.”)</p>
<p>These people were named as difficult or demanding, but they were not named in response to any of the other questions. That means they were not people that the participants socialized with, confided in, got help from, or gave help to.</p>
<p>2. Difficult but involved. (Again, this is my name for them. The authors called them “difficult engaged-in-exchange ties.”)</p>
<p>These people were named as difficult or demanding, but were also named in response to at least one of the other questions. That means they were people the participants socialized with, confided in, got help from, or gave help to.</p>
<p>Most of us have difficult people in our lives, but not too many. Three-quarters of the young adults (75 percent) and two-thirds of the older adults (67 percent) named at least one person in their life who was difficult or demanding.</p>
<p>Who are the people who are difficult, but involved in our lives in meaningful ways?</p>
<p>Some of the difficult people in our lives are people with whom we socialize, confide, and receive or give help. Who are those difficult people who are involved in our lives in some way?</p>
<p>For young adults (21 to 30 years old), here is the percent in each category of those who are difficult, but involved:</p>
<li>20 percent of husbands</li>
<li>14 percent of female romantic partners</li>
<li>19 percent of male romantic partners</li>
<li>13 percent of brothers</li>
<li>18 percent of housemates</li>
<p>For older adults (50 to 70 years old), here is the percent in each category of those who are difficult, but involved:</p>
<li>15 percent of husbands</li>
<li>28 percent of female romantic partners</li>
<li>14 percent of male romantic partners</li>
<li>16 percent of daughters</li>
<li>24 percent of housemates</li>
<p>Who are the people who are nothing but trouble?</p>
<p>For both the younger and the older adults, 5 percent of the people in their personal networks are nothing but trouble. They are difficult and challenging, and not involved in giving or receiving help, socializing, or confiding.</p>
<p>Among the younger adults, in only three categories were there 6 percent or more people who were nothing but trouble:</p>
<ul><li>11.7 percent of the acquaintances</li> <li>11.6 percent of the workmates</li> <li>13.1 percent of brothers</li> </ul>
<p>Among older adults, 6 percent or more of the people in these four categories were nothing but trouble:</p>
<ul><li>15.5 percent of acquaintances</li> <li>12.7 percent of mothers</li> <li>11.7 percent of workmates</li> <li>10.2 percent of sisters</li> </ul>
<p>Who are the people who are especially unlikely to be difficult?</p>
<p>The psychology of difficult people</p>
<a>what makes people boring</a>, but that’s not the same thing.)
<p>A disproportionate number of the people participants said they would approach for long-term help were also considered difficult: 15 percent of them for the young adults and 11 percent for the older adults.</p>
<a>divorce</a>. This study was also conducted at just one point in time, so we don’t know how perceptions of difficulty change over time.
<p>Why don't we just ditch them?</p>
<p>The people identified as difficult, yet involved in our lives are overwhelmingly relatives or romantic partners. Only one category of non-kin was disproportionately named as difficult, but involved — housemates.</p>
<p>With difficult relatives, perhaps people stay involved with them because they feel obligated to do so, or because they see them as people they can turn to if they ever need long-term help themselves.</p>
<a>friendship</a> began, we would not stay friends with them.

<h1> 5 Reasons to Be More Confident That a Relationship Will Last </h1>
<h2> New research shows 5 ways to test whether you think you'll find lasting love. </h2>

<a>divorce</a>? Whether married or not, how much conflict did you witness between them? Thus, if your parents had a troubled relationship, you may feel your own relationship is doomed as well.
<a>attachment</a> style may also impact relationship confidence, and hence quality, over time. People high in
<a>anxious</a> attachment worry that their partners don’t love them, and those high in avoidant attachment prefer not to get too close to a partner.
<li>I feel good about our prospects to make this relationship work for a lifetime.</li>
<li>I am very confident when I think of our future together.</li>
<li>I believe we can handle whatever conflicts will arise in the future.</li>
<li>We have the skills a couple needs to make a <a>marriage</a> last.</li>
<li>We can handle anything that comes our way.</li>

<h1> Couple Conflicts: My Problem, Your Problem, or Our Problem? </h1>
<h2> Why pronoun use during a couple's conflicts matters. </h2>
<li>Communication between romantic partners involves interactions where the focus is on one partner (I-talk or you-talk) or both (we-talk).</li>
<li>New research suggests that you-talk during conflict interactions is dysfunctional, but we-talk is functional.</li>
<li>The research also shows that you-talk or I-talk (i.e. focusing on the stressed partner) is helpful in situations involving coping interactions.</li>

<h3>Investigating conflict interactions and support provision in romantic relationships</h3>
<p>Relationship climate. To determine the relationship climate, three items (relaxed vs. tense, close vs. reserved, and peaceful vs. irritated) were rated for all tasks. Then, the average across these items was calculated for each task.</p>
<p>You-talk was negatively associated with situational relationship functioning in all tasks examined; we-talk was positively associated with situational relationship functioning only in conflict discussions.</p>

<ul><li>You always….</li> <li>You never....</li> <li>Your problem is that….</li> </ul>

<h1> How to Get the Relationships That Matter for Personal Growth </h1>

<p>Few would argue that being close to the people you care about can help promote your feelings of well-being and happiness. Indeed, there is a large body of research showing the value of social support in maintaining mental health.</p>
<a>Midlife</a> in the United States study, or “MIDUS,” the investigators who began this study in the mid-90s used national probability sampling to obtain
<a>resilience</a> or ability to cope with difficult times, life satisfaction, self-actualization (Maslow’s term for the ultimate form of
<a>post-traumatic growth</a>.” They not only bounce back from
<a>openness</a> to helping others) and the willingness to share your time with the people you do have in your support network, you can achieve the personal growth that will promote your long-term fulfillment.

<a>marriage</a> proposals that are rejected shows that proposals made in front of other people are more likely to be rejected than proposals made in private.
<h3>Characteristics of Proposals that Were Rejected</h3>
<p>The couple never discussed marriage before the proposal</p>
<p>Every time a proposal was accepted, the couple had already discussed marriage. Of the proposals that were rejected, 40% of the couples had never even discussed marriage.</p>
<p>The couple never even dated before the proposal</p>
<p>Every time a proposal was accepted, the couples were <a>dating</a>. Of the proposals that were rejected, 10% came from men who had never even dated the woman they were proposing to. Six of those proposals were made by complete strangers.</p>
<p>The couple had not been dating for many years</p>
<p>When proposals were accepted, the couple had been dating for nearly twice as many years (an average of 4.2) as when proposals were rejected (an average of 2.2 years).</p>
<p>The man doesn’t have a ring</p>
<p>When the man didn’t offer a ring, his proposal was 8.5 times more likely to be rejected. If he did not get down on one knee, his proposal was 4.7 times more likely to be rejected.</p>
<p>The man proposed in an attempt to save the relationship</p>
<p>That wasn’t the most common reason, though. Most often, when a proposal was rejected it was because the woman thought they were too young or they just weren’t ready yet.</p>
<h3>Relationships that Continued After the Rejection</h3>
<p>For three out of every 10 couples (31%), a rejected proposal was not the end of the relationship. They continued to date. Only 21 people indicated how long they continued dating; on the average, it was 2.4 years. Five couples eventually married.</p>
<h3>Rejected Proposals: The Special Risks to Women</h3>
<p>Getting their proposals rejected was, unsurprisingly, painful to the men. Their most common reaction was to cry. They also expressed hurt and confusion.</p>
<a>intimate partner violence</a> occurred. Behaviors included as instances of intimate partner violence were “excessive control, threatening
