<h1> Defeat the 3 Habits Trolling Your Health and Growth </h1>
<h2> Mindfulness helps you discover and deal with these habits hidden in plain sight. </h2>
<li>Certain mental habits, which are easily overlooked, can erode one's efforts to make healthy behavioral changes.</li>
<li>Mental habits that get in the way of behavior change include blaming others and believing that things can't change.</li>
<li>The science of habit change requires increasing awareness of one's habits, reevaluating them, and choosing new ones.</li>
<p>Whether you are already frustrated in your efforts to forge new habits for 2022, or if you’ve ever been frustrated in your habit-change efforts, there are three key, hidden habit trolls that might be blocking you.</p>
<p>They are “hidden” because they are so close to you, they are easy to take for granted or miss.</p>
<p>These three habits have tied my own healthy change efforts into knots many times.</p>
<p>They likely are knotting up, or cluttering, your own efforts as well. They are screwing up your best intentions, and they are a major reason your New Year’s resolutions fail.</p>
<p>They are close because these trolls are habits of your own mind. Together, they clutter and tangle your neurons in the ultimate mindf*ck, the one that happens as an inside job in your thoughts! </p>
<h3>Mental Cluttering Habit Troll #1: Disowning Your Discomfort </h3>
<p>You have a mental habit of blaming your upset on what they did. </p>
<p>And yes, what they did may be egregious, ridiculous, and even abusive. And yet… </p>
<p>Once the behavior of others has happened and it enters our sensory systems, the sensory experiences, thoughts, and actions comprising our habit reaction are ours. </p>
<p>Yes, others should be held accountable, and no, you should not be okay with whatever others do that impact you, and yet … </p>
<p>The mental habit of giving over ownership over your own ease, well-being, resilience, and growth to others (who, remember, happen to exhibit egregious actions) is a less-than-ideal habit in your mental software.</p>
<p>The habit of disowning your discomfort needs an upgrade. </p>
<h3>Mental Cluttering Habit Troll #2: Time Addiction </h3>
<p>This mental goblin of the mind ties you in knots when it whispers (via your thoughts) the various excuses, rationales, reassurances, and predictions based on some parlance of time—past or future. </p>
<p>Time <a>addiction</a> is so nasty to your habit-change efforts because these thoughts convince you that you, others, and the things you either want or don’t want are fixed, unchanging entities.</p>
<p>“This has always been this way … This always will be this way … This will never work … This always works … They are the same … I am the same … Always … Never … Same … Later.” </p>
<p>And when you allow this mental habit unfettered, unnoticed access to your <a>attention</a>, you find yourself feeling a bit less uncomfortable, a bit more okay with not putting forth the disciplined effort of moving habits higher.</p>
<p>Basically, this mental wisenheimer ain’t so <a>wise</a>. These thoughts fail the reality test—how everything is here, now, always, and ever … changing.</p>
<p>Think about it: What about your body, emotions, thoughts, circumstances, and stuff of your life has never changed? Isn’t the fact of constant change one of the only always-es? </p>
<p>In mindfully noticing the changing nature of all things, you give yourself the power to drop out of time addiction and embrace the changes you’re intending (even if they are difficult) now.</p>
<p>Embracing the truth of change (especially when time addiction is trying to hijack you) is the antidote to this mental habit poison.</p>
<h3>Mental Cluttering Habit Troll #3: Self Addiction </h3>
<p>Here’s the real cluttering killer paving your change intentions straight to hell.</p>
<p>When your thoughts (particularly around changing your habits for the better and it’s starting to get uncomfortable) center around words like my, me, and mine, you are knocking on the door to Excuseville, just on the outskirts of Quitopia.</p>
<p>“This is just how I roll … This is who I am … I am <a>anxious</a> / <a>depressed</a> / a loner / a rebel … I won’t … I’m not … I can’t.” </p>
<p>It’s more accurate to realize how you are always part of a context. </p>
<p>You are always changing, and you are always changing in reaction to the ebb and flow of circumstances and other people—the in-and-out-flux of physical and mental nutrients entering your system.</p>
<p>The more you can get behind the truth of the real you as a flock of parts flying from one moment to the next, the better.</p>
<p>You’re also far more likely to get with the program of decluttering the less-than-ideal parts and putting your best parts forward toward the things that matter in any given moment.</p>
<a>grateful</a>, curious, compassionate,
<a>forgiving</a>, courageous, and recognizing of your inherent worth and your vision of the decluttered and higher
<a>identity</a> of consistently doing what truly matters and resonates.
<p>Again, these three mental troll-clutterers are universal.</p>
<p>All people get knotted by them, and yet most don’t take the threads of mental habit mindfully in hand.</p>
<p>Thoreau wrote in Walden that most “live lives of quiet desperation.”</p>
<p>You will be among the quietly desperate unless you learn to notice the whisperings of these three trolls of the mind.</p>
<h3>The Weapons to Defeat the Mental Habit Trolls</h3>
<p>Declutter them, like any other habit that gets in the way of your intentions toward health, <a>creativity</a>, connection, and positive impact. </p>
<p>The science of habit change is clear: </p>
<li>Increase your awareness of habits by “mapping” them—the specific lay of the land of how they operate in your life. </li>
<li>Bring <a>mindfulness</a> skills to bear to reevaluate whether your cluttered habits are paying off or costing you. </li>
<li>Build new, specific, higher habits that pay off more, and don’t sap your effectiveness, well-being, and trajectory of growth. </li>

<h1> Self-Awareness and Setting Intentions </h1>
<h2> Setting intentions can help us understand our life's bigger picture. </h2>
<li>An intention is a commitment to oneself—something to be, rather than to achieve—best done in the morning.</li>
<li>Intentions can set the tone and focus of one's day, as well as help one navigate through difficult times.</li>
<li>Setting an intention can influence the trajectory of one's life and highlight those aspects that give it meaning.</li>
<p>For many people, the start of a new year involves making New Year’s resolutions. But for others, setting intentions might be more attainable and something that can be done on a regular basis. </p>
<a>attention</a> that day. Maybe a friend asked you to go shopping together, but you declined because you have already surrendered to your intention to go fishing. You suggest that the two of you go shopping some other day.
<p>Setting an intention is slightly different from setting a goal. An intention is a theme you have in order to achieve some kind of balance in your life. It’s a path that you might follow for the day or another designated period of time. </p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that you can only make intentions for yourself; you can offer hope to other people, but you cannot make intentions for them.</p>
<p>Setting a goal means that there is a desired or chosen outcome. In other words, <a>goals</a> are typically made for more long-term needs or desires, such as wanting to get a doctorate in psychology. </p>
<h3>Intentions and behavior</h3>
<p>There are many different reasons to set an intention. Intentions are useful in changing behavior, as in the case of addictive behaviors. Intentions are easier to accomplish because their lead time is typically shorter.</p>
<h3>Our search for meaning</h3>
<p>Years ago, while in Maui, I had daily meetings with a shaman who spoke a lot about setting intentions. On this trip, I brought my own intention cards with me and I pulled one for each day. Together, we set the tone for the day. </p>
<p>Whatever choices you have and decisions you make, always remember to follow your bliss and what is in your heart, and be true to your authentic self.</p>

<h1> 18 Schemas That Change the Way You See the World </h1>
<h2> These beliefs could be affecting your life without you even realizing it. </h2>
<li>There are 18 different schemas that, if developed in childhood, may have an unpleasant effect on how one views the world. </li>
<li>A person may not even realize they have schemas—in fact, the ideology may feel entirely ordinary.</li>
<li>Once a person becomes aware of their schemas, they can decide how they wish to respond to and combat them.</li>
<p>Have you ever heard of a schema before? A schema is an enduring negative pattern that develops during childhood or <a>adolescence</a>, which persists and expands throughout our lives.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: phototimedp/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Schemas are formed when our needs are not met during childhood. The schema, acting as its self-serving self, often prevents these needs from being satisfied in adulthood.</p>
<a>therapy</a> was first introduced in 1990 and defines 18 schemas. Make note of the schemas that appear familiar, either for you or for someone you know. Awareness is a skill!
<h3>1. Emotional Deprivation</h3>
<h3>2. Abandonment/Instability</h3>
<a>attachment</a> with. There are many ways this schema could develop in childhood. Was there a disruption in your home life that was particularly damaging for you (e.g. the death of a
<a>caregiver</a>)? Did you have parents who were inconsistent in attending to your needs?
<h3>4. Social Isolation/Alienation</h3>
<p>This schema refers to the belief that one is secluded from the world and/or not part of any community. This belief is often caused by experiences in which children see that they are different from other people.</p>
<h3>5. Defectiveness/Shame</h3>
<a>shame</a>. Individuals who develop this schema grew up in homes in which one or both parents were very critical and perhaps made them feel as though they were unworthy of love.
<a>career</a>, school, or sports. Did you grow up in a family where anything less than an "A" was a failure? If you persistently had experiences like this as a child, you may have developed this schema.
<h3>7. Dependence/Incompetence</h3>
<h3>8. Vulnerability to Harm and Illness</h3>
<h3>9. Enmeshment/Undeveloped Self</h3>
<h3>10. Entitlement/Grandiosity</h3>
<h3>11. Insufficient Self-Control or Self-Discipline</h3>
<a>goals</a>, as well as an inability to avoid making your impulses or feelings known. In its milder form, you may have an exaggerated emphasis on avoiding pain, conflict, confrontation, or responsibility. When lack of
<a>self-control</a> is extreme, criminal or addictive behavior may be apparent.
<a>passive-aggressive</a> behavior or anger outbursts.
<a>guilt</a> from feeling selfish. This sometimes leads to the realization that your own needs are not being adequately met, and you may develop resentment towards those for whom you are making sacrifices.
<h3>14. Emotional Inhibition</h3>
<h3>15. Approval Seeking/Recognition Seeking</h3>
<h3>16. Negativity/Pessimism</h3>
<h3>17. Unrelenting Standards/Hypercriticalness</h3>
<a>self-confidence</a>, and relationship satisfaction.
<h3>Unhelpful Responses to Schemas</h3>
<p>There are three main unhelpful responses to schemas: surrender, avoidance, and overcompensation.</p>
<p>Schema surrender refers to ways in which people passively give in to the schema. They accept the schema as fact and then act in ways that confirm the schema.</p>
<p>Schema avoidance refers to the ways in which people avoid activating schemas. </p>
<p>There are three types of schema avoidance: cognitive, emotional, and behavioral. Cognitive avoidance refers to efforts that people make not to think about upsetting events. </p>
<p>Emotional avoidance refers to automatic or voluntary attempts to block painful emotion.</p>
<p>Behavioral avoidance is taking (or not taking) action to avoid situations that trigger schemas and the associated psychological pain. </p>

<h2> Understanding Psychosis </h2>
<div> <h3> What are early warning signs and symptoms of psychosis? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Behavioral changes</a> may be experienced and observed prior to a full psychotic episode. Those <a>signs include</a>:</p>
<p>• Withdrawal from friends and social activities</p>
<p>• A drop in grades or job performance</p>
<p>• Blunted emotion or inappropriate emotion</p>
<p>• An inability to think clearly and the sense that something is "off"</p>
<p>• Suspicions about the behavior of others</p>
<p>• <a>Aggression</a> toward others</p>
<p>• <a>Memory</a> problems and distractibility</p>
<p>• Sensitivity to stimuli such as bright lights, noise, colors, and textures</p>
<p>• Peculiar use of words and phrases, and mangled syntax</p>
<p>• Rapid speech and nonsensical statements.</p>
<div> <h3> What is first episode psychosis (FEP)? </h3> </div>
<a>adolescence</a> and young adulthood. In fact, around
<a>100,000 individuals</a> in the U.S. experience a
<a>first episode of psychosis,</a> or FEP, each year. This may be preceded by a phase when their grasp on reality cracks and slips away. They may perceive things that aren't there, misinterpret social interactions, or struggle with abstract thought.
<div> <h3> How long does a psychotic episode last? </h3> </div>
<a>schizophrenia</a> involves symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech that last longer than a month while
<a>brief psychotic disorder</a> is diagnosed those symptoms last for less than one month.
<div> <h3> Which mental health disorders include psychosis? </h3> </div>
<a>hallmark of schizophrenia</a>, which affects
<a>20 million people</a> worldwide, and other schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder. It can also occur during
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, severe
<a>depression</a>, delirium, and other conditions.
<div> <h3> Are people who have psychosis dangerous? </h3> </div>
<a>more likely to harm themselves than others,</a> through
<a>self-harm</a>, an accident, neglect, or vulnerability to exploitation. Therefore, it’s vital to help the individual seek medical and/or

<div> <h3> What triggers a psychotic episode? </h3> </div>
<a>symptoms may be provoked by anxiety and stress,</a>
<div> <h3> Can cannabis cause psychosis? </h3> </div>
<a>increased odds of developing psychosis</a>.
<div> <h3> Can caffeine induce psychosis? </h3> </div>
<a>caffeine use can induce psychosis</a> in otherwise healthy people. Caffeine can also exacerbate symptoms in those who already have a psychotic disorder. Reducing and eliminating caffeine, in those cases, allowed symptoms to abate.
<div> <h3> Can COVID-19 induce psychosis? </h3> </div>
<a>COVID-19 patients experience psychosis.</a> It’s still unclear whether psychosis stems from the virus itself, such as through inflammation or abnormal coagulation, symptoms of the illness, or fears surrounding the virus.
<div> <h3> Can psychosis be cured? </h3> </div>
<a>curbing the symptoms of psychosis</a> with therapy and medication so that the individual can live a functional, full life.
<div> <h3> Why is it important to treat psychosis early? </h3> </div>
<a>prevents young adults from missing key developmental milestones,</a> such as getting a job, going to college, or forging relationships.
<div> <h3> What are the best treatment approaches? </h3> </div>
<a>Newer successful approaches,</a> such as
<a>Coordinated Specialty Care,</a> incorporate
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy, job assistance, family support, substance use intervention, and lower doses of antipsychotics.
<div> <h3> Why do people stop taking antipsychotic medication? </h3> </div>
<a>lower doses of antipsychotics</a> provides an alternative that can lead to better recovery outcomes.

<h1> Why Legos Might Be the Key to Your Sanity During COVID </h1>
<h2> Finding your own comfort food for the soul in the form of play. </h2>
<li> People are tired and irritable these days, since we no longer have complete access to the things that release endorphins.</li>
<li> It takes creativity and energy to come up with things to do that bring us joy in the midst of the pandemic.</li>
<li>Finding play that is consistent with what you loved as a kid can be comforting now.</li>

<a>creativity</a> and energy to come up with things to do in the midst of COVID that bring us joy. That’s not so easy when we have a threatening virus and all sorts of changes to navigate.
<li>Consider coloring with crayons</li>
<li>Think about re-watching a favorite childhood movie</li>
<li>Reread a childhood book that you really liked, perhaps a classic that you remember reading several times.</li>
<li>Think about taking up painting or finger painting</li>
<li>Consider making something out of clay or Play-Doh</li>
<a>therapy</a> chairs have great pillows on them. In reflecting on why pillows, what came to mind was my childhood play, when friends and I would take the sofa pillows and construct make-believe castles and, my preference, apartments.
<p>What is important to note is that what probably will help get you through these pandemic times is finding something that brought you joy once and just might bring you some much-needed joy again.</p>

<h1> 6 Habits of Genuinely Happy Couples </h1>
<h2> Don't just survive—thrive in your relationship. </h2>
<li>Healthy relationship functioning is not a mystery: it's defined by well-directed effort.</li>
<li>Little changes can build the day-to-day habits that define happy relationships</li>
<li>Relationships are dynamic and can change with effort</li>
<p>Romantic relationships require nurturing, but how do you best nurture an existing relationship?</p>
<h3>How to help your relationship thrive, not just survive</h3>
<p>Relationship scientists strive to identify the patterns that predict healthy relationship functioning. Evidence suggests its worth your time to consider adopting or doubling-down your effort to do the following:</p>
<a>attention</a> to their partner, really listening and expressing care and concern. This gesture goes a long way in protecting a relationship, including from the stressors tied to the pandemic (Balzarini et al., 2020).
<a>psychological flexibility</a>. Being open, aware, considering the context, and keeping perspective all go a long way in reducing negativity (and not escalating problems). Fortunately, psychological flexibility can be developed with practice.
<a>fall in love all over again</a> by asking each other intimate questions, engaging in authentic self-disclosure, and responsively attending to each others' responses.
<a>laughing</a> together reported higher relationship satisfaction than those couples who reminisced about other memories (Bazzini, Stack, Martincin, Davis, 2007). So dig through the
<a>memory</a> archive, and when your relationship needs a boost, share a conversation about times that had you laughing.
