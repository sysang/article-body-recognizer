<p><b>December 27, 2021</b></p>
<p>Jake Fromm is now the third Giants quarterback this season who could not have success.</p>
<p>This offense is just flat out terrible. This team is awful. The Eagles dismantled Joe Judge’s squad 34-10 in Philly on Sunday to send the Giants to 4-11, just two games away from putting an end to the misery.</p>
<a>on why the Giants should go all-in on a trade for Russell Wilson.</a>

<p><b>November 29, 2021</b></p>
<a>not much changed on the offensive side of the football</a> Sunday against the Eagles. Luckily, the defense played lights out against Jalen Hurts and Co., 
<a>propelling the Giants to a much-needed 13-7 win</a> in front of a rowdy MetLife Stadium crowd.
<p>It’s only fitting the defense was tremendous <a>on the day Michael Strahan was honored at halftime</a>. They stomped them out, indeed.</p>
