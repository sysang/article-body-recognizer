<div><div><p>Those discussions have not been very active, Lofgren said. “Not recently.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A Washington Post investigation of the events of Jan. 6</p></div>
<div><div><p>But that day is now also interlocked with the virus in terms of determining when to bring the general public back in some capacity to the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The decision rests with the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who work in consultation with Monahan for medical advice, according to Democratic aides familiar with the discussions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But those officials are also tasked with post-Jan. 6 security considerations as they contemplate the return of visitors, according to the sources.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Don’t underestimate the trauma,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Connolly said that, for some members, just seeing the general public back in the building would serve as a “trigger” to bring them back to the violence of 11 months ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Congressional officials do not mention these lingering Jan. 6 concerns when explaining the continued shutdown to the public. Hoyer and Blunt, when asked whether that was part of the holdup, both said no.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it’s about the virus,” Hoyer said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the issue is just health concerns, the Capitol is taking stricter measures than its counterpart in London.</p></div></div>
<a>general public if visitors</a> plan ahead to get assigned tickets, wear a mask and scan in using a QR code that allows contact tracing measures in the event they later test positive for covid.
<div><div><p>Even that has prompted <a>some MPs to call for more access </a>to Parliament’s deliberations, complaining that lobbyists are holding events again on the grounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Washington, where city officials have wavered over an indoor mask mandate, major venues have adopted their own standards.</p></div></div>
<p>A collection of concert venues, including the Anthem, <a>created an app</a> for proof of vaccination to enter concerts, while also allowing guests to show a photo of their Centers for Disease Control and Prevention card proving vaccination.</p>
<div><div><p>The Kennedy Center also requires vaccination proof to enters its events and requires masks at all times.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Capitol remains shuttered except for lawmakers, staff, its credentialed press corps and those deemed to be official visitors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This all started on March 12, 2020, just as so much of the rest of the world shut down. Capitol security officials ended all public tours throughout the campus and up in the galleries above the two chambers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Monahan has an official policy of never answering any media questions, so it is laughable when congressional leaders refer the press to the attending physician to explain health issues on campus.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Jan. 6 attack prompted a heavy security presence, including a much-criticized fence that created a massive perimeter for many weeks. That loosened up in April, and more official visitors have since been allowed to enter the buildings.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Any day Congress is in session, a few lawmakers can be seen bringing a small collection of family or friends around the Capitol, giving exclusive tours during slow points in the day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet this has made the Capitol more like an actual citadel — a fortress that only the most privileged can enter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hoyer remains optimistic that the public, in some limited fashion, can return soon, something he hoped for back in June only to see a late-summer covid surge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I thought we were just about through this and then — whoa — now this omicron is coming,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others say that the Jan. 6 trauma is almost as important. Until that fades, it will be difficult to really reopen the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s still lingering,” Connolly said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Bob Dole got a front-row seat — and a big snub — as the GOP moved on from his view of American leadership</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Kane</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Robert J. Dole, in one of his last visits to the Senate, lost a big vote. It came not at the hands of Democrats, whom he battled for more than 27 years, including more than a decade as Senate Republican leader.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Instead, in December 2012, Dole sat off to the Republican side of the chamber, in his wheelchair, as his own side of the aisle abandoned him on a vote that helped set the tone for GOP politics over the next decade and perhaps beyond.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Supporters included the top Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Richard Lugar (Ind.), and Armed Services Committee, John McCain (Ariz.), who, like Dole, had suffered disabling wartime injuries.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But just eight Republicans joined all 53 members of the Democratic caucus in voting yes, falling six votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed to approve a treaty; <a>38 Republicans rejected the treaty</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So Dole watched the humiliating defeat on the Senate floor as a guest, 16 years after his retirement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rejecting the treaty was, in effect, rejecting our own values as embodied in the Americans With Disabilities Act,” Ross K. Baker, a congressional scholar at Rutgers University, recalled Friday in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The answer to Baker’s question, in this particular case, was pretty much yes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By the time of the U.N. treaty for the disabled vote, some Republicans had also become susceptible to online activism spurred by sometimes fringe elements of their coalition.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) led the opposition, claiming that a separate commission created in the treaty would lead to infringements on U.S. sovereignty and compel home-schooling parents to adopt other nations’ demands.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What had become clear, at that point, was that many traditional Republicans feared their voters, particularly when it came to low-turnout primary campaigns against ideological challenges from the right.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More than 180 nations have signed on to the treaty, including every major U.S. ally from Japan to Israel, with just a handful of holdouts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the Jan. 6 riots, <a>he told USA Today</a> that Biden had clearly won the election and said he was by then “sort of Trumped out.”</p></div></div>
<a>publicly mocked a reporter with a disability</a>. Dole had always been proud of his work for the disabled and saw it as an offshoot for helping wounded veterans, having lost the use of his right arm from brutal World War II injuries.
<div><div><p>They thought it might win a few votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is about common humanity,” Kerry said during the closing remarks, before pointing to their old colleague. “Don’t let Senator Bob Dole down.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They did.</p></div></div>
<div><h1>The filibuster debate still hasn’t happened in the only place it matters</h1></div>

<a>,</a> decrying the supermajority hurdle as the chief impediment to President Biden’s agenda. Congressional reporters hounded them for months about whether to change the Senate’s rules.
<div><div><p>And just about every Sunday show host pelted Democrats with questions about how chamber’s rules placed them in legislative handcuffs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet there’s one place where this debate hasn’t happened: on the Senate floor itself.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The filibuster, explained</p></div>
<div><div><p>To that end, C-SPAN’s annual year-end statistics point to just how stale the Senate has become, a place where the orators of yesteryear would find themselves wondering what happened to the place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2013 and 2014, by contrast, the Senate devoted more than 600 hours to formal debate time, more than 55 percent of all activity on the chamber floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These frustrated senators want to at least have a public airing of their grievances.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.), finishing his first year in office, fumed about how the GOP actually blocked, through a filibuster, a motion that would have allowed debate only on voting rights legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Warnock and Schatz want senators to actually vote on a few different ideas, putting people on the record about an issue that they otherwise talk so much about.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In the end, if the votes are not there to change the rules, fair enough, that’s democracy,” Schatz said, acknowledging that if the proposals are set at 67-vote hurdles, a rules change is quite unlikely.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think there’s plenty of things,” Tester said.</p></div></div>
<a>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) holding up dozens of diplomatic nominees</a> over a separate policy issue related to Russian energy production.
<p>Another idea, Tester said, might be to grant special fast-track procedures to legislation that gets a large bipartisan vote in committee or bills that are supported by both the chair and ranking minority member of the panel of jurisdiction.</p>
<div><div><p>“The sense is that the Senate is not functioning, not just on voting rights but on other things as well,” Warnock said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With 54 votes that day, Democrat actually had more than 60 percent of those on hand, but a rules change in 1974 put the onus on the majority to produce 60 votes no matter who actually shows up for the roll call.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Schumer hosted a discussion Friday among all Democrats with Marty Paone, who spent several decades as a top parliamentary adviser to Senate leaders. It was meant as a history lesson to explain the evolution of the chamber’s rules.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But those were brief moments, with quick votes. It wasn’t a broad examination of what’s wrong with the Senate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If nothing else,” he said, “that would be an interesting thing to watch.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Searchlight, Las Vegas and the two identities of Harry Reid</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Kane</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 4:31 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Harry M. Reid commanded two different identities in a career that brought him to the pinnacle of American political power in the decades before his death Tuesday at 82.</p></div></div>
<a>February 2020 interview </a>in his office on the Strip.
<div><div><p>The Vegas identity got most of the attention in the national media, particularly when American politics moved into the world of 24/7 cable news energized by a social media ecosystem that lives on conflict.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While attending George Washington University Law School, he worked as a Capitol Police officer to make ends meet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Senate had conservative Democrats, like Sen. Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), who remained a close friend of Reid’s long after he switched parties in 1994, and liberal Republicans like Cohen.</p></div></div>
<p>Reid knew the path to power was through favors to others and taking on tough jobs that many others didn’t like to do. He doled out money from the Appropriations Committee for other senators and served for years on the Ethics Committee.</p>
<div><div><p>“I would rather dance than fight, but I know how to fight,” Reid warned in his acceptance speech.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats won the House and Senate majorities in 2006 and were positioned for even bigger wins heading into the 2008 elections, a time when Reid managed one of his most deft political moves ever.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He forced his party to move the Nevada caucus into a premier early slot on the 2008 presidential nomination calendar in the epic battle between Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Each candidate believed they had Reid’s support — the majority leader had privately told Obama he should run, while Reid’s entire Nevada political operation worked for Clinton, including his oldest son.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Obama-Clinton excitement drew massive turnout and a voter registration edge for Democrats in Nevada, building a Reid machine that has delivered his state to his party four straight presidential elections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With a caucus that reached 60 seats by mid-2009, Reid set out to do really big things with Obama and Pelosi.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reid personally negotiated every last detail of the complex health law with the final handful of holdouts in his leadership office.</p></div></div>
<p>After Obama won a second term, but Republicans maintained their House majority, Reid viewed this new tea party-driven GOP as openly hostile to most form of legislation, trying to obstruct the basic work of agencies and the federal judiciary.</p>
<div><div><p>His relationship with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) bottomed out, setting the Senate on a hyperpartisan path that largely continues to this day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His Las Vegas personality took hold in his final year in office as he used Senate floor speeches ahead of the 2016 election to demean Trump as a “racist” and “con artist” and “human leech.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He and Landra sold their Washington condo and bought a home outside Las Vegas, returning there and hardly ever coming back to the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s who I am. I can’t change,” Reid told me. “And so that’s that.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A year later, the House of Representatives can still look like a crime scene some days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the detectors aren’t there to deter armed insurrectionists. Instead, those detectors are there to prevent lawmakers or their staff from trying to commit violence against each other.</p></div></div>
<p>Trust in one another, whether to clinch a critical legislative deal or to protect each other from violence, seems to be at an all-time low one year after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol with both Democrats and Republicans in their crosshairs.</p>
<div><div><p>“This is — it’s kind of scary.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans, rather than reining in their most controversial members, have dug in with their support for them and now accuse Democrats of a massive overreaction to the threats against the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Interviews with more than 20 members, including Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate, revealed a Congress that remains on edge and where worries about more violence are front of mind for many — and for good reason.</p></div>
<b> </b>In 2017, there were fewer than 4,000 threats against lawmakers, a number that rose to more than 8,600 threats in 2020.
<div><div><p>The tension is less palpable in the Senate, a traditionally more chummy place, where Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), one of the highest-profile objectors to Biden’s election, believes he just had his most bipartisan year ever.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some lawmakers sense the tensions easing a bit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the days following the Jan. 6 attack, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) questioned whether the rioters had inside information because they found his somewhat hidden office on the third floor of the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I have seen that in the last four, six to eight weeks, while at the same time you see Kevin McCarthy acting like a dunce,” he added, referring to the House minority leader.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Democrats are less worried about the state of current tensions than the future, viewing last January’s attack as an opening salvo by Trump and his supporters that laid the groundwork for bigger clashes to come.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a great alarm about how they will behave after the 2024 presidential election,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Democrats’ anger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>That move radicalized some of the most centrist Democrats, the type who usually brag about their bipartisan credentials, and hardened them toward their Republican colleagues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) expressed disbelief that some of the Republicans who faced the greatest threats on Jan. 6 still fall in line behind Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 8, for instance, those five joined with 15 of the most conservative, pro-Trump Republicans to vote against the Improving the Health of Children Act that would help prevent childhood birth defects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bill’s author, Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-Ga.), voted against Biden on both Jan. 6 votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate stayed in session — even calling in Vice President Harris to cast a tiebreaking vote for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Obviously, Davis said, the threat wasn’t that dangerous; otherwise, Harris would not have been allowed anywhere near the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Davis summed up his views of House Democrats in a few words: “We can’t live in fear.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A handful of Democrats, to advance policies they say will help the country, have put aside their anger to work with Republicans who are most supportive of Trump and dismissive of the attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the leading liberals, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), has not let Jan. 6 get in the way of his strange-bedfellows coalition, working with Trump’s biggest backers in the House on reining in the Pentagon’s powers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It sometimes means he is working hand in hand with Republicans who were more than passive supporters of the effort to overturn the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A less tense Senate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Coons also had a John Lewis moment, back in the summer, as he prepared remarks for one of the bipartisan prayer breakfasts he co-chairs, thinking about how Lewis forgave people who assaulted him during his days as a civil rights activist.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The next morning, as he looked into the audience, Coons saw several senators he had not spoken to since they cast votes against Biden’s election, and he thought he needed to find a way to deal with his anger toward them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>One of his best friends in the Senate, James Lankford (R-Okla.), is the other co-chairman of the prayer breakfast, and the duo run the Ethics Committee, a highly sensitive job traditionally given to two of the most trusted senators.</p></div>
<div><div><p>During the five-hour delay to secure the Capitol, Lankford and a few other Republicans withdrew their support for challenging the election, while the others agreed to limit the objections to just Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“At the end of the day all 100 senators all certified the election. Every one of them. Because you have to challenge enough states that day to be able to challenge the election,” Lankford said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That approach infuriates many Democrats, who view any vote against those two states as supporting Trump and his insurrectionists. “Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night,” Casten said of Lankford’s logic.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Klobuchar found the actions by Lankford and those few other Republicans to be courageous, switching sides when they realized how out of control things got in the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They could not stomach being on the side of an insurrection. And that actually brings me great solace,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s been a pretty productive year that way, bipartisan,” Hawley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans who completely turned on Trump — 10 voted to impeach in the House, seven voted to convict in the Senate trial — have faced the most isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is one issue related to Jan. 6 on which lawmakers in both parties have recently found common ground: beefing up their own security in the event of another attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Delays in getting Guard troops to the Capitol surfaced quickly as a key lapse that helped lead to that day turning more deadly, including confusion about the Capitol Police Board’s process for requesting help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The measure passed the Senate on Dec. 13 by unanimous consent, sending it to the House for consideration the next day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one even asked for a recorded vote, and it won unanimous approval.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every minute counts during an emergency,” Klobuchar said in a statement.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Politics</a></div></div><div><h1>Dick Cheney returns to the House and receives a warm welcome . . . from Democrats</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Marianna Sotomayor</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Paul Kane</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Former vice president Richard B. Cheney visited the House floor on Thursday and patiently waited to greet more than a dozen members waiting to shake his hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were all Democrats.</p></div></div>
<p>Cheney and his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) are among the few Republicans who have joined Democrats in condemning last year’s attack on the Capitol as an assault on democracy and blaming former president Donald Trump for that deadly day.</p>
<div><div><p>They were the only two Republicans on the House floor Thursday for an event to mark the anniversary of the attack, but they were hardly alone.</p></div></div>
<p>One by one, Democrats put aside their fierce and lasting policy divides with the Cheneys to thank them for condemning the attack and Trump’s continued effort to undermine the 2020 presidential election results with his false claims of fraud.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was great coming back. I think Liz is doing a hell of a job, and I’m here to support her,” Cheney told reporters upon leaving the House floor.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked to reflect on Republican leaders’ decision not to show up on Thursday to mark the anniversary of the attack, Cheney said he could no longer recognize the party he helped lead as House minority whip and then vice president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Cheney has moderated their positions on any number of conservative issues they have held over the years, but their determination to take on Trump and call out fellow Republicans is more than enough for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Liz Cheney was in the chamber during the insurrection and became one of the only House Republicans to pointedly blame Trump for instigating the most violent attack on the Capitol since British forces set it on fire in 1814.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Republicans oust Cheney for calling out Trump’s false election claims, minimize Jan. 6 attack on Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p>When her father left office in 2009, it was hard to imagine what would cause him to be rejected by Republicans and embraced by Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During his time as vice president, his relationship with Democrats was marked by bitter disagreements, particularly over the Iraq War, that often went beyond policy disagreements and into questions of character and patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi and Cheney had an acrimonious relationship of their own.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney said in 2007 that if Pelosi was successful at preventing a U.S. troop increase in Iraq it would “validate the al-Qaeda strategy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi demanded an apology, saying Cheney had questioned her patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He declined and said he didn’t question her patriotism, just her judgment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s what I believe,” she told CNN. “I think he’s proud of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, those old tensions were put aside as they focused on their shared feelings about Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) also applauded Cheney for his daughter’s courage during a lengthier conversation in which both men were overheard talking about other news of day such as testing frequently for the coronavirus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Back in 2004, at a time when Sen. Patrick J. Leahy and other Democrats accused Cheney’s old company, Halliburton, of profiting off the Iraq War, the Vermont Democrat approached the vice president on the Senate floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hey Dick,” Leahy recalled saying in an interview Thursday, “why don’t you talk to the Democratic side?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney wasn’t amused.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“F--- yourself,” he told Leahy before complaining about the Democrat’s recent comments about him.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Cheney dismisses critic with obscenity</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But like for many Democrats, Cheney’s public support for his daughter’s outspoken anti-Trump vows has softened Leahy’s feelings toward the elder Cheney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that the younger Cheney’s actions remind him of the stories he heard when he first arrived in Washington in 1975.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They thought it was a thing they had to do,” said Leahy, who watched Liz Cheney’s media appearances Thursday morning. “And that’s what I was thinking of, more than anything else.”</p></div></div>

<i>May he go in peace</i> — and then they took turns shoveling dirt into the grave. The hollow thud of frozen earth striking wood was followed by the wails of Raskin’s wife and two daughters, and these, too, were sounds he would not forget.
<p><i>Please forgive me, </i>Tommy had written in his final hours. <i>My illness won today. Please look after each other, the animals, and the global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.</i></p>

<div><div><p>“It was the day after we buried her brother, our son Tommy, the saddest day of our lives,” said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead House impeachment manager.</p></div></div>

<div><p>But now the third-term lawmaker was recounting it at length in the utterly silent chamber, for an audience of 100 U.S. senators — some watching remotely — on the first day of the impeachment trial of the former president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The reason they came with me that Wednesday, January 6th, is they wanted to be together with me in the middle of a devastating week for our family,” Raskin said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>While Raskin prepared a speech to give on the floor later that day, dozens of his colleagues — both Republicans and Democrats, Raskin said — streamed in to offer their condolences for Tommy’s death.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I felt a sense of being lifted up from the agony,” he said, although the feeling wouldn’t last.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And then they heard the mob.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s really when my mind went to the drills we had in school: Hide under a desk. Hide in corners. Turn lights off and turn off any noise. Don’t speak,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Raskins remember Tommy: ‘A radiant light in this broken world.’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Jamie Raskin, separated from his daughter and son-in-law while still in the House chamber, was frantic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The chaplain said a prayer, and the members put their gas masks on, “and then there was a sound I will never forget,” Raskin said, “the sound of pounding on the door like a battering ram.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tabitha Raskin and Kronick sent what they thought could be their final text messages to loved ones, Jamie Raskin said: “They thought they were going to die.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And you know what she said?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raskin paused, fighting back tears.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She said, ‘Dad, I don’t want to come back to the Capitol.’ ”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Philip Bump</div></div>National correspondent </span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 10:28 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“Watch your back,” one read. “I KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP, I SEE YOU SLEEPING. BE AFRAID, BE VERRY AFRAID. I hope you die.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This is a relatively tame example.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That report came out on Thursday. On Friday, the Texas Tribune published an indirectly related update.</p></div></div>
<a>reported</a>, “finding few issues despite repeated, unsubstantiated claims by GOP leaders casting doubts on the integrity of the electoral system.”
<a>cobbled together a new set of “questions”</a> (most of which had already been answered). There was the review of Michigan’s votes conducted by a Republican-led committee — which
<a>failed to find</a> any evidence of significant fraud in the state’s vote tally. A similar review conducted by
<a>a conservative group in Wisconsin</a> came to the same conclusion about that state’s vote. There have been repeated reviews in Georgia, the target of a coordinated effort to overturn the results, as
<a>documented</a> by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But the only reasonable conclusion from the effort is that nothing questionable actually happened there.
<a>fewer than 500 votes</a> that might — might! — have been questionably cast (or that were prevented from being cast in the first place). That’s out of 25.6 million votes cast.
<i>Americans</i> reject the idea that the election of Joe Biden was not legitimate or that there’s solid evidence that fraud occurred, both obviously false assertions. But most
<i>he bears no responsibility at all</i>. Nearly three-quarters think that he bears either no or just some blame.
<div><div><p>On Monday morning, the Wall Street Journal <a>reported</a> that law enforcement agencies are focused on nebulous threats associated with the Jan. 6 anniversary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the poll by The Post and U-Md., 4 in 10 Republicans said that violent action against the government is sometimes justified. The danger lingers, as does the lie.</p></div></div>

<div><p>“Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden,” wrote Pelosi (D-Calif.).</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win. Violence never wins. Freedom wins. This is still the people’s house,” Pence said as he formally reopened the Senate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the rioters had tried to disrupt democracy. “They failed,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) earned sustained applause from his colleagues for a thundering speech in which he said elected leaders should show respect for voters by telling them the truth, not fueling groundless doubts about the election.</p></div>
<div><div><p>At one point early Thursday morning, the raw emotions nearly sparked a physical confrontation after Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) accused Republicans of peddling falsehoods about election fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That that attack today, it didn’t materialize out of nowhere,” Lamb said. “It was inspired by lies — the same lies that you’re hearing in this room tonight.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That sparked an exchange of words between Republicans and Democrats sitting behind Lamb that nearly led to blows before aides intervened.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Both chambers picked up Wednesday night where they had left off before the evacuation, considering a challenge to Biden’s 11 electoral votes in Arizona. The Senate rejected the challenge by 93 to 6 and the House by 303 to 121.</p></div>
<div><div><p>House members also objected when Pence read the tallies from Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, but those challenges died when no senators joined them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lawmakers then moved to reconvene the joint session and complete the counting of the remaining states, setting up a final confirmation of Biden’s victory at 3:45 a.m. — nearly 21 hours after the proceedings began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Only after the D.C. National Guard had been activated and political leaders in both parties condemned the rioting and appealed for calm did authorities declare the Capitol was secure.</p></div></div>
<p>Still, the outcome of the congressional proceedings had been clear from the start, particularly after Pence announced he would reject pleas from the president to use his role as the session’s presiding officer to hand a win to Trump.</p>
<div><div><p>McConnell, who also had said little publicly about the process before Wednesday, likewise delivered a stirring opening floor speech imploring his colleagues not to damage democracy by objecting to the votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken — they’ve all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The tense day turned to chaos when pro-Trump rioters, stirred up at a rally where the president called for them to march on the Capitol, stormed the building and caused the proceedings to be halted for hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several hours after his supporters had broken into the Capitol, Trump tweeted and released a video calling on them to respect law enforcement. But he also repeated lies about the election being stolen from him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All that was left before the inauguration later this month was for a joint session of Congress to gather Wednesday and read those votes aloud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For days leading up to Wednesday, Trump had also pressed Pence, whom the Constitution requires to preside over the ceremony, to refuse to recognize electoral college slates from swing states that backed Biden.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortly before he took the gavel, however, Pence released a three-page letter he had written to members of Congress, rejecting Trump’s pleas.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” he wrote.</p></div>
<div><div><p>When Biden’s votes from Arizona were read aloud, Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), joined Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to object.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At that point, the House and Senate retreated to their respective chambers to debate the challenge, with Pence presiding over the Senate and Pelosi overseeing the House.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For nearly 30 minutes, the process ran largely as expected. McConnell pleaded for Republicans not to heed Trump’s call to object to the results.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,” he said, calling the vote the most important in his 36 years in the Senate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cruz insisted he was seeking only a 10-day audit of the results and not necessarily to overturn the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His remarks ignored that more than <a>90 state and federal judges</a>, including jurists appointed by both Democrats and Republicans, have considered and rejected claims of fraud or other irregularities since the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If for some reason Congress were not able to confirm the electoral college vote between now and Inauguration Day, Pelosi would become acting president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we absolutely know is that at noon on Jan. 20, the current term of both President Trump and Vice President Pence end,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Biden has installed a significant number of judges from diverse backgrounds — now comes the hard part</h1></div>
<h2>The pace reflects an urgency from the Biden White House and Democratic senators to make up ground lost to Republicans who prioritized filling the judiciary with conservatives during the Trump presidency.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Seung Min Kim</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Ann E. Marimow</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 19, 2021 at 6:41 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The pace reflects an urgency from the Biden White House and Democratic senators to make up ground lost to Republicans who prioritized filling the judiciary with conservatives, putting in place more than 230 judges during the Trump presidency.</p>
<p>And when it comes to nominations, speed has been of the essence from the start, with administration officials well aware that any factor out of their control could disrupt the steady pipeline of candidates being confirmed at a record pace.</p>
<div><div><p>Biden’s success in getting judges confirmed comes as other parts of his agenda are falling apart — including a sweeping domestic policy bill and overhauling the nation’s voting laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the road ahead on judges is likely to be difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If they don’t, that’s consequential to me,” Thune said. “I think that affects whether or not you would clear somebody.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We really haven’t gotten to first base for some reason,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, the state’s other Republican senator. “I don’t know why.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Recruiting judicial candidates began as far back as the transition, when incoming White House counsel Dana Remus wrote to all Democratic senators to request names of qualified candidates from their home states.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House is also recruiting people with work histories traditionally underrepresented on the bench, including lawyers who served as public defenders, as well as immigration and labor attorneys.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Certainly, the partisan affiliation of a state’s senators have mattered a great deal when filling judicial vacancies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For months, the staff for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and White House officials have negotiated over a vacancy on the 10th Circuit that opened up in March, exchanging names and providing input.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would say that we have offered advice,” Moran said. “We don’t know whether the advice has or will be accepted.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House said that although it would work with senators on filling vacancies, consultation does not mean approval.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We work for a president who is a creature of the Senate, who believes very much in consulting with the Senate,” Herwig said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Biden is making notable strides in starting to reshape a federal judiciary that Trump and McConnell transformed.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ann E. Marimow</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 22, 2021 at 5:06 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is weighing whether to transfer the case instead temporarily to the Texas Supreme Court, a step requested by state officials that could delay resolution for months.</p></div></div>
<p>Abortion rights advocates say any diversion from the district court would impede their effort to invalidate the law, which has halted most abortions in Texas and forced patients across state lines to terminate pregnancies beyond the six-week mark.</p>
<div><p>Supreme Court sends Texas abortion case to appeals court instead of to judge who previously blocked the law</p></div>
<div><p>The appeals court could rule at any time and has several options. It could temporarily send the case to the Texas high court; schedule additional briefing and argument before a three-judge panel; or return the case to district court.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The law is at odds with Supreme Court precedents, including <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the nearly 50-year old decision protecting the right to abortion before viability, usually around 23 weeks into pregnancy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Future of abortion rights depends on a Supreme Court for which compromise seems elusive</p></div>
<a>a Mississippi abortion law</a> that mostly bans the procedure after 15 weeks. At oral argument in that case, the court’s conservative justices seemed open to overturning
<div><div><p>To do otherwise, they said, would contradict the Dec. 10 ruling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Supreme Court’s decision leaves no room for this Court to do anything else,” the lawyers told the 5th Circuit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>How quickly and before which court the lawsuit is reviewed is critical to the outcome of the case, according to abortion providers.</p></div></div>
<h3>More on the fight over abortion access in the U.S. </h3>
<b>The latest: </b>On Dec. 1, the Supreme Court heard arguments in
<i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Center</i>, a case from Mississippi that legal observers say could weaken or overturn the legal right to an abortion established by
<i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i>. A ruling is expected sometime in 2022.

<div><div><p>The Thursday order granted part of the request from abortion providers — returning the case immediately rather than after the court’s standard 25-day delay.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it sent the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, as requested by Texas officials led by Attorney General Ken Paxton (R).</p></div></div>
<div><p>He told the Supreme Court that Texas plans to ask the 5th Circuit to direct the Texas Supreme Court to interpret a provision of state law before the case is sent back to the district court. It is unclear how long that could take.</p></div>
