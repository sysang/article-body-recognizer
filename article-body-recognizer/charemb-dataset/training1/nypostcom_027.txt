<h1> Ronnie Spector, rock icon behind ‘Be My Baby,’ dead at 78</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 5:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 9:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Ronnie Spector, the powerhouse vocalist and teenage ingenue behind the ’60s rock band the Ronettes, died on Wednesday at 78.</p>
<p>“Ronnie lived her life with a twinkle in her eye, a spunky attitude, a wicked sense of humor and a smile on her face. She was filled with love and gratitude,” they continued.</p>
<p>“Her joyful sound, playful nature and magical presence will live on in all who knew, heard or saw her.” </p>
<p>Spector, born Veronica Yvette Bennett in 1943, was known for singing Ronettes hits including “Be My Baby,” “Baby, I Love You” and “Walking in the Rain.” </p>
<p>Her trademark beehive and unapologetic bad-girl swagger made waves in the music industry when the rock group first hit the airwaves in 1963. </p>
<p>The group’s first album, 1964’s “Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica,” was an instant hit, with five of its 12 tracks making it to the top of the Billboard charts.</p>
<p>In 1968 at age 25, after the Ronettes split, she married Phil Spector, the infamous Wall of Sound producer behind the group’s hits. </p>
<p>But Ronnie, who has <a>spoken in depth</a> about the abuse and vindictiveness she suffered at the hands of her first husband before and after their 1974 divorce, also referenced the bad times. </p>
<p>Ronnie had previously accused him of pulling a gun on her, forcing her to sign a divorce settlement that reportedly cut her out of future records earning, and even lobbying the Rock Roll Hall of Fame to not induct her.</p>
<p>The couple had three adopted children — Donté Phillip and twins Louis and Gary. In 2009, Phil was convicted <a>of murdering actress Lana Clarkson</a> in 2003. <a>He died in prison in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>In 1982, she married her manager Jonathan Greenfield and they had two sons, Austin Drew and Jason Charles.</p>
<h1> ‘Halloween Kills’ proves Kyle Richards’ real nightmare is not ‘RHOBH’ nemesis</h1>
<div> June 25, 2021 9:54am <div> Updated <div> June 25, 2021 11:44am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Lisa Vanderpump has nothing on Michael Myers.</p>
<p>The official trailer for the next installment in the iconic Laurie Strode vs. Michael Myers horror franchise dropped Thursday night — and Kyle Richards is stealing “Halloween Kills.”</p>
<p>The general consensus more than 40 years later: Myers is way scarier than Richards’ arch nemesis Vanderpump, 60, let alone the rest of her constantly catfighting “RHOBH” crew.</p>
<p>Yes, the silly survivor is thinking once again that she finally offed her lifetime “boogeyman.” Not so fast. </p>
<p>Filmmaker David Gordon Green’s <a>2018 “Halloween” reboot</a> — starring OG scream queen Curtis — raked in more than $250 million at the box office worldwide. </p>
<p>That film now ranks as the highest grossing entry in the four-decade franchise and set a new record for the biggest opening weekend in history for a horror film starring a woman, <a>Deadline reported.</a></p>
<p>Fans can watch what happens when “Halloween Kills” finally gets to haunt theaters on October 15, after repeated COVID-19 delays.</p>
<h1> Matthew Stafford, Rams crush Cardinals for QB’s first NFL playoff win</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 11:54pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:21am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The quarterback still took off running on third-and-long through the heart of the Cardinals’ defense on a gleeful, perilous scramble that ultimately ended short of a first down.</p>
<p>Even while shouldering enormous postseason pressure, Stafford never forgot to have fun. He was strong enough to carry it all — and the Rams are riding him on to Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>Stafford passed for 202 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score in his first playoff win, and the Rams roared out of the wild-card round with a 34-11 victory over Arizona on Monday night.</p>
<p>Odell Beckham Jr. and Cooper Kupp made touchdown catches for the NFC West champion Rams (13-5), who will visit the defending Super Bowl champion Buccaneers on Sunday for a spot in the NFC championship game.</p>
<p>After an inconsistent finish to the regular season, the Rams’ constellation of big stars came together brilliantly around Stafford on the postseason stage.</p>
<p>Beckham had four catches for 54 yards, including his first career playoff touchdown catch for the Rams’ first points. He also threw a 40-yard pass during his own first postseason victory.</p>
<p>Linebacker Von Miller added six tackles and a key early sack in his first postseason appearance since winning the MVP award in Super Bowl 50.</p>
<p>Murray went 19 of 34 for 137 yards and two interceptions for the Cardinals (11-7), who followed their 10-2 start with a 1-5 slide. Arizona lost on the road for only the second time in 10 games this season under coach Kliff Kingsbury.</p>
<p>“Losing is one thing, but when you don’t even make it competitive is another,” Murray said.</p>
<p>The Rams capped their second offensive drive with Stafford’s precise 4-yard throw to Beckham. The veteran wideout has six TD catches in his last eight games since he joined the Rams at midseason.</p>
<p>After Long’s TD, the Cardinals finally got a first down seven minutes before halftime, but Rams lineman Marquise Copeland got his first career interception on a deflected pass.</p>
<p>“I feel like we was dominant out there,” All-Pro Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald said. “I feel like the quarterback wasn’t comfortable at all.”</p>

<h1> Halsey rips Grizzlies’ Desmond Bane for ‘s–t talking’ LeBron James</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 3:38pm <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 3:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Halsey sat courtside for Lakers-Grizzlies on Sunday night, which always means we will be treated to several basketball observations from the music star.</p>
<p>The singer specifically directed her ire on this night towards Desmond Bane, who she accused of loudly and inappropriately talking trash to LeBron James.</p>
<p>“Bane got an unnaturally loud and rude big ass f–kin mouth,” she tweeted from her account, Halseyand1, which she runs to chronicle her Lakers fandom.</p>
<p>In response to a Memphis fan’s angry response to her criticism, Halsey doubled down that Bane was over the line.</p>
<p>“Bruh shut the f–k up this man lebron almost had to give him a masterclass in decorum,” Halsey <a>tweeted</a>. </p>
<p>“Everyone s–t talks but word on the court was ‘“he’s a problem.”’</p>
<p>Bane, 23, is a second-year forward on the Grizzlies averaging 17.7 points per game. Memphis won the road game, 127-119. </p>
<p>In previous tweet sprees about basketball this season, Halsey lamented that Lakers coach <a>Frank Vogel was blocking her view</a>, and said she’d <a>love to announce hoops on ESPN</a>. </p>
<h1> Giants GM candidates have mixed histories of identifying franchise quarterbacks</h1>

<div> January 16, 2022 6:46pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 11:13pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>If the Giants knew for certain which of their nine candidates for general manager can identify a franchise quarterback, the search could be called off. </p>
<p>Too bad it’s the trickiest decision in sports. </p>
<p>The Giants should have a new GM in place by the end of the week. Then a new head coach. Then a new offensive coordinator. What about quarterback? </p>
<p>Daniel Jones’ future is very much uncertain as he likely will play in the final year of his contract in 2022, and co-owner John Mara said the decision will be made by the new regime. </p>

<p>As if it couldn’t get worse for the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night, safety Budda Baker was stretchered off the field after taking a shoulder to the head from Rams running back Cam Akers.</p>
<p>Baker was ruled out for the game after suffering a concussion on the hit and was taken to a local hospital for evaluation. The Cardinals said Baker had movement and feeling in all of his extremities.</p>
<p>Lost amid the injury was the offensive holding call on David Edwards that brought the ball back to the Arizona 15-yard line, eventually leading the Rams to settle for a field goal.</p>
<p>The Rams went on to win the game 34-11.</p>

<h1> Malik Akram called NY number before taking Texas synagogue hostage: report</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:09pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:09pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The armed terrorist who took four people hostage inside a Texas synagogue made phone calls to someone with a New York number before the incident, it was revealed Tuesday. </p>
<p>Investigators probing the incident have identified that person and told the outlet it doesn’t appear they had anything to do with Akram’s plan.</p>
<p>Law enforcement sources told The Post Akram had also used the phone to make calls to his family in the UK to ask for money and tell them he was headed to Texas to get married. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Akram, 44, walked into Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, about 26 miles northwest of Dallas, and <a>took three congregants and a rabbi hostage</a> for 11 hours before he was killed by police. </p>
<p>The British national had been <a>suffering from mental health issues</a> and made demands to the FBI to immediately release Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman who was convicted on terrorism charges in 2010. </p>
<p>Akram apparently chose the synagogue because it looked to be the closest gathering of Jewish people to the federal prison where Siddiqui is serving an 86-year sentence for trying to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, the outlet said. </p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear how long he was at the shelter but Wayne Walker, the CEO and pastor of OurCalling, said Akram arrived at the shelter on Jan. 2 and was seen hugging the man who dropped him off. </p>
<p>“He was dropped off by somebody that looked like he had a relationship with him,” said Walker, adding photos and videos of the man have been turned over to the FBI. </p>
<p>During Akram’s 11-hour standoff with police, his family was called in to help with negotiations and his two teenage children were detained for questioning, law enforcement officials told the outlet. </p>
<p>British investigators detained the kids to try to get a clearer picture of Akram’s actions and motives but it wasn’t immediately clear what they were able to provide. </p>
<p>On Sunday, Greater Manchester Police said two teens were taken into custody for questioning in connection with the incident and on Tuesday, the kids were released without charges, the outlet said. </p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, The Telegraph reported Akram was <a>previously investigated by UK intelligence services</a> “in the second half of 2020” but determined not to be a terroristic threat. The probe was closed shortly.</p>

<h1> US to sanction pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine as Blinken visits: report</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:12pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:12pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The United States is set to levy financial sanctions on pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine as tensions grow between Washington and Moscow — with Secretary of State Antony Blinken due to meet his Russian counterpart Friday.</p>
<p>US officials told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the sanctions are meant to pressure Russia into pulling back from a potential invasion of its western neighbor.</p>
<p>Approximately 100,000 Russian troops have amassed along the Russia-Ukraine border in recent months, causing many to fear an invasion similar to when Russia annexed Crimea eight years ago.</p>
<p>“We are now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<a>measure proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)</a> that would have slapped sanctions on the Russian company behind the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline that links Russia and Germany.
<p>On Monday, Lavrov rejected allegations that his country was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine as “total disinformation.”</p>
<p>Blinken underscored to Lavrov on Tuesday that any discussion of European security “must include NATO Allies and European partners, including Ukraine,” the State Department said.</p>
<p>Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during last week’s Russia-US negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels.</p>
<h1> ‘We are going on the record’: Schumer presses Manchin, Sinema on moot filibuster vote</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:56pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Chuck Schumer is going to make his point — even it’s a moot one.</p>
<p>The Democratic Senate majority leader from New York issued a stern warning to Republicans and defenders of the filibuster in his own party Tuesday, saying: “We are going to vote. We are all going to go on the record.”</p>
<p>“If the Republicans block cloture on the legislation before us, I will put forward a proposal to change the rules to allow for a talking filibuster on this legislation.”</p>
<p>The Senate is now expected to vote Wednesday on changes to the rules that would provide a workaround of the chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>But the vote is almost certain to fail due to centrist Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema’s staunch opposition to changing the requirement.</p>
<p>In response, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pointed out that the 60-vote filibuster was used by Democrats to defeat a Russia sanctions bill pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). </p>
<p>“A faction this desperate for unlimited short-term power is a faction that must be denied it,” McConnell concluded.</p>
<a>massive piece of legislation by the House last week</a>, they believe the filibuster is a vital component of the Senate and that amending it would deepen America’s political divide.
<p>Meanwhile, talk of primary challenges against Manchin and Sinema as a result of their stance has begun to pick up pace, though neither is up for reelection until 2024. </p>
<p>Tuesday evening, the head of the pro-choice group EMILY’s List announced it would no longer endorse Sinema if she stuck to her filibuster stance. </p>
<h1> Jan. 6 House committee subpoenas Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, 2 others</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 6:08pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 6:53pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>In addition to Giuliani, the committee subpoenaed former Trump campaign attorneys Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, as well as Trump 2020 strategic adviser Boris Epshteyn.</p>
<p>Thompson also said that Giuliani “actively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of former President Trump and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.”</p>
<a>bizarre press conference in Philadelphia</a> the Saturday after Election Day at which he claimed that “Will Smith’s father has voted here twice since he has died.”
<p>In subsequent days and weeks, Giuliani went so far as to travel to states where Trump had disputed the election results, insisting that Biden was not the true winner.</p>
<p>That assertion led the Trump campaign to distance themselves from Powell and triggered a $1.3 billion lawsuit against her and Giuliani by the company. </p>
<p>The committee wants to speak to Ellis, meanwhile, about two memos she reportedly drafted outlining how Vice President Mike Pence could reject the slates of electors submitted to Congress in states where Trump believed he had won. </p>
<p>The letter gave all four until Feb. 1 to produce documents and scheduled a deposition for Feb. 8.</p>

<p>89% of participants also shared that this retinol treatment was gentle enough to use daily, which is rare to find when it comes to powerful retinol products.</p>
<p>One reviewer even said, “I love the face stick! The retinol is making a visible difference after only a month [of use] with no skin irritation,” while another exclaimed, “I love this stick! [It] really works!”</p>

<h1> The best charcuterie boards of 2022, per ‘The Big Board’ blogger</h1>

<p>It’s time to whip out a wooden board and a spread of creamy brie and gourmet gouda cheese. But, if taking inspiration from Sandy Coughlin, it won’t be just a basic cheese and cracker charcuterie.</p>
<p>“The Big Board” blogger at the Reluctant Entertainer is plastered all over the Internet holding her larger-than-life, gorgeously arranged creations.</p>
<p>While she’s been blogging since 2006, Coughlin said her big moment came in 2017 when she “invited 12 national bloggers” to her home in San River, Oregon to make a now-viral “giant charcuterie board.”</p>
<p>She’s since become known for her big boards, with her “<a>taco dinner board</a> being the most popular.”</p>
<a>holiday best brunch board</a>,
<a>epic summer mini pie board</a> and
<a>summer lunch turkey sandwich board</a> — which means that any meal or appetizer you’d throw on a plate can be amped up with a wooden centerpiece if Coughlin has anything to do with it.
<p>But Coughlin insists not to overthink it when it comes to inspiration for a board.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 7</div> </div> </div>
<p>Not to mention, the gigantic board she holds all over her blog, Pinterest and Instagram are from her very own collection, designed with J.K. Adams, an American-made company, to help create more jobs during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Coughlin, who authored the “<a>Big Boards for Families</a>” cookbook, took inspiration from her own techniques while designing the boards.</p>

<p>Additionally, Coughlin shares which types of boards to buy and how to formulate unique board recipes within her new cookbook.</p>
<h2>What should I put on a charcuterie board?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, there’s no hard and fast rule when designing your board for family and friends. But, Coughlin shares her tried-and-true tips for beginner board makers and designers of the Instagram-worthy charcuterie alike.</p>
<a>Lesley Stowe crackers</a>,” she said. “And, you want to put a sturdy cracker on your charcuterie because there’s nothing worse than a flimsy cracker you can’t spread cheese on.”
<p>Coughlin has all of her <a>“Big Board” recipes</a> on her blog for you to browse, too.</p>
<h3>1. <a>Smirly Cheese Board and Knife Set</a>, $49.99</h3>

<h3>2. <a>Compact Swivel Cheese Board with Knives</a>, $45-$69</h3>
