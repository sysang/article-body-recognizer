<h1> COVID-19: Singapore stops accepting new entry applications for work pass holders from higher-risk countries </h1>
<div> <p>Workers needed for key strategic projects and infrastructural works will be allowed to enter, says the Manpower Ministry.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Gabrielle Andres </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore will not accept new entry applications for work pass holders from higher-risk countries and regions with immediate effect, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in several places around the world. </p>
<p>The new restriction excludes workers needed for key strategic projects and infrastructural works, who will be allowed to enter, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday (May 7).</p>
<p>Higher-risk countries and regions refer to all places except Australia, Brunei, mainland China, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. </p>
<p>Work pass holders from higher-risk places who earlier received approval to enter Singapore before Jul 5 will no longer be allowed to do so - except for migrant domestic workers and those in the construction, marine shipyard and process industry.</p>
<p>“We will inform employers on when to re-apply for entry when the situation has stabilised and will prioritise them for entry approval then,” said MOM.</p>

<p>ARRIVALS RESCHEDULED FOR SOME APPROVED WORKERS</p>
<p>For migrant domestic workers, those who have already obtained approval will be allowed to enter Singapore, with the exception of some with planned arrivals before Jun 7.</p>
<p>They will be rescheduled to arrive in subsequent weeks, MOM said.</p>
<p>Similarly, workers in the construction, marine shipyard and process industry who have obtained approval will be allowed to enter. However, a small group with planned arrivals in June will be rescheduled to arrive in subsequent weeks.</p>
<p>“In this period of heightened alert, we are making changes to the entry of work pass holders who have earlier obtained approvals to arrive from higher-risk countries and regions from Tuesday, May 11 onwards,” MOM said.</p>

<p>The ministry also said it will be reaching out to affected work pass holders and their employers about the changes to their entry dates.</p>
<p>“We seek the understanding and cooperation of work pass holders and their employers for these changes,” MOM said.</p>
<p>“They are necessary to enable workers to enter in a safe and calibrated manner, and mitigate the risk of COVID-19 importation.”</p>

<p>Singapore has been tightening COVID-19 border measures in recent days.</p>
<p>On Apr 22, it announced that all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India will not be allowed entry from Apr 24 due to the worsening COVID-19 situation there.</p>
<p>On May 2, this was extended to include those with <a>recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</a></p>
<p>Due to the restrictions, companies that have traditionally relied on migrant workers from India and Bangladesh are faced with a shortage of workers and are <a>looking for alternative options</a>.</p>
<p>Companies said project delays and disruptions are expected for the time being, while the Building and Construction Authority has promised support measures such as granting more flexibility for firms bringing in workers from China.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore will stop entry or transit for visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force said on Friday (Apr 30).</p>
<p>The ban starts on May 2 and covers all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have been in the four countries in the last 14 days, including transit.</p>
<p>It will also apply to those who have obtained prior entry approval from Singapore authorities, said co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong.</p>
<p>Those with recent travel history to the four countries, who are serving a 14-day stay-home notice in Singapore as of May 3, will have this extended by another seven days at dedicated stay-home facilities.</p>
<p>They will also have to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on their arrival, on the 14th day of their stay-home notice, and before the end of their 21-day notice.</p>
<p>These measures come after a “deterioration” in the COVID-19 situation in India, with the infection spreading beyond India to the surrounding countries, said Mr Wong. India is registering <a>more than 300,000 new cases daily</a>. </p>
<h3><a>READ: COVID-19: People 'should limit' social interactions to maximum of 2 a day, says MOH</a></h3>
<p>They may not opt out of the dedicated facilities, even if they have obtained prior approval.</p>
<p>Thailand is experiencing a <a>third wave of COVID-19 cases</a>, reporting about 2,000 new daily cases. The spike has prompted shutdowns in Bangkok and other areas.</p>
<p>SINGAPORE-HONG KONG TRAVEL BUBBLE</p>
<p>Singapore will maintain its current conditions for suspension of the <a>travel bubble with Hong Kong</a>, said Mr Wong.</p>
<p>He was responding to a question on whether the discovery of a cluster of COVID-19 cases linked to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and heightened community measures would affect the relaunch of the travel bubble, slated for May 26.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Staff placed on leave of absence, 4 wards locked down as Tan Tock Seng Hospital moves to contain cluster</a></h3>
<p>Singapore and Hong Kong said earlier that the bubble would be suspended if the seven-day moving average of unlinked community cases in either city increases to above five. It can only resume when the COVID-19 situation has stabilised.</p>
<p>This is the second time both cities are attempting to launch a travel bubble. The launch was originally scheduled for November last year but was deferred after a spike in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>"We just have to be mentally prepared that this is not a situation where new initiatives are rolled out and then they will continue permanently without any potential for disruption, because the situation is so fluid," Mr Wong said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Singapore returns to tighter COVID-19 measures: What's allowed under the new rules? </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Gabrielle Andres </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: With the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the community, Singapore has announced tighter measures for about three weeks from Saturday (May 8) to curb the spread of infection.</p>
<p>Places that are considered high-risk, such as indoor gyms and fitness studios, will have to close unless they offer low-intensity activities, while fewer people will be allowed at attractions, public libraries, funerals and MICE events.</p>
<p>Limits for gatherings will also be reduced from eight people to five - bringing Singapore back to what it was in Phase 2 of its reopening, which ended on Dec 27.</p>
<p>Here are some changes that may affect your everyday activities:</p>
<p>CAN I MEET FAMILY OR FRIENDS AT THEIR HOMES? </p>
<p>Yes, but households can only receive five distinct visitors per day.</p>
<p>People are also advised to keep to a maximum of two social gatherings per day, whether it is to visit another household or to meet with friends or family in a public place.</p>
<p>The five-person rule applies to all social gatherings, including dining at restaurants.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Cap of 5 people for social gatherings, household visits to return as Singapore tightens COVID-19 measures</a></h3>
<p>CAN I STILL GO FOR EXERCISE CLASSES?</p>
<p>Yes, if you are taking outdoor classes, which are subject to a cap of 30 participants. Group sizes must be kept to five people, with a 3m distance between each group.</p>
<p>Authorities earlier said indoor gyms and fitness studios will have to close as they are considered high-risk. </p>
<a>if they offer "low-intensity physical activities</a>, sport and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times".
<p>The facilities are not allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, or provide equipment for such training which is associated with strenuous activities.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE WORKPLACE RESTRICTIONS?</p>
<p>More people will have to work from home.</p>
<p>From May 8 to 30, the proportion of employees returning to the workplace will be reduced to 50 per cent, down from the current 75 per cent.</p>
<p>For those returning to the workplace, employers must stagger their start times and implement flexible working hours. Split team arrangements are not required.</p>
<p>However, social gatherings at workplaces should be avoided, authorities said. In cases where they cannot be avoided, gatherings are limited to the revised group size of five.</p>
<p>CAN I STILL ATTEND WORSHIP SERVICES?</p>
<p>Yes, but pre-event COVID-19 testing will be required for services with more than 100 attendees at any one time.</p>
<p>There is no change to the cap of 250 attendees but currently, pre-event testing is not required.</p>
<p>As an additional measure, congregational singing will be suspended in religious organisations to manage risk of COVID-19 spread.</p>

<p>HOW WILL WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS BE AFFECTED?</p>
<p>As with current restrictions, marriage solemnisations may proceed with up to 250 attendees. This includes the wedding couple but excludes the solemniser and vendors. </p>
<p>Guests must be grouped in zones of up to 50 attendees.</p>
<p>What's new is that pre-event testing will be required for the wedding couple if their solemnisation involves more than 50 attendees.</p>
<p>Similarly, wedding receptions with up to 250 attendees may continue in zones or time slots of up to 50 guests each. </p>
<p>But pre-event testing will be required for all attendees if the reception involves more than 50 people. This limit is currently set at 100.</p>
<p>For burials or cremations, the cap on attendees will be reduced from 50 to 30. The limit for other days of the wake will remain at 30 people at any one time.</p>
<p>WILL ATTRACTIONS AND TOURS CLOSE?</p>
<p>No, but there will be a new limit on the number of visitors.</p>
<p>Operating capacities at attractions, museums and public libraries will be reduced from 65 per cent to 50 per cent. </p>
<p>Tour groups will need to reduce the number of participants to 20 people from the current limit of 50.</p>
<p>For cinemas, pre-event testing will be required if there are more than 100 patrons. There will be no change to the total number of patrons allowed, which is capped at 250.</p>
<p>Remember to bring along your TraceTogether token when you head out, or simply use the TraceTogether app on your phone.</p>
<p>Trace Together-only Safe Entry at high-risk venues will <a>start on May 17</a>, after authorities announced that its implementation will be brought forward by two weeks.</p>
<p>Scanning of Safe Entry QR codes with phone cameras and the SingPass application will be discontinued from the same day. Check-ins using national identification cards will be allowed until May 31 to ease the transition.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Companies that have traditionally relied on migrant workers from India and Bangladesh are now looking further afield for labour, several firms told CNA.</p>
<p>However, they also said that they are just starting to explore the options, and to expect project delays and disruptions for the time being.</p>
<p>From May 2, Singapore barred entry or transit for visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This travel ban, which includes long-term pass holders, came amid a series of moves to tighten Singapore borders as the COVID-19 outbreak in India worsens and Singapore clocked more local coronavirus cases in recent weeks.</p>

<h3><a>READ: India sees record COVID-19 deaths, new cases in 24 hours</a></h3>
<p>The Building and Construction Authority on Apr 26 said that it will <a>grant more flexibility for firms</a> to bring in workers from China, among other support measures. </p>
<p>But companies told CNA that this will not make up the shortfall.</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF WORKERS SINCE LAST YEAR</p>
<p>A manager in the construction industry, who only wanted to be know as Alan, said that the cost of hiring workers from China will "shoot up" as demand increases.</p>
<p>"As it is, the daily rate for a Chinese worker is about S$200 to S$300 per day. With this move, don't be surprised that the cost will go up 30 per cent to 40 per cent more for each worker," he said.</p>
<p>"However, I also think many companies will hold back on hiring more Chinese workers, as they don't have the budget to. And this will lead to more project delays."</p>
<p>This daily rate includes costs such as housing, levies and insurance for the worker, which the company has to pay. The daily rate for workers from India or Bangladesh is about S$120 to S$150 now, up from S$70 to S$80 in the past.</p>
<h3><a>READ: India's neighbours close borders over surge in COVID-19 cases</a></h3>
<p>Mr Kenneth Loo, COO of Straits Construction, said that the situation is "very tight", and manpower was short before the travel restrictions kicked in. He estimates that there is a 30 to 40 per cent shortage of workers currently.</p>
<p>"There was a net decrease of workers from the system practically the whole of last year ... now with the stoppage from India, that makes the whole scenario even more challenging," he said.</p>
<p>He added that while workers from China can fill some gaps, fewer are willing to come to Singapore as economic opportunities in China improve.</p>
<p>"I think we have no choice, we are still looking," he said in response to a question on whether they are sourcing for workers from other countries.</p>
<p>The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) said on Apr 23 that the labour crunch has already caused delay of construction projects for nine to 12 months, while the cost of labour and materials has escalated by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. </p>
<p>"Some companies may be forced to close and it will adversely impact about 100,000 residents working in the construction sector," said the association, adding that there will be project delays.</p>
<p>Ms Christine Sun, OrangeTee senior vice president of research analytics, said that the shortage is likely to be in the short to mid-term. </p>
<p>"The situation may start to stabilise when more people are being vaccinated and travel restrictions are eased again," she said. "Some affected homeowners may need to adjust their wedding or family planning."</p>
<p>LANDSCAPE INDUSTRY AFFECTED</p>
<p>Companies in the landscape industry also said that they face a lack of workers, with some telling CNA that they have had to turn down projects.</p>
<p>Mr Julian Shi of Nature Landscapes said that they have had migrant workers resign or return on leave in the past months but have had difficulty replacing them. The company is now trying to hire about 20 to 40 foreign workers. </p>
<p>"We are not looking at alternatives for the time being. Our present solution is to adapt with the limitation in resources. We are working with service buyers to extend project timelines," he said.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Singapore returns to tighter COVID-19 measures: What's allowed under the new rules?</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the Landscape Industry Association (Singapore) sent out a notice to service buyers to say that it supports the tighter border controls and appealed to them to postpone non-essential work so that their workers will not "burnout".</p>
<p>Chairman Goh Eng Lam said that their companies will be working with the Ministry of Manpower and other agencies to seek other sources of foreign manpower.</p>
<p>Workers from India and Bangladesh do essential work such as grass cutting and tree works, he said. He thinks there will be a 15 to 20 per cent shortage of workers in the coming months.</p>
<p>"These are all areas of our economy that rely heavily on South Asian migrant labour," she said. </p>
<p>She said that migrant workers who are still working in Singapore are being expected to take on heavier workloads and longer working hours as a result of this labour shortage. </p>
<p>Mr Goh also warned against "overloading" landscape workers, asking service buyers to consider the workers' personal and mental health.</p>
<p>"We cannot take things for granted (and think) that they are superman," he said. "If they do not have enough rest or fall sick, it's going to make matters worse."</p>

<div> <div> <a> Johannes Tjendro </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore has not been able to "adequately replace" migrant workers who have left the country over the last year, given the presence of COVID-19 border restrictions, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Tuesday (May 18).</p>
<p>In a statement to the media, the ministry said there have been recent calls by members of the public to close Singapore's borders "entirely" to bring down the number of imported infections.</p>
<p>"At the same time, businesses have been appealing for more workers to be allowed to enter Singapore to address manpower shortages," the statement added.</p>
<p>According to MOM, the outflow of migrant workers over the last year has exceeded the inflow, as workers ended their contracts and chose to return home.</p>
<p>"As a result of border restrictions to mitigate importation risks, we have not been able to adequately replace those who have left Singapore," said the ministry.</p>
<p>IMPACT OF NOT ALLOWING ANY MIGRANTS IN WOULD HAVE BEEN "SEVERE"</p>
<p>MOM said the impact of not allowing any migrant workers to enter Singapore after the COVID-19 "circuit breaker" last year would have been "severe" for businesses and families.</p>
<p>In response to CNA's queries, MOM clarified that these figures include work permit and S Pass holders in the construction and services sectors, as well as foreign domestic workers on work permits.</p>
<p>The ministry also referred to data available on its website, stating the total number of foreign workers in Singapore. As of December 2020, there were 1.23 million migrant workers in the country, down from 1.43 million a year before.</p>
<p>The latest figure includes 177,100 employment pass holders, 174,000 S Pass holders, 247,400 foreign domestic workers, as well as 311,000 work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors.</p>
<p>MOM also said in its statement: "Border restrictions will impact Singaporeans’ daily lives and this will be felt more keenly in the coming weeks and months."</p>
<a>travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka</a> in the last 14 days have been barred from entry or transit in Singapore. A similar ban has applied to
<p>The decision was taken after a deterioration in the COVID-19 situation in India, with the infection spreading to the surrounding countries, co-chair of the COVID-19 task force Lawrence Wong said, announcing the move.</p>
<p>FIRMS TRYING TO RETAIN EXISTING WORKERS, BUT MANY ARE "HOMESICK"</p>
<p>The Manpower Ministry on Tuesday said many businesses are trying to hold on to existing workers.</p>
<p>"However, many migrant workers are understandably homesick, are worried about their families at home and wish to return home," it added.</p>

<a>an additional seven days of testing</a> on top of a 14-day stay-home notice.
<p>Those headed to dormitories regardless of sector have also been placed under the additional testing regime since January.</p>
<p>This means all such workers, upon arrival, will have to stay at a designated facility for 21 days.</p>
<p>After the three-week period, they are immediately placed on the rostered routine testing regime alongside other workers.</p>
<p>RESTRICTIONS ON INCOMING WORKERS LIKELY TO "PERSIST FOR SOME TIME"</p>
<p>"We are mindful of the manpower crunch that our businesses will face, and the caregiving help that our families will need, as a result."</p>
<p>Mr Wong has also said that <a>Build-to-Order (BTO) housing projects are expected to be delayed</a> by a year or more, as a result of tighter border measures affecting the construction sector.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Work-from-home no longer the default from Jan 1, up to 50% of workers allowed back in the office </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheryl Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: From Jan 1, 50 per cent of employees who can work from home will be allowed to return to the office, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (Dec 14).</p>
<p>This is because previously-announced <a>workforce vaccination measures</a> will kick in on that date, meaning Singapore will be “in a better position to ease the current default work-from-home posture”, said MOH.</p>
<p>Such measures include only allowing employees who are fully vaccinated or who have recently recovered from COVID-19 to return to the workplace.</p>
<p>Working from home has been the <a>default since September</a>, when Singapore began seeing another rise in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed, to "minimise mingling and reduce infection risks", said Mr Gan.</p>
<p>“It does have implications for employers and workers. And that's why we are consulting and discussing with our tripartite partners on this particular move. We will provide more details when the arrangements are finalised.”</p>
<p>In addition, MOH said the cap on participants at work-related events will be raised above the current limit of 50 people.</p>
<p>But this will only apply to events where all participants remain masked and seated, at a safe distance from each other, it said. All participants must also meet the VDS requirements. The ministry added that more details will be provided separately.</p>
<h2>VACCINATION-DIFFERENTIATED SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES EXPANDED</h2>
<p>Vaccination differentiated safe management measures (VDS) for COVID-19 will also be expanded from Feb 1 to cover more areas.</p>
<p>This is in light of the "importance of vaccinations and boosters" in Singapore's fight against the new Omicron variant, said Mr Wong.</p>
<p>From this date, such measures will also cover all indoor sports facilities, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), and leisure guests in hotels, hostels and serviced apartments.</p>
<p>In addition, from Feb 1, all events – irrespective of size – must implement VDS to proceed, said MOH.</p>
<p>This marks a tightening of current rules, where only events with more than 50 attendees are required to do so.</p>
<p>This is because "even smaller-sized events can spark transmission that can then spread to wider groups of people, especially in view of the Omicron variant,” said MOH.</p>
<p>But to minimise disruptions to events that have already been planned for, authorities “will remove the existing concession only in end January 2022”.</p>
<p>MOH also provided an update on the roll-out of “VDS+Test” pilots, which covered sports settings, selected mass sporting events, as well as selected MICE events.</p>
<p>Under the pilot, further easing of safe management measures were allowed for fully vaccinated individuals with a valid negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result on-site prior to the activity.</p>
<p>“These pilots have been successful thus far, given strong compliance and enforcement on the ground, and we will continue to expand these pilots where feasible,” said the ministry.</p>
<p>It also urged non-fully vaccinated recovered persons to receive one dose of an mRNA vaccine at least three months after the date of diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> With plushies and parents in tow, children aged 9 to 11 get vaccinated against COVID-19 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>

<p>“She was too excited actually, and said she wants to go for this first vaccination (shot) as soon as possible,” said Mdm Suzy, 42, outside Pasir Ris Elias Community Club on Monday (Dec 27), where her youngest daughter got her jab. </p>
<p>"At first I was nervous but after I got it, it wasn't that bad," her daughter told CNA. </p>
<h2>"EXCITED" TO GET VACCINATED </h2>
<p>While the children CNA spoke to appeared unbothered by the jab, some were spotted holding onto a stuffed toy or their parent's hands to calm their nerves. A couple almost teared while waiting their turn. </p>
<p>At Hougang Community Club, Madam Doreen Goh and her 10-year-old son were all smiles after a "smooth" vaccination process with "no hurdles". His mother said he had been looking forward to the jab. </p>
<p>The 46-year-old mother said her son was initially "a little nervous", but the friendly nurses helped with his nerves. </p>
<p>"I think most kids are scared of needles. But he's looking forward because he knows about COVID-19 ... about prevention and all," she told CNA. </p>
<p>"He's more worried when he's not jabbed. So after all his vaccinations, we should be fine going out in a group." </p>
<p>The "friendly and approachable" nurses also made the process better for Mdm Suzy and her daughter at Pasir Ris Elias Community Club. </p>
<p>"The nurses were very friendly and approachable. My daughter (recovered from) chicken pox few weeks ago, so we checked with them first whether it was possible to get vaccinated. They said it's no problem," said Mdm Suzy.</p>
<p>Now that her daughter has received her first dose, her entire family will soon be vaccinated. But while they intended to travel, they have made no plans yet. </p>
<p>It was the same for Mdm Uma Devi and her 11-year-old son, who was "excited" to receive a vaccine dose at Our Tampines Hub as it meant they could possibly travel in the near future. </p>
<p>"(Even though we're) not thinking of anywhere right now, it's very important to get vaccinated. My entire family is also vaccinated. (We've got) booster shots too," said Mdm Devi. </p>
<p>Parents also expressed concern that going back to school could expose their children to greater risks, so they did not hesitate to register their child for vaccination. </p>
<p>Mr Muhammad Izuan, whose two older children have been vaccinated, immediately registered his youngest daughter for her jab once he received the invite. </p>
<p>He did not need to gear her up for the jab as she was not afraid, he said. </p>
<p>"I guess it's better to go (get vaccinated), because kids are very vulnerable," he added. </p>
<p>"For me, it's important (that children get vaccinated). Outside now there's the Omicron variant. My worry is when they go to school. Next year it's her PSLE," added Mdm Suzy. </p>
<p>Mdm Goh said getting her son vaccinated would make things “more convenient when they’re going out ... in a group”. </p>
<p>“They have to (lower the) risk of COVID-19 especially (with) children going to school. In a class, there’s usually a huge number of people so it’s better for them,” she added.</p>
<p>Asked whether there was anything to fear in the process, her 10-year-old son, having overcome his initial nerves, replied with an emphatic “no”. </p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Commentary </a> </p> <h5> Commentary: Evidence obesity a risk factor for serious illness with coronavirus is mounting </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Commentary: Evidence obesity a risk factor for serious illness with coronavirus is mounting </h1>
<div> <p>Studies worldwide show a link between severe COVID-19 with obesity and other chronic conditions, say observers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Andrea Pattinson </a> <a> Amanda Salis </a> </div> </div>
<p>SYDNEY: Recent studies have found obesity is a risk factor for becoming seriously ill with COVID-19, alongside older age and chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>It’s true a number of the health conditions which we know increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are also associated with obesity. These include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and respiratory disease.</p>
<p>But new research suggests obesity independently is a strong predictor of severe illness, particularly in those under the age of 60.</p>
<p>This is concerning given two-thirds (67 per cent) of the Australian adult population have a body mass index (BMI) in the overweight or obese range.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Majority who have COVID-19 may not show symptoms but more research needed</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: COVID-19 may be a mild illness for most people</a></h3>
<p>BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m²). While it’s an imperfect measure for an individual person, BMI is very useful in comparing health and weight across a population and between groups.</p>
<p>For adults, overweight is a BMI of 25 or above, but less than 30kg/m². For a woman of average height (162cm), this would be equivalent to a weight of 66kg or above, and for a man of average height (176cm), a weight of 78kg or above.</p>
<p>Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30kg/m² or above. This equates to a weight of 79kg and above for a woman and 93kg and above for a man, both of average height.</p>
<p>One study from China looking at data from 112 patients reported overweight and obesity were almost five times more prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who died (88 per cent) compared to those who survived (19 per cent).</p>
<p>Preliminary data from another Chinese study involving 383 patients, although not yet peer reviewed, suggests overweight or obesity more than doubled the risk of developing severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19, particularly in men.</p>
<p>Further, the need for mechanical ventilation increased with increasing BMI.</p>
<p>Although some of these studies factored in chronic conditions when reporting their results, it’s difficult to separate all of the conditions associated with obesity that may contribute to some degree to the poorer outcomes.</p>
<p>So it’s likely that some – but not all – of the increased risk of severe COVID-19 associated with obesity could be due to people having other chronic conditions.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Can coronavirus spread through your poo? It’s possible</a></h3>
<p>It seems obesity may have more of an impact on the severity of COVID-19 in young people, according to two studies from New York.</p>
<p>One study of 3,615 people who tested positive for COVID-19 found those aged under 60 years with a BMI of between 30 and 34 were almost twice as likely to be admitted to ICU compared to patients with a BMI of less than 30.</p>
<p>This likelihood increased to 3.6 times in those patients with a BMI of 35 or greater.</p>
<p>In patients over the age of 60, the researchers didn’t find a significant link between obesity and severe illness (as indicated by admission to ICU).</p>
<p>Another study, which recorded weight for 178 patients, found obesity was the most common underlying condition for patients under 64 admitted to hospital for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Taken together, the above data suggest there is an association between obesity and more severe COVID-19 illness, particularly in those with a BMI of 35 or greater.</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now lists “severe obesity” as a risk factor for serious COVID-19 illness.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Distracted snacking could put your health and waistline at risk</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Why are we so afraid to talk about obesity?</a></h3>
<p>We know obesity can have a significant impact on lung function. Excess weight around the abdomen can compress the chest, making it more difficult for the diaphragm to move and the lungs to expand and take in air. </p>
<p>This can contribute to lower levels of oxygen in the blood, which may exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We also know obesity results in a chronic state of inflammation which can impair the body’s immune response. This could potentially make it more difficult for the body to fight coronavirus.</p>
<p>The challenges in caring for patients with severe obesity may also affect their outcomes from COVID-19. For example, it’s more difficult to intubate or perform imaging such as X-rays and CT scans in patients with obesity.</p>
<p>Further, positioning ventilated patients on their stomachs can increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs. But this is often not possible for patients with severe obesity.</p>
<p>The short answer is no. If your body weight is above the healthy range, these results should not be cause for panic or impetus to engage in crash diets to reduce COVID-19 risk.</p>
<p>While the data does suggest obesity is a risk factor for more severe illness, it’s early days in the life of COVID-19 and we need more research before we can definitively say what’s going on.</p>
<p>The most significant thing you can do to lower your risk is to follow yourt government’s guidelines.</p>
<p>These restrictions can be challenging and might lead to reduced physical activity and eating for comfort or to ease boredom, potentially resulting in weight gain.</p>

<div> <p>The interplay between non-communicable disease and COVID-19 is a health emergency that must be tackled decisively, says Ifeanyi M Nsofor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ifeanyi M Nsofor </a> </div> </div>
<p>ABUJA, Nigeria: Growing evidence shows that COVID-19 survivors can suffer from long-term health effects, not least heart-related complications.</p>
<p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that many people who recover from the virus have heart inflammation (myocarditis).</p>
<p>Of 100 survivors in the study, 78 had evidence of previous heart inflammation, and 60 showed ongoing inflammation at the time of observation.</p>
<p>This medical complication should worry us all. As of Aug 25, there were more than 23 million cases of the disease worldwide, 16 million recoveries, and more than 800,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Using that same study as a benchmark, we could conjecture that around 10 million of those survivors have heart inflammation, implying a massive increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</p>

<p>HEART DISEASE ALREADY A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH</p>
<p>NCDs were already killing far too many people before the pandemic arrived. </p>
<p>In 2016, 54 per cent of 56.9 million total deaths were due to at least one of the ten leading causes of deaths, starting with ischemic heart disease (the narrowing of blood vessels) and then stroke – both of which are NCDs of the heart.</p>
<p>Myocarditis is a serious condition with life-threatening consequences. When the heart is inflamed, its ability to pump blood is reduced, and it may beat irregularly.</p>
<p>In either case, the supply of blood reaching other parts of the body is reduced, raising the likelihood of stroke and other conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, several NCDs are themselves risk factors for COVID-19.</p>
<p>OBESITY COULD EXPLAIN WHY HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE HIGHER COVID-19 RATES</p>
<p>Obesity is a major public-health problem globally, and tends to increase the risk for many other NCDs.</p>
<p>These obesity statistics may be a factor in the relative severity of COVID-19 across countries, helping to explain why some high-income countries have higher COVID morbidity rates than low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>The interplay between the leading NCDs and COVID-19 constitutes its own health emergency, and requires urgent attention.</p>
<p>Governments and their partners in civil society must step up their efforts to prevent the virus from spreading in the first place.</p>
<p>If everyone were to adopt these practices, the number of new COVID-19 cases would likely fall dramatically, as would the number of people facing heart complications in the near future.</p>
<p>FOCUS ON INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH HEART PROBLEMS</p>
<p>Furthermore, public-health authorities need to start devising interventions to provide lifelong cardiovascular support to COVID-19 survivors.</p>
<p>Given the new data on heart-related complications, the broader pandemic response must include provisions for continuing care.</p>
<p>Although such interventions may require the reallocation or reprioritization of existing resources, they would almost certainly be cost-effective when weighed against the costs of not addressing the additional NCD burden.</p>
<p>LOOK AT REDUCING NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES</p>
<p>In fact, more attention should be focused on reducing the impact of NCDs more generally. The UK’s experience offers lessons here.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The circuit breaker was a time many of us want to forget. Let’s make it count</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the latest science points to the need for better geriatric care. The elderly are at increased risk of both NCDs and more severe complications from COVID-19.</p>
<p>An analysis in July by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 80 per cent of those who had died of COVID-19 in the US up to that point were 65 or older.</p>
<p>Applying that rate to the US death toll as of August 21, it follows that around 139,500 of the 174,442 deceased have been elderly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than three million Americans have now recovered from the virus, and among them are elderly survivors and other high-risk individuals who will need additional care, including home services.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, the health-tech platform GeroCare provides affordable care to the elderly in the comfort of their homes through regular doctor visits. Its least expensive plan offers three home visits per month for just $50.</p>
<p>This approach to care needs to be scaled up significantly. The more we can reduce the heart-related and other complications of COVID-19, the more lives we will save.</p>
