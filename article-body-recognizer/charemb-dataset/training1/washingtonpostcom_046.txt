<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Jacqueline Alemany</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Marianna Sotomayor</div></span></div></span></div><div>May 10, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>When 10 Republicans voted to impeach President Donald Trump on Jan. 13, it marked a historic milestone: It was the most House members from a president’s party to vote to remove him from office.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But since that vote, the 10 lawmakers have cut different paths in grappling with the fallout as they consider their political futures in a party still beholden to Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How an obscure Texas firm helped convince many the election was stolen from Trump</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a letter sent to his Republican colleagues on Monday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said it was time for Cheney to go.</p></div></div>
<div><p>McCarthy backs ousting Cheney from GOP leadership, paving way for removal vote this week</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the early days after the vote, some of the 10 flirted with the idea of banding together to make joint statements on consequential issues, believing they could have influence based on their moral authority.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Although they never did much as a group once it became clear that opposing Trump was increasingly treacherous, some of these lawmakers, or aides familiar with their views, said the takedown of Cheney has been demoralizing to watch.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most of the 10 House lawmakers stand at a crossroads in figuring out how to navigate the reality that their party has embraced Trump’s falsehoods and their own political futures and consciences.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Liz Cheney’s months-long effort to turn Republicans from Trump threatens her reelection and ambitions. She says it’s only beginning.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Rice’s vote to impeach was a surprise, and he has been mostly quiet about it. He was the only one of the 10 not to sign the letter to Pelosi about the Iowa race.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I support Liz Cheney. She is a very good leader, thoughtful and strong. She has a right to her opinion regarding President Trump. Her opinion has nothing to do with her qualification as our conference chair,” Rice added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Other members have avoided getting involved in the Cheney fight, while making clear they are on board with moving forward when she is gone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stefanik has been courting the support of the impeachment group and placed calls to some of them over the weekend, according to one of the lawmakers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kinzinger, meanwhile, continues to work the cable news and Sunday morning news circuits, but the scope of his influence remains unclear.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The committee has also requested documents and communications related to Eastman’s legal advice and analysis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello, did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Also present was One America News reporter Christina Bobb, a lawyer by training who was volunteering for the campaign at the time, according to people familiar with the operation. Bobb declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The three people familiar with the operation described intense work in the days and hours leading up to and even extending beyond 1 p.m. on Jan 6, when Congress convened for the counting of electoral votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the Sacramento Bee, Eastman wrote on Oct. 7 that he advised Pence to delay counting the electoral votes to give the states time to resolve concerns about voting irregularities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pence withstood the pressure. Around 1 p.m., as he prepared to gavel in the joint session, he announced via a letter posted to Twitter that he would count the electoral college votes as they had been cast several weeks earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the violence erupted a short time later, forcing Congress into recess, some of the most ardent Trump supporters saw an opportunity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ward did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waldron and Ramsland did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ligon and Haliburton did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kerik initially sought reimbursement from the Republican National Committee, but said he was told the party would not foot the bills. The bills were eventually submitted to the Trump campaign, which agreed to pay them.</p></div></div>
<p>Kerik told The Post he was “furious” with the RNC because it collected tens of millions of dollars in support of Trump’s legal battle, “yet didn’t spend a dime on [Giuliani’s] legal team or their expenses.”</p>
<div><div><p>The RNC has previously said it did not pay the legal bills because neither Giuliani nor Kerik was hired by or represented the organization.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eastman stayed at the Willard from Jan. 3 until after breakfast on Jan. 8, according to records showing that the hotel charged $1,407 for his lodging and meals during that time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clark has been subpoenaed by the House panel investigating Jan. 6 and is required to appear for questioning at the end of this week. He did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although Clark’s proposal was rebuffed, those working in the Willard command center continued to push the idea that Pence could intervene on Jan. 6 itself. Other legal scholars disagreed.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The announcement was swiftly condemned by watchdogs in Israel and internationally, who say the designations are unsubstantiated and are attempts to muzzle prominent critics of the Israeli government.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The terrorism designation effectively bans the groups by allowing authorities to freeze their funds, raid their offices and prohibit fundraising and public expressions of support for the organizations, according to international monitors.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Israel’s Defense Ministry accused the groups of being controlled by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist-Leninist movement with an armed wing that has carried out deadly attacks on civilians.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Israel and its allies, including the United States, consider the PFLP to be a terrorist organization.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Al-Haq, arguably the best-known Palestinian rights group, called the allegations “baseless” and a “systemic smear.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Citing omicron, advocates and Democrats press Biden to push faster on efforts to vaccinate the world</h1></div>
<h2>Emergence of new variant is ‘cruel reminder that the world does not have the time to wait,’ they say</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dan Diamond</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 15, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Biden administration is facing renewed questions about its global coronavirus strategy, with international infections climbing and the new omicron variant poised to tear across the world.</p></div></div>
<a>seven-month-old pledge</a> to ensure that countries waive intellectual property protections on coronavirus vaccines and share them with the developing world — a push they say has stalled in diplomatic meetings in Switzerland.
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others are demanding details behind a <a>plan to boost global vaccine manufacturing</a>, complaining that the White House has yet to clarify the proposal’s objectives and strategy since unveiling it last month.</p></div></div>
<a>racing to deliver </a>a far-diminished target of 800 million doses.
<div><p>But on Capitol Hill, Democrats insisted that the White House still needs to specify how it would address logistical challenges that have slowed vaccinations in developing countries and led some to <a>turn vaccine donations away</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, global leaders are projecting a new surge of omicron-linked cases. Less than 8 percent of the population in Africa has been fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The global community is playing variant roulette at this point, and the Biden administration is not being big enough, bold enough, fast enough,” said Zain Rizvi, research director at Public Citizen.</p></div></div>
<a>monitored</a> by the Duke Global Health Innovation Center. Altogether, the White House has committed more than $1.6 billion toward global vaccine efforts, including last week’s
<a>announcement </a>of a new $315 million initiative overseen by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
<div><div><p>Policy experts commended the Biden administration for its efforts but said the United States has a unique responsibility as poorer nations reel from the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<a> joint statement</a> last month.
<div><p>“Donations are neither reliable nor sustainable. Most pledges have yet to fully come through,” said Sangeeta Shashikant, legal adviser at the Third World Network, an advocacy organization that focuses on developing nations.</p></div>
<div><p>“Preserve public control over the facility, giving the government the freedom to make critical decisions about operations, manufacturing partners and technology,” Partners in Health, Public Citizen and Prep4All wrote.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The worrying signs suddenly seem everywhere: Professional <a>sports leagues</a> are canceling games. Colleges are sending <a>students home</a> from campus. Secretary of State Antony Blinken cut short his trip to Southeast Asia.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Understanding the many mutations of the omicron variant</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s breathtaking to watch the rate at which everything is increasing right now,” said S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Officials believe the number of cases will continue to skyrocket in coming weeks, and they are gravely concerned about how the more infectious variant will swamp health systems and devastate communities with low vaccination rates.</p></div>
<p>News of the new variant is proving disorienting for many Americans, as mask mandates are reinstituted in some Democratic-led states, parents deal again with school closures, and families question whether they can safely gather for the holidays.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials concede Americans may get infected with the virus even after getting boosted, but they remain confident the vaccines will protect against hospitalization and death.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Outside of Washington, state and local officials have also largely held off on reimposing mask mandates and social distancing requirements even as cases explode across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s public health school, said leaders are struggling to navigate political resistance and pandemic-related fatigue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Health officials worry that if even a small percentage of those infected with omicron become hospitalized, it could overwhelm a health system already dealing with the delta variant and the seasonal flu.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Experts have said they are optimistic that omicron will cause less severe cases than prior forms of the virus, particularly for people who were previously infected or vaccinated, but they caution that the data remains preliminary.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Even some of the nation’s top health experts say that after nearly two years of dodging the virus, they are resigned to being infected by omicron.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, predicted this week that U.S. coronavirus cases could soon reach 1 million per day, significantly outpacing the previous peak of about 250,000 cases per day in January.</p></div>
<div><div><p>As tens of millions of Americans prepare to gather for the holidays, health experts are urging them to use rapid coronavirus tests to detect infections and fend off outbreaks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Take those tests, and then you can be assured and have an enjoyable holiday,” former White House adviser Andy Slavitt said <a>on his podcast</a> this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But U.S. supply of rapid tests has lagged <a>behind other nations</a>, and the White House has been criticized for moving too slowly to make the tests more widely available.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several countries are reeling from the resurgent virus. In the United Kingdom, chief medical officer Chris Whitty urged residents on Wednesday to limit social interactions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Don’t mix with people you don’t have to,” Whitty said at a news conference, warning that coronavirus “records will be broken a lot” in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In France, President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out mandatory coronavirus vaccinations, and in Malaysia, Blinken cut short his trip on Wednesday after a member of the press corps accompanying him tested positive for the virus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the United States, Broadway shows have closed, some colleges are sending students home early for winter break, and other businesses grappled with uncertainty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is going to wipe through the United States,” said one senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak publicly.</p></div></div>
<p>Despite such events, officials have been buoyed by data that show booster shots provide robust protection. The problem remains the entrenched opposition of many Americans to the vaccines, which is increasingly exasperating administration officials.</p>

<div><h1>Former Biden advisers call for ‘new’ covid strategy</h1></div>
<h2>They suggest an approach based on a ‘new normal of life with covid,’ rather than continuing efforts to eradicate the virus</h2>

<p>Six former health advisers to President Biden’s transition team released a series of journal articles on Thursday calling for a “new normal” in the nation’s approach to fighting the coronavirus and other viral threats.</p>

<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>
<b> </b>comes amid experts’ growing realization that neither vaccinations nor infections appear to confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus. Some also express frustration the White House has squandered opportunities to contain the virus

<div><p>“Two years into the pandemic, the U.S. is still heavily reliant on data from Israel and the U.K. for assessing the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines and rate of vaccine breakthrough infections,” they write.</p></div>
<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>
<p>In interviews, the advisers said that Biden officials faced considerable challenges in trying to both execute a pandemic strategy and plan for the future, adding that their recommendations were meant to complement the administration’s efforts.</p>
