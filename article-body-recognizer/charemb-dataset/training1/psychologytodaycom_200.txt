<p>There are several reasons why we don’t know ourselves as well as we think we do. Here are just four:</p>
<p>The Actor-Observer Bias.</p>
<p>How to get better self-insight: Realize that both the situation and ourselves are responsible for our actions and outcomes—and that others’ perception is biased toward blaming us. </p>
<p>Self-Protective Biases <a>Rationalization</a>.</p>
<a>intelligence</a> and communication skills. When we fail, then, we protect our
<a>self-esteem</a> by rationalizing and making excuses. But in doing so, we also fail to gain the self-insight that would allow us to improve.
<a>leadership</a>. This involves getting evaluations from those around you—superiors, subordinates, peers. This helps in understanding how others see us. For example, if co-workers say you are “aloof” it may be your
<a>introversion</a>, and this feedback about how others interpret your actions can help you gain self-insight.

<a>self-deception</a> and a lack of self-insight.

<h2> Implicit bias has been much in the news. A new paper explores it in detail. </h2>

<a>attention</a> from both researchers and the popular press involves a construct called implicit
<a>bias</a>, which can be contrasted with explicit bias. In the context of bias toward social groups, explicit bias involves being aware that one has a negative attitude toward a particular group.
<p>The conceptualization of implicit bias assumes that people may also regard groups negatively without any awareness that they are doing so.</p>
<a>Implicit Association Test</a> (IAT), which has people make speeded responses to items reflecting pairs of groups in order to assess whether people have stronger associations between one of those groups and negative information.
<p>There are two potential reasons why the long-term effects of these programs are small (at best). One is that people’s scores on the IAT may also reflect other information they encounter after taking the test for the first time.</p>

<p>And yet when we get together with family members who belong to the opposing political party, we can enjoy a meal together, as long as we focus on how we are members of the same family group, if not not the same political group.</p>
<p>How Ingroup Identification Leads to Destructive Prejudice</p>
<p>This perception of being endangered as a group leads us maintain an alliance with members of our ingroup and reject members of the outgroup – they are perceived as the enemy.</p>
<p>How we can reduce prejudice?</p>
<p>As social animals we require a healthy balance between our sense of individuality and our sense of belonging; prejudice is the loss of that healthy balance. Some ways to promote this healthy balance are:</p>
<li>Educating ourselves about <a>identity</a> development and the dangers of us vs. them thinking, which is a sign that we have lost perspective.</li>
<li>Alerting young people about the dangers of perceiving individuals as simply members of a group rather than as distinct individuals, as well as teaching them to appreciate the benefits of a diverse society.</li>
<li>Understanding how personal relationships can contribute to our satisfaction in living and play a significant role in helping us strengthen our <a>self-esteem</a> and feelings of personal security.</li>
<li>Calming fears regarding anxiety producing conditions in society (e.g. economic loss or increased tensions between ethnic groups), political and community leaders can proactively reassure constituents that they are safe.</li>

<h2> Understanding Behavioral Economics </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between traditional economics and behavioral economics? </h3> </div>
<a>can make better decisions</a> given these constraints.
<div> <h3> Why is behavioral economics important? </h3> </div>
<a>self-control</a> and develop healthy habits (e.g., exercising more or drinking less). Often, thinking more about their future self and long-term goals can help people make better decisions and
<a> not give in to harmful impulses and addictions.</a>
<div> <h3> Do economic incentives to change behavior work? </h3> </div>
<a> turning a social exchange into an economic one</a>. Incentives must be both achievable and progressive to be effective at changing behavior.

<h2> Irrationality and Behavioral Economics </h2>
<a> may make irrational choices</a> by demonstrating how their decision-making is influenced by:
<li>Biases (such as future discounting)</li>
<li>Perceived social norms</li>
<div> <h3> What are some examples of bias in behavioral economics? </h3> </div>
<a> making fast, instinctive decisions</a> instead of taking time to deliberate. With Occam’s razor bias, a person assumes that the most obvious solution is the best. A silo effect takes a too-narrow approach to making decisions.
<div> <h3> What is the main drawback in using heuristics to solve problems? </h3> </div>
<a> lazy thinking</a> that are just as likely to be wrong as they are to be right.
<div> <h3> What are some examples of heuristics that lead to irrational choices? </h3> </div>
<a> availability heuristic</a>, people tend to base their judgment on how easy it is to recall relevant information. With the
<div> <h3> Does having too many options lead to poor decision-making? </h3> </div>
<a> As a result of this choice overload</a>, people can experience decision paralysis, mental fatigue, and disappointment or dissatisfaction with their choice.
<h2> How Can You Influence People's Behavior? </h2>
<a>behavioral changes</a>, such as eating less or saving more money.
<div> <h3> What is nudge theory? </h3> </div>
<a>free will</a>—nothing is banned or mandated—but it’s
<a> easier to do what’s best for themselves</a> in the long run.
<div> <h3> What is an example of a nudge? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some nudging techniques? </h3> </div>
<a>Whether nudging yourself or someone else,</a> it’s helpful to use reminders and prompts on a regular basis to keep target behaviors top of mind. Reframing negative thoughts as positive ones can boost
<a>motivation</a>, and reducing the accessibility of temptations can prevent backsliding. Additionally, social pressure can be an effective tool to increase accountability for reaching one’s goals.
<div> <h3> Is nudging ethical? </h3> </div>
<a>politics</a> of the person or individual doing the nudging.

<h2> The inaugural how to be miserable post. </h2>
<p>Enough, already. Welcome to How To Be Miserable: The Blog.</p>
<p>What’s This All About?</p>
<p>If a denizen of the Middle Ages found himself transplanted to 21st Century North America, he would think he had arrived in heaven.</p>
<p>If a culture is a machine for the production of human happiness, ours appears to be malfunctioning - and grossly inefficient. Maybe we should look and see what has gone wrong.</p>
<p>The field of positive psychology is big on the idea of signature strengths. If, in a world of relative plenty, we have managed to create so much misery, then perhaps unhappiness is our true signature strength. Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p>The Shape of Things to Come</p>
<p>I’d also like the blog to be at least somewhat interactive. At intervals I’ll print letters and Q and A pieces. To this end, please feel free to write me here at Psychology Today. Including:</p>
<li>Ways that you erode your own happiness, contentment, and enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Questions about positive psychology, mood difficulties, and life fulfillment. (Please understand, however, that I cannot offer clinical advice in this forum.)</li>
<li>Topics you’d like me to cover.</li>

<a>anxiety</a>, depression, life change,
<a>burnout</a>, health-related distress, and much more.

<p>None of my characters smile. I laugh as I write the cartoons, however, and at the funny way people think one thing, but do another. That's a great cartoon.</p>

<h1> A Little Paranoia Might be Just What You Need </h1>
<h2> A classic article explored the value of "prudent paranoia". </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Fear? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to combat fear and anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>My last cartoon was about <a>magical thinking</a>. Yes, I'm a believer.</p>
<p>When does <a>anxiety</a> or fear turn into <a>paranoia</a>? A lot of us don't trust something new and unfamiliar. But in the old days, avoiding red berries and new animals kept us alive!</p>
<p>How about an emergency, such as in the cartoon, when the desert crawler is dying of thirst, but still hesitates to accept help? Or when we need something, but still can't get close to someone, or trust their motivations?</p>
<p>Roderick M. Kramer wrote a fascinating article for <a>Harvard Business Review </a>in which he asserts that a little paranoia—and sometimes a lot—is good for us. He calls it "prudent paranoia."</p>
<p>The author suggests that even Steve Jobs used paranoia. Not in a defensive way, but offensive: He convinced young Apple people to be wary of IBM. (Does this remind you of recent <a>politics</a>?)</p>
<p>Be sure to read to the end of the article about a somber case that turned out to be real: sometimes the FBI really is watching you.</p>
<p>By the way, I am not like the guy in the cartoon. I was an early adopter of soy milk... once they invented chocolate.</p>
