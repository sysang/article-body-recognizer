<p>Smoking is bad for you—that’s common knowledge. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>As a result, researchers and healthcare providers are constantly looking for new and better ways to help people <a>quit smoking</a>. A new systematic review demonstrates a concept that is proven to work: Paying smokers to quit.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Given the high costs of smoking, it makes sense to help people quit by offering financial rewards—especially because they appear to be effective.</p>

<a>antidepressant</a> treatment, suggestion that one of the best things smokers who want to be happier can do is quit. Those who
<a>quit smoking</a> also reported greater life satisfaction, less anxiety, and an increase in positive feelings.
<li>A specific plan for quitting smoking. Most successful quitters scheduled a quit date and stuck with it.</li>
<li>Support from friends, family, or a spouse.</li>
<li>Replacing the habit of smoking with a healthier habit. Exercising, singing, or walking the dog can help. Some studies also suggest that sucking cold water through a straw or eating something sweet can help ease cravings.</li>
<li>Identifying and avoiding triggers to smoke, and planning a strategy when triggers are unavoidable.</li>
<li>Remembering reasons to quit smoking. Many successful ex-smokers write their reason for quitting on an index card, then refer to the card when the going gets tough.</li>
<p>If someone you care about is trying to quit, supporting them through the process really can make a difference. Here are some things you can do:</p>
<li>Avoid fostering hopelessness. Don't tell your loved one that she'll have cigarette cravings forever. Not only is this untrue, but it also provides little incentive to quit.</li>
<li>Read up on the process of quitting so you can remind your loved one that the pain is temporary.</li>
<a>stressful</a> everyday tasks such as cleaning the house or walking the dog. Ex-smokers who experience high levels of stress, particularly in the first days after quitting, are more likely to return to the habit.
<li>Even if you still smoke, don't talk about smoking and don't smoke around your loved one. Help your loved one remove ashtrays and other smoking accessories from his or her home.</li>
<li>Don't <a>guilt</a> or <a>shame</a> your loved one, or lecture them about health. Such stress can actually increase the desire to smoke.</li>
<li>Expect slip-ups. Most smokers <a>relapse</a> several times prior to successfully quitting.</li>
<li>Focus on the positive. If your loved one makes it an hour, a day, or a week, this deserves celebrating. And celebrating little victories can make the big ones seem more attainable.</li>
<p>Quitting smoking is never easy, but the health benefits — both mental and physical — keep piling up. A few days of misery is worth it for a lifetime of good health, and no matter how long you've smoked, it's never too late to quit!</p>

<h2> How smoking may harm aspects of memory. </h2>
<a>boring</a> tasks, you could take a low dose of nicotine by, say, smoking one cigarette and could increase your subjective feelings of arousal and
<a>attention</a>. In contrast, during
<a>stressful</a> situations, you could take a high dose of nicotine by chain-smoking and actually reduce your stress by activating the right hemisphere and producing a bit of sedation.
<a>Alcohol</a> Dependence investigated the effect of smoking on our ability to remember to carry out activities at some future point in time; this is called prospective
<a>memory</a>. For example, we use prospective memory to remember to meet friends for dinner, to stop by the grocer on the way home from work, or to take a
<a>medication</a> at the correct time each day. Prospective memory plays an important role in our daily routine.

<p>Cessation of nicotine use is followed by a withdrawal period that may last a month or more and includes symptoms that can quickly drive people back to using it. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may begin within a few hours after use, and include:</p>

<p>• Sleep disturbances </p>
<p>• Cognitive and attentional deficits </p>
<p>• Increased <a>appetite</a> </p>

<p>Research suggests that a person should quit smoking gradually to lessen the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Rates of <a>relapse</a> are highest in the first few weeks and months and diminish considerably after three months.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that pharmacological treatment combined with psychological treatment, such as psychological support and skills training to get through high-risk situations, results in some of the highest long-term abstinence rates.</p>
<p>Smoking cessation can have a major positive impact on a person's health; for example, a 35-year-old man who quits smoking will, on average, increase his life expectancy by about five years.</p>

<p>Other non-nicotine medications are being investigated for the treatment of tobacco addiction, including other <a>antidepressants</a> and antihypertensive medication.</p>
<div> <h3> Can the lungs heal after quitting smoking? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The lungs can heal and repair themselves to a degree, though they will not return to normal fully. There will likely be continued discoloration of the lungs. However, it is still better to quit.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <p>Nicotine withdrawal can result in some tightness of the chest. The muscles may also become sore from coughing. This tightness will likely pass after a few days.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Using pharmacological treatments can increase the odds of success. However, a combination of pharmacological and behavioral treatments—for example, combining the nicotine patch with group therapy—further improves chances.</p>

<h2> Why Do People Self-Sabotage? </h2>
<p>There are many reasons why a person might act in a way that proves damaging to his or her own well-being.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I know if I’m sabotaging myself? </h3> </div>
<a>examine whether your behaviors are aligned with your long-term goals.</a> If not, the behavior may be self-defeating. You can also take
<a>this quiz</a> to find out whether your behaviors are problematic.
<div> <h3> What are different forms of self-sabotage? </h3> </div>
<a>types of self-sabotage</a> involve
<a>procrastination</a>, perfectionism, relationships, work, finances, time, and change. For example, a
<a>perfectionist</a> who wants to complete a task flawlessly may dismiss incremental improvements, when making even a little progress would actually help accomplish their goal.
<div> <h3> Why do I always procrastinate? </h3> </div>
<a>tasks that in some way evoke anxiety or distress.</a> Putting the task off allows people to avoid those negative emotions—even if it also prevents them from accomplishing long-term
<a>happiness</a> or fulfillment. Distractions, like social media, or setting vague deadlines like “I’ll get to that next week,” also fuel procrastination.
<div> <h3> Why do I always put myself down? </h3> </div>
<a>extreme modesty can hinder success</a> by derailing one’s own
<a>confidence</a> and by hindering other people’s confidence in you, as research shows that self-effacing individuals are generally better liked but are also seen as less competent.
<div> <h3> Why do I always sabotage my relationship? </h3> </div>
<a>self-esteem</a>, and uncomfortable feelings that surface. The desire to avoid emotional pain and protect themselves could be the reason
<a>for sabotaging a relationship.</a> Exploring those emotions and fears in
<a>therapy</a> can help break the pattern.

<div> <h3> How do I stop sabotaging my success? </h3> </div>
<a>make a plan for actions to take instead.</a> For example, if negativity is a problem at work, plan to make one positive comment each day. Embrace improvements, rather than elimination, to make incremental progress toward your goal.
