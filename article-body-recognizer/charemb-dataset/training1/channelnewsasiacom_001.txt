<p>SINGAPORE: Cinemas in Singapore can reopen from Jul 13, with up to 50 patrons in each cinema hall among other safe distancing measures.</p>
<p>Cinemas have been closed since Mar 26, as part of nationwide measures to stem the spread of COVID-19. Businesses have now gradually resumed operations as part of <a>Phase 2</a> of Singapore's reopening, which started on Jun 19.</p>
<p>In an update on its website on Friday (Jul 3), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said up to five people who are friends or family may sit together in cinemas without the 1m safe distancing requirement. </p>
<p>"However, different groups of patrons must comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement," said IMDA.</p>
<p>"All patrons must wear a mask at all times, even inside the cinema hall, except when consuming food and drink."</p>
<p>The cinemas allowed to reopen are:</p>
<ul><li>Golden Village</li> <li>Cathay Cineplexes</li> <li>Shaw Theatres</li> <li>Filmgarde</li> <li>WE Cinemas</li> <li>The Projector</li> <li>Eaglewing Cinematics</li> <li>Carnival Cinemas</li> <li>Salt Media@Capital Tower</li> </ul>
<p>Other establishments with screening venues that are allowed to reopen must comply with the mandatory safe management measures, the authority added.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Gatherings outside school and work will be limited to a maximum of 10 people from Thursday at 11.59pm to Apr 30 this year, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force said on Tuesday (Mar 24).</p>
<p>The task force said that the duration of the stricter measures may be extended if the situation here does not improve.</p>
<p>Events which were limited to 250 participants previously, like festivals and concerts, will also have to adhere to the new measures.</p>
<p>All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended.</p>
<p>“This is to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students,” according to the statement.</p>
<p>All religious services and congregations will also be suspended, although places of worship may remain open for private worship and essential rites, subject to a group size of up to 10.</p>

<p>Organised tours within public venues such as sightseeing and guided walking tours will also be suspended.</p>
<p>“Activities like live music or karaoke that are likely to cause patrons to congregate will have to cease,” the task force said.</p>
<p>Suspension of <a>activities for seniors will also be extended till Apr 30</a>.</p>
<p>“During this time, we advise seniors and individuals with underlying chronic medical conditions to avoid social gatherings as far as possible,” the task force said.</p>
<p>During a press conference on Tuesday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force, said that a large proportion of local transmission takes place during social gatherings.</p>
<p>"So we think an effective way to reduce the likely vectors for local transmission ... is to reduce social gatherings particularly in large numbers," he said.</p>
<p>RETAIL MALLS, ATTRACTIONS MAY OPEN BUT HAVE TO ADHERE TO REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>While venues such as retail malls, attractions and museums may remain open, as contact is more transient in these places, operators are expected to adhere to strict requirements.</p>
<p>“Retail malls and attractions that are unable to adhere to these requirements must be closed,” the task force said.</p>

<p>The task force cautioned that malls and attractions may face additional penalties if they are found to have been a place of transmission of COVID-19 and had not adhered to the requirements.</p>
<p>Mr Wong said that gyms and yoga studios would not be closed, but if the venues are unable to uphold the principles of safe distancing, they will be shut. </p>
<p>The same goes for political parties that may want to organise any activities, Mr Wong said in response to a question. </p>
<p>Dining venues will also have to ensure they take safe distancing precautions. Those with fixed seating will have to use alternate seating. While related diners may sit together at one table, tables must be “spaced out”, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Mr Wong said: "We are mindful that the COVID-19 outbreak has already impacted many businesses, and the measures we need to take to protect ourselves to save lives will have economic impact." </p>
<p>However, he added that the Government is taking these into account for a <a>second package of stimulus measures </a>that will be announced by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday.</p>
<p>The task force advised Singaporeans to avoid holding and participating in social events and gatherings involving more than 10 people, including weddings and birthdays.</p>
<p>“For funerals and wakes, attendance should be limited as far as possible to family members only, and gatherings of 10 or fewer people at any one time,” it said.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said the strong measures implemented to protect lives will "inevitably have a major impact on the global economy and our economies".</p>
<p>"Many of our businesses have been affected, with some sectors particularly hard hit. More businesses will be affected by the measures we announced today," he wrote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr Heng is set to present a supplementary budget on Thursday, with more support measures for families and businesses.</p>
<p>"More support will be given to the most severely impacted sectors," he said.</p>
<p>"We live in extraordinary times. But this crisis has also brought out the best in our people and our companies."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> CNA Lifestyle </p> <h1> Fast Furious 9 puts charge back into US movie theatres with US$70m opening </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The ninth installment in the Fast Furious franchise, starring franchise regulars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, opened only in theatres and had the widest release of any movie since the start of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The North American total for Universal Pictures' F9 topped the previous pandemic-best of US$48.4 million for A Quiet Place Part II four weeks ago. It was the biggest opening of any film since Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker in December 2019.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place Part II came in a very distant second with US$6.2 million. But it has now earned US$136.4 million since its release. The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard brought in US$4.88 million in the third spot.</p>
<p>F9 debuted internationally on May 19, and has now grossed more than US$400 million globally.</p>

<p>Universal eschewed the hybrid approach of combining theatrical and streaming releases, as Disney did earlier in the year with “Cruella” and Warner Bros. did with “Godzilla vs. Kong."</p>
<p>It also came after most major theatre chains have significantly loosened restrictions on capacity and masking.</p>
<p>The trends suggest that Hollywood might have something resembling a regular summer movie season, albeit one that starts months late and won't be setting any industry records.</p>

<div> <p>A study involving octogenarians found out that activities like walking boost immune cells in the brain that may help to keep memory sharp and even ward off Alzheimer's disease. Very few of them formally exercised.</p> </div>

<h1> Did the pandemic get your blood pressure rising? Take deep breaths – you're not alone </h1>
<div> <p>Average blood pressure readings among Americans increased as the coronavirus spread, as new study suggests. The findings portend medical repercussions far beyond COVID-19.</p> </div>
<p>Last year was a tough one. Americans grappled with a global pandemic, the loss of loved ones, lockdowns that splintered social networks, stress, unemployment and depression.</p>
<p>It is probably no surprise that the nation’s blood pressure shot up.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists reported that blood pressure measurements of nearly a half-million adults showed a significant rise last year, compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>These measurements describe the pressure of blood against the walls of the arteries. Over time, increased pressure can damage the heart, the brain, blood vessels, kidneys and eyes. Sexual function can also be affected.</p>
<p>“These are very important data that are not surprising, but are shocking,” said Dr Donald M Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>“Even small changes in average blood pressure in the population,” he added, “can have a huge impact on the number of strokes, heart failure events and heart attacks that we’re likely to be seeing in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Almost half of all American adults have hypertension, or high blood pressure, a chronic condition referred to as a “silent killer” because it can have life-threatening consequences, though it produces few symptoms.</p>
<p>Hypertension may also put people at greater risk for severe disease if they are infected with the coronavirus. (The evidence for that link is mixed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Hypertension may also put people at greater risk for severe disease if they are infected with the coronavirus. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>The researchers found that blood pressure readings changed little from 2019 to the first three months of 2020, but increased significantly from April 2020 through December 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>The new study found that the average monthly change from April 2020 to December 2020, compared with the previous year, was 1.10 mm Hg to 2.50 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure, and 0.14 to 0.53 for diastolic blood pressure.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>The increases held true for both men and women, and in all age groups. Larger increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were seen in women.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Black people have also been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Laffin said information on race and ethnicity was available only for 6 per cent of the study participants, so an analysis would not be meaningful.</p>
<p>The researchers dismissed a possible effect of weight gain, known to raise blood pressure, saying that the men in the study had lost weight and that the women had not gained more weight than usual.</p>
<p>But other experts pointed out that average figures for weight gain might mask gains in segments of the population.</p>
<p>Americans must pay greater attention to overall health and the management of underlying medical conditions despite the pandemic, Laffin said, adding that the penalty for not doing so might outlast the coronavirus itself.</p>
<p>“There are also public health consequences from not seeing your doctor regularly, making poor dietary choices and not exercising,” he said. “If we think about the long-term implications, that’s potentially more profound.”</p>

<h1> COVID-19 shutdown: How Singapore’s cinemas, bars and theatre groups are coping </h1>
<div> <p>The local entertainment scene is looking to use the closure time to keep their chins up and take care of their staff – as well as find other alternatives, such as going online.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Genevieve Sarah Loh </a> </div> </div>
<p>And so it has begun. In compliance with the recent government directive, entertainment venues such as bars, discos, karaoke outlets, cinemas and theatres have <a>officially shut their doors until Apr 30</a>.</p>
<p>As inevitable as these recent developments may seem, it's been a major blow for many establishments struggling to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Cinema chains such as Shaw Organisation are trying their best to look out for their staff as they temporarily suspend operations and close their movie theatres.</p>
<p>Shaw's 100 full-timers and 200 part-timers are affected by the closure, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>When it comes to patrons, he reassured that those who have purchased tickets online and via credit cards for films affected will be refunded within four weeks.</p>
<p>The company will also be looking into housekeeping and maintenance.</p>
<p>“We will be conducting a round of deep cleaning for all our cinemas as well as a check for repairs,” said the spokesperson. “We will also take the opportunity to conduct minor renovation works to upkeep our facilities.”</p>
<p>The local theatre scene is also feeling the brunt of the new measures.</p>
<p>Adrian Pang, actor and artistic director of Pangdemonium told CNA Lifestyle that as “heart-breaking” as the decision to halt their upcoming production The Glass Menagerie was, nothing matters more than “ensuring everyone’s safety”.</p>
<p>But Pangdemonium is determined to “keep being creative and productive”. </p>
<p>“While we continue to work through this turbulent time, we are also looking ahead to the future when things improve, when we can elevate our creativity to another level. And I believe this is true for our entire arts community,” he added.</p>
<p>Other theatre companies like Wild Rice have also followed suit and postponed their upcoming productions of Grandmother Tongue, An Inspector Calls and Hotel.</p>
<p>And of course, you’ve got the bars. For some establishments, the new rules on closures can be a little grey as some operate under restaurant and not bar licences.</p>
<p>With the Muddy Murphy group temporarily closed, it’s an opportunity to rethink some basic habits – such as hygiene.</p>
<p>“Youth and millennials, especially those who play games, tend to make the best out of the worst situations,” added Min-Liang Tan, chief executive and co-founder of Razer.</p>
<p>A portion of any proceeds accumulated, according to the organisers, will be donated to the Singapore government to support the fight against COVID-19.</p>

<h1> Stress and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Are my stomach problems really just all in my head? </h1>
<div> <p>Scientists often debate whether Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a mental or physical issue. That’s not much help for those who suffer from it, says this The New York Times writer.</p> </div>
<p>“I’m so sorry, honey,” I said. “I feel really, really bad.” And I did. I was on the verge of tears, as much out of self-pity and shame as any maternal concern.</p>
<p>Eli shook his head. “It’s OK, Mum. It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>But it was. Because of me – or, to be precise, my digestive system – we would not eat until we reached Amarillo, Texas, at 10 pm, and bought frozen food from a grocery store near our Airbnb.</p>
<p>The same contractions that go unnoticed by most people cause pain in IBS patients, who have become hypersensitive to sensations in their gut, he said. Calm the mind, the thinking goes, and the gut may follow.</p>
<p>Fair or not, I hear this prescription and think, “Oh, so this is all in my head?” Then I fear my stomach aches are my fault, the product of an anxious mind that I cannot tame into submission.</p>
<p>That night on the highway, I kept wanting to apologise to my son again. But as Eli flicked on the headlights, I realised he accepted me the way I was. And I wondered, what if I could, too?</p>
<p>I later learned my experience is not unusual. Studies suggest that female sex hormones modulate the brain-gut connection, and as these hormones wane, women may experience more severe IBS symptoms.</p>
<p>Eventually, I dropped 10 pounds because eating had become so painful. That’s why, in 2015, I landed in the office of a gastroenterologist. He ran a bunch of tests – blood, scopes – and when everything came back negative, he diagnosed me with IBS.</p>
<p>It could have started with a past infection, he said. Recent stresses in my life probably didn’t help. He had no way of curing me, but he advised me to relax more and manage my diet.</p>
<p>If my IBS was triggered by stress, I thought, “I must be the most neurotic person I know.” Thoughts like these did not help me calm down. But that became my new goal: to relax so my belly would no longer hurt.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Stress modifies, and can exacerbate, the underlying disease physiology. But stress is not the cause of IBS. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>If I decided I was calmer and began to edge off my strict diet, I’d be miserable again. When I asked Dr Mayer why no amount of calming would allow me to eat gluten or garlic without pain, he warned me not to underestimate the power of fear.</p>
<p>“It’s a very common thing in IBS patients,” he said. He added that an IBS patient’s system “looks at food as a potentially dangerous thing.”</p>
<p>When I read this, scrolling through my phone at a motel in Illinois, I thought: I knew it. The stabbing stomach pains that woke me at 3 am after eating garlic or black beans weren’t caused by my subconscious; it was my damaged gut.</p>
<p>Later, I called Dr Marc E Rothenberg, one of the paper’s authors and the director of the division of allergy and immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, to get more clarity.</p>

<p>JOHOR BAHRU: Johor Chief Minister Hasni Mohammad said the state must focus on reducing the number of COVID-19 cases before discussions on reopening borders with Singapore. </p>
<p>Speaking to CNA in an exclusive interview on Monday (May 31), Mr Hasni said that both sides are in agreement that talks to reopen cross-border travel have been put on hold given the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia. </p>
<p>"It is because of the number of cases recorded, which has kept on rising as far as Johor is concerned," he said, adding that further discussions will only happen when the number of cases shows a downward trend.</p>
<p>Malaysia began its <a>third nationwide lockdown</a> on Tuesday amid a surging third wave of COVID-19 that has hit record levels in recent weeks.</p>
<a>only 17 essential service sectors</a> will be allowed to operate. These sectors include healthcare, telecommunications and media, food and beverage, utilities as well as banking.
<p>On Wednesday, Malaysia recorded 7,703 new COVID-19 cases, of which 554 cases were logged in Johor. There are now more than 580,000 cases nationwide.</p>

<p>Mr Hasni added that one way for the Johor state government to reduce the number of cases was to expedite the vaccination of local residents as soon as possible. </p>
<p>He said that Johor has always contributed substantially to the national economy and it would be important for Malaysia that "economic activity in Johor is able to resume to its original level". </p>
<p>He is targeting for 80 per cent of the Johor population to be vaccinated by October. </p>

<p>COST OF QUARANTINE AN ISSUE FOR THOSE UNDER PCA</p>
<p>During the interview, Mr Hasni also touched on issues affecting Malaysian workers who are currently working in Singapore under the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA). </p>
<p>Under this scheme, Malaysian workers in Singapore who hold long-term immigration passes are allowed to apply for short-term leave after working in Singapore for at least 90 consecutive days. </p>
<p>However, some have expressed concern about the cost of serving quarantine when entering Singapore. </p>
<p>Last month, Singapore announced that those with recent travel history to higher risk countries and regions, including Malaysia, will have to serve a <a>21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities</a> with effect from May 8. </p>
<p>For those serving their 21-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities in Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority website shows a cost of S$3,000 for accommodation and food for a single adult. This excludes the costs of PCR tests. </p>
<p>Additionally, these commuters are also required to serve 14 days of quarantine when entering Malaysia, where they would be charged a maximum of RM150 per day. </p>
<p>Mr Hasni said that he hoped the Singapore government could consider reducing the costs of quarantine for this group. </p>
<p>"If I may, can I express my request, and hope to the Singapore government ... It would help a lot if the cost of quarantine can be reconsidered to be much lower than what it is now," said Mr Hasni. </p>
<p>He said these Malaysians are based in Singapore because they are holding on to a job and have obligations with their respective companies in the city state.</p>
<p>"So I believe that it's not that they can't pay, but it will help if they can have extra to spend and ... protect their (finances)," he added. </p>
<p>JOHOR KEEN ON PROCURING VACCINES FROM SINGAPORE </p>
<p>Additionally, the chief minister said that the state government is keen to increase Johor's vaccine supply through various channels, including by procuring them from Singapore. </p>
<p>"Once they fulfill this obligation, then only they will be allowed to discuss with other individuals or private parties," he added. </p>
<p>Mr Hasni also noted how the state government <a>has collaborated with Temasek Foundation previously</a> to distribute face masks, hand sanitizers and ventilators to help in the state's fight against COVID-19. </p>
<p>Temasek Foundation is a Singapore-based non-profit organisation under the philanthropic arm of the state sovereign fund Temasek Holdings. </p>
<p>He expressed hope that further collaboration can be done to increase the supply of vaccines in Johor. </p>
<p>"So, maybe from the foundation's perspective, it is more of charitable work. But I suppose if it is on an understanding that can be developed to manage, control or reduce the number of positive COVID-19 patients, then why not?" said Mr Hasni.</p>
<p>"We will explore all possibilities as far as securing our own vaccines."</p>

<div> <p> Commentary </p> <h1> Commentary: Angsty and irritable? It could be your poor diet </h1> <div> <p>The increasing "emotional, non-rational, even explosive remarks" may be linked to modern unhealthy diets, say researchers.</p> </div> </div>

<p>What's going on? This escalation in angry rhetoric is sometimes attributed to social media. But are there other influences altering communication styles?</p>
<p>As researchers in the field of nutrition and mental health, and authors of The Better Brain, we recognise that many in our society experience brain hunger, impairing their cognitive function and emotion regulation.</p>
<h2>ULTRA-PROCESSED PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>Obviously, we are not deficient in macronutrients: North Americans tend to get sufficient protein, fats (though usually not the best fats) and carbohydrates (usually not the good complex carbs).</p>
<p>But we are being cheated of micronutrients (minerals and vitamins), particularly in those whose food choices are dominated by ultra-processed products.</p>
<p>Ultra-processed products include things like soft drinks, packaged snacks, sweetened breakfast cereal and chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>They generally contain only trivial amounts of a few micronutrients unless they are fortified, but even then, only a few at higher amounts.</p>
<p>Three published analyses from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed these sobering statistics:</p>
<h2>MICRONUTRIENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>The scientific evidence base for this statement is now vast, though it is so rarely mentioned in the media that few in the public are familiar with it.</p>
<p>A dozen studies from countries like Canada, Spain, Japan and Australia have shown that people who eat a healthy, whole foods diet have fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than people who eat a poor diet (mostly ultra-processed products).</p>
<p>Correlational studies cannot prove that nutritional choices are the cause of mental health problems.</p>
<p>For that we turn to some compelling prospective longitudinal studies in which people with no apparent mental health problems enter the study, are evaluated for their health and dietary patterns, and are then followed over time.</p>
<p>Some of the results have been astonishing.</p>
<p>It follows that nutrition education ought to be one of the first lines of treatment for children in this situation.</p>
<p>A Mediterranean-style diet is typically high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, seafood and unsaturated fats such as olive oil.</p>
<p>In one such study, about one-third of the people who changed to a whole foods diet in addition to their regular treatment found their depression to be in remission after 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The remission rate in the control group using regular treatment but no diet changes was fewer than one in 10. The whole foods diet group also reported a cost savings of about 20 per cent in their weekly food budget.</p>
<p>This final point helps to dispel the myth that eating a diet of ultra-processed products is a way to save money.</p>
<p>Important evidence that irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood can be resolved with improved micronutrient intake comes from studies evaluating micronutrient supplements to treat mental health problems.</p>
<p>Most public awareness is restricted to the ill-fated search for magic bullets: Studies of a single nutrient at a time. That is a common way to think about causality (for problem X, you need medication Y), but that is not how our brains work.</p>
<p>To support brain metabolism, our brains require at least 30 micronutrients to ensure the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, as well as breaking down and removing metabolic byproducts.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear: A well-nourished population is better able to withstand stress. Hidden brain hunger is one modifiable factor contributing to emotional outbursts, aggression and even the loss of civility in public discourse.</p>

<p>JOHOR BAHRU: The Johor state government is planning to launch another economic stimulus package to help residents cope with the financial impact of COVID-19, Chief Minister Hasni Mohammad said on Thursday (May 27). </p>
<p>Mr Hasni made the announcement in a media statement after a virtual meeting with elected representatives of the state. </p>
<p>"Therefore, the Johor state government is planning to provide an economic stimulus package 3.0. Apart from that, the state government has also allocated RM10 million (US$2.4 million) for the (distribution) of food baskets (to the needy)."</p>
<p>Johor's economy has been heavily impacted by the border closures enforced by COVID-19 as many businesses in the state are heavily dependent on visitors from Singapore. </p>
<p>Mr Hasni did not provide any more details to the stimulus package that will be launched. </p>
<p>However, it will be on top of a stimulus package announced by the Johor state government in 2020, in which a total allocation of RM150 million was used to help industries and sectors in the state impacted by COVID-19. </p>
<p>In his statement, Mr Hasni added that the state government is looking to expedite the process of vaccinating residents in the state. </p>
