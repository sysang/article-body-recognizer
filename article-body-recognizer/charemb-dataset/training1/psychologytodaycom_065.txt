<a>well-documented negative impacts</a> on children, there is nothing wrong with gently reminding your child to apologize.
<p>So what does this all mean? How can you apply this research? Here are some evidence-based tips for helping your child recognize and take responsibility for their mistakes: </p>
<li>Wait until everyone involved has calmed down (including yourself!). Then, give your child a chance to apologize or make amends spontaneously.</li>
<li>If they do not apologize or make amends spontaneously, first ask what they can do to help the other person feel better (since making amends may be more effective than apologizing). </li>
<li>Model apologizing by apologizing to your children and others around you whenever you make a mistake. Model making amends by finding ways to “make it up” to your child and others when you make a mistake. </li>

<h1> How Adversity Gives You Second Sight </h1>
<h2> When It Is Dark Enough, You Can See the Stars </h2>
<li>Darkness and hardship are teachers in disguise, sent by life to teach us the art of transforming pain into insight, darkness into illumination.</li>
<li>Accepting that adversity is fuel for growth, essential to personal realization, inoculates you against despair.</li>
<li>When you stop expecting humans not to be humans — and existence not to be a struggle — you liberate yourself from disappointment. </li>
<p>Darkness and hardship are teachers in disguise, sent by life to teach us the art of transforming pain into insight, darkness into illumination.</p>
<p>Initiation rites from around the world confirm this sacred relationship between darkness and wisdom, or what indigenous people call "second sight." </p>
<p>This is important to understand. The most enduring, transformative lessons in life arrive most of the time in unwanted packages, through loss, insecurity, suffering, terror, and disillusionment, as anyone over 40 knows. </p>
<p>We cannot mature as human beings without having first learned to negotiate darkness and the unknown. “He has seen but half the universe who never has been shown the House of Pain,” Emerson reminds us. </p>
<p>Nature teaches us that vitality — and new life — are only born through the death of the old. Destruction is a necessary, vital component of our personal ecology, as well as the foundation of our <a>resilience</a>. </p>
<p>Accepting that adversity is fuel for growth and essential to personal realization inoculates you against despair by reminding you that life was never meant to be easy.</p>
<a>jealous</a>, and surly,” advised the Roman Emperor.
<h3>An Antidote to Self-Pity</h3>
<p>Facing life on its own terms is also an antidote to self-pity. Self-pity is a trap laid by ignorance that presupposes we should be special, not vulnerable to pain like everyone else. </p>
<p><a>Gratitude</a> changes all this. Being willing to be thankful for life with all of its endless imperfections ennobles the mind and opens the heart to compassion, bringing insight and deeper connection.</p>
<p>This separation is the heart of our sorrow — that and the <a>fantasy</a> that this should not be happening, whatever this is, that things should be other than how they are.</p>
<p>The ego hears this as <a>rationalization</a>, whitewashing, slapping a happy face on sad realities. But these principles are incontestably true when viewed from a <a>spiritual</a> perspective.</p>
<p>Whatever it takes to wake us up is a form of grace. Whatever is required to shake us from our complacency, or vacillation, and stop taking life for granted is a form of grace.</p>
<p>The older we get, the more aware we become of bitter pills bringing the sweetest benefits sometimes, evolutions we would not have expected. </p>
<p>We learn to welcome grace in its "distressing disguise," as Mother Teresa described her working with human suffering while seeing the body of Jesus in everyone.</p>
<p>“Whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep,” Emerson wrote. “When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has the chance to learn something.”</p>
<p>We are not always aware of the <a>education</a> while it's happening. “In times when we thought ourselves indolent, we have afterwards discovered that much was accomplished and much was begun in us," Emerson continued. </p>
<p>Forces are working in us even at our worst, reorganizing our inner worlds and preparing us for what is coming. Times of uncertainty are frequently ripest for transformation, an assertion supported by data on <a>posttraumatic growth</a>.</p>
<h3>"Second Sight" in the Time of COVID-19</h3>
<p>Call it intentionality or self-fulfilling prophecy, it boils down to the same thing: We can use pain to wake up or as an excuse to go to sleep.</p>
<p>When we cling to our self-centered stories and resist moving through our pain, we interfere with the flow of nature that's always changing, discovering new outlets and resolutions, changing shape, surprising us.</p>
<p>It’s actually easier to surrender to things as they are than it is to fight reality.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean resigning ourselves to circumstances we might improve. Nor does it mean miraculously becoming grateful for heartbreak, <a>trauma</a>, and loss. </p>
<p>Rather, we regain the energy it takes to fight reality and turn it toward doing something worthwhile. </p>
<p>We use the flame concealed in the darkness to light our own way. </p>

<h1> How to Talk to Children about Porn </h1>
<h2> Strategies for a more effective conversation. </h2>
<li>Young people have always watched porn; the difference today is greater availability and access.</li>
<li>When speaking to a child or teenager about porn, it’s important for parents to be open, honest, accurate, and supportive. </li>
<li>Parents should also aim to be non-judgmental and avoid introducing or heightening shame around porn and sex. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kelly Sikkema/ Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It's important to put this in the context for young people of exploring <a>sexuality</a> and sexual behavior, as it is perfectly normal. Human beings are indeed sexual beings.</p>
<a>teen</a> about this, it is crucial to do so in an open, non-judgmental way, and in a way that does not heighten
<a>shame</a>. Initiating this conversation can be tricky and it's important for children to not feel "caught" doing something "bad," so they don't come to see pleasure as punishing.
<a>mindful</a> of not further contributing to this. One way to do this is to normalize the exploratory aspect and the qualities of discovery and pleasure. When sex
<a>education</a> exists in schools, it is typically merely focused on the prevention of
<a>pregnancy</a> and sexually transmitted diseases and talked about in terms of
<a>morality</a>, danger and pain. Reframing the narrative to include pleasure is helpful and serves to remove some of the shame.
<a>fantasy</a> and reality, to have unrealistic expectations of others and themselves, to intensify
<a>gender</a>, race, class, and
<a>sexual orientation</a> and this is harmful for young, vulnerable, developing minds. Helping younger people see and question these difficult dimensions is essential.

<h1> ADHD, Social Norms, and the Workplace </h1>
<h2> How ADHD interferes with social expectations at work. </h2>
<li>Growing up in our society, we learn various social norms across different contexts.</li>
<li>ADHD can make it challenging to properly learn those cues.</li>
<li>Not understanding or adhering to social norms due to neurodivergency can create negative social outcomes, including at work.</li>
<li>In the workplace, ADHD people can struggle to navigate social norms, which can impact their experience at work.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>ADHD can be a challenge in the workplace</div> <div>Source: Brooke Cagle via Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The workplace can be a rollercoaster for an <a>ADHD</a> brain.</p>
<p>In some ways, the average work environment can provide structure to neurodivergent individuals. While people with ADHD may rebel against routine, sometimes having a consistent schedule can help them stay on top of daily tasks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that same structure can be a nightmare for ADHD minds. People with ADHD tend to crave novelty, and doing the same thing each day makes it much harder to stay engaged in their work.</p>
<p>For neurodivergent people though—that is, people with ADHD, <a>autism</a>, or other neurodevelopmental differences—they don’t always have that same roadmap by the time they start their careers.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Social norms are something we learn throughout our lives, in many contexts</div> <div>Source: Zest Tea via Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Being raised as a person with ADHD in a neurotypical society means potentially missing the skills that dictate our social norms. These social impacts can stem from any number of places, depending on how it manifests for the person.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Social norms are a larger part of our workplace than we realize</div> <div>Source: Ant Rozetsky via Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>social anxiety</a>, likely to the point of social
<a>anxiety</a> disorder diagnosis.
<p>These factors are impairing enough in any context.</p>
<p>However, listening and comprehending others, speaking at appropriate times, managing frustration, taking criticism—one can imagine that in many workplace environments, those skills aren’t just the goal, they are the expectation.</p>
<h3>Workplace Social Norms vs. ADHD</h3>
<p>Just as social difficulty can stem from many different roots, it can come into play in many different areas of a job.</p>
<p>One such area is the interview process itself. Interviews are <a>stressful</a> enough, even with the right social tools, and are rich with unspoken protocols—how and what to talk about, which questions to ask, how to hold yourself.</p>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>7 Differences in the ADHD Brain vs. the Neurotypical Brain </a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Sneaky Sensory Triggers in ADHD That No One Talks About</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>Say, also, that someone with ADHD doesn’t get the job they want? That real rejection would create the perception of failure, or hopelessness. It may prevent someone from even pursuing a certain <a>career</a> at all.</p>
<p>You may not even absorb the discussion at all, because trying to focus so hard on finding a gap in the conversation means little to no mental energy can go to comprehension.</p>
<p>Not being able to properly process time—a symptom referred to as "time blindness"—might make someone frequently late to shifts or spend longer than others on tasks.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Creating connections at work can be a challenge with ADHD</div> <div>Source: Magnet Me via Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Employers, as well as fellow employees, can find this irritating, or perceive it as laziness or incompetence. This will no doubt affect the person’s interactions with others.</p>
<p>And it isn’t just the working relationship that’s impacted. Making connections with coworkers is an important part of making the workplace enjoyable, especially since a lot of us spend the vast majority of our days there.</p>

<h1> Sneaky Sensory Triggers in ADHD That No One Talks About </h1>
<h2> Sneaky sensory triggers could be ruining your day. Here's how to handle them. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is ADHD? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome ADHD</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Sensory processing issues are common in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism. </li>
<li>The overstimulation of one or all five senses can trigger sensory overload.</li>
<li>Learning what triggers sensory overload and making accommodations using sensory-friendly items can help alleviate a meltdown.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: file404/shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>sensory processing</a> issue; however, more often than not, sensory processing challenges affect the
<a>neurodiverse</a>. More specifically, they're commonly seen in neurodevelopmental disorders such as
<a>2015</a> review found that children with ADHD had substantially more sensory processing issues than neurotypical children. It is so prevalent that in
<a>2019</a>, researchers even called for sensory over-responsivity to be added to diagnostic criteria for ADHD.
<a>“fight or flight”</a> behaviors such as agitation, panic, and a general feeling of being "unsafe."
<a>One study</a> even found that more sensory issues in ADHD predict higher levels of
<a>aggression</a> and delinquency. These unfortunate—and, more importantly, preventable—consequences speak to the importance of early detection and intervention.
<h3>Symptoms of Sensory Overload </h3>
<p>Sensory overload can be triggered by overstimulation of one or all five senses, and the emotional and physical reactions can be mild, moderate, or severe. </p>
<p>In children, it often looks like a complete meltdown. It’s not unusual for children to: </p>
<li>Avoid specific people, places, and situations</li>
<li>Gag at different smells, tastes, and textures</li>
<li>Perseverate on a specific sensation—i.e., a tag, seam, or certain type of fabric </li>
<p>In teens and adults, symptoms include:</p>
<li>Inability to ignore loud sounds, strong smells, or other types of sensory input</li>
<li>Extreme sensitivity to clothing or different textures</li>
<li>Feeling overwhelmed or agitated</li>
<h3>Types of Sensory Triggers in ADHD and How to Handle Them </h3>
<p>1. Touch-Tactile Sensitivities</p>
<p>Triggers: Hugs, unwanted personal contact, hair brushing, brushing teeth, touching sticky things, clothing that’s too tight or itchy, holding a pencil, clothing tags, sock seams, certain fabrics. </p>
<p>2. Sound-Auditory Sensitivities </p>
<a>misophonia</a>, which is Greek for “hatred of sound.” These sounds elicit extreme emotional reactions such as anger, rage, and disgust.

<p>Parents may also need to be understanding of their child wearing earplugs at the dinner table if it means eating together as a family. If that’s not a viable option, allow for background music to muffle out the chewing sounds at dinner. </p>
<p>3. Sight-Visual Sensitivities </p>
<p>Triggers: Bright lights, flashing lights, video games, TV shows </p>
<p>Sunglasses, hats, dimming lights, and getting rid of fluorescent lightbulbs are all helpful solutions. Spending less time on screens can also reduce the likelihood of being triggered.</p>
<p>4. Smell-<a>Olfactory</a> Sensitivities </p>
<p>5. Taste and Texture-Gustatory Sensitivities</p>
<p>Triggers: Brushing teeth, hot food, cold food, specific textures—i.e., smooth, crunchy, or pureed food—particular flavors of food (i.e., food that is too sugary, too sweet, too salty)</p>
<p>Occupational <a>therapy</a> for children is beneficial and essential as nutritional deficiencies are associated with this sensory issue.</p>

<h1> Adult ADHD and Coping With Sleep Difficulties </h1>
<h2> “To sleep, perchance to get distracted.” </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Is Sleep Important? </li> <li> <a>Find a sleep counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Adults with ADHD often experience sleep issues that interfere with their ability to function during the day and regulate emotion. </li>
<li>Sleep issues for adults with ADHD may include difficulty waking in the morning or falling asleep at night.</li>
<li>Behavioral strategies such as cognitive reframing can help establish healthy sleep routines for those with adult ADHD.</li>
<p>“Night guy always screws morning guy.” —Jerry Seinfeld</p>
<p>The original sleep quote by Shakespeare, paraphrased in the title of this post, refers to Hamlet’s contemplation of death, so the Seinfeld line really gets at the heart of the matter for many adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>Sleep problems for adults with ADHD take many forms.</p>
<p>Problems winding down at night</p>
<p>Difficulty awakening in the morning</p>
<sup>1</sup> This syndrome is much more than an ingrained, “I-hate-mornings” slowness. Sleep inertia manifests as poor cognitive functioning upon awakening, which is a defining symptom of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder.
<p>Patterns of sleep <a>procrastination</a></p>
<a>stress</a> and frustration at the waking realization that yet another plan to get a good night’s sleep went awry, as they are left to face the day already feeling behind.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Adults with ADHD promise themselves to only do one more thing before going to sleep - but there is ALWAYS one more thing!</div> <div>Source: Anna Nekrashevich/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Behavioral Strategies That Can Help</h3>

<p>Treatments for adult ADHD often focus on skills for more consistent and efficient <a>management</a> of daytime roles, which allows for more “my time” during waking hours without sacrificing sleep. </p>
<p>Getting-ready-for-sleep script</p>
<sup>3</sup> A personalized bedtime routine or script is a sequence of sleep-
<a>meditation</a>, brushing teeth, and/or reading in bed, to name a few. Some people have much briefer sleep scripts, noting that once they get horizontal in bed, they quickly fall off to sleep.
<p><a>Mindfulness</a> and relaxation techniques</p>
<a>lying</a> awake in bed, not yet asleep, but still gaining valuable rest. Writing out thoughts, to-do items, and worries before getting into bed is another proactive way to process and externalize disquieting thoughts as part of closing out a day.
<p>Middle-of-the-night awakenings and corresponding difficulties falling back asleep are another source of sleep stress. A common reaction to such interruptions is the thought, “My sleep is ruined and tomorrow will be bad.”</p>
<a>self-regulation</a> are central for adults with ADHD and their potential solutions are worth the effort to implement.

<h1> 3 Phrases Helping Professionals Should Avoid </h1>
<h2> Check your comments: These responses could ruin a therapeutic relationship. </h2>
<li>The therapeutic relationship is considered a key to positive outcomes for patients, but three phrases used by some helpers can tarnish it.</li>
<li>Saying "I understand" is well-meaning, but can be taken as a patronizing gesture or sign that the provider has had a similar experience.</li>
<li>"There's not much we can do about that" may seem like a path to getting patients to accept a circumstance, but can create collateral damage.</li>
<p>“The road to hell is paved with good intentions” is an ancient phrase. One interpretation is that sometimes trying to do something good can have unintended bad consequences.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this referenced road can detour through psychotherapy offices.</p>
<h3>“I understand.”</h3>
<a>attention</a> and/or empathizing, right? But this is a specious perception. Have you ever noticed that sometimes that phrase has earned you a snappy reaction?
<a>empathic</a> listening skills. However, it should be cautioned the professional only says this if they really do. Otherwise, as noted by
<a>personality disorder</a> expert
<a>Dr. Joseph Shannon</a> (2019), patients, especially those with certain personalities, will likely sense disingenuousness, and it can tarnish the alliance.

<a>anxiety</a>. Tinnitus is itself anxiety-provoking (e.g., Kherle et al., 2015; Pattyn, 2016; Abbas et al., 2019), and this was then compounded by hopelessness.
<h3>“You just have to...”</h3>
<a>supervision</a> on the situation. Patients are struggling to just find a solution and know they can’t hit rewind. They’re in therapy precisely because they can’t do this and are hoping for alternative resolutions.

<h1> Improving Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments for Eating Disorders </h1>
<h2> A promising strategy for improving the treatment outcome of eating disorders. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>A subgroup of patients does not reach full remission from eating disorders with current evidence-based psychological treatments.</li>
<li>Researchers are hoping to design new forms of therapies by exploring genetic or neurological causes that might underlie the eating disorders.</li>
<li>An alternative strategy to improve the treatment outcome is the intensification of current evidence-based psychological treatments.</li>
<li>The adaptation of CBT-E for intensive settings of care has shown promising results in patients not responding to outpatient treatments.</li>
<p>There is a consensus that the mainstay of treating eating disorders is the outpatient setting. The <a>NICE guidelines</a> recommend cognitive behavior therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) as an evidence-based treatment for all eating disorders.</p>
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> therapies for eating disorders covered by the umbrella term 'CBT-ED.' CBT-E has been originally developed to address
<a>eating disorder</a> psychopathology (rather than the
<a>DSM</a> diagnosis) of adult outpatients, but later it was also adapted for adolescents.
<h3>The current status of CBT-E and other evidence-based treatments</h3>
<a>psychotherapy</a> or IPT, CBT-E was more potent. Additionally, 20 sessions of CBT-E have been found to be more effective than 100 sessions of
<a>psychoanalytic</a> psychotherapy delivered over two years.
<h3>The need to search for a better treatment</h3>
<h3>Is intensive CBT-E a potential solution?</h3>
<li>A subgroup of patients fails to respond to outpatient CBT-E.</li>
<li>The ineffectiveness of outpatient CBT-E in some patients may depend on insufficiently intensive care rather than the nature of the treatment itself. </li>
<li>The treatment is delivered by a multidisciplinary team comprising physicians, psychologists, dieticians, and nurses, all fully trained in CBT-E.</li>
<li>Assistance with eating is provided in the early weeks to help patients get over their difficulties in real-time.</li>
<li>Some procedures are delivered in group sessions.</li>

<p>Four studies (one controlled and three case series) evaluated the effectiveness of intensive CBT-E in patients who failed outpatient treatments. As matters stand, the research findings may be summarized as follows:</p>
<li>Inpatient CBT-E has a similar promising outcome in adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa. About 85% complete the treatment, and among these more than 60% have normal body weight and 50% a full response at a 60 weeks follow-up.</li>
<li> Inpatient CBT-E can be used in patients with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa. About 85% complete the treatment, and among these 33% has a full response at a 60 weeks follow-up.</li>
