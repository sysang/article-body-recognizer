<p>"Some of the Haitian men started running, trying to go around the horses," Ratje said.</p>
<p>Ratje said that he and his colleagues didn't witness Border Patrol agents using whips on any of the migrants.</p>
<p>"I've never seen them whip anyone," Ratje said. "He was swinging it...but it can be misconstrued when you're looking at the picture."</p>
<p>Ratje is a photographer based in Las Cruces. He's been in Del Rio since September 17 and has primarily taken photos on the Mexican side of the U.S. border.</p>
<a>Department of Homeland Security</a> Secretary
<a>Alejandro Mayorkas</a> and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz stated that they didn't see anything wrong in the footage and photos of the alleged incident on September 17.
<p>According to Brandon Judd, who serves as President of the National Border Patrol Council, the number of migrants at the bridge is 14,872 as of September 16.</p>
<p>Mayorkas issued a stark warning to any migrants looking to seek asylum from their home base in the U.S.</p>
<p>"If you come to the United States illegally, you will be returned. Your journey will not succeed, and you will be endangering your life and your family's life," said Mayorkas via the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ortiz said that the U.S. is on pace to have the migrants removed in an acceptable amount of time.</p>
<p>On Friday, President <a>Joe Biden</a> told reporters that "people will pay" as a result of Border Patrol using horses to block migrants from crossing the Rio Grande River.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has since banned the use of horses in Del Rio.</p>
<p>As of September 24, Judge Lewis Owens told the Associated Press that the last group of 225 Haitian migrants at the Del Rio, Texas camp will be removed by the end of the day.</p>

<div> Tech Science Iphone <a>Photography</a></div>
<ul><li>Macro photography mode</li><li>Optical zoom</li><li>ProMotion (120 Hz refresh rate)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Large camera system may interfere with accessories</li><li>Price difference over regular iPhone</li></ul>
<p>The crux of whether you should pick a pro model or a regular one revolves around photography. In short, the pro models have an extra telephoto camera and can also capture subjects really close with the macro capability on its wide-angle lens.</p>
<p>The listed 3x optical zoom is also useful. The optical reach was only available in the iPhone 12 Pro Max last year, so having the feature in the regular size 13 Pro is a huge benefit for people unwilling to carry the biggest phone.</p>
<p>At the full 120 Hz, content on the iPhone 13 screen is incredibly smooth and glides effortlessly. It makes reading and viewing content even more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Additional Pro Considerations</h2>
<p>There are a few items gated within the pro models that are only available at the higher price point. For example, you can only get 1TB storage on an iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 13 is limited to 512GB—still a lot of space.</p>
<h2>Should You Buy the iPhone 13 Pro?</h2>
<p>Additionally, everyone should enjoy the visual benefits of a ProMotion display, but as is, it's more of a nicety than a feature to upgrade for itself alone. It doesn't enable a more noticeable always-on lock screen feature, for example.</p>
<p>Buy at <a>Apple starting at $999</a>.</p>

<div> Culture Photography <a>Celebrity</a> <a>Pop culture</a></div>
<p>"I don't think of my subjects as celebrities, I think of them as artists, and my photography is very collaborative," said celebrity photographer Greg Williams, who is known for getting famously candid photographs of celebrities.</p>
<p>The photographer this year was in Italy to capture behind-the-scenes moments with the celebrities in town for the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>Dakota Johnson, Rami Malek, Jake Gyllenhaal, Kristen Stewart, Timothée Chalamet, <a>Anya Taylor-Joy</a>, Zendaya and more have all been subjects of Williams' unposed portraits.</p>
<p>Explaining how he manages to capture such moments and a rarely seen side of so many famous faces, Williams told Newsweek that it's all about encouraging spontaneity.</p>
<p>Williams said he started taking photos as a young child and now has his technique very well figured out.</p>
<p>Luck and being in the right place at the right time is crucial but Williams makes it all come together with his practiced skills. He is also present in his photos as his subjects interact with him.</p>
<p>Here are six of Williams' favorite shots:</p>
<p>Ultimately, to capture his celebrity subjects in candid moments, Williams is a big believer in not treating them like celebrities.</p>
<p>"And I don't think I've ever made anyone regret that trust they've put in me."</p>
<p>Newsweek interviewed Greg Williams as part of the launch of the new MARTINI campaign #MARTINIMOMENTS.</p>

<p>Wedding photographs provide documentation of a couple's special day, which the two can then look back on for years to come.</p>
<p>However, one pair of newlyweds decided to go against the grain and have a snap taken of them using a Game Boy Camera.</p>
<p>The photograph, which is very pixelated and in black and white, shows the couple standing side by side; the bride in a white dress, the man in a tuxedo.</p>
<p>Shared to Reddit by an account called KytorIndustries, the photo is so low-resolution that the duo's faces are barely distinguishable.</p>
<p>Explaining in the comments section, the image poster revealed that he and his wife also had a professional photographer on hand to capture the day.</p>
<p>A Game Boy Camera is a pocket camera which was released by Japanese company Nintendo back in 1998 as an accessory for Game Boy, a portable video game console.</p>
<p>The device, which ceased to be manufactured in 2002, featured a 180-degree swivel lens and shot grey-scale photographs which people could edit and print out.</p>
<p>KytorIndustries captioned the snap, which he posted in the forum r/pics, writing: "I got married last weekend, and asked our photographer to take photos of us with my Game Boy Camera."</p>
<p>The post has gone viral on Reddit, having received more that 111,000 upvotes.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people also took to the comments section to share their opinions on the novel wedding photograph.</p>
<p>One person, Talking_pillow, added: "That is going be so awesome when you print it out on the Game Boy printer and stick the photo to the fridge."</p>
<p>Animatedreality added: "For some reason, the Game Boy photo quality makes this feel way more poignant and sweet than I thought it would. Congratulations!"</p>
<p>Georgecm12 joked: "I wish the new Mr. and Mrs. Blur all the happiness in your new marriage!"</p>
<p>Kowallaonskis stated: "You probably had more guests at the wedding than pixels in this image."</p>
<p>Theythembian explained: "Lol at first I thought, they got shafted by their photographer.. glad that wasn't wasn't case. Congrats!!!"</p>
<p>Darthfloyd typed: "Congratulations I hope that you did take other photos with a bit more pixels, coz otherwise your SO is gonna be mad at you forever.."</p>
<p>Despite the low quality of the image, SaturdayHeartache managed to observe: "I think I wore the same gown! No joke lol."</p>
<p>To this, KytorIndustires went on to clarify: "Oh yeah of course, professional photographers that took many photos.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to grab a few with my Game Boy Camera because I'm a big retro tech handheld gaming guy."</p>

<p>A wedding photographer who went viral after detailing how she deleted a newlywed couple's photos from their big day has broken her silence on social media.</p>
<p>In a post published to <a>Reddit</a>'s "Am I The A**hole" forum last month, the photographer detailed how she took the decision to <a>delete the wedding snaps after being denied a 20-minute break "to get something to eat and drink."</a></p>
<p>The woman, who described herself as a "<a>dog</a> groomer" by trade, said she had agreed to shoot the event for a flat $250 fee as a favor to the bride and groom.</p>
<p>Despite the severity of her response, the woman found herself inundated with messages of support on Reddit with many hitting out at the behavior of the bride and groom.</p>
<p>Now she has returned to the forum to provide an update on how the situation has developed since her last post.</p>
<p>Posting under the handle IcyReserve6995, the photographer revealed that after their <a>honeymoon</a> the bride contacted her to hear her "side of the story."</p>
<p>According to the post, the groom "wasn't truthful" with his bride when it came to what happened on their big day, telling her the photos were lost due to "camera problems."</p>
<p>The photographer refused to let that slide though.</p>
<p>"I told her plainly what happened and told her that while I felt guilty, it's no way to treat someone doing them a favor," she wrote. "She wasn't in the know about any of this, and asked if there was any way we could mend this."</p>
<p>The bride also declined her offer to try and recover the deleted pictures from an SD card on her camera, with the pair agreeing to sweep what happened "under the rug" and move on.</p>
<p>The post, which has been upvoted 12,800 times, sparked yet more debate over the wedding day drama, with some questioning the fee agreed and others critical of the groom's attempts at covering up the incident.</p>
<p>Reasonable_Tax2446 commented: "You basically worked many hours at the wedding, did not get a break or any food, and didn't get paid when the groom caused problems. Now you're going to work again for them, for the $250 that was too little before?"</p>
<p>"Either this bride is more aware of what went down than she's letting on and is trying to save face now that there are consequences, or she's a complete doormat."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Backgrounding-Cat was surprised the bride "didn't want to try saving the photos" with tri220987 agreeing it was "very odd."</p>
<p>Rendahlyn suggested it could simply be down to the fact they were getting married on the tight budget and may have been "embarrassed" by the groom's behaviour.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted IcyReserve6995 for comment.</p>
<p>The pressures associated with a big wedding can sometimes prove too much for some couples.</p>
<p>One woman, for example, recently went viral after revealing how she and her husband-to-be scrapped their plans for a lavish wedding and <a>opted to instead have a quickie ceremony and spend the money on four honeymoons</a>.</p>
<p>Another couple, meanwhile, opted to shun marriage entirely by <a>sending out cards to their nearest and dearest announcing that they were "not engaged."</a></p>

<p>Today's Google Doodle celebrates Claude Cahun, the French <a>surrealist</a> photographer and writers whose works challenged norms around gender and sexuality in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>According to Google, the artist decided to <a>identify as non-binary</a>, despite gender non-conformity being considered taboo in France at the time.</p>
<p>Cahun's cross-dressing self-portraits have since become subjects of interest for gender studies and post-modernist theory, according to the archive.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City describes Cahun as "a creative chameleon" who was "keenly attuned to the quintessentially modern condition of self-alienation."</p>
<p>The couple moved to Paris in 1914, where they began their artistic collaborations.</p>
<p>Cahun's works examined gender fluidity through literature and self-portraits. Their 1927 photo series "I am in training, don't kiss me" portrayed the artist as a feminized weightlifter, challenging masculine and feminine stereotypes.</p>
<p>In 1937, Cahun and Moore settled in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands between Britain and France. They later became actively involved in the resistance movement against the island's Nazi occupation, the gallery says.</p>
<p>The couple produced anti-Nazi propaganda and were arrested in July 1944. They were sentenced to death and imprisoned for nearly a year before Jersey was liberated in May 1945.</p>
<p>Cahun was awarded the Medal of French Gratitude in 1951 for their resistance work during the Second World War. The artist died in 1954 while Moore died 18 years later in 1972.</p>
<p>Cahun's self-portraits were forgotten following the Second World War but their works were rediscovered and widely circulated in the 1990s, AWARE says.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Photographer's Image of Halloween Blood Moon is Equal Parts Spooky and Amazing</h1><div> By Arian Movileanu, Zenger News <time>On 10/31/21 at 11:00 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>The images of last week's blood moon were captured by an Iraqi astrophotographer with a fast-growing online following.</p>
<a>Hunter's Moon</a> is the full moon after the Harvest Moon and occurs in October or early November. Its name is literal: The full Hunter's Moon illuminates the hunter's prey.
<p>Mirza shared several shots with the message: "What is Hunter's Moon? Also called the blood moon or sanguine moon, it is the first full moon of fall in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>"As autumn settles in and crops are cleared from the field, hunters journey into the twilight to stock up on fattening deer — guided by the light of a full moon, known as the Hunter's Moon.</p>
<p>"I love the night sky, the stars and the planets, and exploring the unknown," Mirza said.</p>
<p>How does he achieve his perfectly timed snaps?</p>
<p>"Every month we have a different full moon, some years it is 12 and others 13. It depends mainly on the number of full moons in that year and the Hunter's Moon is no exception."</p>
<p>"There are several devices I use, like my cameras (<a>Canon EOS 6D</a> and Canon EOS 1200D) and lenses Canon EF 24-105mm, Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM, and Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM.</p>
<p>"I also use a Celestron Astro Master 114eq telescope and a Celestron NexStar 8SE telescope."</p>
<p>Mizra is currently at university, studying for a Master of Science degree.</p>
<p>For those in the Southern Hemisphere, the Harvest and Hunter's Moons are based on the March equinox, their equivalent autumn equinox.</p>

<p>It can be the video game equivalent of a Fast and the Furious movie, or it can resemble a carefree Sunday drive. The choice is yours, and either option is a totally valid way to play.</p>
<a>Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>).
<a>Forza Horizon 5</a> locations that are absolutely worth checking out.
<p>Copper Canyon is an expansive biome in its own right, taking up a substantial chunk of Forza Horizon 5's map.</p>
<p>There are technically dirty roads that run through Copper Canyon, but most people only see portions of it during their hikes, bike rides, or as they zoom past on the famous railroad track.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 gives you the option to explore it at a more leisurely pace, as you can pretty much go anywhere and take in the spectacular views.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to do some municipal sightseeing, then you simply must take a trip to Guanajuato. The city is one of the more densely packed areas in all of Forza Horizon 5, not to mention its most vibrant.</p>
<p>Every building is painted a different color, papel picado banners are hung above the cobblestone streets, there are eye-catching murals at every turn and, if you look carefully at the rooftops, you can spot even alebrije spirit guides.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the city also attracts visitors with its impressive cathedrals and heritage sites that you can drive past in the game.</p>
<p>Ek' Balam is considered to be one of the best-maintained archaeological sites in all of Mexico (even its ancient plasterwork is still intact) and it has a lot to teach us about Mayan culture.</p>
<p>If you take a shining to Ek' Balam, there is a neighbouring villa you can purchase so that the landmark is always right on your doorstep.</p>
<p>La Gran Caldera is a hollowed-out depression in the earth that was formed by one of the biggest volcanic eruptions in history.</p>
<p>It's particularly awe-inspiring if you can get there before it becomes congested with other drivers (looking to participate in arcade events) as that can spoil the otherworldly atmosphere a little.</p>
<p>You can visit the latter by taking a detour along the nearby dirt roads. While the site is not quite as grand or impressive as Ek' Balam, its unique location by the shore does make for a terrific photo opportunity.</p>
<h2>El Arco De Cabo San Lucas</h2>
<p>The waters surrounding El Arco De Cabo San Lucas are a <a>popular snorkelling and whale watching spot</a>, but the distinctive rock formation is also a tourist attraction in its own right.</p>
<p>In Forza Horizon 5 you can really admire El Arco De Cabo San Lucas from every possible angle (in a way that you cannot in real life) and can even use its pillars to hone your drifting skills.</p>
<p>A viral Instagram trend has promised to plant a tree for every <a>pet</a> photo shared to Instagram Stories with a sticker attached.</p>
<p>The new sticker feature allows users to jump on trends and link their Stories to a wider campaign.</p>
<p>One viral sticker trend said: "We'll plant 1 tree for every pet picture."</p>
<p>Over 4.2 million Stories were shared using the sticker, which would mean a huge forest is to be planted somewhere.</p>
<p>But is it too good to be true?</p>
<h2>Is a Tree Really Going To Be Planted for Every Pet Photo?</h2>
<p>Initially, it was not clear where the trend started or who exactly "we" was in this scenario.</p>
<p>The sticker did not link back to the trend's originator or an official campaign.</p>
<p>As there is no way of verifying the person or account behind the trend, it was not clear if any trees would be planted.</p>
<p>The account @plantatreeco has claimed ownership of the campaign.</p>
<p>In a post on its feed, it said that they had only posted the Story for 10 minutes before deleting it.</p>
<p>"We immediately understood the potential this post had and believed we didn't have the resources to keep our end of the post," it said.</p>
<p>"Instagram has also stripped us from the credit of making the post, hiding the originator of the post from the millions of people who have participated.</p>
<p>"Though we don't have the ability to plant 4 million trees, we can use this awareness to make a lasting impact which is why we started this fundraiser."</p>
<p>The post has a fundraiser attached and has so far raised over $3,500 for Trees For The Future.</p>
<p>Trees For The Future told Newsweek it has no affiliation with @plantatreeco.</p>
<p>Lindsay Cobb, marketing and communications manager, said: "When the fundraiser came to our attention, we immediately reached out to the group asking them to clarify the nature of the fundraiser and we reported the post to Instagram."</p>
<p>While many of your friends' Stories may still be viewable with the sticker attached, on some individuals' Stories they no longer link to all the other users who posted their pet photos using the sticker or allow you to "add yours."</p>
<p>As this is a new feature, it may be plausible that the sticker's viral popularity may have overwhelmed Instagram's servers preventing the stories from continuing to link to each other or preventing more users from adding to the sticker.</p>
<p>There may also be a limit to the number of users able to add to a sticker.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted representatives at Instagram for clarity on this.</p>
<p>Some have been skeptical of @plantatreeco's intentions behind the post.</p>
<p>In @plantatreeco's description, they claim to have raised over $500,000 "for different charities" and planted 6,500 trees, though there is no link to any website.</p>
<p>Twitter users have consistently shared their skepticism about @plantatreeco's motivations, with some posts dating back as far as 2019.</p>
<p>@plantatreeco has been accused of using a number of social and environmental causes to grow its follower base including the Australian bushfires and <a>Black Lives Matter</a> movement in the wake of <a>George Floyd</a>'s death.</p>
<p>A website that appears to be linked to the Instagram account sells jewelry and has only received negative reviews on TrustPilot.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted @plantatreeco for comment.</p>
<p>It is strongly advised that you users avoid sharing their personal details with @plantatreeco.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about reforestation though, there are a number of tree-planting initiatives you could perhaps donate to instead.</p>
<p>You can donate directly to Trees For The Future, which aims to end poverty by training farmers in sub-Saharan Africa to plant trees in order to regenerate their land.</p>
<p>Cobb added that the non-profit does have the capacity to plant as many trees as the original trend promised.</p>
<p>"We must clarify that Trees for the Future has the capacity to plant millions of trees. This year alone, farmers planted more than 35 million trees across our projects," she said.</p>
<p>"We've planted more than 225 million trees to date, positively impacting more than 300,000 people. Earlier this year, we announced our goal to plant one billion trees by 2030 and we're happy to report that we are on track to meet that goal."</p>
<p>The Trillion Trees campaign was launched by the WWF, WCS and Birdlife International with the intention of protecting and restoring one trillion trees by 2050 with projects worldwide.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign aims to plant one billion trees around the world by 2025 in an effort to tackle deforestation.</p>

<p>A partial lunar eclipse was visible Thursday night into the early hours of Friday across large swathes of the Earth, and photographers across the world captured the spectacular event.</p>
<p>The partial lunar eclipse was the longest of its kind since 1440, according to <a>NASA</a>, clocking in at three hours, 28 minutes and 23 seconds.</p>
<p>In the picture below, captured by photographer Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, the partial eclipse can be seen behind the Statue of Freedom on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. early on November 19, 2021.</p>
<p>This image, snapped by Philip Fong from the observation deck of Roppongi Hills in Tokyo, Japan, clearly shows the reddish hue that the moon took on during the eclipse.</p>
<p>Photographer Yuki Iwamura captured another spectacular shot of the moon on November 19 appearing behind One World Trade Center in New York City.</p>
<p>And in this image, taken from San Salvador—the capital of El Salvador—by photographer Emerson Flores, one portion of the moon appears to be visibly dimmer than the rest as our natural satellite moves through the Earth's shadow.</p>
<p>Lunar eclipses only occur during full moons, although they do not happen on every full moon night.</p>
<a>last night's eclipse</a>, which coincided with November's Beaver Moon, the alignment was almost perfect, but not quite.
<p>The partial lunar eclipse was not the only notable astronomical event this week. The <a>Leonid meteor shower peaked</a> on the night of November 17-18, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS.)</p>
<p>Since the January 6 attack on the Capitol, a total of 675 people have been arrested in connection to the disorder, with prosecutors warning that many more could still follow.</p>
<p>According to an update marking 10 months from the attack, the Department of Justice said more than 120 individuals have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from misdemeanors to felony obstruction.</p>
<p>While hundreds of <a>Donald Trump</a> supporters were part of the attack on the Capitol, only a handful became recognizable for their actions that day.</p>
<p>Below, Newsweek has compiled what happened to the Capitol riot defendants whose photos went viral.</p>
<p>Arguably the most prominent and well known of all those who stormed the Capitol on January 6 is <a>Jacob Anthony Chansley, aka Jake Angeli, better known as the QAnon Shaman.</a></p>
<p>Images of the shirtless Chansley wearing a horned Viking hat, carrying a spear with his face covered in paint went viral across the world in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>Inside the Capitol, he was seen flexing his bicep on the dais of the U.S. <a>Senate</a>, as well as yelling "freedom" on the chamber floor.</p>
<p>Chansley also left a note on the Senate Chamber dais for <a>Mike Pence</a>, where the then vice president had been sitting while certifying the 2020 Electoral College results, warning "it's only a matter of time, justice is coming."</p>
<p>Chansley was arrested January 9 and was held in custody until his sentencing on November 17.<a> He was given a 41-month jail term after pleading guilty </a>to obstruction of an official proceeding.</p>
<p>In a statement read out in court, the QAnon Shaman denied that he was violent or intended to stop the certification of the 2020 election results during the riot.</p>
<p>"I may be guilty of this crime, but I am in no way, shape or form a dangerous criminal," Chansley said. "I am not a violent man. I am not an insurrectionist. I am certainly not a domestic terrorist. I am a good man who broke the law," he said.</p>
<p>Upon sentencing, Judge Royce C. Lamberth told the 34-year-old that what he did was "terrible."</p>
<p>"You made yourself the epitome of the riot," Lamberth added. "What you did here was actually obstruct the functioning of the whole government. It's such a serious crime."</p>
<p>In addition to the prison term, ordered Chansley to pay $2,000 in restitution and must also serve three years of supervised release after his release from jail.</p>
<p>Another Capitol riot suspect whose image went viral across the world was Florida man Adam Johnson, who was pictured waving while carrying off House Speaker <a>Nancy Pelosi</a>'s lectern.</p>
<p>On November 22, <a>Johnson pleaded guilty to one count </a>of entering or remaining in a restricted building in connection to the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>Although Johnson was seen appearing to take Pelosi's lectern, it was later found undamaged in a hallway on the Senate side of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Following his arrest, Johnson's lawyers said that 36-year-old's crime should not be thrown in with those who were in the Capitol on January 6 in an alleged attempt to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>"He wasn't involved in any coup. He wasn't involved in any planning of any entering of the Capitol," <a>his attorney David Bigney told CNN in January.</a></p>
<p>"Things got out of hand. You saw the pictures. He was not there for any destruction, any treason. He was just there to witness history."</p>
<p>Johnson is due to be sentenced on February 25 and is not expected to receive a custodial sentence following his guilty plea.</p>
<p>He is also expected to be ordered to pay $500 restitution for his share of the damage at the Capitol.</p>
<h2>Confederate Flag Suspect</h2>
<p>Kevin Seefried is better known as the suspect who was seen with a Confederate flag in the corridors of the Capitol on January 6. He was arrested along with his son, Hunter Seefried.</p>
<p>Kevin Seefried explained to prosecutors that he brought the Confederate Battle Flag to Washington D.C. from his home in Delaware, where it was usually displayed outside</p>
<p>The defendant was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is due to stand trial on December 7.</p>
<p>One suspect<a> who is facing a number of serious charges</a> is Tennessee man Eric Gavelek Munchel, who was seen carrying plastic hand restraints while dressed head to toe in military-style attire.</p>
<p>Munchel was charged, along with his mother Lisa Eisenhart, with a number of offenses including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to commit obstruction and violent entry or disorderly conduct in relation to the Capitol attack.</p>
<p>He was released from custody after pleading not guilty to the charges on <a>March 29</a> and is currently awaiting trial.</p>
<p>In September, Munchel was accused of violating his bail conditions for drinking alcohol "excessively," reported 11 Alive.</p>
<h2>"Camp Auschwitz" Suspect</h2>
<p>Another man who gained notoriety in the wake of the Capitol riot was Virginia man Robert Packer, who was seen walking through the corridors of the Capitol building with a "Camp Auschwitz" top.</p>
<p>He was arrested on January 13 on suspicion of entering and remaining in a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>
<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charges on February 24. In August, <a>CNN</a> reported that the Justice Department offered Packer a plea deal as he is not accused of any violent offenses.</p>
<p>Packer appeared before another hearing in October where it appears no deal was reached.</p>
<p>The fate of an Idaho man who was seen dangling from the balcony of the senate floor and sitting in Pence's chair during the January 6 riot is still to be determined after he pleaded guilty to one charge.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of an official proceeding in July while agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>
<p>He also admitted to joining up with<a> fellow suspects Ronald Sandlin and Nathan DeGrave,</a> who arrived in D.C. for the election protests with a cache of weapons and ammunition, although none were charged with weapon offenses.</p>
<p>According to a statement of facts, Colt boasted on social media in the wake of the Capitol riot that he was the first person to sit in the House Speaker's Pelosi's chair, as well as calling her a traitor.</p>
<p>However, the seat Colt was actually photographed sitting in was the one used by vice president Pence.</p>
<p>No sentencing date has been set for Colt, but he faces between 51 months to 63 months in jail, and a fine of anywhere from $20,000 to $200,000, reported <a>CBS</a> News.</p>
<p>DeGrave and Sandlin have pleaded not guilty to all charges against them, including obstruction of an official proceeding, and assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers.</p>
<p>A married couple who have posed together for a picture in a photobooth every year since they first met 22 years ago have gone viral after sharing the heartwarming results online.</p>
<p>They can tell a story or simply convey a feeling in a way unlike any other medium.</p>
<p>Giles told Newsweek: "We'd known one another since we were a lot younger growing up in the same town, but it wasn't till she was 18 and I was 22 that we met again one night in a club and got talking."</p>
<p>He recalled the first photobooth picture being a spontaneous one.</p>
<p>"We were on one of our first dates and we were catching the train home and we spotted the photobooth and thought it would be fun to mark the occasion," Giles said.</p>
<p>"Even though it was a new relationship we both felt it was something special."</p>
<p>A year later, Giles and Michelle found themselves at the very same photo booth at the very same station in Brighton, East Sussex. "It just seemed meant to be," he said.</p>
<p>Much has changed for the couple in the years since. They now have two sons together, Elijah, 14, and Sonny, 12, while Giles is an award-winning author and podcaster.</p>
<p>One thing has remained constant though. Every year, without fail, the family gathers for the photobooth picture. Elijah's first appearance as a baby came in the ninth edition of the photo, with Sonny joining the clan a year later.</p>
<p>The tweet generated a huge response. At the time of writing, it had earned over 3,600 retweets and 75,000 likes, with Giles and Michelle's simple yet powerful tradition touching the hearts of so many on social media.</p>
<p>The romantic gesture comes hot on the heels of similarly heartwarming stories like the <a>one detailing how two people working side-by-side during the pandemic found love together</a>.</p>

<div> News Dogs <a>Photography</a> <a>Detroit</a></div>
<p>Part-time photographer Julia Earhart has warmed hearts with her selfless business decision.</p>
<p>After a friend asked the Detroit, Michigan resident to take pictures of her and her dog, who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer, she had an idea of how she could help other pet owners who have to say goodbye to a loved one.</p>
<p>After this, Earhart decided to offer these end-of-life photo sessions for free due to the difficulty pet owners go through losing a friend and high medical costs.</p>
<p>According to Detroit News, Earhart has been an animal lover all her life and currently has two dogs herself, a 2-year-old golden retriever and another one aged 1.</p>
<p>Speaking to Fox 2 News, she said: "It is kind of cool to put my passion for animals, dogs and photography all into one."</p>
<p>While discussing her friend's request, she also said: "She was like 'hey Julia, can you photograph pictures of me and Cudi while he is still in good spirits.'</p>
<p>"This is because she doesn't expect to have too much time with him so I said of course." When the friend received the photos, Earhart added that dog owner starting" sobbing right away.</p>
<p>"After that session, it made me realize just how important your bond with your animal, who is sometimes your best friend, can be.</p>
<p>"Photos aren't something a lot of pet owners might think about doing, but I know how much I love my dogs, and I know how much that would mean to me."</p>
<p>Earhart also highlighted why she feels giving the service away for free was the thing to do after having her own dog cancer scare.</p>
<p>She said: "I understand that treatments can be expensive, medicine can be expensive for helping dogs with the end of life if they are ill.</p>
<p>"So I was like why don't I offer this for free to help people be able to have these memories forever.</p>
<p>"I would rather them give the money towards their dogs, favorite toy, favorite treats, spend it and spoil them while you can.</p>
<p>"I know it is going to be emotionally challenging but knowing that at the end of the day it is going to make a pet owner happy, I'm more than excited, I kind of take it on."</p>
<p>Earhart spoke to Newsweek and explained what drove her to offer this service.</p>
<p>She said: "This service is an act of kindness. I was not expecting the attention nor response that I have been receiving.</p>
<p>"To me, doing something kind for someone doesn't have a price to it. Pet parents who have older or Ill animals have the financial burden of medical expenses and I want to give them a gift that will make them happy and help remember their pet."</p>
<p>Earhart also explained to what the reaction has been from pet owners for offering this service.</p>
<p>She also detailed what was the most rewarding thing and hardest thing about offering this service to pet owners.</p>
<p>She said: "Receiving their reaction to the photos. Knowing I have made someone else that happy is enough for me to continue doing this, and makes me want to do it even more."</p>
<p>She continued: "As an animal lover, and someone who has 2 dogs of her own, I think the hardest part is knowing years down the road I will be in their shoes with my own animals.</p>
<p>"I recently had a cancer scare with my 2 year old golden retriever right after I photographed my first End of Life Pet session, and I feel like it was a sign for me to pursue this as I would want the same photos with my animals come their time."</p>

<p>A real-life optical illusion has gone viral after being posted to Twitter by a woman seeking reassurance she isn't the only one with a dirty mind.</p>
<p>The image shows a shaft of sunlight beaming through a naturally-made stone tunnel onto a stream and some surrounding undergrowth.</p>
<p>It's undoubtedly a picture of stunning natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, it's also an image that, upon first glance for some at least, appears to be depicting a shaft of an altogether different kind.</p>
<p>The X-rated illusion was shared to Twitter by a user who calls herself Mairhead and posts under the handle Midge1415.</p>
<p>"Tell me it's not just me who sees it," she wrote alongside the tweet. "Please, I worry about me."</p>
<p>In fact, most saw little else.</p>
<p>Netty0779 wrote: "I'm trying to work out what it actually is cos it can't be what I'm seeing."</p>
<p>MarianTrevilli1 agreed: "I'm embarrassed to tell you how long it took me to see the shaft of sunlight."</p>
<p>Elsewhere Chuyungo admitted: "There are some things once seen that cannot be unseen!" while StephenJenkins1 said: "Occasionally a photograph is just taken at the perfect time."</p>
<p>British politician George Galloway even weighed into the comments, quipping: "This is unsolicited please don't send me more."</p>
<p>Many comments also came flooding in from fellow users eager to share similar examples of this particular phenomenon.</p>
<p>Marie Fairclough showed social media her three-year-old granddaughter's attempt at a picture of her mum holding a coffee.</p>
<p>Nicola Ellen recalled the time she received a chocolate santa.</p>
<p>While Haggy Hagarth offered up an unusual snap of her daughter's baby Bambi toy.</p>
<p>John Clark, meanwhile, highlighted a rather unfortunate design flaw in <a>London</a>'s Westminster Bridge.</p>
<p>Away from the striking imagery, arguably the most apt response came from a user posting as MrsM_Weegie, who wrote: "We're all juvenile and smutty but it is funny."</p>
<p>Speaking to Newsweek, Mairhead, who according to her Twitter bio is from <a>Ireland</a>, briefly explained the image's origins. "It was sent to me via WhatsApp and I found it funny," she said. "Funny what takes off online."</p>
<p>Optical illusions may be puzzling on the eye, but there is a logical explanation for why they can occur. It's all to do with a mix up in the way the human eye communicates what it sees to the brain.</p>
<p>This is not the first time an optical illusion has gone viral, of course.</p>
<p>Previously, less X-rated efforts have included <a>a cat who appeared to have an arm going through it</a> and <a>a young girl who was pictured seemingly sinking into the sidewalk</a>.</p>

<p>But I'm fairly positive that 98 percent of the people I met didn't know I had been drinking all day because I was hitting my targets at work and getting promoted. I was then earning more money which made buying alcohol really easy.</p>
<p>Every day, I'd get up and my whole being would be telling me to go to the shop and buy alcohol. It was utterly horrendous. I had to try and shut that voice up and stay busy.</p>
<p>When I got to the end of my first year of sobriety, I asked myself: "Is life better now?" I had a partner, my own business and I had bought my own house. One year is all it took for me to do all that.</p>

<p>Photographers, amateur and professional alike, from around the globe braved the cold weather of December to capture stunning images of 2021's final full moon.</p>
<p>December's Cold Moon rose on Friday night. It is both the longest full moon of the year and the last before the winter solstice on Tuesday, December 21.</p>
<a>NASA</a> said that skywatchers had three days to catch the moon in full glory.
<p>The space agency said the moon would appear full from Friday evening to Monday morning, declaring the period a "full moon weekend." And photographers definitely took advantage of this extended period to capture the full moon.</p>
<p>The image below shot on Sunday shows the Cold Moon partially shrouded by clouds, from Moscow.</p>
<p>In a scene that wouldn't look out of place in an epic Hollywood blockbuster, this New York photographer captured December's full moon as it rose behind the observation deck of Edge NYC, the highest observation deck in the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>The image was captured by Hudson Bay, New York, on Friday, December 17.</p>
<p>A clearer image of the Cold Moon looking suitably frost-white was captured from Siliguri, a city in the northeast Indian state of West Bengal that sits at the foot of the Himalaya mountain range.</p>
<p>Nasir told Newsweek: "<a>Capturing full moons</a> has always been relaxing and peaceful. This picture holds a special place in my collection because I always wanted to capture the full moon behind palm tree branches."</p>
<p>According to NASA, a full moon occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the sun as viewed from Earth. This means it is a period in which we come the closest to seeing the moon's sun-facing "dayside" fully illuminated by our star.</p>
<p>The next full moon will rise on Monday evening January 17, 2022, at around 6:48 p.m. ET. The January full moon, also known as the Wolf Moon, will appear in the sky for three nights from Sunday to Wednesday.</p>

<p>In Italy, <a>Twitter</a> user Mary Shovlain caught an incredible image of the final full moon of 2021 framed against the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.</p>

<div> World Taiwan <a>Joe Biden</a> <a>Congress</a></div>
<p>Taiwan says it is ready to step up its security partnership with the United States after President <a>Joe Biden</a> signed a $768 billion defense package that encourages deeper exchanges with the island's armed forces.</p>
<a>signed on Monday</a>, includes a multibillion-dollar initiative to better fund American forces in the Pacific, where
<a>China</a>'s growing military presence has become the U.S.'s principle challenge. The NDAA requires the
<a>Defense Department</a> to produce a number of reports and analyses about Chinese hard and soft power.
<a>Congress</a> to improve Taiwan's self-defense, a capability that has slowly deteriorated as China devoted ever larger sums to its military spending over the decades. The law, which has already drawn
<a>Beijing's ire</a>, wants the
<a>Pentagon</a> to assist Taipei in investing
<a>in the right areas</a>, while also assessing the possibility of integration and interoperability between American and Taiwanese forces.
<a>proposed partnership</a> between the
<p>China was twice a participant in 2014 and 2016, while Taiwan previously expressed a desire to take part.</p>
<p>Reached by Newsweek, a Taiwanese defense spokesperson referred to remarks by Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, who told reporters on Wednesday that he welcomes support in any form.</p>
<p>Taiwan would "do its best" and "is happy to cooperate," Chiu said ahead of a parliamentary review of next year's defense budget. "Cooperation doesn't mean accepting [every proposal] in full," he said. "We will carry out assessments."</p>
<p>Chiu—Taipei's former head of intelligence—said the island was facing increasing threat and pressure from the Chinese military. Taiwan was "duty-bound" to prepare, he said.</p>
<p>Johnny Chiang, a legislator with Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang, told reporters he hopes U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation helps reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait and decrease the chance of conflict.</p>

<header><div> World</div><h1>Russia Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Can't Be Stopped, Moscow Says</h1><div> By David Brennan <time>On 12/29/21 at 7:20 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Russian officials remain bullish on Moscow's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, even as tensions over Ukraine prompt renewed calls from opponents to scrap the natural gas project that is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2—controlled by Russia's state-owned Gazprom corporation—is the second natural gas pipeline running directly from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Nord Stream 1—majority owned by Gazprom—became operational in 2011, and has an annual capacity of 1.9 trillion cubic feet of gas. Nord Stream 2 will double this to around 3.9 trillion cubic feet.</p>
<p>The second pipeline is currently under review by German regulators. European regulators will then also have to give their approval. As Europe grapples with an energy crisis, Moscow is calling for the process to be accelerated.</p>
<p>German regulators, however, said earlier this month that their decision would likely not be made in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>Russian diplomats remain publicly confident that the $11 billion project will be approved. Nechaev told the German DPA news agency in an interview published Tuesday: "No one wants to artificially delay the commissioning of the pipeline."</p>
<p>Nechaev called on the new German government—a coalition formed of the Social <a>Democratic Party</a>, Greens, and Free Democratic Party—to act "pragmatically and in the interests of consumers."</p>
<p>"I hear from the new federal government that this is a private sector project that should not be linked to politics," Nechaev said, according to Russia's state-backed Tass news agency.</p>
<p>"We do not take anyone's word for it. But we take it into account. We very much hope that we will complete the project. Everyone will benefit from it."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Novak told RBC media that efforts to stop the pipeline would not succeed. "We believe that this project cannot be disrupted," the deputy prime minister said. "It was created in line with all requirements of the law."</p>
<p>Chizhov, meanwhile, told Tass it would be Europeans, not Russians, that would pay the price if the pipeline is blocked. "Only European consumers will suffer from delays in the certification of the Nord Stream 2," he said.</p>
<p>"Gas through this pipeline, supplied on the basis of long-term contracts, will be the cheapest. After all, in all other cases it is the consumer who pays for additional transport and other costs."</p>
<p>Chizhov blamed repeated delays on European "populist spirit."</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2 opponents say the pipeline is a political project that will allow Moscow to hold Europe hostage.</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2 will also allow Russia to stop using an existing natural gas pipeline that runs through Ukraine to Europe, which could deny Kyiv transit fees of around $3 billion each year.</p>
<p>Successive U.S. administrations have opposed the project but been unable to convince past German governments to abandon the pipeline.</p>
<p>In May, President <a>Joe Biden</a> waived U.S. sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG—the Gazprom-owned entity overseeing the pipeline—and its chief executive Matthias Warnig, prompting anger in Ukraine and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Germany signed an agreement earlier this year committing to action if Russia uses the pipeline as a political weapon. Skeptics took <a>little comfort</a> from the accord while Russia disputed its validity.</p>
<a>told Newsweek</a> they hoped the new German government would take a fresh, more critical look at the project.
<p>Kyiv, too, is still pushing for a U-turn. A source close to the government <a>told Newsweek</a> this month that the U.S. decision to waive sanctions "sends the wrong message."</p>
<p>Former <a>NATO</a> Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said stopping the pipeline could be "a powerful instrument to get Putin to understand that we need a political solution to the problems in Ukraine."</p>
<p>Following a surge in COVID-19 cases on cruise ships, Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal called for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>) and cruise lines to stop cruise travel.</p>
<p>Florida, where many of the affected cruise ships dock, hit a record-breaking 46,900 cases in one day on Tuesday, with weekly averages and hospitalizations also increasing.</p>
<p>The CDC reported that 88 cruise ships are currently under investigation or observation, with another four being monitored. It did not state how many cases have been reported on the ships.</p>
<p>Though no cruise lines have announced plans to halt travel, Senator Blumenthal took to <a>Twitter</a> to call for them to stop.</p>
<p>"Our warnings have proved sadly prescient and continuously compelling," Blumenthal wrote. "Time for CDC and cruise lines to protect consumers again pause—docking their ships."</p>
<p>A chart from the Mayo Clinic shows the dramatic spike in the rate of positive cases in Florida beginning in mid-December, going from an average of 2.6 percent at the end of November to 14.4 percent as of December 26.</p>
<p>The U.S. cruise industry has only been reopened for about six months, with ships beginning to depart from Florida again in June after COVID-19 shutdowns. No ships so far have had enough cases on board to necessitate a return to port.</p>
<p>Some cruise ships, though, have been denied entry at some foreign ports.</p>
<p>Several Florida-based ships have reported outbreaks. The Carnival Freedom was denied entry to Aruba and Bonaire after an undisclosed number of passengers and crew aboard caught the virus.</p>

<p>Amid a skyrocketing number of Omicron cases, more urgent health care centers in New York state are closing their doors.</p>
<p>CityMD has tempo<a>rarily closed</a> 26 locations throughout the Empire State. Four of those sites are in the Bronx, two in Westchester, five in Queens, six in Manhattan, four on Long Island and five in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>That's seven more sites closed in one week, as CityMD had announced on December 22 that 19 sites had been temporarily shuttered.</p>
<p>The urgent care center noted in its most recent update that most of its locations are operating at full capacity but that some closures were necessary to have adequate staffing at the sites.</p>
<p>Hochul advised residents to get tested before New Year's events and urged people to wear masks, get vaccinated and receive a booster shot if they are eligible.</p>
<p>"If we all do what's right, we can make 2022 a very different year from the hardships we've had to endure so far," Hochul said in a statement.</p>
<a>Bill de Blasio</a> has said new testing sites are being opened around the city, with the goal of having 160 sites available to residents.
<p>"We will increase testing capacity citywide to make it easier for young people to get checked and provide free vaccinations at sites around the city," Mayor-elect Eric Adams said at a Tuesday news conference.</p>
<p>The state is also sending out millions of testing kits to schools. New York City will receive 1 million kits, which contain two tests each, by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to de Blasio's office and CityMD for additional comment but didn't receive a response before publication.</p>
<header><div> News</div><h1>Tribal Leaders Concerned Over Feds' Proposed $300M Project That Would Cross Sacred Lands</h1><div> By Zoe Strozewski <time>On 12/29/21 at 11:16 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> News New Mexico <a>Native Americans</a></div>
<p>Indigenous leaders in New Mexico are concerned over a proposed transmission line, expected to cost up to $300 million, that they say would cross through an important sacred area in the state.</p>
<p>The council, which represents 20 pueblos across New Mexico and Texas, recently passed a resolution backing the protection of the Caja del Rio.</p>
<p>The federal government's planned transmission line project is aimed at funneling more electricity to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a U.S. Energy Department facility initially created during World War II for the design of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>An increased electricity supply would support current and future missions at the laboratory, including building key nuclear arsenal components.</p>
<p>The transmission line would also span the Rio Grande at White Rock Canyon, where new structural towers will need to be constructed on both sides of the ravine.</p>
<p>The tribes say longstanding mismanagement by the federal government has resulted in desecration to sacred sites on the Caja del Rio.</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration announced in April that it would be working with federal land managers to assess the project's potential environmental effects.</p>
<p>However, pueblo leaders claim there has not been adequate tribal consultation on the proposed project.</p>
<p>All Pueblo Council of Governors Chairman Wilfred Herrera submitted a letter to the Santa Fe National Forest on December 17, requesting that forest officials comply with consultation requirements.</p>
<p>Herrera, a former governor of Laguna Pueblo, said preservation of the Caja Del Rio's sacred landscape is a collective priority for the council as it works to protect ancestral homelands around the region.</p>
<p>He said Caja del Rio is home to pueblo ancestors and spirits.</p>
<p>The project calls for new overhead poles with an average span of 800 feet (244 meters), access roads for construction and maintenance and staging areas where materials can be stored.</p>
<p>Part of the line would be built along an existing utility corridor, but a new path would have to be cut through forest land to reach an electrical substation.</p>
<p>Environmentalists, residents and others already have voiced concerns about potential effects, saying the area encompasses wide Indigenous landscapes and is a scenic gateway to northern New Mexico.</p>
<p>The area has seen an increase in outdoor recreational use and it serves as a migration corridor for wildlife.</p>
<p>British Socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>'s sex trafficking co-conspirator, could face up to 65 years in prison after being convicted on five out of six charges on Wednesday.</p>
<a>perjury</a>, which could also add a five-year sentence apiece.
<a>federal prison sentencing guidelines</a> are allowed and she is ordered to serve sentences concurrently, Maxwell could face as little as 10 years.
<p>Epstein was found hanged inside his jail cell in 2019 while he was awaiting his own trial on related charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p>
<a>said</a> that enhanced security measures for Maxwell, which have
<a>included</a> guards shining a flashlight into her cell every 15 minutes, were required during her detention to protect her from other prisoners and prevent her from self-harm.
<a>shocking</a>" conditions of her detention. Maxwell herself
<a>recently recounted</a> cell visits by a "friendly rat" to Mail on Sunday and described being watched by "creepy guards" while attempting to shower.
<a>told</a> reporters after the verdict.
<p>"We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence," Sternheim said. "Obviously we are very disappointed with the verdict, we have already started working on the appeal and we are confident that she will be vindicated."</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan has yet to announce the date of Maxwell's pending sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Maxwell's attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Prisons for comment.</p>
<p>British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been found guilty of aiding <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the sex trafficking and abuse of young girls.</p>
<p>The only charge that she was acquitted of was enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. An explanation for this acquittal by the jury has not been provided.</p>
<p>Maxwell still awaits trial on two separate counts of perjury.</p>
<p>The defense had insisted Maxwell was a victim of a vindictive prosecution devised to deliver justice to women deprived of their main villain when Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019.</p>
<p>Pilots took the witness stand and dropped the names of luminaries—Britain's <a>Prince Andrew</a>, <a>Bill Clinton</a>, <a>Donald Trump</a>—who flew on Epstein's private jets.</p>
<p>Jurors saw physical evidence like a folding massage table once used by Epstein and a "black book" that listed contact information for some of the victims under the heading "massages."</p>
<p>There were bank records showing he had transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell, his longtime companion.</p>
<p>Carolyn testified that she was one of several underprivileged teens who lived near Epstein's Florida home in the early 2000s and took up an offer to give massages in exchange for $100 bills, which prosecutors described as "a pyramid of abuse."</p>
<p>Maxwell made all the arrangements, Carolyn told the jury, even though she knew the girl was only 14 at the time.</p>
<p>Jane said in 1994, when she was only 14, she was instructed to follow Epstein into a pool house at his Palm Beach estate, where he masturbated on her.</p>
<p>The lone count on which Maxwell was acquitted applied only to Jane.</p>
<p>"I was frozen in fear," she told the jury, adding that assault was the first time she had ever seen a penis. She also directly accused Maxwell of participating in her abuse.</p>
<p>Maxwell's lawyer asked Jane why it had taken so long to come forward.</p>
<p>"I was scared," she said, choking back tears. "I was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn't want anybody to know any of this about me."</p>
<p>The last to testify, Farmer described how Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage at Epstein's New Mexico ranch and how Epstein unexpectedly crawled into bed and pressed himself against her.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 60, vehemently denied the charges through her lawyers.</p>
<p>Still, she declined to take the risk of testifying, telling the judge: "The government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt so there is no reason for me to testify."</p>
<p>"The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did," one of Maxwell's lawyers, Bobbi Sternheim, emphasized to the jury. "But she is not Jeffrey Epstein and she is not like Jeffrey Epstein."</p>
<p>Maxwell's legal team questioned whether the accusers' memories were faulty, or had been influenced by lawyers seeking big payouts from Maxwell and from Epstein's estate in civil court.</p>
<a>University of California</a> Irvine professor who has testified as a memory expert for defense lawyers at about 300 trials, including the rape trial of movie mogul
<p>She said memory can be contaminated by suggestions made by an interviewer, particularly law enforcement or the media.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>After Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty Wednesday in New York federal court for her role in financier and sex offender <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>'s ring of abuse, <a>Prince Andrew</a> accuser Virginia Giuffre called for more accountability.</p>
<p>Maxwell had also received significant financial backings from the wealthy Epstein, as bank records showed that he had given his longtime associate at least $30 million between 1999 and 2007.</p>
<p>However, with the other five guilty counts, Maxwell is still facing a maximum of 65 years in prison for her crimes.</p>
