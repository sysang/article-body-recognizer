<div>The elementary school principal told police that the driver's windshield showed signs of "severe damage."</div>
<p>A video has emerged showing the man who allegedly trespassed on Windsor Castle grounds armed with a crossbow detailing his plans to "assassinate the Queen" on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The clip, obtained by The Sun, is believed to show 19-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail with his face covered, wearing a hood and pointing at a black crossbow.</p>
<p>A distorted voice says that he is "sorry for what I've done and what I will do" and that he will "attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, Queen of the royal family."</p>
<p>The man in the footage posted onto <a>Snapchat</a> on Christmas morning said the assassination plot was "revenge" for those who died in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.</p>
<p>The incident, also known as the Amritsar Massacre, occurred in April 1919. It saw British troops fire on a large crowd of unarmed Indians in the Punjab region.</p>
<p>The crowd at the Jallianwala Bagh public gardens contained people protesting against war taxes and the forced conscription of Indian soldiers, as well as those celebrating the Baisakhi festival.</p>
<p>At least 379 people were killed and more than 1,200 injured during the shooting. In 2019, then-British Prime Minister <a>Theresa May</a> described the massacre as a "shameful scar on British Indian history."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the video, the man with the crossbow said his plot against the Queen was "also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race.</p>
<p>"I'm an Indian Sikh, a Sith. My name was Jaswant Singh Chail, my name is Darth Jones," he added.</p>
<p>In the Star Wars franchise, Siths are the enemies of the Jedi Order who have embraced the dark side of the Force, such as main villain Darth Vader.</p>
<p>In the video, a framed picture of obscure Sith lord Darth Malgus can be seen in the background.</p>

<p>"The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment—the has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals," Met Police said in a <a>sta</a>t<a>ement.</a></p>

<p>The father of a would-be assassin who vowed to kill Queen Elizabeth II with a crossbow said "something's gone horribly wrong with our son."</p>
<p>Jaswant Singh Chail posted a video to friends on <a>Snapchat</a> on Christmas Day, 24 minutes before a <a>teenager was arrested storming Windsor Castle</a>, where the 95-year-old monarch was in residence.</p>
<p>Police have not named the intruder, who was detained under the Mental Health Act after he was found with a crossbow at 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Chail gave his full name as he wielded a crossbow while wearing a hoody and mask in the video, published by The Sun.</p>
<p>He has not been definitively confirmed as the person seized attempting to break into the castle, though neighbors described police activity around his home, in Southampton, on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Jasbir Singh Chail, the teenager's father, told MailOnline: "Something's gone horribly wrong with our son and we are trying to figure out what.</p>
<p>"We've not had a chance to speak to him but are trying to get him the help he needs. From our perspective, we are going through a difficult time. We are trying to resolve this issue and it's not easy."</p>
<p>In the video, the teenager said: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done and what I will do. I will attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, queen of the <a>royal family</a>.</p>
<p>"This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.</p>
<p>"It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race. I'm an Indian Sikh, a Sith.</p>
<p>"My name was Jaswant Singh Chail, my name is Darth Jones."</p>
<p>The message appeared to contain two references to Star Wars, including the "Sith," who in the franchise are ancient enemies of the Jedi.</p>
<p>The reference to Darth Jones is slightly more obscure, though Darth Vader's character was originally voiced by James Earl Jones.</p>
<p>The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar Massacre, was one of the bloodiest in British history, the <a>BBC</a> reported.</p>
<p>British soldiers fired on protesters for ten minutes until their ammunition ran out, killing between 379 and 1,000, according to different estimates.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan <a>Police</a> told Newsweek it is assessing the contents of the video.</p>
<p>A press statement read: "A 19-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon.</p>
<p>"Security processes were triggered within moments of the man entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings. Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered.</p>
<p>"The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment - he has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals."</p>
<p>The break-in happened on the day of the <a>Queen's most emotional Christmas message yet</a>, in which she described the loss of her husband Prince Philip after 73 years of marriage.</p>
<p>In the pre-recorded address, she said: "Although it's a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year, especially, I understand why.</p>
<p>"But for me, in the months since the death of my beloved Philip, I have drawn great comfort from the warmth and affection of the many tributes to his life and work—from around the country, the Commonwealth and the world.</p>
<p>"His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation—were all irrepressible. That mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him.</p>

<p>A group of puppies got new homes for Christmas after they were abandoned at a convenience store on the holiday, according to local police.</p>
<p>Somebody left the five puppies in a zipped duffel bag at a QuikTrip convenience store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, police said in a Facebook post Sunday. Officers responded to the scene after being made aware of the abandoned pups.</p>
<p>"Overwhelmed with Christmas feelings," the Facebook post reads. "4 of the officers immediately adopted 4 of the puppies and the 5th went home with the QT employee."</p>
<p>Tulsa police also took the opportunity to urge residents to "adopt don't shop" if they're looking for a new dog.</p>
<p>"There are lots of rescues and shelters that are over capacity for abandoned pets," police said.</p>
<p>Many took to the comments to thank the officers and employee for adopting the dogs.</p>
<p>"I'm glad they didn't get dumped out where they suffered. They look like heeler and border collie mix," Bonnie Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>"Now that's some last minute shopping. Thanks TPD and QT for giving these pups a home," Dena Price wrote.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Tulsa police for further comment Monday morning but did not hear back in time for publication.</p>
<p>Other dogs have been abandoned during this year's holiday season.</p>
<a>abandoning a dog and her 11 puppies</a> at an animal shelter just days before Christmas. In the video, the couple is seen getting out of a car with the black dog before eventually leaving the dogs outside the shelter.
<p>The dogs spent an hour outside before staff noticed her "peering through the windows" at them.</p>
<p>In November, a woman <a>abandoned her dog Bama at Tampa International Airport</a> after being told she did not have sufficient paperwork to take him with her. <a>Police</a> said she dropped Bama's leash and continued with her travel to Miami.</p>
<p>But the airport contacted a rescue organization to help find the dog a new home. Corinn Smith, who responded to the call, took in the shih tzu mix herself.</p>
<p>A man was recently arrested after allegedly fatally shooting his grandmother while his family was opening up presents on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The suspect was identified as 23-year-old Austin Alvarez, police said in a press release on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the Fresno County Sheriff's Office in California, the incident occurred at around 1:45 p.m. local time on Saturday, when officers were called to a home located at the 17000 block of Goodfellow Ave, following reports of shots fired.</p>
<p>When officers arrived to the residence, they discovered two women who sustained fatal gunshot wounds. The two women were identified as 58-year-old Magdalena Alvarez and 39-year-old Meisa Rashid.</p>
<p>"Deputies learned that the suspect, Austin Alvarez, had fled the home in his GMC pickup truck. A bulletin was issued to all law enforcement agencies to look out for the suspect's vehicle," the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said in a press release.</p>
<p>After arriving to the scene, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office began their investigation into the incident and learned that Austin Alvarez's family was opening Christmas gifts at the residence when he showed up.</p>
<p>"During the visit, Alvarez fired shots striking his grandmother (Magdalena Alvarez) and his father's girlfriend (Meisa Rashid)," the sheriff's office said.</p>
<p>After allegedly shooting the two victims, Alvarez fled from the home and attempted to shoot at his father as he noticed him in a parked vehicle outside the home. The gunshots did not hit Alvarez's father, the sheriff's office said.</p>
<p>With help from the California Highway Patrol and other nearby police departments, Alvarez was eventually arrested "approximately 10 miles away," from the residence where the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Following the arrest, Alvarez was booked into the Fresno County Jail on two charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder, the sheriff's office said. He is currently being held on a $2.5 million bail.</p>
<p>"A clear motive has not been established at this time. This remains an ongoing investigation," the press release said, adding that anyone with information on the incident is asked to call the Fresno County Sheriffs Office.</p>
<p>Lt. Brandon Pursell of the Fresno County Sheriff's Office told Fresno news station <a>KFSN-TV</a>, "We have multiple scenes—both where the homicide took place and where the suspect was arrested outside Orange Cove."</p>
<p>"Anything that happens with a family on Christmas is extra tragic. Especially when it's multiple homicides on Christmas, it's one of the worst-case scenarios," Pursell said.</p>
<p>Newsweek was directed to the press release after reaching out to the Fresno County Sheriff's Office for comment.</p>
<p>The new chief constable of the West Mercia police in England said she was "deeply sorry" for the 2016 use of a stun gun that led to the death of former professional soccer player Dalian Atkinson.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Atkinson, a former striker for Premier League team Aston Villa, was arrested in Telford, outside the central English city of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Constable Benjamin Monk responded by using his stun gun against the 48-year-old for 33 seconds, over six times longer than customary. He also kicked Atkinson in the head twice, hard enough for his boots to leave an impression on Atkinson's face.</p>
<p>Atkinson died in a hospital shortly after. In June, Monk was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in prison.</p>
<p>Pippa Mills, who started as the West Mercia police chief in September, wrote an apology letter to Atkinson's family.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kate Maynard, Atkinson's family's lawyer, called the apology "welcomed and overdue."</p>
<p>"The chief constable's acknowledgement that a police uniform does not grant immunity is especially pertinent in a year that has seen other terrible examples of deadly police violence," Maynard said.</p>
<p>The charity Inquest, which supports the bereaved in cases of deaths involving the state, has said that Monk's conviction is believed to be the first time a British police officer has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a Black man.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department released a 35:26 video on Monday documenting officers' actions when shooting and killing an assault suspect in an incident that also led to the accidental shooting death of a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Police were called to a Burlington store in North Hollywood on December 23 after reports that 24-year-old David Elena Lopez was attacking a woman with a bicycle lock. The unnamed woman was left with wounds on her head, face and arms.</p>
<p>The <a>video shows erratic behavior</a> by Elena Lopez captured on security cameras. He walked around the store trying different clothes on. He then waited at the top of an escalator next to his bike, often taking steps toward passersby.</p>
<p>The first two women he attacks get away from him. A third is repeatedly struck with a bicycle lock. Her face is covered in blood while she slips along the floor trying to create distance between herself and Elena Lopez.</p>
<p>The department's policy is to release footage from "critical incidents" within 45 days, In addition to the body camera and security camera footage, 911 calls and radio transmissions were released from the day of the shootings.</p>
<p>In a Thursday statement, Moore apologized for Orellana-Peralta's shooting.</p>
<p>The California <a>Department of Justice</a> is also investigating Thursday's shooting.</p>
<p>LAPD officers have shot people 38 people—18 of them fatally, including the shooting Sunday of a man with a knife—in 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>Those figures mark a dramatic rise in cases where officers shot or killed people in either of the last two years—27 people were shot and 7 of them killed by LA police in all of 2020. In 2019, officers shot 26 people, killing 12.</p>
<p>Mourners left flowers and a votive candle outside the store on Christmas in a memorial for Orellana-Peralta.</p>
<p>Update (12/27, 8:37 PM): This story was updated with a new headline and additional information following the release of video, calls and audio from the incident.</p>
<p>Thursday in North Hollywood, authorities said Elena Lopez was acting erratically, threatening to throw items from the upper floor, before attacking a woman with a bicycle lock shortly before noon as the store was crowded with holiday shoppers.</p>
<p>Officers answered a report of an assault and others of shots being fired. No gun—only the bike lock—was recovered at the scene.</p>
<p>Police shot and killed Melyda Corado, 27, the assistant store manager, as she ran toward the store's entrance after hearing the car crash.</p>
<p>The suspect, Gene Evin Atkins, took employees and shoppers hostage for three hours before surrendering, authorities said.</p>
<p>Atkins has pleaded not guilty to the killing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors found two police officers acted lawfully when they returned Atkins' gunfire.</p>

<p>A 19-year-old man in Australia has been arrested by police after allegedly ignoring a positive <a>COVID-19</a> test and hitting a local nightclub.</p>
<p>Ralph MacIntosh from Kensington Park, Adelaide, has been accused of failing to quarantine himself after being informed by South Australia Health that he had returned a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>MacIntosh allegedly then spent the evening at Adelaide's Loverboy city <a>nightclub</a> on Friday, December 17 where he remained until the early hours of the following morning.</p>
<p>V<a>accinated</a> patrons who were at Loverboy during MacIntosh's alleged visit have since been ordered to quarantine for seven days with unvaccinated visitors told to quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>9News reports that a total of 150 patrons and staff who were at the nightclub at the time were forced into isolation.</p>
<p>The nightclub also had to temporarily close its doors as a result.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, South Australia <a>Police</a> COVID-19 investigators from the Licensing Enforcement Branch arrested the 19-year-old and charged him with failing to comply with directions under Section 28 of the Emergency Management Act.</p>
<p>"It will be alleged the man remained at a city nightclub and did not quarantine after being informed by SA Health that he had returned a positive COVID-19 test," South Australia Police said.</p>
<p>"The failure without a reasonable excuse to comply with a direction given in accordance with the Emergency Management Act 2004 during a major emergency amounts to a criminal offence."</p>
<p>MacIntosh could face a fine of up to $20,000 (nearly $14,500) or a maximum two years in prison.</p>
<p>Following an initial review of his case, MacIntosh was released on bail. He is due to appear at Adelaide Magistrates Court on February 18, 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a>ABC</a> News, Premier Steven Marshall said he hoped the case would serve as "a lesson" to others about the importance of abiding by COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>"These are very serious allegations, and if they're correct, I think this serves as a lesson to every single South Australian that they've got to abide by these restrictions, otherwise there are very heavy penalties," he said.</p>
<p>According to 9News, MacIntosh posted a message to social media: "I've admitted to my mistakes and am truly apologetic."</p>
<p>The owners of the Loverboy nightclub have issued a statement hitting out at MacIntosh over his "selfish" actions and hinting at possible legal action.</p>
<p>"Christmas is supposed to be a time to celebrate with family and loved ones, however, because of the actions of one selfish person, that won't be the case for many," it said.</p>
<p>"We have to close our doors for the busiest week of the year and will be opening presents in isolation. We will be seeking justice."</p>

<p>A pair of neighbors in Florida are dead following what appeared to be a murder-suicide on Monday afternoon that allegedly grew out of a dispute over security lights.</p>
<p>"The shooter himself had made his way to his backyard where he apparently took his own life," Lake County Sheriff's Lieutenant Fred Jones said.</p>
<p>Hilderbrand was found in a backyard chair, dead from what deputies said appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Hilderbrand shared the home with his sister, who was present during the altercation but was not harmed, deputies said.</p>
<p>"All I know is I went out the side door I heard bang, bang, bang three times," another neighbor, Gary Moran, said.</p>
<p>"And so, this is something that's been going on since October and I guess today it just finally came to a clash," Jones said.</p>
<p>Relatives of both men spoke to WESH 2 News and claimed that the dispute between the two concerned more than the light. Details about what else the two were feuding over have yet to be revealed. No criminal complaints have been filed at this time.</p>
<p>According to Moran, Patch and Hilderbrand were recent arrivals to the neighborhood, each having moved in within the past year.</p>
<p>"I think in terms of just the holidays and this is what's going to be remembered on the holidays, so you know it's sad, and it could have been avoided," Jones added.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the Lake County Sheriff's Office for a comment on this story.</p>
<p>Another murder-suicide occurred in Florida in early November. Orlando police responded to the incident on November 4 while conducting a wellness check. In the home, they found the bodies of three family members.</p>

<p>A gunman reportedly killed four people in a series of shootings across Denver Monday evening.</p>
<p>The gunman was not identified during a joint press conference between the Denver and Lakewood police departments. The Denver Channel reported the suspected shooter also died Monday.</p>
<p>The first shooting took place just after 5 p.m. at First Ave and Broadway in central Denver. At this location, the suspect shot three people, killing two women and injuring a man, Denver <a>Police</a> Chief Paul Pazen said.</p>
<p>Shortly after, a second shooting occurred near Denver's Cheesman Park. One man was killed.</p>
<p>Denver police were then sent to W. 6th Avenue and Cherokee Street, but there were no injuries reported at the location following gunfire.</p>
<p>According to The Denver Channel, officers identified the shooting suspect's vehicle after the third shooting incident, at which point they chased the vehicle and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. No officers were reported injured.</p>
<p>After this, Pazen said the gunman "disabled the police vehicle" and fled to nearby Lakewood.</p>
<p>John Romero, public information officer with the Lakewood Police Department, said his department received calls about a shooting outside of a Lakewood business a little before 6 p.m. Another person was killed at this location.</p>
<p>After receiving a description of the suspect's vehicle, Lakewood police identified the vehicle at the Belmar shopping area. When the authorities tried to make contact, the suspect began to shoot, at which point gunfire was returned.</p>
<p>The suspect ran from the car and went into the Hyatt Place hotel, where The Denver Channel reported a clerk was shot. The clerk's condition is not currently known.</p>
<p>After the confrontation at the hotel, the suspect tried to flee again but ran into a Lakewood police officer. The suspect reportedly shot the officer. Romero said the officer was in surgery at the time of the press conference.</p>
<p>Following the officer's shooting, the suspect and additional Lakewood officers exchanged more gunfire.</p>
<p>The suspect was fatally shot, and it is uncertain whether it was the police who struck him, according to authorities, per The Denver Post.</p>
<p>Many businesses in the area went into lockdown well into the night as police cleared the area.</p>
<p>When speaking with FOX31, witnesses described the gunman as "a tall man, blond hair, with a trench coat."</p>
<p>The wounded officer was undergoing surgery Monday night and his condition was not immediately known, a spokesman for the Lakewood Police Department said.</p>
<p>"This one individual was responsible for this very violent crime spree that took place this evening, Pazen said.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning, Thomason had pulled into the gas station to fill up, cracking the window open to ensure Yogi stayed cool while he went inside and paid.</p>
<p>Thomson said he wasn't inside "more than a couple of minutes" yet by the time he returned to his car, Yogi was gone.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old told ABC13 that his worst fears were confirmed when he reviewed the CCTV footage from the gas station.</p>
<p>"I saw the dark Chevrolet truck drive beside me, and the guy got out and put Yogi into his car and drove off," he said.</p>
<p>Thomason described the shock realization Yogi had been taken from him as "gut-wrenching."</p>
<p>"It was like one of my children had just been kidnapped," he said.</p>
<p>Desperate to track down his canine companion, Thomason and his <a>family</a> embarked on a campaign to get the word out about Yogi's theft. That campaign included filing a report with the Harris County Sheriff's Office.</p>
<p>Then on Monday, Thomason got the call he had been hoping and praying for: Harris County deputies had found Yogi.</p>
<p>The Boston terrier's retrieval was credited to the Harris County Sheriff's Office's Proactive Auto Theft Unit, which conducted a vigorous investigation into the theft.</p>
<p>According to KHOU, Yogi was found thanks to the work of undercover deputies who were led to a nearby home before recovering the dog from another location.</p>
<p>There's been no comment from the sheriff's office on whether anyone has been arrested or is facing charges in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Thomason shed tears of joy upon reuniting with Yogi, telling KHOU his return is "the greatest gift" he could have received this Christmas.</p>

<p>Romero-Moran said that his wife had been walking a dog, and he followed her back to the home where she worked in Doral, according to investigators. He told Miami-Dade police officers that he killed her by strangling her, his arrest report said.</p>
<p>"I killed my wife, and I'm here to turn myself in," Romero-Moran said when he entered the police station, according to the report.</p>
<p>When someone arrived back at the Doral home at around 9 a.m. on Monday, they found his wife's body in the backyard and contacted the local police. There was a zip tie around her neck when she was discovered, according to investigators.</p>
<p>Romero-Moran told authorities that he and his wife had a "verbal dispute" the day before the murder, which is "when he knew he was going to kill the victim," the arrest report said.</p>
<p>"He walked into the residence where she works with the intent of killing her with a zip tie and strangled her with it," the report said.</p>
<p>Additional details on the couple's argument were not immediately available. The couple was originally from Venezuela, and online bios for Cambar showed that she had also worked as a real estate agent, the Miami Herald reported.</p>
<p>Police said that the residents of the home where the killing took place were not harmed.</p>

<p>A 911 dispatcher in Chicago blasted Mayor Lori Lightfoot over her handling of the skyrocketing crime in the city.</p>

<a>Merrick Garland</a> to send agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) amid the distribution and possession of illegal guns in the city.
<p>"I know people are scared," the Chicago mayor said during a press conference earlier this month.</p>
<p>Shortly after referencing Lightfoot's request, Fox Friends First co-host Todd Piro remarked that the mayor previously denied federal assistance from then-President <a>Donald Trump</a>, saying that it "would spell disaster."</p>
<p>Thornton, who said that his comments were his own and had nothing to do with his role as a 911 dispatcher in Chicago, previously shared a <a>Facebook</a> post where he referred to the city as a "death zone."</p>
<p>"If you are a Chicagoan," he said, "living here or doing business here, even just visiting as a tourist here, your safety is compromised and in jeopardy."</p>
<p>During his appearance on Fox Friends First, Thornton said the breaking point for him to speak out was "what's taking place every night, every day, every morning, every afternoon."</p>
<p>"It's the crime. It's out of control," he said. "This is by far the absolute worst that it's been where it is affecting every part of the community within Chicago."</p>
<p>Lightfoot has served as the mayor of Chicago since 2019.</p>

<p>A Massachusetts school police officer has been cleared of any wrongdoing after videos emerged of him handling a student arrest last month.</p>
<p>The officer, whose name has not been released to the public, was filmed kneeling on the neck of a Brockton High School student on November 17.</p>
<p>A Brockton Police spokesperson told The Enterprise that the officer works for the school district.</p>
<p>It is still unknown when and if the officer will return his role at the school, or if he will face any sort of discipline for the incident. The officer has been on administrative leave since videos taken of the arrest gained public attention.</p>
<p>In multiple videos of the arrest, the officer can be seen kneeling on the neck and upper back of a student who is being held down on the pavement outside Brockton High School.</p>
<p>"The video depicts the moment the student is being handcuffed and the way the student is being restrained during the arrest has been a cause for great concern," Thomas said, adding that the videos were "painful to watch."</p>

<p>The alleged shooter has been identified as the boy's father, who is employed as an officer with the Jacksonville <a>Police</a> Department, according to Lee.</p>
<p>Neither the boy nor the father has been identified in media reports.</p>
<p>Preliminary investigations have so far suggested that the firearm in use was a handgun, and that the shooting was accidental, according to WNCT. However, it is not yet clear how the incident occurred.</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Police Department said Tuesday that they will work with Onslow deputies during the probe.</p>
<p>Newsweek contacted the Jacksonville Police Department for additional comment and will update this story as more information becomes available.</p>
<p>Experts have said that accidental shootings often occur because officers don't receive sufficient firearms training.</p>
<p>"Ninety-nine out of 100 times, there is not something wrong with the gun," Paul Markel, a former police officer and firearms instructor in Mississippi, told the news outlet. "It's the person holding it."</p>

<p>A teenage couple was arrested on Wednesday and is accused of killing the woman's five-year-old son.</p>
<p>Officers with the Cincinnati Police Department responded to a call about an unresponsive infant last week. The infant, Casey Sams, had been in the care of his mother, Shakayla Sams, 19, and her partner, Donte Farrier, 19.</p>
<p>"Upon arrival, responding officers located the male infant unresponsive," the department's statement read. "Cincinnati Fire Department personnel responded and transported the infant to Cincinnati Children's Medical Center."</p>
<p>The two were arraigned in court on these charges on Tuesday morning. Both are being held on a $250,000 straight bond.</p>
<p>At this time, police have not confirmed what injuries Casey Sams suffered or how the couple might have inflicted them.</p>
<a>with local news outlet WLWT</a>, Sams and Farrier's neighbors said that they had mostly not heard or witnessed anything violent from the couple. However, one neighbor, Denise George, did recount witnessing a domestic violence episode between the two.
<p>Court documents obtained by WLWT indicate that Sams and Farrier share at least one child together who lived with them at the residence where Casey Sams was found unresponsive. Farrier's relationship with the infant is unclear at this time.</p>
<p>The documents also allege that both children suffered injuries at the hands of Sams and Farrier as far back as June 22. Investigators concluded that the home was a dangerous place for children.</p>
<p>According to a police affidavit, Alcazar later admitted to stabbing her daughter, saying that it would "fulfill the last of her sins, murder." She also stated that "she would not change any of the events surrounding the murder."</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, Crump called out the actions of the Los Angeles <a>Police</a> Department (LAPD) officers who were shooting at a suspect outside of a mall dressing room when one of the bullets struck and killed Orellana-Peralta.</p>
<p>"This is 14yo Valentina Orellana-Peralta. A few months ago, her family moved to Los Angeles from Chile in search of a better life," one of the tweets mentioned. "Tragically, Valentina was killed just a few days before Christmas."</p>
<p>Orellana-Peralta's case is the latest in a long line of wrongful-death lawsuits that have been taken on by Crump.</p>
