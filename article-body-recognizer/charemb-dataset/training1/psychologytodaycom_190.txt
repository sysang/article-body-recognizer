<p>Recent research reveals that women exhibit four distinct types of sexual fluidity, which differentially correlate with other aspects of women’s <a>sexuality</a>.</p>
<h3>What is sexual fluidity?</h3>
<a>bisexual</a> woman who usually dates men might find that as she grows older, she prefers to date women. Although the researchers acknowledge that sexual fluidity might include changes in
<a>attraction</a> due to partner age, relationship status, or other factors, in this research, the authors focused on sexual fluidity due to partner

<h3>Correlations with other aspects of women’s sexuality</h3>
<a>women’s sexuality is more flexible than men’s</a>, the authors contend that some types of sexual fluidity may be more common in men versus women.

<h1> How Feeling Like a "We" Boosts Sexual Satisfaction </h1>
<h2> ... and how motivated couples can find the feeling. </h2>
<li>Intimacy and closeness are hard to define, especially when researching sexuality and relationship.</li>
<li>How much we include the other person in our own sense of self is a good measure of closeness; it includes both behaving and feeling close.</li>
<li>Sexual satisfaction and sexual problem coping are partially accounted for by how much couples include each other in their own sense of self.</li>
<li>Research and experience suggest ways for motivated couples to build sexual and relationship satisfaction.</li>
<a>intimacy</a>, and how people deal with sexual difficulty together. A study published in The Journal of Sex Research (2021) by Pietras, Wiessner and Briken, reviewing current understanding and analyzing population-based health and
<a>sexuality</a> data from over 3,000 men and women aged 18-75, highlights the components of satisfaction, even in the presence of difficulties.

<p>Flirting is a fundamental fixture in humans’ sexual repertoire, a time-honored way of signaling interest and attraction, to say nothing of mutual awareness. It is a kind of silent language spoken by men and women around the world.</p>

<h2> The Roots of Flirting </h2>
<div> <h3> Why do people flirt? </h3> </div>
<p>People most often flirt to convey interest in someone and potentially build a relationship. But research has actually identified six specific reasons why people flirt:</p>
<p>1. Relational reasons — to turn an acquaintance or friend into a partner.</p>
<p>2. Exploring motive — to gauge if someone else is interested in you.</p>
<p>3. Fun — to have a playful, exciting interaction. </p>
<p>4. Instrumental reasons — to encourage someone to complete a task, such as a household chore. </p>
<p>5. Esteem motive — to reinforce one’s own self-esteem.</p>
<p>6. Sex — to gain a sexual partner.</p>

<a>pregnancy</a> with every possible candidate they encountered.
<a>Flirting achieved that end,</a> offering a relatively risk-free set of signals with which to sample the field, try out sexual wares and exchange vital information about candidates' general health and reproductive fitness.

<div> <h3> Which nonverbal cues do people use to flirt? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the features of a flirty facial expression? </h3> </div>
<a>flirtatious facial expression,</a> according to research that assessed heterosexual women flirting with men. They are: 1) Head turned to one side 2) Chin tilted down slightly 3) Slight smile 4) Eyes turned to the other person.
<div> <h3> How do women flirt? </h3> </div>
<a>flirting techniques for women:</a> giving the person a short sideways glance, swaying with the music, smiling, laughing, nodding, and leaning forward toward the other person in conversation.
<div> <h3> How do men flirt? </h3> </div>

<a>Flirting serves a key role in marriage,</a> couples say, such as showing love, enhancing self-esteem, maintaining
<a>intimacy</a>, and reducing tension. So it’s still worth taking a moment to smile, joke, or give a loving glance to a partner in a committed relationship.

<a>Learning emotional regulation skills</a>—such as naming any negative feelings, redirecting
<a>attention</a> to productive activities, or practicing
<a>mindfulness</a>—or creating physical “barriers” (such as freezing credit cards so they can’t be used impulsively) can help.

<div> <h3> What causes panic buying? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> make the world appear frightening and senseless; stocking up on certain items like toilet paper is one way to restore a feeling of control.
<a>Panic buying</a> is also driven in part by herd mentality; if people see that others are hoarding hand sanitizer, they assume they should too.
<div> <h3> What motivates impulse purchases? </h3> </div>
<a>Impulse buying may be motivated</a> by negative emotions, as purchasing something often temporarily boosts mood. It may also be driven by personality—the naturally more impulsive or less
<a>conscientious</a> may be driven to more frequently purchase items on a whim. Marketing strategies, like advertising products as “limited time offers,” can increase the tendency to impulse buy.
<h2> How Advertising and Marketing Work </h2>
<p>Two vast, interrelated industries—advertising and marketing—are dedicated to introducing people to products and convincing them to make purchases.</p>
<div> <h3> How does marketing influence what we buy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Do marketers take advantage of how the human brain works? </h3> </div>
<a>Marketers often exploit cognitive shortcuts</a>, known as heuristics, to convince consumers to make purchases. One example of this is the
<div> <h3> Why do some ads succeed while others fail? </h3> </div>
<a>timing and context</a> are often critical to an ad’s success.
<div> <h3> Why are “limited time offers” so appealing? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are so many ads sexual? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual</a> stimuli naturally capture attention; thus, marketers often make use of attractive models or erotic imagery simply to make consumers take notice. Being “primed” with erotic content can change behavior, too; research has found that
<a>sexual priming can lead consumers</a> to make riskier financial choices.
<div> <h3> Do sexual ads really work? </h3> </div>
<a>sex in advertising</a> likely depends on several factors, including
<a>gender</a> and context. Women appear to respond more negatively to sexual ads than men, research finds. When the product is unrelated to sex, using erotic imagery in ads can trigger dissonance and trigger negative feelings about the brand.
<h2> How to Appeal to Consumers </h2>
<div> <h3> How can I persuade people to buy my product? </h3> </div>
<a>“pre-suasion”</a> to argue that marketers must grab consumers’ attention before making an appeal—by offering free samples, for instance, or couching a product pitch in an amusing commercial.

<h2> How Important Is Your Social Life? </h2>
<p>Human beings are social animals, and the tenor of someone's social life is one of the most important influences on their mental and physical health. Without positive, durable relationships, both minds and bodies can fall apart.</p>
<p>Technology has changed the ways people interact with others in their daily lives, but it hasn’t affected the basic need to form supportive bonds with other people.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the importance of social interaction? </h3> </div>
<a>as shown by this research on friendly foxes</a>.
<div> <h3> What are different types of social interaction? </h3> </div>
<a>social interaction matters: Spending more time around other people can increase an individual’s happiness and satisfaction with life. </a>
<div> <h3> Is it OK to be a loner? </h3> </div>
<a>People tend to withdraw from social life</a> for a variety of reasons: They may be
<a>shy</a>, prone to avoidance, naturally unsocial, rejected by their peers, or they may simply enjoy spending time alone. While many people become loners out of
<a>anxiety</a>, not all motivations are harmful. Some people, such as hermits, can get great pleasure out of leading a solitary life.
<div> <h3> Is it unhealthy to have no friends? </h3> </div>
<a>closer friendships, they simply aren’t necessary</a> to your survival or even your
<a>happiness</a>. What does matter is how comfortable and content you are with being alone.
<div> <h3> How many friends does the average person have? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>There is no <a>“right” number of friends</a> that someone should have. What matters is the individual’s perception of the quality of their friendships and how much satisfaction they receive in the process. </p> </div>

<h2> How Can I Improve My Social Life? </h2>
<p>Understanding how to establish and maintain supportive connections in any medium is an essential part of life. People who live alone especially benefit from cultivating a strong network of social connections. </p>
<div> <h3> How can I be a social person? </h3> </div>
<a>it’s easiest to develop friendships</a> with people who are in close proximity, share similar interests, and support your social
<a>friendship</a> requires you to be supportive, disclose personal information, interact regularly, and be more positive than negative on balance.
<div> <h3> Why is it harder to make friends when you’re older? </h3> </div>
<a>difficult to make new friends as adults</a>. As they age, most of their time and energy get consumed by
<a>career</a> and family demands. They tend to socialize out of convenience with co-workers, bosses, the parents of their children’s friends, etc., but these relationships often don’t deepen into anything more lasting.

<h1> Emotional Improvisation Lessons for the Year Ahead </h1>
<h2> Enough with the changes, let’s make some music. </h2>
<li>Although not explicitly taught emotional improvisation, we are all built to improvise and be resilient in the face of change. </li>
<li>The flexibility sequence helps us to 'make music out of the noise' of life's changes. </li>
<li>Emotional improvisation leads to emotional agility, a creative capacity for working with rather than avoiding our feelings. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: khamkhor/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>A global pandemic, climate crisis, racial reckoning. That trifecta alone is taking an emotional toll, and with new variants out every day, how can anybody make music out of the noise? </p>
<p>“But the psyche is built to improvise.” I implore. </p>
<p>“If this is the tune we all have to play, why aren’t we taught it?”</p>
<a>lonely</a> again, and only last year, everything seemed so sure. Six hundred and fifty days in, we’re in the challenging harmonic territory of Billy Strayhorn’s Lush Life. Just as we find some temporary
<a>happiness</a>–getting back to school and work in person, enjoying restaurants and reunions–we’re disillusioned and back to existential dread. Without a week in Paris to ease the bite of it, how can we start making music again?
<p>But how do we do this when the music is all dissonance? Bonanno offers up the ‘flexibility sequence’: identify the song you are playing, vary your repertoire, and monitor your feedback. </p>
<a>depression</a>, but at first, she didn’t know why until she recognized an old melody with similar harmonic changes: the survivor
<a>guilt</a> she always felt for her twin brother who had committed
<a>suicide</a> now echoed in fears of abandoning her work family. Not only did her job serve as
<a>unconscious</a> penitence but Marianne now saw the myriad ways she neglected her own physical and emotional needs as
<a>Therapy</a> became her weekly soundcheck to adjust the levels on her psychological mixing board, to listen keenly to her own
<a>traumas</a> in the current collective trauma, to experiment with new ways of thinking, feeling, and acting on its familiar melody and harmonies, and to solicit feedback from friends, colleagues, or a counselor to make needed adjustments.
<a>creativity</a>. Echoing jazz vibraphonist Stefon Harris, instead of commandeering the band–the many players who metaphorically play inside–we learn how to collaborate and make more interesting music together.
<p>When we read the changes like this, we employ our creativity not just for art’s sake, but for life’s sake. And that just might be what we need to keep the band together so we can all make music this new year and beyond.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>There’s a Disturbance in the Force, Luke</a></h2> <p>Don’t let the dream shrink anymore. Don’t disbelieve it. Give it new life now. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>In Times When the Old Rules Don’t Work, Turn Within</a></h2> <p>We all have our unique ways of turning within. Here, I offer 3 examples.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Looking for Help in Lots of Wrong Places</a></h2> <p>As Dylan sang more than a few years ago, “the times they are a changin’."</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Big Systems Fail, Coaches Energize the Small</a></h2> <p>Few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but all of us have an opportunity to change a small portion of events.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Special Olympics: Compassion Meditation</a></h2> <p>Most meditation talk amongst practitioners includes something referred to as compassion meditation. Here's one way to practice.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Drain That Cup: The Art of Artistic Living </a></h2> <p>The bigger life is not the bigger house you buy, it is the bigger imagination and livelier heart you foster.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Mastering the Art of Living: Dealing with Dow Fatigue</a></h2> <p>It is so much easier to make money and talk about making money than it is to live contentedly.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>The Narrative We Live or the Narrative We Choose</a></h2>
<p>Whether you are a coach or not, you ought to know that the stories you tell about yourself, others, work and life tend to follow a dramatic pattern that reveals who you are.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Secret to Enjoyable Aging: "Good People Who Happen To You"</a></h2> <p>How you age is largely up to you</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When We Feel the Tears of Blessedness, We Feel Alive</a></h2> <p>This happy/sad blend can be called poignancy. It is the bittersweet state we have all felt when a joyous but fleeting thing happens.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Neglecting Our Democratic Infrastructure No More</a></h2> <p>Like physical systems, we use the democratic infrastructure all the time; they are in constant use and need maintenance and metaphoric oil changes.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Keeping America's Kids from Being Politically Wounded</a></h2>
<p>After watching the presidential debates, I think we have an obligation to our grandkids. We need to tell them how political discourse used to be and how it can be again someday.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Original Teenage Soul</a></h2> <p>The soulful social psychology of this weekend was not lost on any of us. We were celebrating the best parts of us that only these old friends know in its purest forms.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Reading as Deliberate Confrontation</a></h2> <p>Yes there is time for fast reading. Indulge away and keep yourself broadly informed. But do another kind of reading. Be revolutionary. Slow down.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Sky Behind Me</a></h2> <p>A worthwhile read for anyone who wants to sense the ghost in the machine.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Exploring the Good Kind of Disobedience</a></h2>
<p>Intelligent Disobedience. I recommend this book to all of us interested in the implications of the Hoffman Report, and to everyone not in psychology but interested in human courage in the face of collective evil.</p>
