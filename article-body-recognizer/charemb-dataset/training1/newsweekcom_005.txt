<p>Workplace monitoring, of course, isn't all bad: Some surveillance practices can help ensure safety, detect and prevent harassment, and provide constructive employee feedback.</p>
<p>The key, according to Hanley, is to incorporate workers into the decision-making process.</p>
<p>"What are their health and safety concerns? Maybe they say, you know what? This technology, we actually could use it," said Hanley. "But that's for them to decide."</p>
<p>Yet it's hard to imagine a company like Amazon willingly relinquishing control in this area to its workers. It's a catch-22: Workers won't get a say until they win a seat at the bargaining table.</p>

<p>A group of employees at the crime-watch app Citizen voted to unionize, a report from <a>Bloomberg</a> revealed on Monday. This follows a trend of unionization among large companies seen across the United States.</p>
<p>The unionized employees would be members of the app's central operations, who monitor local police scanners and send out news alerts to the app's users.</p>
<p>Citizen said in a statement that it would "move forward in our mission of making our users' world a safer place."</p>
<p>"While we are assessing next steps on this initial tally, what we know now is that we've grown through this process, learning how we can better work together to deliver for our users," the company continued.</p>
<p>A free mobile app that sends real-time safety and emergency alerts to its users, Citizen has grown significantly over the last few years. It has sent over 10 billion mobile alerts and is active in 60 American cities, according to the app's website.</p>
<p>The push to unionize within Citizen reportedly began in 2020 during the summer-long <a>Black Lives Matter</a> protests after the app saw a significant increase in downloads, according to a former employee that spoke to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Anger toward the non-unionization of the company reportedly spiked after many central operations jobs were outsourced overseas, the employee added. This included major positions that were normally controlled by the app's central operations.</p>
<p>Calls for change also came after Citizen CEO Andrew Frame reportedly offered a $30,000 bounty in Los Angeles for someone who was wrongly accused of a crime.</p>
<p>The unionization effort comes as the company has reportedly raised $133 million in venture capital from a variety of large backers.</p>
<p>The app is one of a slim number of tech startups that have chosen to go the way of the union in a historically non-union industry, although they are not exclusive in this category.</p>
<p>This includes workers at the app Mobilize, a community-organizing app whose employees unionized this past March. That effort was also organized by the CWA.</p>
<a>Amazon</a>, a company known for its strong anti-union stance, allowed 5,000 warehouse employees in Alabama to participate in its first union election in seven years this past February. However, this push for unionization was shot down by the company.
<a>Alphabet</a> Inc., the parent company of
<a>Google</a>. This led to the creation of the Alphabet Workers Union in January 2021, which currently has over 800 members—although this is a minute number compared to the over 100,000 total employees at Alphabet.
<p>In a statement sent to Newsweek, the CWA said that "the protections of a collective bargaining agreement will allow us to advocate for editorial standards that prioritize the safety of Citizen users without fear of losing our jobs."</p>
<p>Updated 12/14/2021, 4:18 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with a statement from the CWA.</p>
<div> News Starbucks <a>Labor unions</a> <a>Boston</a></div>
<p>Following a successful vote at a Buffalo, New York, Starbucks to unionize, employees at two of the coffee chain's Boston locations are trying to do the same.</p>
<p>The two Boston stores are looking to be represented by Workers United Labor Union, the same organization that, if certified by the National Labor Relations Board, will represent the Buffalo Starbucks.</p>
<p>The employees said they have not yet heard back from management regarding their unionization endeavors.</p>
<p>If the Buffalo store's unionization is certified, it will become the first store in the chain's over 50-year history to do so.</p>
<p>Kylah Clay, a 23-year-old barista at the Allston location, said in an interview with WGBH that she sees this as the beginning of a national movement. She called the Buffalo store "the first domino" and said she hopes the Boston stores are the next.</p>
<p>The NLRB said Thursday that workers voted 19-8 in favor of a union at Buffalo's Elmwood Avenue location, one of three stores in the city where elections were being held.</p>
<p>If no objections are filed to those results, they could be certified as early as Thursday. If objections are filed, there could be a series of hearings and appeals that delay certification of the votes.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>Last week, an election resulted in a 19-8 vote in favor of unionization at a Buffalo, New York, Starbucks, the first of the company's 8,000 U.S. stores to do so.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certified the results of the election Friday, making it official that Starbucks will have to enter into labor negotiations with an organized union for the first time in its 50-year history.</p>
<p>"We don't want to fight Starbucks — we're asking them to turn over a new leaf," said Jaz Brisack, an organizer at the store.</p>
<p>The Hamburg location voted 12-8 against unionizing, and the Cheektowaga vote is not yet public as seven total votes are being disputed by the union or Starbucks.</p>
<p>Workers United said the employees "were subjected to a massive campaign of overwhelming psychological force from the moment they publicly expressed the desire to form a union."</p>
<p>The NLRB will review the claims, and if it agrees with the union's complaints, it can set aside the election and determine if a second election should be held.</p>
<p>"These claims are grossly inaccurate. We did not and do not engage in intimidation tactics," Starbucks responded in a statement. "We are partners and we show up for one another. That's what we do and what we continue to do."</p>
<p>The 50-year-old company has actively fought unionization for decades, saying its more than 8,000 company-owned U.S. stores function best when it works directly with employees.</p>
<p>The actions disrupted the "laboratory conditions" considered necessary for a fair election, the union said.</p>
<p>Workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.</p>
<p>Update (12/17, 6:58 PM): This story was updated to reflect the NLBR's certification of the vote to unionize at one Buffalo location.</p>
