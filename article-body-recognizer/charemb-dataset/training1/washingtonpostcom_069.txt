<h1>When a saint draws the Virgin, so much is in the details</h1>
<h2>Van der Weyden’s depiction of Saint Luke is a meditation on attention as much as painting</h2>

<p>Since Saint Luke is the patron saint of artists, I imagine Van der Weyden extending that patience as much to himself (it takes time to get a good likeness) as to his subjects. (Good luck trying to keep an unswaddled, feeding infant still.)</p>

<h1>Mystery on a Venetian lagoon</h1>
<h2>What, exactly, are the fishermen doing in this Vittore Carpaccio painting? </h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>June 23, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>The title would seem to give us all we need: Men are hunting birds on a lagoon. But look closer, and things begin to get odd.</p>
<p>There are problems with this theory — why, most obviously, are the hunters firing pellets at the birds? — and with various other theories (for instance, that the birds being hunted are not cormorants but great crested grebes).</p>
<p>But equally fascinating is the mystery of the picture’s construction. There’s something strange about its perspective scheme: The vanishing point seems to be off to the left.</p>
<p>United with the hunters in their shallow-bottomed boats, it makes for a provocative and audacious composition: a passive (to the point of ennui) feminine sphere in the foreground, active men in the background.</p>
<h2>Barkley Hendricks’s photorealist portraits used to be unfashionable. They’ve come back into vogue.</h2>

<p>Photorealism got its charge from a kind of purposeful elevation of the humdrum. It transformed the accidental aesthetic of the photographic snapshot into large-scale, technically virtuosic, museum-ready paintings.</p>
<h2>Winslow Homer’s early masterpiece captured a new moral anxiety in the modern conduct of war</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>July 14, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>This 1863 picture by Winslow Homer, thought to be his earliest completed effort in oil paints, marks a turning point in modern warfare. For all its plain-spoken simplicity, it is one of the most morally anguished, ominously charged paintings I know.</p>
<p>Homer had impeccable journalistic impulses, and part of his motivation was that snipers, or sharpshooters, were a new phenomenon in warfare, made possible by telescopic sights and modern rifle technology.</p>
<b> </b>to embed the thing depicted in a story line and to possess, in a sense, actionable intelligence. Which is a good term to describe what you’re getting when you look through the sights of a rifle.
<p>“The above impression,” wrote Homer, “struck me as being as near to murder as anything I could think of in connection with the army I always had a horror of that branch of the service.”</p>

<p>“Friend! Shall we play a little game?”</p>
<p>“Here, handsome, sit closer.”</p>
<p>“Sir, let me top up your glass.”</p>
<p>The game is likely primero — a bluffing game similar to poker. Our victim here is the plump-faced, narrow-eyed and sumptuously dressed young man at right. You can tell he’s pleased with his hand because he has staked a tidy sum on it.</p>
<p>And, yes, she’s in on the ruse. In fact, they all are. And from the flashing interplay of their sidelong glances, we know, as they do, that this is the moment of truth.</p>
<p>Or when truth is traduced. How I’d love to look at this painting in the company of a great cardsharp like the late Ricky Jay. It’s so subtle, yet at the same time so theatrical and, in a way, so terrifying.</p>
<p>But La Tour’s genius is such that he compromises our pity by bringing us in on the con. The cheat with the ace of clubs tilts his head in our direction as he shows us his hand. And in an instant, we are transformed into accomplices.</p>

<h2>The color and detail in this 19th-century painting of a prize stallion will blow you away </h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Aug. 25, 2021</div></div></div>

<h2>“Alma Sewing” is both a study of composure and full of weird unruliness.</h2>

<p>You can’t stop progress, though. A hundred years later, cameras and sewing machines were both ubiquitous, and the world had duly adjusted.</p>

<h2>‘The Smokers’ could be a warning against the dangers of vice. Or it might be a sly endorsement.</h2>

<p>Other parts — the blushing patch of pink in the middle distance, for instance — must have been made with a dryer brush, a more tentative touch: You can see the weave of the canvas beneath.</p>
<p>The whole scene breathes. It trembles in the salty air, responds to the muffled boom of distant surf.</p>
<p>All of it, you sense, has been done intuitively. You can see the residue of the many revisions.</p>
<h1>Eva Gonzalès was Édouard Manet’s student. This was her masterpiece.</h1>
<h2>But the more you look at “Nanny and Child,” the more puzzling it becomes</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Sept. 29, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>In “Nanny and Child,” Gonzalès used a similar format — the “present” nanny, the “absent” child” — but ramped up the oddity critics had perceived in “The Railway.”</p>
<p>Why, moreover, would a chair be placed exactly there, directly behind an open gate of an ivy-covered fence that we — or the painter — are on the other side of? It’s a peculiar, in-between place to situate a portrait.</p>
<p>Then there is the child. She is closer to us than the nanny is, which makes her seem more important. But why, given that we can’t see her face? What is she holding in her hand? A piece of cloth? Some ivy? A letter?</p>
<p>The cruel choices facing talented young women in 19th-century France took a particularly cruel turn in Gonzalès’s case. In 1883, she died after an embolism, very soon after giving birth to a son. She was just 34.</p>
<b>. </b>It may be that people grab at whatever strategies are available as they try to hang on to life and to love.
<h1>This simple painting revolutionized art</h1>
<h2>With his ‘Boy Drinking,’ Annibale Carracci helped usher in the genre style</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Oct. 7, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>It does seem incredibly fresh. You don’t feel the painter following any existing schema. It feels instead like a depiction of something he has observed directly with his own eyes and done his best to reproduce with the brush in his hand.</p>
<p>Carracci had an older cousin, Ludovico, and an older brother, Agostino, who were both successful artists. They collaborated closely, but of the three, Annibale was the most accomplished and the most revolutionary.</p>
<b> </b>a renewed investment in the pleasures of the here-and-now. A toast to that! Saluti!

<h1>A tribute to mosaics, moonlight and mystery</h1>
<h2>This Jack Whitten masterpiece reflects his respect for the insights of writer Édouard Glissant</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Updated Nov. 3 at 9:45 a.m.Originally published Nov. 3, 2021</div></div></div>
<div><div><h6>correction</h6><p>A previous version of this article misstated the last name of the woman Jack Whitten would marry. She was Mary Staikos, not Mary Orsini. The article has been corrected.</p></div></div>
<p>This is why, as our body politic splutters and chokes on the weeds of identity politics, we need art more than ever.</p>
<p>Whitten, a Black man from Bessemer, Ala., was the son of a coal miner. (“The color black is in my blood!” he wrote.) He would marry Mary Staikos, a woman of Greek descent, and for decades they spent the summers in Crete.</p>
<p>But what Whitten liked in Glissant was his (very political) rejection of hierarchies as well as his concept of a universal space that was neither Utopian nor “hippie,” but concrete, just like “Atopolis.”</p>
<p>Opacity. What could be more attractive for an abstract artist? (If you choose to be an abstract artist, you probably want — more than most artists — to remain inscrutable.)</p>
<p>If Whitten was susceptible to the seductions of abstraction, materiality and opacity, it’s because no one can survive on just toast.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Sebastian Smee</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 18, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’ve been reading the headlines about art and NFTs, you probably have questions. Starting with, what the heck <i>is </i>an NFT?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I’m here to help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And by here, I mean in Miami, where Art Basel Miami Beach recently concluded its latest run.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You’ll want to know about Anadol’s work, I promise. But first …</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is an NFT, in the art world?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>An NFT can be minted (i.e. registered on a blockchain) from almost anything: a virtual racing car inside a video game, a photo of Harry Styles’s cardigan or a work of digital art.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Wait. What is a blockchain?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is the point of an NFT?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Until, of course, you sell it. And that’s the real point. By minting something as an NFT, you’re creating a commodity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What’s the relationship between NFTs and the art world?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>(because the blockchain ledgers they’re stored on are public). And they’ll reward artists with resale royalties, because you can embed contracts in NFTs that award artists a percentage every time a work is purchased.
<div><div><h3><div>Why is everyone suddenly talking about NFTs?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Beeple was famous among digital artists, but almost no one in the art world had heard of him before the sale. The bidding started at $100. Over a period of weeks, it was pushed higher and higher by several cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What explains the astonishing price?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bidders really liked Beeple’s work, no question. But they were also up to something else. They wanted to create a sensation, to whip up publicity for NFTs in particular and cryptocurrencies in general.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What about Beeple?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>had reached $12 billion.
<div><div><h3><div>Are NFTs a new art form?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>No. NFTs are not a new artistic medium in the way that oil paint, printmaking, photography or video art were. Even digital art (which is just art made on a computer) preexisted NFTs by decades.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>NFTs are financial instruments. They make it easier to sell digital files by creating scarcity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“NFTs have already transformed the art world, regardless of whether the boom continues,” curator Hans Ulrich Obrist said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ugh. My head hurts. Can you take me back to the beach? That sounded like quite the scene.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Wow. Really? But my head still hurts. Can I just forget NFTs for a moment and surrender to some great art?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Certainly. I feel the same way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>You’re saying it was good?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I buy it?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Did $851,130 represent the ‘true value’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Huh? Old-school question!</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What kind of artists are benefiting from the current craze?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Wanting to capitalize on the hype, many unknown and struggling digital artists are minting and selling whatever they can as NFTs, and it’s making a big difference in some of their lives. Unfortunately, they’re also flooding the market.</p>
<div><div><p>Established art collectors are yet to be convinced of the value of digital work by people like Thorp and Beeple. But if the cryptocurrency crowd stays interested, that may not matter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do you judge the quality of NFT art?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>the conceptual artist, explains, “you can do something really simple and it can be amazing.”
<p>For people who have trouble with that notion, one good proxy, said Meyohas, is “how hard was this to do?” “So some art gets its value from displaying its labor. Beeple’s work is an insane performance of labor.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Are there digital artists who were already recognized in the art world before NFTs came along?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What role is the cryptocurrency crowd playing?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the market for NFTs was essentially created by cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, and since they’re still the ones sustaining it, you can’t really understand the NFT craze without contemplating their wider designs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we’re seeing is the ripple effect or shock wave of people trying to get their sea legs and figure out what all this means,” said Glenn Kaino, one of the most interesting artists working with NFTs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What problems are NFTs actually solving?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>So what problems are NFTs creating?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>The hype is out of control and the supply of NFTs so far outstrips demand that it’s hard to know where to look, let alone where lasting value might lie.
<div><div><h3><div>Who will sort out the good NFTs from the deluge of mediocrity?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Critics? Ha.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dealers and auction house specialists will help, and many are already getting in on the game. But there’s a great irony here.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You’re going to have a lot of upset curators and gallerists,” predicted Reid Yager, a spokesman for the blockchain platform Tezos, which had a stand showcasing NFTs on the periphery of Art Basel Miami Beach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Are art galleries nervous about the threat posed by NFTs?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How important are dealers anyway?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The art world could certainly do with more transparency. But dealers play a bigger role in artists’ careers than many realize.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>You can do that?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sure. That’s the power of combining genuine demand with limited supply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“With NFTs, all that control and nurturing of an artist’s market goes out the window, because you can buy and sell an NFT in five minutes,” Meyohas said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>So what’s going to happen?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meyohas said she thinks “the traditional art world and the NFT world are going to move closer to each other. We’re going to have this physical/virtual continuum where NFTs are just part of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>But what if you don’t want it to change? What if you prefer physical works of art to art that exists in computers?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>You’re probably in the majority. But guess what? Not everyone thinks like you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spend a little time at Art Basel and you might think the art world is a coherent entity, a club. It’s not.</p></div></div>
<p>The NFT craze is making it clear that the “art world” comprises an ever-expanding cluster of disparate communities. And as Zwirner said, “Different communities are developing different rubrics for what makes art good.”</p>
<div><div><p>“But,” he concluded, “the idea that physical reality and physical objects will somehow be supplanted by digital experience? That seems like a marketing ploy for a digital worldview.”</p></div></div>

<h1>Red, right to the liberated heart</h1>
<h2>Martin Puryear’s sculpture at Glenstone is an invitation to reflect on freedom and coercion</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 22, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>It was an amazing show, but none of the other pieces crystallized in my memory quite like this. So I was happy when it turned up in the collection of Glenstone Museum.</p>
<p>Was it the color that made this piece so memorable?</p>
<p>Other works in Puryear’s 2014 show suggested shackles used on slave ships. In both cases the sculptures were abstracted and simplified. Some were hollow, others solid, and the materials (Puryear is a master craftsman) kept changing.</p>
<p>No such ambiguity exists here. The form is clearly a liberty cap. But the color red, and its association with revolutionary extremism, might remind us that extremes of freedom are never far from extremes of domination.</p>
<p>Whether it’s guns or vaccines, wealth redistribution or education, it seems we can never get the balance between liberty and coercion right. When it banned slavery in February 1794, France was still in the grip of the Terror.</p>

<p>Now she has two. My family lives 1,000 miles away, and before the cats we would visit regularly. About four years ago we visited, but my son became very sick due to his allergy and we had to leave early.</p>
<p>My mom has made me feel bad that I am unable to visit. However, I cannot afford to stay in a hotel and will not risk my son’s health because of her cats.</p>
<p> <b>Missing Family:</b> Well, the defender of the kid who can’t breathe is right by default.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t solve your problem, so let’s keep going.</p>
<p>You’re both being stubborn in your own ways. Her way is obvious — guilt-tripping you over your kid’s health? I struggle to see how she justifies that to herself.</p>
<p>Presently both of you think you have the right not to budge. Which you both do, of course — but does exercising that right serve anybody well?</p>
<p>Now I’m practically failing one of my classes and I don’t know what to do.</p>

<div><h1>Carolyn Hax: For a rude houseguest, time to set limits on hospitality</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Carolyn Hax</div></div>Advice columnist </span></div></span></div><div>July 11, 2019</div></div>
<div><p><b>Dear Carolyn:</b> My husband's brother has left after another visit and I would appreciate tips on how to tell him, when he asks to visit again, that we love him but he's not welcome back unless some things change drastically.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Should we draw up a set of rules for him? Other suggestions? He has the right to live how he wants, but we want to draw the line.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p> — Not Your Hotel or Servant</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Not Your Hotel or Servant:</b> Of course you do — his “right to live how he wants” doesn’t include doing so at your expense or without any consequences.</p></div></div>
<div><p>His being “immature and self-centered” does mean he won’t anticipate this himself, yes, because that’s the one-question maturity test: Do you treat others as if you’re more important than they are? Yes/no.</p></div>
<p>However, you’re talking as if you need a big conversation to get your point across, and in fact you don’t even need him to get this. All you need is to be utterly unmoved by any expectations he has that you’re not willing to meet.</p>
<div><p>For example, you say: “He insist[s] on going out for everything.” No big conversation needed there; just don’t budge. “We’re having our coffee here. You’re welcome to go out if you’d like.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>And: “He only wants to do what he wants to do, making faces . . . at our suggestions,” means, “Okay! Have fun. Will you be back by dinner?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And: “Please pick your clothes up — they’re on the hall floor.” Because, seriously. Stand there while he does it.</p></div></div>
<i>in the moment</i> is the drastic change I emphatically recommend.

<p>Adapted from a recent online discussion.</p>
<p>But I don’t feel like waiting around and twiddling my thumbs for a year if marriage is the end goal. I think I’m the only one of us who has a goal of actually being married to my partner.</p>
<p>— Invested in Marriage</p>
<p><b>Invested in Marriage:</b> You sound less like partners and more like roommates with specific objectives. Different objectives at that. How much do you guys talk, and how deeply? Where's the intimacy here?</p>
<p>Try, please, to have the conversation: “You say _____, ______ and _____ about weddings and marriage in general. I plan the wedding, you postpone the wedding.</p>
<p>“I would rather you tell me the truth about what you’re thinking and feeling than to have it come out in bits and pieces like this.” Your words of course, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>And it sounds for your part that your “goal” of marriage is no longer about him anymore, or about what the two of you create together emotionally, but instead about formalizing a vision you formed years ago.</p>
<p>Think big, speak honestly and be brave enough to let the right outcome reveal itself, instead of pushing for one you think you want. Or pushing away from one you’re afraid of — which is so often the case.</p>
<p><b>Re: Marriage:</b> "I was very close to leaving for this exact reason, and when he realized I was serious, quickly worked to get me an engagement ring": No matter what happens, you can't ignore that detail.</p>
<p>He’s willing to string you along indefinitely until you threaten the status quo he enjoys so much. Then he’s going to give you whatever you want (in gesture only) while going back to being himself.</p>
<p>Even if you two get married, that doesn’t bode well for a happy life, with him doing whatever you want so he doesn’t lose you and nothing more.</p>
<p><b>Anonymous:</b> Yes — transactions, not trust. Thank you.</p>

<p> Adapted from a recent online discussion. </p>
<p>We went to look and wound up really liking it. We decided to make an offer and asked (before we did) if they were sure they were okay with our making the offer. They said yes (somewhat enthusiastically, too!). So we made an offer.</p>
<p>After we did, my brother sent us a text basically saying they were afraid that living so close would be stressful to them and our kids might have issues in school (same ages, not even in school yet). My husband and I were obviously upset.</p>
