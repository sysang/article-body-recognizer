<div><div><p>“He was enamored with [how] ‘all these people are coming to fight for me,’ ” said a senior Republican close to him. “I don’t think he appreciated what was going on.”</p><div>3</div></div></div>
<p>In a statement, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich disputed The Post’s findings as “fake news” and falsely cast people who entered the Capitol that day as “agitators not associated with President Trump.”</p>
<li>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack, but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</li>
<li>Trump had direct warnings of the risks, but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</li>
<li>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</li>
<li>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to take back control of the Capitol</li>

<p>“Not very good, Mr. President,” Tuberville responded. “As a matter of fact, they’re about to evacuate us.”</p>
<p>“I know we’ve got problems,” Trump responded.</p>
<div><p>Amid the mayhem, Tuberville abruptly ended the call. “Mr. President, they just took our vice president out,” the senator said. “They’re getting ready to drag me out of here. I got to go.”</p><div>5</div></div>
<p>“You know what I see, Kevin? I see people who are more upset about the election than you are. They like Trump more than you do,” the president replied.</p>
<p>Trump responded, “Kevin, they’re not my people.”</p>
<div><div><p>McCarthy told the president, “Yes they are, they just came through my windows and my staff is running for cover. Yeah, they’re your people. Call them off.”</p><div>7</div></div></div>
<h3><div>Seven hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Cheney took to Twitter at 7:11 a.m. to denounce the effort by a growing number of her Republican colleagues to try to give Trump a second term by rejecting the electoral college results.</p>
<div><div><p>A few blocks away, at the Washington Monument, a mob of Trump supporters overran police at 9 a.m. One U.S. Park Police officer radioed:</p><div>11</div></div></div>
<p>Within minutes, the dispatches from officers on the scene worsened.</p>
<p>Then, at 9:46 a.m., an even more frightening report came in from the Lincoln Memorial. Park Police officers radioed in to say there were 500 to 800 people gathered, some with giant banner flags.</p>
<p>Just then, another officer at the Washington Monument radioed in:</p>
<p>Instructions came over the radio to all Park Police officers:</p>
<p>An officer explained the strategy of restraint: “We’re not going to agitate them.”</p>
<p>At the White House, Trump issued an unambiguous instruction at 8:17 a.m. to Pence, who was preparing to preside over the joint session of Congress at 1 p.m.</p>
<h3><div>Five hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Around the city, there was a carnival atmosphere at the various gatherings of protesters who believed they were not just witnessing history, but helping create it, with Biden’s victory about to be undone.</p>
<div><p>Guilfoyle argued to Trump that the swelling crowd outside represented a national consensus. “They’re just reflecting the will of the people,” she told him. “This is the will of the people.”</p><div>13</div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump was unforgiving. “You don’t have the courage to make a hard decision,” he told Pence.</p><div>14</div></div></div>
<p>As they arrived on the scene, murmurs of “the Proud Boys are here” went through the crowd, and people moved to make a clearing. “Praise God!” one woman said.</p>
<p>At 11:39 a.m., Trump departed the White House by motorcade for the quick drive to the Ellipse, where he gathered with aides, allies and family members beneath a white tent before taking the rally stage.</p>
<b> </b>At the same time, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that the vehicle near L’Enfant Plaza contained two handguns as well as the rifle and scope.
<h3><div>Two hours to go</div></h3>
<p>“Should it affect what you’re going to do?” her father asked.</p>
<p>After some discussion, they agreed she should press on.</p>
<div><div><p>“You can’t let that sort of threat stop you from doing what’s right,” he told his daughter.</p><div>17</div></div></div>
<p>At 12:36 p.m., Pence arrived at the Capitol. As the motorcade drew near, one of his staffers was struck by the scale of the crowd.</p>
<div><div><p>Pence’s team did not imagine the scene would turn violent; none of the relevant agencies had briefed the vice president or his team about what to expect.</p><div>18</div></div></div>
<p>As Pence entered the Capitol, his office released the letter to Congress. The finality of its conclusions sent shock waves through Trump’s orbit and beyond.</p>
<p>A city official pointed to CNN, which was displaying images of Pence and Congress meeting inside. “That’s not what’s on television,” the official said.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be,” Harvin fired back.</p>
<p>At 1:03 p.m., Capitol Police found an unoccupied red pickup truck with Alabama tags containing a trove of weapons, including an M4 carbine assault rifle, loaded magazines of ammunition, and components to make 11 molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>Back at the Ellipse, Trump was finishing his speech, and the leader’s edict rang through the city like a call to arms.</p>
<p>“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue — I love Pennsylvania Avenue — and we are going to the Capitol.”</p>
<p>And then, at 1:10 p.m., he told the crowd to march to “try and give [lawmakers] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”</p>
<h3><div>60 minutes to go</div></h3>
<p>“1776!” one man called out.</p>
<p>“1776!” fellow marchers responded.</p>
<p>“Whose Capitol? Our Capitol!” they chanted.</p>
<div><div><p>By 1 p.m., Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund realized things weren’t going well: “I’m watching my people getting slammed.”</p><div>20</div></div></div>
<p>“Break open the gate!” one man yelled, his voice bellowing over the crowd. “We're not going to be scared! We're not backing down! You mess with American people, this is what you get!”</p>
<p>This was a full-blown riot.</p>
<p>At 1:50 p.m., the D.C. police commander declared a riot at the Capitol.</p>
<p>“Get ’em!” people shouted, charging into battle. “Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!”</p>
<h3><div>The Capitol is breached</div></h3>
<p>At a landing, Goodman turned around and made as if he was going to hit Jensen with the baton. “Back up!” Goodman shouted.</p>
<p>“Hit me, I’ll take it,” Jensen said. “I will take it for my country.”</p>
<p>Goodman turned again to run. “Second floor!” he shouted into his radio as he took the stairs two at a time, warning fellow officers that the crowd was on the move. Jensen ran after him, his arms pumping.</p>
<b> </b>office where Pence was hiding.
<p>Goodman looked to his left, toward that office. Then he pushed Jensen in the chest and started walking toward the right, where a line of police officers was waiting. Jensen followed, and so did the rioters behind him.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of stopping us at this point?” Jensen said to one officer, in an exchange captured on video obtained by The Post, as rioters’ yells echoed off the marble walls.</p>
<p>“That's as far as it's going to go,” the officer declared.</p>
<p>“Then go arrest the vice president!” Jensen said.</p>
<p>At 2:19 p.m., Capitol Police emailed an urgent bulletin to all congressional staff:</p>
<p>On the House side, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had been presiding when her security detail pulled her from the rostrum, and the House suddenly adjourned at 2:20 p.m.</p>
<p>At the White House, Trump was watching the spectacle play out on television. He was pleased by thousands of his supporters storming the Capitol. Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m.:</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving the Capitol,” Pence had told Giebels. He feared the image of his departing motorcade might provide vindication to the insurrectionists.</p>
<p>The vice president and his family and aides were led on a safe path down a staircase to a secured subterranean area that rioters couldn’t reach. Pence’s armored limousine was parked there, and Giebels asked him to get inside.</p>
<div><p>“I’m not getting in the car, Tim,” Pence said. “I trust you, Tim, but you’re not driving the car. If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I’m not getting in the car.”</p><div>26</div></div>
<p>The vice president and his entourage found safety in a secured underground area of the Capitol, where they would wait out the rioters.</p>
<div><div><p>Eastman said his message was a response to an email in which Jacob told him that his “bull----” legal advice was why Pence’s team was “under siege.”</p><div>27</div></div></div>
<h3><div>30 minutes in</div></h3>
<p>“It seemed like they knew less about what was happening than we did,” Jayapal said. “Everyone felt unprotected, but we were stuck there.”</p>
<p>At 2:44 p.m., a shot echoed in the halls. A Capitol Police officer killed Ashli Babbitt as she attempted to force entry into the Speaker’s Lobby adjacent to the House chamber.</p>
<p>Inside the chamber, lawmakers assumed the worst and realized they could soon be overrun by violent intruders. Jayapal thought the rioters were shooting into the chamber.</p>
<p>Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) comforted her friend Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) in prayer.</p>
<p>Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.) called her mother.</p>
<p>Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), who has since disclosed lasting mental trauma sparked by his experience, called his family and began to say goodbye after understanding the gravity of the situation; there was a chance he would not make it out alive.</p>
<p>Soon Wild was lying on the ground. Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) held her hand.</p>
<p>Members discussed how they would position themselves if the mob were to burst through the doors. Crow suggested that members take their pins off so that the rioters could not identify them as the elected officials they wanted to kill.</p>
<p>Just removing a pin was not a solution for every lawmaker, however. While all were under threat, the danger was particularly acute for lawmakers of color, whose identity made them a visible target for the overwhelmingly White throng.</p>
<p>As rioters pushed their way into the Speaker’s Lobby, their hatred and zeal was evident. When Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn ordered them to leave the Capitol, some yelled back:</p>
<p>“President Trump invited us here!”</p>
<p>“Nobody voted for Joe Biden!”</p>
<p>In a rare instance of injecting politics into his job, Dunn replied: “I voted for Joe Biden. Does my vote not count? Am I nobody?”</p>
<p>Rioters then hurled racial epithets at Dunn, who is Black.</p>
<p>“You hear that, guys?” one woman said. “This n----r voted for Joe Biden!”</p>
<div><div><p>About 20 people screamed at Dunn, “Boo! F---ing n----r!”</p><div>31</div></div></div>
<h3><div>45 minutes in</div></h3>
<div><div><p>“Call the president!” Schumer yelled at Rosen. “Tell him to call off his people! Tell him to tweet that they have to stop this!”</p><div>32</div></div></div>
<b> </b>Rosen spoke to senior White House officials that day, including counsel Pat Cipollone, but never to the president.
<p>Frustrated by what they felt was Rosen’s noncommittal answer to their demand, Schumer and Pelosi issued a joint statement urging Trump to call off the rioters.</p>
<b> </b>The Army was not denying the requests, Piatt later testified. The service just wanted a clear plan in place before taking what leaders saw as a serious step to deploy armed guardsmen at the Capitol.
<div><div><p>At the Pentagon, Miller, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy huddled to discuss how to mobilize the Guard.</p><div>35</div></div></div>
<p>At 2:52 p.m., the first FBI SWAT teams arrived at the Capitol. In total, 520 federal agents from a hodgepodge of agencies responded to an urgent call to help at the Capitol from the Justice Department. It was throwing bodies at a crisis.</p>
<h3><div>60 minutes in</div></h3>
<div><div><p>Hodgkins walked among the desks on the Senate floor and took a selfie to document his place in what felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. “It felt like some kind of dream,” he said.</p><div>37</div></div></div>
<p>Hodgkins made his way to the well, holding his Trump flag right next to the desk where Pence had been sitting just 40 minutes earlier to certify Biden’s win.</p>
<p>“Let’s all say a prayer in this sacred space,” declared the shirtless, face-painted “QAnon Shaman,” Jacob Anthony Chansley, who stood behind the desk wielding a bullhorn as several other men bowed their heads.</p>
<div><div><p>Hodgkins beat his chest twice with his right hand, as his left hand held the flag. He raised it in salute as the prayer ended and the group said “Amen!”</p><div>38</div></div></div>
<p>Police would soon enter the chamber, and by about 3:15 p.m. Hodgkins would follow their orders to leave. “I couldn’t believe that I walked into the Senate so easily,” Hodgkins recalled.</p>
<div><div><p>Farah called and texted Mark Meadows, her former boss, practically begging the White House chief of staff to put out a statement or address cameras if the president wouldn’t. She wrote in one message:</p><div>43</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I need you to come back down here. We’ve got to get this under control,” Meadows told Ivanka Trump on several occasions.</p><div>45</div></div></div>
<p>Trump was being worked from multiple angles. This was around the same time that Kevin McCarthy, House minority leader, called the president practically begging him to denounce the riots.</p>
<p>At 3:13 p.m., Trump tweeted a new message, one that again fell short of what those around him felt was necessary.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump retweeted her father’s message at 3:15 p.m. and addressed the rioters as “American Patriots.” She deleted her tweet a few minutes later after it was roundly criticized.</p>
<p>Both statements were belligerent and twisted the truth in redirecting blame for the riots, but nevertheless urged his supporters to end the insurrection. Trump sent neither.</p>
<h3><div>The second hour</div></h3>
<p>As the afternoon hurtled on, the rioters were pushing through the Capitol with greater ferocity and in higher numbers. Gina Bisignano, a salon owner from Beverly Hills, Calif., egged on the violent crowd with a megaphone.</p>
<div><div><p>“Everybody, we need gas masks,” she said at one point. “We need weapons. We need strong, angry patriots to help our boys. They don’t want to leave.”</p><div>47</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>She also said, “You are not going to take away our Trumpy-bear. You are not going to take away our votes and our freedom that our men died for.”</p><div>48</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Look, we have to move articles,” she told her Democratic counterpart. “Immediately.”</p><div>50</div></div></div>
<p>Trump still had not addressed the crisis on camera or instructed his supporters to go home when, at 4:05 p.m., Biden appeared on television from Wilmington, Del.</p>
<p>Senators from both parties watching from their secure room at the Capitol complex applauded. “It was like, wow, we have a leader who said what needed to be said,” Romney said.</p>
<b> </b>In an August court filing, Sabol’s lawyer says he “vehemently denies” hitting the officer with the baton.
<p>The officer from whom Sabol had stolen the baton was also dragged into the crowd, where rioters ripped off his helmet, Maced him and stomped on him. He required staples in his head.</p>
<p>At the Justice Department, Rosen watched images of violence unfurl across the television screen. He was horrified by the literal and spiritual damage being done to one of America’s most important institutions.</p>
<h3><div>The final hours</div></h3>
<div><div><p>“I think that’s the right thing to do,” Meadows told Short.</p><div>52</div></div></div>
<p>Trump chimed in at 6:01 p.m. with a new tweet that, much like his Rose Garden video message, propagated his election fraud lie while telling the “great patriots” to “go home with love in peace.”</p>
<p>Trump’s video and tweets enraged some Republican members of Congress, even loyal ones like McCarthy and Graham. “That was a bad tweet,” Graham said of Trump’s message excusing what had happened that day.</p>
<p>Shortly before 8 p.m., Pence and senators returned to the Senate chamber to pick up where they had left off. Graham took Pence aside and said: “You’re doing the right thing. I’m proud of you.” The two men hugged.</p>
<p>Visibly emotional from the day’s trauma, Pence gaveled the Senate back into session at 8:06 p.m.</p>
<p>When it was Graham’s turn to speak, the South Carolina Republican was animated as he wistfully described Trump as a friend who had drifted away, if only for a moment.</p>
<p>Even as the Senate returned to order, the pressure on Pence did not let up. Eastman, the attorney advising Trump, emailed Jacob, Pence’s counsel, around 9 p.m. to try to convince the vice president to move to not certify the election results.</p>
<div><div><p>Jacob told others he was amazed at the email and disregarded it. He did not respond to Eastman. Pence continued to oversee the counting of votes.</p><div>56</div></div></div>

<p>“We deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life and the quagmire of dysfunction that threaten our democracy,” Black said.</p>
<p>He then sounded an unmistakable condemnation of the weeks-long campaign to infect the body politic with lies and disinformation about the election.</p>
<p>“These tragedies have reminded us that words matter,” Black continued, “and that the power of life and death is in the tongue.”</p>

<b> </b>to formalize the electoral college vote, but federal law enforcement agencies did not seem to share his sense of urgency. On Saturday, Jan. 2, he picked up the phone and called his counterpart in San Francisco, waking Mike Sena before dawn.
<p>Sena listened with alarm. The Northern California intelligence office he commanded had also been inundated with political threats flagged by social media companies, several involving plans to disrupt the joint session or hurt lawmakers on Jan. 6.</p>

<p>While the public may have been surprised by what happened on Jan. 6, the makings of the insurrection had been spotted at every level, from one side of the country to the other. The red flags were everywhere.</p>
<li>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</li>
<li>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</li>
<li>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</li>
<li>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</li>
<div>View all key findings</div>
<p>Intelligence officials certainly never envisioned a mass attack against the government incited by the sitting president.</p>
<p>When that failed, he turned his focus to Jan. 6, historically a pro forma ritual by Congress.</p>
<p>His words triggered rapid action by angry supporters who made plans to go to the nation’s capital, fusing together in a dangerous call-and-response.</p>
<p>Come to Washington, Trump tweeted to his supporters on the Saturday before Christmas, issuing a clarion call for them to gather and protest on Jan. 6: “Be there, will be wild!”</p>
<div><div><p>His supporters immediately responded on the pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win under a thread titled “TRUMP TWEET. DADDY SAYS BE IN DC ON JAN. 6TH.”</p><div>2</div></div></div>
<p>Trump primed his base to view Pence as either a would-be hero or villain, depending on the path the vice president took.</p>
<p>“I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” he declared at a rally in Georgia two days before the joint session, adding: “If he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him as much.”</p>
<p>Trump’s supporters not only knew where the president wanted them to gather on Jan. 6. They knew whom to target.</p>
<p>Again and again, as the pivotal day approached, top law enforcement officials fielded warnings of what was to come, but failed to respond in kind.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power, new accounts reveal.</p>
<p>DHS said in a statement that it is participating in ongoing investigations about the security failings and “leveraging lessons learned to enhance its ability to prevent future acts of violence.”</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Defense Department “continues to cooperate with the Congress as they examine the events of that day.”</p>
<b> </b>bureau’s work leading up to Jan. 6 as proactive and aggressive. In interviews and statements, they insisted much of the alarming online chatter
<b> </b>agents saw was largely “aspirational” and therefore protected First Amendment free speech — not the detailed evidence of planning needed to launch an investigation or foresee a mass attack on the Capitol.
<p>In a statement, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich disputed The Post’s investigation as “fake news” and falsely cast people who entered the Capitol that day as “agitators not associated with President Trump.”</p>
<h3><div>102 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The violent events of Jan. 6 had been months in the making.</p>
<p>Trump’s first allusion to the notion that Congress could determine the winner of the presidential race came more than a month before voters went to the polls, on Sept. 26, at a rally outside Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p>While the line didn’t register in Harrisburg, congressional Democrats in Washington took note.</p>
<p>Trump’s remark in Pennsylvania confirmed Democratic suspicions. The next day, Pelosi sent a letter to her caucus revealing that a backup plan was already underway.</p>
<p>“The Constitution says that a candidate must receive a majority of the state delegations to win,” Pelosi wrote. “We must achieve that majority of delegations or keep the Republicans from doing so.”</p>
<p>Three days after the Harrisburg rally, Trump made a more menacing declaration at the first presidential debate.</p>
<p>Biden pressed Trump to specifically condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for street brawls with liberal protesters. When Wallace sought an answer, Trump said, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.”</p>
<p>On Parler, the social media network popular with conservatives and hate groups, the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, responded almost immediately:</p>
<p>LEFT: Paul Hodgkins volunteers at a Trump rally in Tampa on Oct. 29, 2020. RIGHT: Leading up to Election Day, Hodgkins stood along busy intersections, waving Trump campaign flags. (Photos courtesy of Paul Hodgkins) </p>
<p>As Trump made misleading and false claims warning about voter fraud, Hodgkins grew concerned. He had never heard of tactics like “vote harvesting” or seen so much voting by mail.</p>
<p>“Previous elections we didn’t have that kind of thing go on,” he said.</p>
<h3><div>63 days to go</div></h3>
<p>In the wee hours of the morning after the election, as it appeared that he could be in danger of losing, Trump stepped before supporters in the East Room<b> </b>and falsely claimed that the election was rigged.</p>
<p>The next day, Trump tweeted that he “claimed” a win in Pennsylvania, falsely asserting that the state wasn’t allowing vote observers.</p>
<b> </b>used Sharpie pens to mark their ballots. County officials had debunked the rumor, but that didn’t matter.
<p>Holt felt his first pang of worry about where it would all lead when he was monitoring video from Maricopa on Nov. 4. He could see some protesters openly brandishing rifles and handguns.</p>
<p>“You had folks with very extreme views armed,” Holt said. “It wasn’t just an airing of grievances, but some went with intention to intimidate.”</p>
<h3><div>53 days to go</div></h3>
<p>As Trump refused to concede, angry supporters and self-styled militias geared up to fight. Quickly, plans for a “Million MAGA March” in Washington on Nov. 14 galvanized figures known for their hard-edge rhetoric.</p>
<p>Rhodes urged all citizens to be ready to fight while Trump “is commander in chief and has a narrowing window” to act.</p>
<div><div><p>Racine would go on to pass the information to the mayor and other elected D.C. officials, and asked McCord to keep his office updated. The prosecutors flagged it for the FBI’s Washington Field Office.</p><div>13</div></div></div>
<p>On Nov. 14, Mendoza and her team lined up outside the Capitol near dusk and watched as Proud Boys and other protesters paraded across the Capitol grounds. It seemed to her that they were eyeing her officers, sizing them up as they walked past.</p>
<p>As night dragged on, the extremists and groups of counterprotesters began to scuffle — they were soon brawling in the street between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mendoza and her crew repeatedly waded into the melee to separate the warring sides. Punches flew. Officers were pushed through the crowd.</p>
<p>By the time it ended, one person was stabbed, four officers were injured, police took eight firearms off protesters, and more than 20 people had been arrested, many for inciting violence.</p>
<p>The fighting was so intense that Mendoza could barely move when she awoke the next morning. The next night, she texted a colleague who had been there:</p>
<p>He was recovering, too, but wrote he’d toasted the job they’d done keeping it from getting worse — attaching a picture of an empty tumbler beside a bottle of Scotch.</p>
<h3><div>48 days to go</div></h3>
<p>But the president was so enamored with the conspiracy theories that he asked advisers if the government could research them — particularly whether foreign countries such as China hacked the vote.</p>
<p>Yes, Trump could exaggerate, Hodgkins knew, but the growing number of voices agreeing with the president was convincing.</p>
<p>He soaked up false allegations of election fraud on Fox News and the right-wing website Daily Caller. He took notice of Stop the Steal rallies popping up around Tampa.</p>
<p>The new movement helped Hodgkins shake off his post-election funk. He wrote a $10 check to the Trump campaign and attended a campaign meetup.</p>
<p>He was ready to help the cause.</p>
<h3><div>36 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Though it was clear that Trump’s rejection of the election was stirring his supporters to action, senior law enforcement officials at the FBI and Justice Department were feeling boxed in.</p>
<p>The president was increasingly irate that officials would not support his unfounded claims of voter fraud. Trump’s threats to Wray rankled. The FBI chief wasn’t looking for any more confrontations with the president.</p>
<p>“We can stop this whenever we want, but we’d rather not do that. It’s not our place,” said one senior official at the time.</p>
<b> </b>optimistic about that, although he felt that as long as Trump’s lawyers were focused mostly on state-related election issues, the Justice Department could steer clear of the fray.
<p>In the latter half of November, some Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), privately pressed Barr to make some kind of public statement knocking down the baseless claims about massive vote count errors.</p>
<p>Barr put them off, but on Nov. 23, he privately told Trump the claims of major problems with voting machines were nonsense.</p>
<b> </b>official recalled, and shift the burden of proof back to the president’s lawyers. Instead, it marked the beginning of the end of Barr’s tenure. Two weeks after the statement, he announced he would leave the job.
<p>Soon, Ali Alexander, Amy Kremer and Trump’s other backers were promoting a second rally in D.C. for Dec. 12 — two days before members of the electoral college would meet in state capitals across the nation.</p>
<p>A New Hampshire Proud Boys group leader calling himself “biggdaddy” promoted the event on Parler and told members not to miss making history to “support our President.”</p>
<p>Rhodes published a national call for Oath Keepers to travel to D.C., specifically calling on law enforcement officers to join the cause, noting they were allowed to carry concealed weapons.</p>
<p>“We especially need LEO and military veterans with pertinent backgrounds for security (combat arms veterans, for example), or civilian equivalents,” Rhodes wrote.</p>
<p>Discussions Holt could see on the social network service MeWe suggested the number of militants who would be traveling to D.C. this time was far greater than in the previous month.</p>
<p>“They’re meeting up with like 750 Proud Boys over there,” wrote one user on a chat group for self-described Three Percenters in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The longtime Republican official stood before the television cameras at a Dec. 1 news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with anger: “It. Has. All. Gone. Too. Far.”</p>
<h3><div>25 days to go</div></h3>
<p>On Dec. 12, just as they had a month earlier, thousands of pro-Trump supporters and protesters converged on D.C., including what police estimated were — as advertised in advance by extremists <b> </b>— about 700 Proud Boys.</p>
<p>“This isn’t over, this is just beginning,” Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson told the crowd.</p>
<p>Alexander told those assembled that if the electoral college endorsed Biden’s victory, his Stop the Steal organization would turn its attention to pressuring Republicans to object to the certification on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Trump flew over the crowd in a helicopter and cheered on his supporters.</p>
<p>With nightfall came chaos.</p>
<p>Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, paraded a Black Lives Matter banner that someone had ripped from the side of Asbury United Methodist Church, a historic Black church in downtown Washington, and he and others <a>set it on fire</a>.</p>
<p>Within the FBI, many would draw the wrong lesson from that night — that the principal danger posed by Proud Boys or other extremist groups was street clashes. It would prove to be a grave miscalculation.</p>
<p>“Jan. 6 will be the MPD’s problem,” one federal law enforcement official said in December, referring to the D.C. police and echoing an oft-repeated and widely held belief within the FBI at the time.</p>
<p>As it turned out, much of the planning for Jan. 6 was preparation for the wrong kind of violence, in the wrong place.</p>
<h3><div>19 days to go</div></h3>
<p>By mid-December, the <a>electoral college</a> had met and formalized Biden’s victory. Trump had just one more move: disrupting Congress’s count of the votes on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The exhortation, more than almost any other words or action by Trump after the election, seemed to electrify his most devoted followers in chat groups and<a> websites like TheDonald.win</a>. Some took it as an order.</p>
<p>Among the messages the informant flagged from a MeWe chat group for members of the self-styled militia:</p>
<div><div><p>Here, in a short, simple government form, was a warning about a threat identifying a potential place, period of time and a specific target: a senator from Utah.</p><div>20</div></div></div>
<p>Of the combined tips, an FBI official wrote: “None of these sites have specifics on what they’re going to do once they overturn the DC police. These sites are wanting to do this ‘because it will stop the steal.’ ”</p>
<p>By Tuesday morning, Dec. 22 – less than 48 hours after the first call was recorded in the FBI’s system — the threat assessment was closed, marked at the top: “Does not warrant further investigation at this time.”</p>
<p>Romney’s office could not locate a record that it had been alerted about the tip. An FBI official noted that the tip was shared with the Capitol Police.</p>
<b> </b>fundraising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which
<a>sent robocalls</a> urging people to go to D.C. for the day’s events.
<div><div><p>Stop the Steal also secured permitted space for a rally on the east side of the Capitol on Jan. 6. The organization had applied under a different name.</p><div>23</div></div></div>
<p>On extremist chat groups, Brookie, Holt and McCord saw a new tone of desperation take hold. Trump supporters were going further than before — talking about being citizen soldiers who might have to die for their cause.</p>
<p>Holt focused on the explicit talk of violence, writing in his report that Oath Keepers were “ramping up” pressure on their peers to join them in settling the election by force, “preferably with guns.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is going to happen unless we MAKE it happen,” began an exchange he highlighted in the report, which was passed along to the FBI.</p>
<p>“How much more of this s--- do you need to see … There is only one way. It’s not signs. It’s not rallies. It’s f---ing bullets!” read the post from a person identifying as an Oath Keeper.</p>
<p>Holt and Brookie soon spotted a shift from threats to planning.</p>
<p>At the White House, Pence began telling advisers that he knew he was in the crosshairs — Trump would expect him to act.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the White House chief of staff was also spurring on a looming confrontation between Trump and his vice president.</p>
<h3><div>16 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Still, D.C. officials relied on it for intelligence, and Harvin assigned an analyst to each new permitted protest that might turn violent and tasked them with gaming out whether the city would be able to handle it.</p>
<p>The Jan. 6 assignment went to the office’s most junior analyst, who quickly became<b> </b>spooked about what he saw. Almost daily, he brought Harvin disturbing new posts found online.</p>
<div><div><p>Extremists from different parts of the country were now coordinating logistics. They were mobilizing an informal army, exchanging tips about how to smuggle weapons into D.C., where to meet, what to wear, he noted.</p><div>28</div></div></div>
<b> </b>Someone could plant an improvised explosive device near the Capitol,
<b> </b>he said. With law enforcement distracted, extremists might then band together and attack government buildings, maybe even the Capitol.
<p>Even as the meeting went on, Trump returned to Twitter and further egged on his supporters:</p>
<p>[Tune into a special Washington Post Live conversation with Donell Harvin and Clint Hickman on Nov. 2]</p>
<p>For their part, Pentagon leaders were not looking for a role in Jan. 6 security.</p>
<h3><div>7 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The shutdown had been months in the making. The bureau advertised in early 2020 that it wanted to sign a new contract for “social media alerting,” describing the service as “mission-critical.”</p>
<p>Donohue was especially worried by the volume of well-known white-supremacist groups whose members said they planned to come, as well as a sense among them that they had the approval of, if not a direct order from, the president of the United States.</p>
<p>All the while, Trump was keeping the pressure up, seeking a soft spot in the system.</p>
<div><div><p>“We have the full support of Trump and Giuliani,” she added.</p><div>34</div></div></div>
<b> </b>It was from a man who said he was an operator at the White House switchboard, calling to inform Hickman that the president wanted to speak to him.
<div><div><p>Now — after midnight in Washington — the president appeared to want to talk to the Maricopa County chairman.</p><div>35</div></div></div>
<p>Hickman again did not respond: “My mom always warned me nothing good happens after midnight.”</p>
<h3><div>6 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Hodgkins put his blue Trump tights on for a New Year’s Eve party.</p>
<p>“As it got closer to Jan. 6, the people I talked to said it was important,” Hodgkins said. “That it was going to be a historical event, maybe the biggest political turnout ever in Washington.”</p>
<div><p>By New Year’s, Sandlin was in touch with around a dozen other Trump supporters making similar plans, including a 34-year-old Idaho man named Josiah Colt and a 31-year-old Las Vegas resident named Nathaniel DeGrave.</p><div>36</div></div>
<div><div><p>Other ominous messages were posted on Parler, which had recently begun communicating with the FBI after its attorneys had decided some posts were so threatening that they required law enforcement notification.</p><div>37</div></div></div>
<b> </b>informant in the Midwest characterized the talk among members of self-proclaimed militias as heavy on planning to travel to D.C., and said the tone had become significantly more “anti-law enforcement.”
<p>“Broad claims and online chatter often lack specificity or detail about concrete plans and participants and, therefore, are not susceptible to disruption,” said an FBI official.</p>
<h3><div>3 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Miller, the acting defense secretary, couldn’t believe the Justice Department wasn’t more concerned.</p>
<p>In the hours that followed, Rosen and the upper tier of the Justice Department would vow to resign should the president push forward with installing Clark.</p>
<p>Still, Clark encouraged Trump. “Mr. President, we can do this,” he told Trump. “We can get it done. History is calling.”</p>
<p>After a three-hour standoff, Trump dropped the idea as unworkable, leaving only one person left who could help him set aside the election and retain the White House: Pence.</p>
<p>Unaware of the high-stakes moment playing out at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, officials at the Capitol were reaching their own fire-alarm moment.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam, of the Capitol Police, were sweating the final intelligence assessment for Jan. 6.</p>
<p>For weeks, their analysts had catalogued comments on TheDonald.win and other sites in which Trump supporters had discussed confronting members of Congress and police.</p>
<div><div><p>“Anyone going armed needs to be mentally prepared to draw down on” law enforcement officers, read a post highlighted back in a Dec. 21 internal report.</p><div>40</div></div></div>
<p>It had been a day after that when the FBI told Capitol Police it wasn’t investigating similar threats about overrunning police and arresting lawmakers.</p>

<p>It seemed a menacing signal: Angry people knew where the two leaders lived and were willing to break the law to get their message across. The number of officers assigned to each leader was increased, and the details were issued assault weapons.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam made a grim prediction in their final internal report: Jan. 6 would be far more dangerous to the Capitol and its occupants than the pro-Trump rallies in November and December.</p>
<p>Sund agreed not to press for a deployment — unaware of the new threat assessment being prepared by his own intelligence unit that very day.</p>
<h3><div>2 days to go</div></h3>
<div><div><p>David Bowdich, the No. 2 official at the FBI, heard him out but did not sound concerned. Don’t worry, he told the senator, the FBI was on top of it.</p><div>43</div></div></div>
<p>That day, the National Park Service allowed the number of people expected under a permit filed for the rally at the Ellipse to balloon from 5,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Trump kept hyping the event.</p>
<p>In short, Sena wrote in an email to all 80 fusion centers, “a significant number of individuals plan to or are advocating for others to travel to Washington, DC to engage in civil unrest and violence.”</p>
<b> </b>surprised that the chief wasn’t on the call. But even for those on the call, many didn’t hear a major shift in Donohue’s risk forecast or fresh cause for alarm.
<p>It was part of a pattern of miscommunication, poor planning and sloppiness inside the department that left Capitol Police completely ill-equipped for what was to come.</p>
<p>Over at the Pentagon, officials remained worried about the level of preparedness.</p>
<p>Eastman’s allies, including Giuliani and former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, were huddled blocks away in a makeshift war room at the Willard Hotel, conferring about how to<b> </b>put the plan into motion.</p>
<b> </b>believed his legal theory would clear a path for Pence to overturn the election results, Eastman admitted that he thought it probably wouldn’t work. Furious, Cipollone exploded, berating the lawyer.
<b> </b>on his plan to disrupt the electoral college count. Eastman said that it was an “open question” whether Pence had the ability to unilaterally decide which votes to count.
<p>“You heard him say that, right?” Pence said to the president. Trump did not seem to be paying attention.</p>
<p>The vice president said the law seemed to leave him no choice but to preside over the formalization of Biden’s victory. But, Pence assured the president, he was still willing to read any materials on the topic that Trump wanted him to see.</p>
<h3><div>38 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>On Jan. 5, Hodgkins got off work in Tampa around 12:30 a.m. He’d slept only a couple of hours when he got up, collected his bag and a red Trump flag on a pole, and left for the bus terminal in Sarasota.</p>
<p>His spirits were tempered by a text from his mother, accusing him of being blind to reality.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, in Des Moines, Douglas Jensen prepared to go, too.</p>
<p>As Trump’s supporters converged on Washington, his allies anticipated the unrest that would follow. “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,” Bannon told listeners of his podcast on Jan. 5.</p>
<p>Across the city, officials charged with the nation’s security had wildly different expectations about what the next day would bring.</p>
<p>Miller also packed a gym bag with an extra set of clothes to bring to the Pentagon, on the off chance the situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>At Justice, Rosen told much of his staff they could work from home, reflecting a general sense of unease about possible traffic disruptions and disorder, but no serious concern that democracy itself could be at risk.</p>
<p>All day, a crowd kept growing blocks from the White House, where Trump surrogates took turns at a microphone declaring the election results were about to be overturned.</p>

<p>The report noted people had shared maps of tunnels underneath Congress, and planned rendezvous spots in the eastern part of the United States to travel together to Washington.</p>
<div><div><p>To some inside the FBI, that cautionary language was a telling example of how the bureau tempered its reaction to threats of violence from White, middle-aged and middle-class Americans.</p><div>52</div></div></div>
<p>While the memo was shared widely at low levels of various agencies, it was not flagged to the leadership of law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Outside the FBI, the bureau’s handling of the report sent the message that it was not particularly concerned.</p>
<h3><div>18 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Inside the Oval Office on the evening of Jan. 5, the Colonnade door swung open, filling the room with the frigid night air, but also the sound of the president’s supporters, gathered a couple blocks away.</p>
<p>Still, the president did not seem deflated after Pence’s departure.</p>
<p>Scavino, perched in a chair by the crackling fireplace, read it back:</p>
<p>Trump was getting warmed up. He and Scavino workshopped a second tweet:</p>
<p>The crowd outside suddenly roared loudly. “They’re fired up. They’re fired up,” Trump said. The president looked at Scavino: He didn’t want violence the next day, he said.</p>
<p>Soon a third tweet finished his thought:</p>
<p>For nine weeks, the coda to Trump’s presidency had blared like a siren song. His false claims of election fraud had lured followers to act on their worst instincts. A wave of them had come to Washington, and more were on the way.</p>
<p>Trump turned to an aide and asked what he thought the crowd wanted to hear at the next day’s rally. The aide suggested Trump should highlight all of his accomplishments. “I mean, you’ve had an incredible four years,” he said.</p>
<p>“No, no,” Trump interrupted. “These people are upset. They’re angry.”</p>

<div><div><p>Apollo, of Poway, Calif., was arrested and booked into the Orange County jail Thursday on suspicion of battery and resisting arrest, according to police. He was released on bail Friday, records show.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We know the case is now in the hands of the District Attorney’s office and we hope it proceeds in enforcing the full extent of the law,” Rossel said in a statement.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>After Apollo walked into the clinic without a mask before 10 a.m., workers asked him to put a mask on, according to police. When Apollo refused, he was asked to leave.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“He said, ‘I don’t need a mask, I don’t have the virus, and you are the ones making people sick,’ ” Jahanbani, 37, told the Register. “And just every type of profanity you can imagine.”</p></div>
<div><p>At one point, Apollo pinned down the medical assistant, who declined to be publicly identified in local media, and landed “a few pretty strong punches” to the official’s head, chest and back, Jahanbani told the Times.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It was one of my biggest fears coming true,” Jahanbani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was shouting, ‘You’re a part of this, too!’ at the officers,” Jahanbani told the outlet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Families Together said it was “extremely saddened” by the attack but that nothing would stop its workers from administering vaccine doses to people who want them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re proud of the strength and bravery of our team, and while this incident has shaken us, we will not be deterred from our mission to keep our community safe and healthy,” the group wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jahanbani told the Register that he was ready to forgive Apollo for the attack — and hopes he understands why vaccination is necessary to help stop the spread of the virus.</p></div></div>
<p>“This isn’t a man-made problem,” Jahanbani said. “It’s happening to humanity, and we all have to unite together against it. We all want things to go back to normal, and that’s why we’re doing this.”</p>

<div> <div> <h3>Why even Grinches get warm fuzzies from old holiday songs</h3> </div> </div>
<p> What is going on here? The answer is nostalgia, said literally every person contacted for this story.</p>
<div> <h4>Only three of the most popular 20 holiday songs were released this century, and all are covers of much older songs</h4> </div>
<div> <p>Pentatonix’s cover of “Hallelujah” is the newest song on the list, having been released in 2016.</p> </div>
<div> <p>The oldest song on this list, Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas,” was released in 1942.</p> </div>
<p> Holiday music burrows into a sweet spot in our brains’ wiring, said Brian Rabinovitz, a lecturer at the College of William Mary whose expertise is the neuroscience of music.</p>
<div> <div> <h3>So how does a new song break in?</h3> </div> </div>
<p>But getting into that rare air is hugely profitable, so artists keep trying, and every decade or so, someone succeeds.</p>
<p>John Lennon and Yoko Ono did it with their 1971 duet “Happy Xmas (War Is Over).” So did Paul McCartney’s 1979 song “Wonderful Christmastime” and Wham!’s “Last Christmas,” which debuted in 1984. </p>
<p> And sitting pretty in a red elf suit atop them all is Mariah Carey’s 1994 blockbuster, “All I Want for Christmas Is You” (AIWFCIY for short).</p>

<p> Songs that make the top of the list tend to have certain similarities.</p>
<div> <h4>Holiday song lyrics share a few common themes</h4> <p>Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” includes multiple lyric themes found in the most popular holiday songs. Some examples:</p> </div>
<div> <p>Peace on</p> <p>Earth</p> </div>
<div> <p>Instrumental</p> </div>
<div> <p><i>“Make my wish come true</i></p> <p><i>Baby all I want for Christmas is you”</i></p> </div>
<div> <p><i>“Santa won't you bring me</i></p> <p><i>The one I really need”</i></p> </div>
<div> <p><i>“I don't care about the presents</i></p> <p><i>Underneath the Christmas tree”</i></p> </div>
<div> <p><i>“I won't ask for much this Christmas</i></p> <p><i>I won't even wish for snow”</i></p> </div>
<div> <p>Peace on Earth</p> </div>

<div> <div> <h3>The deal with covers (a.k.a. your brain on Michael Bublé)</h3> </div> </div>
<p> Of the 20 songs that dominate Billboard’s list, many are covers. Because we are enamored with the old stuff, it’s not surprising that the canon is littered with newer versions of classics.</p>

<p>Rabinovitz provided a neurological explanation for why we like covers: They meet our expectations.</p>
<p>It works the same with music, Rabinovitz said. “You can have your prediction violated but find it wonderful.” </p>

<p> This is why cover artists tinker a little but don’t usually stray wildly from the original arrangements.</p>
<p>The original “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” was recorded by Judy Garland in 1944. That version appears in the Holiday 100 along with eight different covers from 2011-2019. </p>

<div> <div> <h3>Hippos, donkeys, menorahs and death by reindeer</h3> </div> </div>
<p> Just like there is a canon for traditional holiday songs, there’s a canon of sorts for novelty songs, which are too goofball-niche to enter the Serious Traditional Canon but are also too much fun to not play every year.</p>
<p>For example, “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,” recorded in a startlingly Ethel-Merman-like voice by 10-year-old Gayla Peevey in 1953, has a clever conceit: a child making an unreasonable demand.</p>
<p>“It gives you that charming feeling of what a nice idea,” said Bennett, “but it’s not a universal sentiment.”</p>
<p> Elmo Patsy’s 1979 tale of a Christmas Eve tragedy, “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,” is a bit too twisted to jibe with many people’s idea of the Christmas spirit.</p>
<p>Ah, but once in a while, a supposed “novelty song” turns out to be universal after all.</p>
<p>The vanilla theme, the peppy beat, the endless repetition and the easy-to-remember lyrics make a powerful combination — and it doesn’t hurt that the triangle and maracas together sound a lot like sleigh bells. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>These are the voices you’ll hear the most</h3> </div> </div>
<p> These artists have had the most songs appear at least once on Billboard’s Holiday 100. The a cappella group Pentatonix has had 16 songs appear, one more even than Bublé. Below is how each artist’s top songs ranked over time. </p>
<div> <p>16 songs, with their top 3: </p> </div>
<div> <p>“Hallelujah”</p> </div>
<div> <p>“Little Drummer Boy”</p> </div>
