<h1> The Biggest Myths About ADHD </h1>
<h2> Understanding ADHD better by unraveling some of its myths. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is ADHD? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to help with ADHD</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Many people have heard of <a>Attention</a>-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (<a>ADHD</a>), but they often misunderstand the condition due to the myths that surround it.</p>
<p>A common belief is that ADHD is not that bad of a problem, and so society and funding sources should not make it a high priority. This myth really has three parts:</p>
<li>ADHD is not real (“bogus”). </li>
<li>Even if it is real, ADHD is not a very serious condition (“Cancer kills you; ADHD just distracts you.”). </li>
<li>Even if it is real and serious, “we have a treatment for it, so let’s move on.” </li>
<p>2. Is ADHD very serious?</p>
<a>depression</a>, although this might be questionable in many cases.

<a>comorbid</a> disorder, a 25-fold increased chance of early death. It is also associated with significantly reduced lifetime earnings, increased serious physical injury, and increased chances of
<a>suicide</a>. All of these indicate it is very serious indeed!
<p>3. Do we have a treatment for it?</p>
<p>Despite some understandable confusion, the bottom line is clear: ADHD reflects all-too-real problems of a serious nature that are difficult to overcome. ADHD is a priority for medical and psychological research.</p>

<h1> Why Your Dignity Is So Vulnerable Today </h1>
<h2> Helping destroy someone else's reputation has social benefits and costs. </h2>
<li>Current trends in media and social media have increased reputational risk, even for the average citizen.</li>
<li>Being misrepresented, humiliated, or exploited in the media is a violation of personal dignity. </li>
<li>Public punishments were outlawed in the late-18th century, but the digital age has fueled public shaming for entertainment and personal gain.</li>
<li>Treating people (even those in the media or on the internet) as if they are human beings that matter reduces the impact of this trend.</li>
<p>In today’s media-saturated world, media organizations need to continually fill their production pipelines with content. Unfortunately, too often these stories involve the destruction of someone’s reputation.</p>

<h2> What is the best way to help a child manage anxiety? </h2>
<p>• Listen to concerns; don’t dismiss children’s feelings. Just feeling heard is comforting.</p>
<p>• Limit children’s exposure to news of disasters and catastrophic events. Eventually children will develop the cognitive capacity to handle such information, but constant replay magnifies the sense of threat.</p>
<p>• Allow time for relationships. Anxiety results when children do not feel safe. Relationships of all kinds—with parents, with other family members, with peers, with teachers—are natural antidotes to anxiety.</p>
<p>• Offer specific skills for dissipating the discomfort anxiety creates. Teach kids deep breathing, which subdues the nerves of alarm. </p>
<p>• Help your children face the discomfort of anxiety to know that it won’t destroy them, rather than allowing them to avoid situations that give rise to worry. . </p>
<p>• Keep your own anxieties to yourself. Do not share them with your children. </p>
