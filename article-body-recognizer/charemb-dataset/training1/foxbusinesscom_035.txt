<h1>Airlines hit hard by cancellations again Monday, as COVID staffing issues threaten to bleed into new year</h1>
<h2>The holiday travel season is ending, but omicron COVID wave might not be</h2>
<h2>Dr. Makary: 'We need a selective testing policy'</h2>
<p>Fox News Medical Contributor Dr. Marty Makary on the low supply of COVID testing amidst omicron variant surge and the need for public health officials to acknowledge natural immunity</p>
<a>airlines</a> are struggling with a flood of
<a>COVID-related</a> cancellations yet again Monday as the omicron variant causes staffing shortages – and it's not clear the issues will completely clear up after the holiday
<p>According to FlightAware, there were more than 1,100 flights canceled in the United States as of just before 3 p.m. Monday. The airline hit the hardest was SkyWest, which runs regional flights for Delta, United and American Airlines, among others. </p>

<p>MORE THAN 2 MILLION AMERICANS FLEW THROUGH US AIRPORTS SUNDAY DESPITE CANCELED FLIGHTS, OMICRON FEARS</p>
<p>Other airlines hit hard are Alaska Airlines with 141 cancellations, American Airlines with 86, United with 94 and Delta with 81, all according to FlightAware. </p>
<p>Delta, which over the weekend was one of the airlines hardest hit by cancellations, told FOX Business that it could be seeing an improvement over the 375 flights it canceled on Christmas Day. </p>

<p>STOCK FUTURES EDGE HIGHER AFTER CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY</p>
<p>As of 2:00 p.m. Monday, Delta canceled 81 flights – more than it predicted but still far fewer than it canceled over the weekend. </p>
<p>United Airlines did not reply to a request for comment from FOX Business Monday. But Saturday it blamed the omicron variant for its many cancellations and did not respond to a question about when it will get back to full operation. </p>

<p>Major airlines run thousands of flights per day, meaning that the majority of flights are landing on time. But the thousands of cancellations are still throwing into jeopardy tens of thousands of peoples' holiday plans. </p>
<p>And because the omicron surge is showing no signs of abating, it's not clear the airlines' staffing and cancellation issues will clear up once the calendar changes to 2022 and the holiday travel season dies down. </p>

<p>Although <a>Federal Student Aid (FSA)</a> has been communicating with student loan borrowers who will be impacted, it adds another layer of confusion for those who will begin making payments to a new loan servicer.</p>

<h2>Letter calls for Biden to cancel student loan debt ‘without delay’</h2>
<p>Although extending the student loan payment pause would provide a temporary fix, the letter also calls for a more "comprehensive solution:" student loan forgiveness.</p>
<a>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.) has also said that student loan forgiveness must "be an act of Congress." However, passing such legislation would be challenging amid pushback from Republicans and moderate Democrats.

<h1>Roy Blunt won't run for re-election as Missouri senator becomes latest GOP incumbent to retire</h1>
<h2>Blunt becomes the fifth Republican senator to retire rather than run for re-election in 2022</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>Missouri Republican <a>Sen. Roy Blunt </a>announced Monday plans to retire from <a>the Senate</a>, saying he will not run for re-election <a>in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Blunt made the announcement in a video posted on YouTube.</p>
<p><a>SHELBY THE LATEST OF THE 'OLD GUARD' SENATE REPUBLICANS TO ANNOUNCE RETIREMENT</a></p>
<p>The 71-year old Blunt, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said that he will finish out his current term, which runs through the end of next year.</p>
<p>He becomes the fifth Republican senator to retire rather than run for re-election in 2022, as the GOP tries won win back the Senate majority it just lost in the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p>Two other Senate Republicans are also mulling retirements: 87-year old Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.</p>
<p><a>NRSC CHAIR SCOTT SAYS DEMOCRATS' 'OVERREACH' WILL HELP GOP RECLAIM SENATE IN 2022</a></p>
<p>Missouri was once a competitive state, but has trended Republican in recent decades.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton in 1996 was the last Democrat to win the state in the race for the White House, and then-Sen. Claire McCaskill’s 2012 victory was the last time a Democrat won a Senate election in the state.</p>
<p>Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee executive director Christie Roberts charged that "Senate Republicans have a retirement problem."</p>
<p>And the pro-Democrat outside group American Bridge argued that Blunt's retirement announcement "is yet another sign that Republicans are running scared from a resurging Democratic Party with the winds at our backs."</p>

<div><div><h2>At-home COVID test company ramps up production ‘on all fronts’: Intrivo Co-CEO</h2> <p>Intrivo co-CEO Ron Gutman says their at-home COVID tests are available online and at select retailers.</p></div></div>
<p>One U.S.-based <a>healthcare</a> company is ramping up production of its at-home <a>COVID-19</a> tests as cases of the <a>omicron variant</a> surge across the country.</p>
<p>Intrivo co-CEO Ron Gutman said the company’s working to distribute millions more of their 10-minute rapid tests to meet increased demand in an exclusive interview on "<a>Mornings with Maria</a>" Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are ramping up production to keep Americans safe," Gutman told FOX Business’ <a>Cheryl Casone</a>. "When other people ramp down production and close factories, we actually increased it, doubled down with <a>technology</a>."</p>
<p>Starting today, Intrivo is offering their <a>"On/Go" COVID-19 tests</a>, which are FDA authorized and designed to be taken ahead of gatherings.</p>
