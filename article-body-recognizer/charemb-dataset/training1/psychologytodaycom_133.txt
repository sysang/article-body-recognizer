<h2> How a Crisis Can Create New Possibilities for Healing </h2>
<p>For nearly everyone, a world suddenly turned upside down forces the need for rapid problem-solving and the forging of new relationships, life patterns, and perspectives on ways of doing nearly everything.</p>
<div> <h3> How can I recognize the opportunities hidden in this crisis? </h3> </div>
<a>Responding to the crisis as a challenge</a> to be mastered can lead to the enhancement of capabilities and
<a>confidence</a> that psychologists observe as
<div> <h3> How can the social deprivation required to slow the epidemic help people emotionally? </h3> </div>
<a>perfectionists</a>, permission to reset expectations of themselves. Studies show that for others, the
<a>lack of many everyday distractions</a> opens the door to learning how to tolerate negative emotions; such
<a>self-regulation</a> is considered one of the most important life skills.
<div> <h3> How has the coronavirus crisis affected people like narcissists, who demand to be in control? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The very nature of the epidemic has removed the possibility of control, a goal that is always elusive but nevertheless pursued by many, usually <a>at high psychic cost </a>to themselves and others around them.</p> </div> </div>
<h2> Remote Therapy: Moving to Phone and Video Sessions </h2>
<div> <h3> How do I make the most of remote therapy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> My therapist won’t continue therapy remotely. What should I do? </h3> </div>
<a>many other therapists</a> offer remote sessions. If you don’t want to see a new therapist, you can ask your therapist about books, online resources, and activities that can help until your next session.
<div> <h3> Is remote therapy as effective as in-person therapy? </h3> </div>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy
<a>was equally successful</a> in treating depression when administered by phone or face-to-face, and fewer people discontinued therapy over time.
<p>To maximize social distancing, more and more companies are asking employees to work from home. In many locations, it is now required by law that nonessential workers stay home, meaning that those who are able to work remotely must do so. </p>

<div> <h3> How do I learn to work virtually? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I improve my productivity during this time? </h3> </div>
<a>Experiment with different time management</a> and
<a>collaboration</a> strategies—such as planning out a weekly schedule or setting up a daily check-in with coworkers—to identify ways to become more productive. 
<div> <h3> How can I best manage my employees remotely? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I work when I’m anxious? </h3> </div>
<a>can be immensely challenging</a>. Remind yourself that feeling
<a>anxious</a> right now is normal. Limiting news exposure, practicing healthy habits, and being kind to yourself can soothe anxiety and help reset your focus.

<div> <h3> How could biases be shaping our view of coronavirus? </h3> </div>
<a>normalcy bias,</a> may be responsible for continued social congregation in spite of expert advice. For some, however,
<a>catastrophic thinking</a> could lead to going beyond recommended precautions or overreacting to signs of potential danger.

<a>instance of the bandwagon effect</a>. The
<a>urge to eliminate even small risks</a> (such as running out of toilet paper) may have contributed, too.
<div> <h3> What will convince people to stop the spread? </h3> </div>
<a>carefully and with clear solutions provided</a>. Some people—such as peers or familiar experts—may be
<a>more persuasive in these efforts</a> than others.
<div> <h3> How do I break the habit of touching my face? </h3> </div>
<a>Address those triggers</a> by keeping something in your hand to fidget with, such as a beaded bracelet, or by putting your hands between your legs to make touching your face more difficult.
<div> <h3> How can I boost my immune system? </h3> </div>
<div> <p><a>Keep your immune system strong</a> by getting plenty of sleep, exercise, and eating nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens and fruit. Stress <a>hormones</a> can tax the immune system, so soothing your stress can help as well.</p> </div>

<a>a nationally representative British sex survey</a> found that about 1 in 4 adults in relationships reported experiencing this issue in the past year alone. These discrepancies are also one of the most frequent reasons couples enter sex

<h1> 5 Ways Children’s Genes Shape their Behavior </h1>
<h2> Understanding the role of kids’ genes can help us parent more effectively. </h2>
<li>Parents care a lot about their children’s behavior, but they often ignore one of the biggest things shaping it: their genes.</li>
<li>Genes influence how childrens' brains develop, how others respond to them, and how they choose and respond to their environments.</li>
<li>Understanding how children’s genes shape their behavior can help parents allow them to become the best version of themselves.</li>
<h3>1. Genes influence the way children’s brains get wired during development.</h3>

<a>risk-taking</a> children climb to the top of tall trees and jump off the playground equipment. Risk-taking adolescents hang out at concerts and bars. Children who are more
<a>anxious</a> or introverted prefer to spend more time at home or in small group activities. Children’s genes influence their development in part by influencing the environments they select.

<h1> 3 Resolutions to Combat the "Great Resignation" </h1>

<li>The labor market remains unsettled, and employees are quitting jobs at record rates.</li>
<li>Employees are more committed and engaged when they work for managers who trust them.</li>
<li>In contrast to transactional psychological contracts, covenantal relationships increase employee loyalty.</li>
<li>Managers should look for ways to reduce employee loneliness, which has only increased during the pandemic.</li>
<a>record high rates</a>, and many employees are retiring early, starting small businesses, or moving on to organizations that offer more flexibility, more meaningful work, or more equitable pay and benefits.
<p>Here are three resolutions worth considering:</p>

<a>article</a> in The Wall Street Journal noted that when Tiffany Co. called corporate employees back to its headquarters, their badge swipes were monitored to ensure that employees were in compliance (and to investigate further if they were not).
<a>aware and understand</a> the need for surveillance, such practices can undermine perceptions of fairness and trust.
<h3>2. Develop Covenantal Relationships.</h3>
<a>Research</a> has shown that workers are more likely to perceive a covenantal relationship with their organization when they have meaningful and satisfying work; are given autonomy and regular feedback; and believe their organization values quality,
<a>cooperation</a>, and employee participation.
<h3>3. Reduce Workplace Loneliness.</h3>
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy had described
<a>loneliness</a> as an epidemic, with important implications for the

<a>found</a> that loneliness adversely affects physical and mental health, but it also
<a>indicates</a> that lonelier employees find it difficult to connect with their colleagues and their organization, which results in lower job performance.

<p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness with no known cure that often runs in families, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Symptoms include issues thinking clearly, managing emotions, making decisions, and relating to others.</p>
<h3>Exploring the dark genome</h3>
<a>genes</a>. In this study, the researchers refer to this area of the genome as novel Open Reading Frames or nORFs.
<a>Genome Research</a> in 2021, the scientists demonstrated that proteins encoded by the dark genome are involved in the processes of 22 types of cancers and 150 rare diseases.
<p>In this study, the researchers hypothesize that the dark genome may play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. To narrow the search, the researchers focused on transposable elements (TEs) and human accelerated regions (HARs).</p>
<a>NIH </a>blog post written by Dr. Francis Collins, an American physician-geneticist and former NIH director who was not part of the current study.
<p>Based upon their findings, the researchers suggest that the dark genome is an area to analyze within disease systems that may lead to new drug targets for medical diagnostics and treatments in the future.</p>

<h1> It Might Just Be the Time to Try Some Positivity </h1>
<h2> New research shows what you can gain from putting a positive spin on your life. </h2>
<li>During stressful times, it's difficult to maintain an upbeat attitude about the world and even yourself.</li>
<li>New research shows that even one positive person in a group can help make everyone else feel better.</li>
<li>To boost your own positivity, try recalling positive past events and learning from the people you know who focus on the bright side.</li>
<p>Before becoming completely discouraged, however, it might help to know that your negativity doesn’t have to assume permanent proportions. You were happy once—can you be happy again? And if so, how can you jump-start the process?</p>
<h3>Positivity and the Conservation of Resources Model</h3>
<h3>Testing the COR-Positivity Model</h3>
<a>productivity</a>. This model could, however, also apply to the infinite number of interactions you experience outside the workplace, as conflict is almost a universal phenomenon in any collection of people.
<a>stressful</a> in general. However, even people low in positivity can feel better about the group’s interactions as long as the others in the group themselves seem to be looking at the bright side.
<h3>What to Do If You’re Not a Positive Person</h3>
<p>The authors of the study suggest a number of practical implications of their findings. Again, although these findings apply to a work setting, they would appear to have more general applicability.</p>
<a>optimistic</a> outlook toward the future. Your own positivity can be lifted, in line with the COR model, when that of your group is boosted as well.
<a>self-efficacy</a>,” as Theodorou et al. suggest, think about the times that you’ve handled stress well. Although you’re discouraged now, what were you able to accomplish the last time things seemed bleak?
<p>To sum up, positivity is a quality you can nurture. Allowing others to build you up while you build your own <a>self-confidence</a> and sense of optimism can provide the resources you need to find fulfillment even in difficult times.</p>

<h1> Why Misinformation Is Appealing </h1>
<h2> People often prefer certainty over the truth. </h2>
<li>Belief in misinformation can persist even after it has been corrected, especially when the misinformation (falsely) explains the event's cause.</li>
<li>Corrections of misinformation can make people feel uncomfortable, which motivates them to disregard the correcting information.</li>
<li>When discomfort is interpreted positively, it makes people more accepting of the correction and leads to reductions in misinformation belief.</li>

<h1> 6 Reasons People Regret Ending Relationships Too Soon </h1>
<h2> The most common reasons people leave relationships too soon. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: PhotoMediaGroup/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>1. <a>Fear</a> of Commitment</p>
<p>If one partner feels that the other wants a commitment and isn’t ready, he or she will sense that desire as a potential trap. Feeling locked into a relationship that might lose its allure feels too scary.</p>
<a>attraction</a>, most people pull back their energy and resources. The fear of commitment will logically become a fear of entrapment when relationships stop evolving and regenerating.
<p>2. Lack of Readiness for a Long-Term Relationship</p>
<a>wise</a> or experienced enough to promise a future they cannot foresee. They don’t know themselves deeply enough to predict what they might want someday, and are not ready to stop exploring other alternatives that might be better.
<a>dreams</a> for the future, they require that both partners maintain their devotion and continue to regenerate their love.
<p>When people want that security, but cannot give up their freedom, they must ultimately make a choice. They may leave relationships that feel wonderfully satisfying, but anticipate they will need to move on someday.</p>
<p>3. Going Back to an Unfinished Relationship</p>
<p>4. Lack of Faith in Successful Long-Term Relationships</p>
<a>friendship</a> and commitment, they begin to focus on what isn’t going right.
<a>unconscious</a> mind tells them continuously that all relationships are eventually doomed, and they begin to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<p>5. Choosing Easy Over Challenge</p>
<a>attention</a>. As boredom increases, many partners will seek novelty and excitement outside the relationship. The couple begins to spend less time and energy on the relationship, and the distance between them increases.
<p>6. Lacking the Skills to Transform Romantic Feelings to Deeper Love</p>
<a>Heroic Love</a>, shows you how to avoid the common pitfalls that keep people from finding and keeping
<a>romantic love</a>. Based on over 100,000 face-to-face hours counseling singles and couples over her 40-year
<a>career</a>, you’ll learn how to zero in on the right partner, avoid the dreaded “honeymoon is over” phenomenon, and make sure your relationship never gets boring.

<h1> Ten Crucial Behaviors That Nurture Intimacy </h1>
<h2> These vital behaviors form the crux of sustaining and regenerating love. </h2>
<p> Posted October 15, 2018 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Many committed couples come into <a>therapy</a> concerned that the magic of their early love is waning, and wanting to know what they can do to reignite it. </p>
<a>self-help</a> books, and followed every piece of advice. Some have attended multiple relationship workshops or entered into their own personal therapeutic journeys. Others have tried trial separations,
<a>spiritual</a> guidance, or even significant lifestyle changes, doing whatever they could to work their way out of how they feel. Yet, they are still struggling.
<p>1. Living in the Heart and Mind of Your Partner</p>
<p>In relationships that continue to regenerate and thrive, both partners know that they are still representing the other in all they say and do, whether they are together or apart.</p>
<p>2. Keeping Private Knowledge in <a>Confidence</a></p>
<p>Both also know that they can tell one another vulnerable experiences from the present or from the past, without fearing that knowledge will ever be used against them by their partner or by an outside person.</p>
<h2>Relationships Essential Reads</h2>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How We Justify Staying in Problematic Relationships</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Why Patience Can Be Essential for Romantic Relationships</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>3. The Acceptance of Imperfections</p>
<p>Most people will begin to withhold <a>intimacy</a> over time if their partners express mockery, disdain, suspicion, <a>anxiety</a>, or <a>prejudice</a> when they reveal difficult or embarrassing mistakes.</p>
<p>In relationships that grow in intimacy, both partners know that they can always go to each other confident that their imperfections will be received without judgment.</p>
<a>fear</a> that they are incompatible. That relationship might have worked had the couple openly talked about those differences when their love was in abundance.
<p>Differences and discovery are intertwined characteristics of all truly intimate relationships. In order to take advantage of the excitement they provide, couples have to know how to welcome them and successfully weave them into their relationship.</p>
<p>5. Not Taking Anything for Granted</p>
<a>happiness</a> in all phases of life is wonder. When people feel wonder, they experience perspective and a sense of deep gratefulness to have each other. If intimate partners stop feeling that magic, they begin to lose that emotional
<a>gratitude</a> and start taking each other for granted.
<p>Intimate partners who always remember that their presence in each other’s lives is not a guarantee, and that great relationships are re-created anew every day, stay more tuned in to that realization and recommit each day they are together.</p>
<p>6. Courage in the Face of Threats to the Relationship</p>
<a>dreams</a>, or natural disasters can easily obliterate and deeply threaten the once-sturdy bond of even deeply committed partners.
<p>The pressures and demands of daily life can easily allow love relationships to forget the most important reasons they are together. Successful long-term partners keep those feelings close at hand.</p>
<p>When people are newly in love, they see each other as islands of safety, secure in knowing that they will find comfort and <a>forgiveness</a> if they are frightened or insecure.</p>
<p>People who know how to stay in love truly understand that no matter what they must face in their lives together, they can count on their partner to be fully present and available if that emotional red telephone call sounds a crisis of any kind.</p>
<p>In order for intimate partners to continue to remain havens of healing for each other, they must make certain that they protect those connections that keep that faith alive, ever-ready to be present and available whenever their partners need them. </p>
<p>9. Belief in the Other’s Inherent Value</p>
<p>Successful stay-in-love partners all share one irrefutable relationship quality: They irrevocably believe in each other’s basic goodness.</p>
<p>In many long-term relationships, that certainty may waver. If either partner feels they are on trial for their core worth, they will become defensive, pleading for their inherent value.</p>
<p>10. Recognizing That Love Is Not Ownership</p>
<a>jealousy</a>, competitiveness, or territoriality towards their partners, they are not thinking of what might be best for the other. All of those thoughts and behaviors are expressions of the same need: to control the availability of the other partner.
<p>It is both human and natural to want the security that the other partner will never abandon the relationship. But intimate partners who truly love one another do not allow those needs to take precedence if they entrap the other. </p>
<p>Coercion, threats, pleadings, or demands will not change those feelings, and they are likely to have a more deleterious effect. To love fully is to commit to the other partner’s well-being, even if it means letting them go.</p>
<p>That freedom within commitment is a wondrous combination and those who have achieved it know how rare it is. That understanding seems to bond them together, whether their relationship continues or ends. </p>
<a>attraction</a>, acceptance of the other partner’s foibles and fancies, and continued discovery and intrigue. But when these behaviors are practiced as an integral part of the relationship, all other mismatches or differences are easier to resolve.
<p>All of these behaviors are related, and they integrate and support the outcome as they meld. That means that as partners get better at each one of them, they automatically become better at the others as well.</p>

<h2> The Neuro Exam Step-by-Step </h2>
<p>These following nerves and functions are generally tested in such an exam:</p>
<a>olfactory</a> nerve for smell. Difficulties with any of these may indicate a neurological problem.
<p>For the sense of smell, test tubes are filled with common odors like cinnamon or coffee, which are placed under each nostril. You will be asked to identify the odors. </p>
<p>The neurologist will ask you to wrinkle your nose and bare your teeth to test your facial nerves. </p>
<p>Motor System and Coordination</p>
<p>Mobility, coordination, and fine motor skills are tested. With your eyes shut and arms outstretched, can your finger touch your nose? Can you button and unbutton your shirt? Can you spin around once, and in how many steps? </p>
<p>The neurologist may test your reflexes by tapping your knee with a hammer. </p>
<p>The physician may use soft fabric and a needle to gauge your ability to feel pain and touch. Also, can you feel warm or cold water? </p>
<p>Cognitive Function and <a>Memory</a></p>
<p>Autonomic <a>Nervous System</a></p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system controls your body's vital functions, such as your pulse, breathing, body temperature, and digestion. A neurological exam also includes questions about bowel movements, urination, and blood pressure. </p>

<div> <h3> What are neurological vital signs? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Vital signs include breathing patterns, oxygen level, heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. A person with compromised neurological function will have changes in these signs.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is neurological gait? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Gait, balance, and coordination are controlled by the cerebellum. Irregular movement may mean there is a problem, such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington's, or stroke.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are pupils and hearing examined? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is the EEG or EMG used? </h3> </div>
