<p>China says its new space station had to perform evasive maneuvers twice in four months to avoid satellites belonging to <a>SpaceX</a>'s <a>Starlink</a> project, according to a note Beijing sent to the <a>United Nations</a>.</p>
<a>launched</a> into orbit on April 29 and maintained a stable altitude of around 242 miles, said the note. On June 17, China launched
<a>Shenzhou 12</a>, its first crewed mission to the station and the country's longest manned mission to date, lasting until September 17.

<a>Communist Party</a> on July 1. The satellite had moved to an altitude of around 237 miles at the end of June, and Tianhe was forced to conduct an evasive maneuver "to avoid a potential collision between the two spacecraft," Beijing said.
<a>outpost</a> for more than 70 days and will surpass Shenzhou 12's mission length when they return to Earth in April 2022.
<p>Neither SpaceX nor its CEO, <a>Elon Musk</a>, has responded to the incident. Newsweek contacted the State Department for comment.</p>
<p>Communist Party newspaper the Global Times speculated that both near misses could have been deliberate attempts by SpaceX to test China's responses in space.</p>
<p>In addition to two Shenzhou missions this year, China also conducted Tianzhou 2 and 3 cargo launches in May and September, respectively. Shenzhou 14 and Tianzhou 4, as well as the launches of other space station modules, are scheduled for 2022.</p>
<p>SpaceX, meanwhile, has put nearly 1,900 satellites in low-Earth orbit since Musk's connectivity project began six years ago. The U.S. government-approved network is expected to number in the tens of thousands.</p>
