<p>PHILADELPHIA — Investigators are probing whether a 5-year-old child playing with a lighter may have sparked a house fire that killed a dozen people, including eight children, one of the worst blazes in the city’s recent history.</p>

<div><div><p>Until Monday, when a federal court is expected to end the diplomatic incident that has taken on circuslike theatrics, Djokovic must remain in the hotel.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tennis star Novak Djokovic draws renewed attention to Australia’s ‘detention hotels’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Monday’s hearing will be held one week before the tournament’s Jan. 17 start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic was detained at Melbourne’s airport overnight Wednesday as Australian border officials reviewed his visa and qualifications for a medical exemption to Australia’s strict covid vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was one of “a handful” among 26 applicants granted an exemption by Tennis Australia and the government of the state of Victoria to compete in the tournament.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rationale for Djokovic’s exemption, which was granted in consultation by medical authorities who reviewed applicants without knowing their identity, was a previous covid infection, <a>the Guardian reported</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Australia’s national standard for medical proof that a visitor to the country cannot be vaccinated, which is enforced at the border, is higher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has acknowledged contracting covid in summer 2020, after taking part in a short-lived exhibition he staged in Serbia and Croatia amid minimal precautions. It is unclear if he contracted covid more recently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With 20 Grand Slams and the men’s record-holder for weeks atop the world ranking, Djokovic, 34, is quite possibly the greatest to ever play tennis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two qualities in particular set the 6-2, 170-pound Djokovic apart:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A fanatical adherence to a strict gluten-free diet and a program of stretching and exercise that has transformed his otherwise unremarkable physique (much like Tom Brady) into a purpose-built, pliable winning machine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the foot speed, reach and flexibility to blast winners even if badly out of position, he covers virtually every inch of the court, sapping opponents’ will in the process.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And he has mastered the mental game, whether that means summoning his best when most players would be at their breaking point or breaking the momentum of unfavorable spells with a bathroom break or call for a trainer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>None of these attributes was bestowed. They are not gifts, but the product of relentless work.</p></div></div>
<p>Djokovic has been chasing tennis perfection since childhood — the past two decades, in the form of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, champions who are elder by five-plus years, in the case of Federer, and 11 months, in the case of Nadal.</p>
<div><div><p>But Djokovic has yet to close the gap in fans’ affection. He has been forever a third wheel in the sport’s love affair with Federer and Nadal.</p></div></div>
<a>straight-sets loss to Daniil Medvedev in the U.S. Open final</a> — Djokovic wept with a pathos that won hearts.
<div><p>Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. Now he’s becoming a punchline.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Afterward, he spoke unabashedly about what it meant to feel the crowd’s embrace.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>4:10 p.m. — Forecast is on track as snow spreads into West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Radar shows snow falling over most of Kentucky and West Virginia as the storm system sweeps eastward. The snow is still set to arrive in our area between around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., or maybe a little later in our eastern areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>

<a>frontogenesis</a> — essentially the formation of a cold front in the middle levels of the atmosphere.
<div><p>Long Island, Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts will probably see a few hours of heavy snow, with the Cape and Islands under the heaviest band for at least three or four hours while it pivots offshore on Friday afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Timing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Interstate 68 corridor in the Panhandle of Maryland could see snow as early as 8 p.m. Thursday. The snow will reach the D.C. to Baltimore stretch shortly after midnight.</p></div></div>
<p>Philadelphia should see snow around 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, reaching New York City and overspreading the Long Island Expressway around 5 a.m. From there it expands into southern New England, the heaviest coinciding with the time of the morning commute.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Totals</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The storm will continue out to sea over the weekend, explosively intensifying southeast of Greenland with an air pressure rivaling that of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.</p></div></div>

<b> </b>Global Health Security Index — a project of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a D.C.-based nonprofit global security group, and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health

<div><p>Although the emerging data is a cause for relief, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it is too early to draw conclusions and that more data and time is needed to have a complete picture of the risks and impact of the variant.</p></div>

<b> </b>Midway through this year, fatal police shootings are down compared with the same period last year. They have fluctuated month to month since the project began, ending near 1,000 annually.

<div> <p>Police shot and killed more than 1,000 people in 2020, more than any other year since The Post began tracking fatal shootings in 2015.</p> </div>
<p>American policing is not set up for across-the-board shifts, experts said, given that there are more than 15,000 local police and sheriff’s departments, each with its own policies, practices and training.</p>
<p>Police<b> </b>patrol a nation awash with firearms, and researchers have<b> </b>found higher rates of fatal shootings by officers in states where gun ownership is higher. Countries where police kill fewer people tend to have fewer guns.</p>
<p>In the United States,<b> </b>fatal shootings by police are both rare and constant. Tens of millions of people cross paths with police each year, and most of those encounters end without the use of force.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of those fatal shootings are lawful, righteous shootings,” said Daniel Oates, a former police chief in Miami Beach, Aurora, Colo., and Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
<b> </b>Still, Oates said that despite the fusillade of criticism, policing has improved significantly.
<b> </b>in any single year. The Post’s database, launched in 2015, has found more than double that number every year. The FBI’s
<b> </b>new program meant to fill the gaps is voluntary — and still incomplete.
<div><h3>Shielding the shooters</h3></div>
<b> </b>Despite a push since 2015 for police body cameras and the periodic emergence of surveillance footage or
<b> </b>bystander cellphone video, more than 80 percent of fatal police
<b> </b>shootings still were not filmed, according to The Post’s database.
<p>Some fatal shootings draw intense scrutiny of police actions that might otherwise escape notice. After Louisville police killed Breonna Taylor in March 2020, the uproar led to reforms.</p>
<b> </b>When police in Springfield, Ore., shot and killed a 32-year-old named Chase Brooks the day after Taylor was killed, his death
<b> </b>received little notice outside the area. “He’s not on the news every day like everybody else has been,” Karen Brooks said about her son.
<b> </b>public records laws or other restrictions in declining to release information, documents or footage after shootings. A Post investigation found that in 2015, departments withheld the names of officers in about 1 in 5 fatal shootings.
<b> </b>turning to the use of Marsy’s Law to shield their officers’ names. This law, which voters passed in 2018, says
<b> </b>has generated controversy. An investigation by ProPublica and USA Today last year found that sheriff’s offices there
<b> </b>routinely shielded the names of officers who “used force that resulted in a civilian’s injury.”
<p>These cases are stark examples of a pattern that experts say persists nationwide: After police kill someone, they also often shape what the public learns about the killing.</p>
<p>“They write the reports, they give the statements, and other people’s accounts are not taken seriously,” said Philip Stinson, a criminology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.</p>
<p>“But in most of these cases,” Stinson said, “police still own the narrative.”</p>
<div><h3>A disparity in deadly force</h3></div>
<p>Two weeks after Floyd was filmed gasping for air, an officer in Atlanta shot a 27-year-old Black man in the back, killing him during a confrontation at a Wendy’s restaurant.</p>
<b> </b>spurred a new wave of public anger, and the Atlanta police chief resigned.
<p>Since The Post began tracking cases, Black people have been shot and killed at higher rates than White people.</p>
<b> </b>— from fatal police shootings to physical encounters — for a dozen police departments and found stark racial disparities. The report found that the average
<b> </b>use-of-force rate for Black people was 2.5 times higher than the overall rate and 3.6 times the rate for White people.
<p>Racial disparities persist because they are part of the larger, systemic issues that play out in policing, said Justin Nix, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.</p>
<p>“We have very clear evidence that these disparities are real,” he said.</p>
<div> <p>The rate at which Black Americans are shot and killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for White Americans.</p> </div>
<div> <p>Higher rate of police killings</p> </div>
<div> <p>U.S. population</p> </div>
<p>But the debate about what role bias might play persists. “It’s much harder to parse out how much of that disparity is attributable to bias on the part of officers, whether it’s explicit or implicit,” Nix said.</p>
<p>Most of the people — 58 percent — shot and killed by police since 2015 were armed with guns, according to The Post’s database. And 15 percent were armed with knives, the database shows.</p>
<p>Research has revealed a link between fatal police shootings and how saturated a region is with guns. Nationwide, there are more than 700,000 local law enforcement officers, and experts say there could be between 300 million and 400 million guns.</p>
<b> </b>by firearm and an estimate of households where adults are thought to have guns. The higher the rate of gun ownership,
<div><h3>‘People who are in crisis’</h3></div>
<p>Year after year, numerous police shootings have followed two types of police-civilian encounters: reports of people in the throes of mental health crises and domestic violence.</p>
<b> </b>to a review by the Michigan attorney general’s office. His mother told a police negotiator that Gallegos was on medication for “many mental illnesses,” according to the review.
<p>After police coaxed him outside,<b> </b>Gallegos came with a shotgun and shot an officer in the leg, the review said. Six officers fired at Gallegos, killing him. The attorney general’s office said the officers acted lawfully.</p>
<p>“There was no opportunity to use de-escalation techniques,” an assistant attorney general wrote. “The officers had no choice but to fire to eliminate the threat.”</p>
<p>Domestic violence is another kind of crisis that police are often called to investigate. Since 2015, more than 1,000 people have been killed by police after calls about domestic disturbances.</p>
<p>In 2020, the first year of the pandemic, nearly 1 in 5 fatal shootings by police followed such calls, slightly up from the previous year and the most in any single year since The Post began tracking fatal police shootings.</p>
<p>On May 28, 2020, with the country gripped by unrest over policing in Minneapolis and beyond, officers in Ogden, Utah, responded to a 911 call from a woman who had fled her home, saying her husband had assaulted and threatened to kill her.</p>
<p>Two officers in Ogden, which is north of Salt Lake City, headed to the house, along with two state probation and parole<b> </b>agents who happened to be in the area.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old officer, holding a notebook and pen, turned to speak to another officer and Coleman shot him in the head, Allred wrote, killing him instantly.</p>
<p>Lyday “had no opportunity to react,” Allred concluded. The Ogden police chief said the officer was “felled by the forces of evil.” Other officers returned fire, and one of them shot Coleman in the head.</p>
<b> </b>to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. Since 2000, an average of six officers have been killed per year in these circumstances, according to the group’s data.
<b> </b>said Jacinta Gau, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida.
<b> </b>“When officers arrive on scene ... there’s so much anger.”
<p>Coleman’s wife, who asked not to be identified because of the trauma, said she had endured years of emotional abuse and controlling behavior that “spiraled out of control.”</p>
<p>She and their children feel no anger at police for shooting Coleman, something they told the officer who fired the fatal shot. “There was no other way to deal with the situation,” she said.</p>
<p>She said she feels only guilt about what happened that day.</p>
<p>“We just unleashed that on the world,” she said. “It was our problem, and we were taking care of it and holding it together, and it just, it spilled over.”</p>
<div><h3>‘He could’ve retreated’</h3></div>
<p>Hannah Fizer was driving to her overnight shift at a convenience store on June 13, 2020, when a sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in Sedalia, a small city in western Missouri.</p>
<p>Sokoloff said the deputy could have waited for the arrival of the backup he had called.</p>
<p>“He could’ve retreated. She wasn’t able to go any place. … He could’ve let things simmer a little bit down,” said Sokoloff, general counsel for the Missouri Office of Prosecution Services.</p>
<p>Sokoloff said Fizer could be heard over the deputy’s radio dispatch yelling at him and was seen in video footage bending down in her car and rising back up. No gun was found in her car.</p>
<b> </b>the New York City police announced plans to retrain their 36,000
<b> </b>officers to reduce the use of force.
<b> </b>since the beginning of 2015: More than 2,600
<b> </b>departments were involved in the more than 6,400 fatal shootings. In more than 1,600 of these shootings, it was the only time since 2015 an officer in a department had fatally shot someone.
<p>Ronald L. Davis, a former police chief and ex-director of the Justice Department’s Community Oriented Policing Services office, said the goal should be less use of deadly force overall, “not just unjustified uses of deadly force.”</p>
<b> </b> also “debunks the myth of police reform affecting officers’ safety, that officers were hesitating” amid scrutiny and criticism, Davis said in an interview before President Biden nominated him in March
<b> </b>to lead the U.S. Marshals Service.
<p>“If you pointed your firearm because it was necessary,” Davis said, “you’re not going to be thinking about some lawsuit or complaints.”</p>
