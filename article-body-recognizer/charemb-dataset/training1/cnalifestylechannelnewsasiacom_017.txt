<section> <div> <p> Living </p> <h1> Making a list? Checking it twice? Tips for out-of-practice gift givers </h1> <div> <p>Is re-gifting acceptable? What should you do if you hate a gift? And when is it not okay to give cash?</p> </div> </div> </section>
<p>It has been two years since the holidays felt “normal,” and you’re determined to make them special.</p>
<p>Then, the moment comes to hand over the carefully selected present, tastefully wrapped. But instead of squeals of joy, you’re met with an anticlimactic “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I think that when gift giving goes wrong, the person hasn’t put enough thought into the gift,” McKee said.</p>
<p>No matter your role in exchanging gifts, there are many do's and don’ts. Here’s what you should know this season. </p>
<p>There’s a hierarchy when it comes to giving, and it starts with those you’ve exchanged gifts with in the past for long enough that it’s a tradition.</p>
<p>“In most families, if your parents are still living, the parents will receive a gift,” McKee said. “The grandparents will receive a gift. After that, it’s going to vary in every family.”</p>
<p>ARE SPENDING LIMITS WORTH IT?</p>
<p>Setting a price limit is most useful in office and corporate settings when large groups of people exchange gifts, like Secret Santa, Cowie said.</p>
<p>Awkward feelings could develop if someone intentionally exceeds the limit, said McKee, who added that in such cases an explanation should be given.</p>
<p>“Think of the person you’re giving the gift to,” she said. “Because too often gifts are bought at the delight of the person giving the gift.”</p>
<p>AM I OBLIGATED TO GIVE A GIFT IN RETURN?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. Giving a gift or sending a holiday card in return is not required, McKee said, but she noted that this time of year people sometimes keep small items they can easily give away when unexpected situations arise.</p>
<p>“Keep in mind, if you do give them a gift, you’ve opened the door for the same thing to happen next year,” she said.</p>
<p>IS IT RUDE TO GIVE CASH?</p>
<p>Cash can either alienate or delight the receiver, but it’s really a matter of personal taste or age (perfect for picky teenagers). It is, however, impolite to ask for cash.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, that’s a slippery slope because you’re now soliciting a gift,” Cowie said.</p>
<p>Giving cash can work in certain circumstances, but keep in mind the person and your relationship to them.</p>
<p>HOW DO YOU SAY YOU HATE A GIFT?</p>
<p>You don’t. It’s customary to accept a gift with gratitude, even if the giver “misses the mark,” McKee said. And it’s perfectly fine to regift the item or donate it to someone who may like it more.</p>
<p>After you give a gift, never ask about it, especially if you never see or hear about it again.</p>
<p>“If the receiver has something to say about it, they’ll say it,” McKee said. “Don’t ask, ‘How are you enjoying that? Where is the vase I bought you?’ You’ll put them in the awkward position of feeling like they need to fib.”</p>
<p>WHAT IF YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO GIVE GIFTS THIS YEAR?</p>
<p>A person never has to explain why he or she can’t give a gift, Cowie said. But if you receive one, he said, do give a proper thanks.</p>
<p>“I find so often that people don’t respond to gifts,” he said. Phone calls, text messages or even handwritten notes to acknowledge gifts will do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s fine to openly discuss why you’re not exchanging gifts, in order to help others understand your decision, McKee said.</p>
<p>“The first rule of etiquette is never assume,” she said. “Don’t assume because they live in a particular home or have a particular job that their finances are neat and tidy, because you don’t know the whole picture of their life.”</p>

<h1> Look back: Virgil Abloh's career highs from Louis Vuitton to Off-White to iconic collabs </h1>
<div> <p>The designer was hailed one of the most powerful men in fashion, following his appointment as Louis Vuitton's menswear designer. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serene Seow </a> </div> </div>
<p>Louis Vuitton’s artistic director for menswear Virgil Abloh has died at age 41. The founder of Milan-based label Off-White had been privately battling a rare aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma.</p>
<p>The announcement of his death was shared on his official Instagram page on Sunday (Nov 28).</p>
<p>The late designer’s zest for life was palpable in his creative endeavours. He once told The Cut that fashion is a kind of a “joke”. </p>
<p>“I don’t get too bogged down in the clothes. For me, it’s one big art project, just a canvas to show that fashion should have a brand which has someone behind it who cares about different contexts. Social things,” he said.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>CNA Lifestyle looks back at the self-taught designer’s rise and rise in fashion and art.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>2009: Abloh’s first taste of fashion was at Fendi in Rome, where he interned alongside Kanye West. The pair were spotted at Paris Fashion Week that year at the Comme des Garcon show.</p>
<p>2010: Abloh became the creative director of West’s creative agency, Donda.</p>
<p>2011: Abloh's artwork for West and Jay-Z’s Watch The Throne album picked up a Grammy nomination.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>2013: Pyrex Vision was repositioned as menswear brand Off-White. Abloh described the grey area between black and white as the "Off-White" colour.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>2014: Off-White launched a womenswear line and showed at Paris Fashion Week, alongside its menswear collection.</p>
<p>2016: Abloh debuted a furniture collection, Grey Area, at Off-White’s first concept store in the Aoyama district in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>2017: Abloh won the British Fashion Award for Urban Luxe Brand.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>2018: The designer was appointed the artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s menswear division. Abloh replaced his mentor Kim Jones.</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>2020: Abloh put a spin on a classic Mercedes-Benz, reimagining the company's G-Class as a streamlined racing car.</p></div> </div> </div>

<h1> Virgil Abloh honoured in final fashion collection show for Louis Vuitton </h1>
<div> <p>Drones formed Abloh's initials and spelled out the words "Virgil was here" in the sky outside Miami's Marine Stadium where the memorial event was held.</p> </div>
<p>Louis Vuitton honoured Virgil Abloh at his last fashion collection show in Miami on Tuesday (Nov 30), just days after his sudden death prompted an outpouring of tributes for the industry's most high-profile black designer.</p>
<p>Drones formed Abloh's initials and spelled out the words "Virgil was here" in the sky outside Miami's Marine Stadium where the memorial event was held. There was also a giant statue of Abloh.</p>
<p>Chicago-based rapper Scott "Kid Cudi" Mescudi walked the runway before a live audience that included streetwear designer Don Crawley, known as Don C, Kim Kardashian and rapper ASAP Ferg, according to Instagram posts.</p>
<p>As the show began, roughly 16,000 viewers tuned in to watch <a>on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Models were clad in Vuitton jerseys, while others wore black top hats, bright red jumpsuits and blue suits. Female models carried blue and pink lockbox purses, while the men sported grey duffle bags.</p>
<p>Kendall Reynolds, chief executive of Kendall Miles Designs, said in an interview before the show that Abloh had inspired her to start the luxury brand of Italian handcrafted products.</p>
<p>"His indelible mark on the disruption of traditional European fashion houses will be a legacy that all young designers, like myself, can learn from," she said.</p>
<p>The 45-minute livestream of the show closed with an eruption of fireworks and a recording of Abloh's voice.</p>
<p>"There's no limit," said Abloh in the recording. "Life is so short that you can't waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do."</p>

<h1> #Cheapestthing Christmas edition: 10 most affordable designer gifts from Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton </h1>
<p>You know that TikTok trend that blew up earlier this year where people posted unboxing videos of the cheapest thing they could buy from designer brands? Here’s the Christmas gifting edition of the #cheapestthing you can buy from luxe labels here.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Celine Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>There’s something hilarious and strangely poignant about taking an expensive-looking box out of a high-end paper bag, undoing the shiny ribbons and wading through swathes of crisp paper and packaging, to unveil... a tiny luxury product. </p>
<p>For others, it’s essentially luxury on a budget, a way to get a minuscule piece of the big brands, an aspirational act until you can afford the actual Spring/Summer key pieces. </p>
<div><p>As can be expected, many of the #cheapestthing items are beauty products. Beauty buys have always been one of the most affordable ways to ride the designer train. Think lip gloss from Dior and body lotion from Chanel, for example.</p></div>
<p>There are also small fashion and lifestyle accessories, such as a scarf from Gucci, cufflinks from Prada, a wine glass from Tiffany Co, socks from Loewe and notebooks from Louis Vuitton. </p>
<p>To boot: You get free samples with every Chanel purchase (“choose up to 2 complimentary with every order” and these samples include perfume spray, cleansing foam, serum and mascara, that may even cost more than the initial purchase of cotton pads).</p>
<p>Here then are 10 #cheapestthing items we found from some of the most expensive designer labels, available in Singapore. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>1. PRADA MY CHARACTER SLOT METAL SYMBOL FOR CUSTOMISING KEYCHAINS, S$55</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>2. LOUIS VUITTON SINGAPORE CITY GUIDE, S$49 (OTHER CITIES AVAILABLE)</p> <ol/></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>3. BALENCIAGA TENNIS SOCKS, S$165</p> <ol/></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>4. CHANEL LE VERNIS LIMITED EDITION LONGWEAR NAIL COLOUR 913 – ROUGE INTEMPOREL, S$42</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>5. TOM FORD SOLEIL BLANC ATOMIZER, S$99 FOR 10ML (FROM SEPHORA)</p> <ol/></div> </div> </div>

<h1> ELLE fashion magazine bans fur in all its titles to support animal welfare </h1>
<div> <p>Each of the magazine's 45 global editions has signed a charter to ban editorial content promoting animal fur on its printed pages and its online and social media sites.</p> </div>
<p>Fashion magazine ELLE is banning fur from the pages of all its international editions in a move to support animal welfare and reflect changing tastes, the publication said on Thursday (Dec 2).</p>
<p>Each of the magazine's 45 global editions has signed a charter to ban editorial content promoting animal fur on its printed pages and its online and social media sites, Bessolo LLopiz said at The Business of Fashion’s VOICES 2021 conference.</p>
<p>ELLE owner Lagardère Group collaborated with the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International and Creatives4Change in penning the charter.</p>
<p>In the last few years, a number of fashion houses and retailers have said they were ditching animal fur or skin amid pressure from animal rights groups and changing tastes from younger, ethically and environmentally savvy customers.</p>
<p>In September, luxury group Kering, announced all its brands would stop using animal furs in collections, four years after its star label Gucci made the move.</p>
<p>"Fur appears to be outdated and not fashionable anymore, and especially for the Gen Z, who is the golden target of fashion and luxury industry," Bessolo LLopiz said.</p>
<p>"Gen Z wants fashion to be responsible, ethical and innovative, and that's what's happening."</p>
<p>Founded in 1945, ELLE magazine is published around the world today. Thirteen editions have already implemented the charter, while a further 20 will do so as of Jan 1. The remaining editions will follow from Jan 1, 2023.</p>

<h1> What makes a good luxury bag? 7 important things to look out for before buying one </h1>
<p>Here’s what makes a luxury bag a worthwhile piece of designer arm candy – just in time for the festive season, especially if you’re thinking about whether to splurge on yourself or a loved one this festive season.</p>
<p>In partnership with Burberry.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Goh Yee Huay </a> </div> </div>
<p>That is why you’ll want to make sure the bag you get has all the qualities that make it worth shelling out for. </p>
<p>These could range from tangible traits – expensive materials, fine workmanship – to more idiosyncratic, emotion-based allure such as the brand’s cache or the feel-good boost the bag gives you when you carry it. </p>
<p>Remember, too, that the right luxury bag should be effortless to use – something that captures your personality and suits your needs. No point splurging on an it bag if it’s the complete opposite of your tastes and habits. </p>
<p>To ensure you get the most from your buy – and offset those worries about spending big – here are some hallmarks of a luxury bag that make it worthwhile. </p>
<p>1. IT’S A VERSATILE STAPLE </p>
<p>A well-designed bag can pull off the fine balancing act of being classy, trendy, sporty and chic all at once. This means it complements most outfits in your wardrobe, and you can whip it out for just about any occasion.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Don't miss this IG moment: A giant luxury bag at ION Orchard </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Another upside to a luxury bag that’s a staple in your get-up – you get plenty of use out of it, which balances the price tag. </p>
<p>One feature of a well-made bag is how effortless and comfortable it is to have on you.</p>
<p>Thoughtful touches like magnetic closure, slip pockets and card slots provide convenient access to frequently needed items.</p>
<p>Chain straps that can be worn on the shoulder or across the body give an added element of flexibility, not to mention a touch of glitz.</p>
<p>3. IT'S PRACTICAL BUT STYLISH </p>
<p>4. IT USES TOP-GRADE MATERIALS</p>
<p>One leather that’s popular in luxury bags is lambskin, which is known for its fine-grain surface, ultra-soft texture and lightweight feel. In the case of the Lola, its quality is boosted further with the lambskin given an aniline finish. </p>
<p>5. IT HAS AN EYE-CATCHING FIGURE </p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s the seemingly basic things that set the posh apart from the pedestrian. In the case of luxury bags, just their very shape could be a distinguishing feature, with some of the most famous ones recognisable by their outline alone. </p>
<p>For those who are in the market for a bag with a shape that’s a little atypical, a little unconventional without being outlandish, carriers like the Burberry Crescent Lola Bag and Lola Bucket Bag are among the ones which strike that fine balance. </p>
<p>With its curved top, gently inward-slanting sides and oval base, the Crescent Lola has an almost cowhead-like form that stands out from the rectangles and squares we usually see. </p>
<p>And though the Lola Bucket Bag has the sort of tall, upright shape that defines bucket bags, it’s far more slender, compact and elegant. Much closer to a slim vase than a stumpy pail. </p>
<p>6. IT COMES IN CLASSY STATEMENT COLOURS AND DESIGNS </p>
<p>In fact, a luxury label may actually be a more worthwhile buy because of the tasteful, refined takes on trends and novelty designs that it can offer. </p>
<p>In the case of Burberry’s Lola line, being the more rebellious, playful little sister of the brand’s classic TB bag means it comes with a younger, more vibrant palette featuring colours like Deep Saffron, Soft Violet, Marsh Green and Primrose Pink. </p>
<p>Fashion-adventurous souls can also opt for Lola iterations with eye-catching designs and materials like Horseferry print, camouflage print, quilted cashmere and knitted check.</p>
<p>This may seem like one of those intangible factors that contribute to a bag’s high-end status. But there are actually good reasons to connect heritage with luxury. </p>
<p>Established, storied brands like Burberry have been making their bags for a long while now. They have had the benefit of time to hone their craft and perfect their processes, as well as recruit the best artisans to realise their designs. </p>
<p>In addition, their longevity in a fast-changing, highly competitive fashion scene points to the quality of their products. </p>

<div> <p> Living </p> <h1> You may now kiss the avatar: What's it like to get married in the metaverse? </h1> <div> <p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology is being incorporated into ceremonies more than ever.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Think guest lists that number in the thousands. Gift registries that feature NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. Maybe even destination weddings in space. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Think guest lists that number in the thousands. Gift registries that feature NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. Maybe even destination weddings in space.</p>
<p>Of course, this would require the skills of a software engineer, a role not in any typical wedding budget at the moment.</p>
<p>They livestreamed their nuptials for those who could not be there in person. Guests of the virtual ceremony attended via computer, which required downloading software and then creating an avatar.</p>
<p>Both Traci Gagnon, 52, and her husband, 60, work as agents at eXp Realty. The brokerage has embraced virtual work and the metaverse and is part of eXp World Holdings, which also owns Virbela.</p>
<p>The Gagnons sent pictures of themselves and their wedding decor to Virbela’s events team and software engineers, who incorporated personalised details like bird of paradise flowers and images of their in-person venue into the virtual ceremony. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> “I’m always a size 4, even in January. And I never have a bad hair day. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>“They were able to take my wedding dress and customide it, and take a little flower halo and put it on my hair,” Traci Gagnon said.</p>
<p>But, Perry said, as the metaverse gets built out, “there’s going to be more plug and play assets.” Wedding couples will be able to select from predesigned venues, flowers, tablescapes, dresses, musical entertainment and other elements.</p>
<p>For Traci Gagnon, who hired two videographers, one to capture the in-person event and another to simulcast the ceremony to the cloud, the whole point of the metaverse element was the connection it offered.</p>
<p>“There is a different level of connection” with the metaverse, she said.</p>
<p>Being a metaverse bride had other benefits, too.</p>
<p>“I’m always a size 4, even in January,” she said, laughing. “And I never have a bad hair day.”</p>

<p>Style is but a fleeting moment. Thankfully we have the paparazzi (or Instagram) to capture the best moments of 2021. </p>
<p>From Squid Game’s irrepressible Jung Ho-yeon to China’s most popular star Xiao Zhan to Singapore’s very own Aisyah Aziz, not to mention the hugely popular BTS and Blackpink, CNA Lifestyle rounds up Asia's cool set. </p>
<p>Are your favourites on the list? Scroll on to find out.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>EXO’S KAI</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Star of new Netflix series New World, Kai, who made the cut for GQ UK’s 50 Best Dressed Men of 2020, is known for pushing fashion frontiers with his ever-changing hair colours and cutting-edge style. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>JACKSON WANG</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The 27-year-old China-based singer-host has style running through his veins. A friend of top luxury houses such as Cartier, Fendi and Armani, Wang is also creative director of Team Wang Design, a streetwear label he founded. </p>
<p>2021 was a big year for Cheng. She released a new music album, played ambassador to Lancome and even found time to cameo in a yet-to-be-released movie directed by Hong Kong actor-director Stephen Fung. </p>
<p>So, if you must know what’s the latest fashion trend, head on over to Cheng’s Instagram (@sammi_chengsauman) to stay up to the minute.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>G-DRAGON</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Korea’s best-dressed OG celeb, G-Dragon is a firm favourite with top fashion houses like Givenchy, Balmain and of course, Chanel – the singer has been an ambassador of the French fashion house since 2017. </p>
<p>The 33-year-old who owns fashion label PEACEMINUSONE, has been creating style ripples with a slew of sold-out sneaker collaborations with Nike. </p>
<p>The Air Force 1 Para-Noise and Para-Noise 2.0 kicks got snapped up faster than you can say ‘go’. The recent follow-up PEACEMINUSONE x Nike Kwondo 1 shoe that launched on Dec 3 expectedly sold out in a blink of an eye.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>NAOMI WATANABE</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>One of China’s shiniest stars, the singer-actor is arguably one of the most sought-after celebrities. His 29.6 million followers on Weibo love him, but not nearly as much as the luxury labels. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>GIANNA JUN</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>DILRABA DILMURAT</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The heavily embellished dress was so heavy and restrictive that it required a few assistants to help the You Are My Glory star walk down the red carpet. The star was heard apologising to the media for moving slowly. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>BTS</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The seven-piece K-pop boy band is undoubtedly the most watched celebrity set in the world. They took a little over three hours to amass one million followers on popular social media platform TikTok. What they do, say and wear clearly matters.</p>
<p>The boy band's versatile style caught the eye of the late designer extraordinaire Virgil Abloh, who snagged them as brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton to showcase Abloh's unique brand of elevated streetstyle. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Endometriosis - better understanding of pain descriptors result in faster diagnosis </h1>
<div> <p>With 10 per cent of women at a reproductive age affected by endometriosis, improvements in women's healthcare is needed for the wellbeing of patients, say experts.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annalise Weckesser </a> <a> Stella Bullo </a> </div> </div>
<p>BIRMINGHAM: Though endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age, most women with the condition visit a GP over 10 times before being referred to specialist care for a diagnosis.</p>
<p>This can mean an average wait of eight years to receive a diagnosis. Given the chronic pelvic pain that endometriosis causes – which can sometimes be incapacitating – this delay can severely impact sufferers' physical, social and mental health.</p>
<p>While a key cause of this delay is the dismissal and normalisation of women’s pain, another cause may be the challenge of adequately communicating how it feels – which is something our latest study explored.</p>
<p>We found that both women and doctors find current tools for communicating endometriosis pain inadequate. We also found that some of the language women used to articulate their pain wasn’t recognised by GPs.</p>
<p>This miscommunication could mean many women aren’t getting the diagnosis or treatment they need – or may be waiting longer than necessary for it.</p>
<p>To conduct our study, we first surveyed 131 women with endometriosis. We asked them about the difficulties they faced talking about their pain with doctors prior to being diagnosed and how they describe their pain.</p>
<p>Many women reported that the numeric rating scales (zero being no pain and severe pain being a 10) commonly used in consultation didn’t accurately capture the severity and impact of their pain on their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Some expressed the need for linguistic or visual tools, with one participant stating: “I did not associate what I was feeling as ‘pain.’ I needed to see a list of feelings … like burning, dragging, squeezing.”</p>
<p>Women also reported feeling unheard when they tried to describe their symptoms in consultations. They often felt rushed or discouraged from talking and some felt intimidated.</p>
<p>This not only posed challenges for effectively communicating their pain to their GP, it also made women feel their pain was being dismissed.</p>
<p>Research shows that this kind of invalidation by health professionals is associated with lower self-esteem and depression in patients with endometriosis.</p>
<p>Our research also revealed that many women use metaphors and similes to describe their pain.</p>
<p>The most common metaphors were those that invoke violence. For example, a recurrent metaphor women used to describe their pain was “as if somebody is repeatedly stabbing me with a large knife”.</p>
<p>Other common metaphors compared pain to heat – “like having a hot poker planted inside your stomach” – or pressure, describing it as having “a balloon inside me pushing on everything”.</p>
<p>While these metaphorical expressions aren’t typically used by GPs to diagnose endometriosis, the language still gives a good indication of the type and intensity of the pain being experienced.</p>
<p>We also conducted interviews with 11 GPs, asking how they assess suspected endometriosis pain and how their patients talk about such symptoms.</p>
<p>We then presented them with the metaphors that women commonly used to describe their endometriosis pain.</p>
<p>Three of the GPs we spoke to reported they wouldn’t initially suspect endometriosis if women used these common metaphors and similes.</p>
<p>Some of the expressions such as those including or suggesting words like stabbing or burning were also more likely to make the GPs suspect nerve pain or an infection rather than endometriosis, which they would want to investigate first.</p>
<p>One GP also said that they would associate “more of crampy type pain” with endometriosis, as opposed to the words women used to describe their sensations.</p>
<p>While most GPs reported using the numeric rating scales in their diagnoses, many also felt it was an insufficient tool for assessing pain on its own.</p>
<p>Instead, they reported using the scale along with questions about how the pain impacts a patient’s life, as well as the location, frequency, duration and quality of the pain.</p>
<p>Most of the GPs, however, did identify these metaphors as indicative of possible endometriosis – even recognising them as ones they often hear from patients with the condition.</p>
<p>Some GPs also found use of metaphors and similes helpful in their investigations – even saying it can help patients describe their symptoms when they’re struggling to find the words.</p>
<p>Research with UK GPs has also shown that endometriosis is challenging to diagnose because symptoms resemble those of other conditions they seek to rule out first.</p>
<p>We know that when physicians use metaphors, it can improve communication with seriously ill patients.</p>
<p>And other research shows that when healthcare providers know the common metaphors used by chronic pain sufferers, it can make them less likely to dismiss or misunderstand a patient’s symptoms.</p>
<p>This is why improving GPs’ knowledge of pain metaphors commonly used by women with endometriosis could increase the likelihood that their pain will be understood and believed, which is central to improving diagnostic times.</p>
<p>Our study shows that new and different ways of communicating endometriosis pain to doctors is needed to improve how quickly a patient is diagnosed.</p>
<p>Metaphor, simile and other creative ways of communicating might be one way of doing this, as shown by our research.</p>
<p>Pain is subjective. This is why communicating endometriosis pain is such a challenge. We know from our research and other studies that metaphors and similes are a useful tool for pain sufferers in describing these internal experiences.</p>
<p>The key now will be making sure GPs know how to recognise the common language women use to communicate their endometriosis pain so more can benefit from a diagnosis.</p>

<h1> Luncheon meat, hotdogs: Here's how your favourite processed foods are really made </h1>
<div> <p>Why does ham always look pink? Is that meat really meat? How dangerous are the additives used in these? CNA Lifestyle asked two health and nutrition experts for the lowdown.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>It’s no secret we’ve all got a complicated relationship with processed meats. They’re either a guilty pleasure or our go-to comfort food. At the same time, we’ve been warned about eating too much of these items because of what they contain.</p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle reached out to a dietitian and a gastrointestinal surgeon to find out more about what goes into some of our favourite foods. </p>
<p>LUNCHEON MEAT AND HOTDOGS</p>
<p>As tasty as they are in your hotdog bun or between slices of bread, these items are actually made from the leftover bits found on chicken or pork bones. </p>
<p>What follows is a cocktail of chemicals: Nitrates such as sodium nitrate to preserve as well as enhance flavour and colour, according to Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical and sports dietitian, and the founder of Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants. </p>
<p>Lactate and phosphate compounds may also be added to regulate acidity and provide further preservation. And finally, flavour enhancers such as MSG and dextrose to make the meat product tasty, she said. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> The risk of colorectal cancer increases by about 18 per cent per 50g of processed meat intake per day. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>The additives with the highest quantity used are typically listed first on the ingredient list, so that’s how you watch out for them, said Reutens. </p>
<p>“From a nutritional perspective, these foods are normally high in sodium and saturated fat, which can increase the risk of blood pressure and heart disease if consumed frequently,” she said.</p>
<p>As alarming as it sounds, CO-treated meats are safe for consumption, said Reutens, and “not associated with any health risks”. </p>
<p>“It is difficult to detect the use of carbon monoxide as it’s an odourless gas. But it should not matter because there is no risk posed to humans,” she said.</p>
<p>By 2013 though, pink slime use dropped to about 5 per cent – a significant reduction caused in part by the US media’s coverage of the additive. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> The average adult in Singapore consumes about 8.3g of salt daily – more than 60 per cent above the recommended level. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>You might pick up on pink slime if you see “lean finely textured meat” on the ingredient list, said Reutens. “Apart from that, it is hard to tell.”</p>
<p>But is it safe to eat pink slime? There is ammonia used after all. “It is not the most nutritious form of meat but it is safe to eat pink slime,” said Reutens. </p>
<p>Viruses are not good news (think: COVID-19). So when you hear about spraying viruses onto ready-to-eat deli meats, alarms inadvertently go off in your head. </p>
<p>More accurately, the food industry uses bacteriophages or phages, which are viruses that infect and kill bacteria that cause food poisoning, such as salmonella, E coli, camphylobacter, listeria and pseudomonas, said Reutens.</p>
<p>“Bacteriophages are safe for use on food. They only attack bacteria and are harmless to humans. If anything, they are protective,” she said. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you cannot tell if phages have been sprayed onto your ham, she added.</p>
<p>BACON AND OTHER SMOKED MEATS</p>
<p>That lovely smokiness you smell when you fry up bacon? It’s courtesy of the liquid smoke used to flavour it and other BBQ foods, said Reutens.</p>
<p>It is important that the liquid smoke is filtered twice, said Reutens, to remove cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. “You probably cannot tell if liquid smoke is used,” she said.</p>
<p>To help consumers make informed choices, all prepacked food products have to carry a listing of all the ingredients and additives used, added the spokesperson. For the list of approved additives, you can check the SFA website.</p>
<p>YES, FOOD ADDITIVES ARE GENERALLY SAFE BUT…</p>
<p>On the whole, it doesn't hurt to reduce the intake of processed foods as they typically contain high levels of salt, which has been linked to stomach cancer. “High salt levels damage the stomach lining and cause the cells to die,” said Dr Look. </p>
<p>“Studies have found that people who consume large amounts of pickled vegetables and foods have about a 50 per cent increased risk of gastric cancer compared to those who consume them minimally,” said Dr Look.</p>
<p>WHAT OTHER ADDITIVES COULD LEAD TO CANCER?</p>
<p>Processed meat such as bacon, sausages, ham and hot dogs typically use nitrates and nitrites as preservatives. They are the chemicals that keep these meat products looking pink and fresh instead of brown and old. </p>
<p>Interestingly, nitrates and nitrites can be found naturally in vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, celery, carrots, radish and beets. And they are actually advantageous for cardiovascular health and immunity, according to Dr Look.</p>
<p>But when nitrates and nitrites are used as preservatives in processed meat such as bacon and sausages, it’s a different story altogether. “Ingested nitrates can be converted into nitrites by the bacteria in our mouth,” explained Dr Look. </p>

<h1> 70% of sexually active women in midlife experience sexual dysfunction: NUHS study </h1>
<div> <p>Hormone replacement therapy can significantly reduce the risk of female sexual dysfunction among menopausal women, said NUHS experts.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hidayah Salamat </a> </div> </div>
<p>The majority of women in Singapore who are in midlife and are sexually active, experience sexual dysfunction, according to a new study led by the National University Health System (NUHS).</p>
<p>Of the 1,048 Chinese, Malay and Indian women aged 45 to 69 years old who were surveyed, 57 per cent were found to be sexually active, according to the study.</p>
<p>Of these, 70 per cent experienced female sexual dysfunction, which is characterised by a lack of sexual interest or arousal, an inability to orgasm and/or experience genital pain.</p>
<p>“Vaginal dryness is the biggest risk factor of female sexual dysfunction,” said Professor Yong Eu Leong, who led the study.</p>
<p>This condition increases the risk by “a whopping 13.8-fold, which is about 1,300 per cent”, said Prof Yong, who is Emeritus Consultant at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. </p>
<p>Treating menopause using hormone replacement therapy helps protect against sexual dysfunction, the study also found, with Prof Yong adding that such treatment can reduce the risk by a significant 70 per cent. </p>
<p>NUHS said its study was driven by the lack of discussion about sexual issues among midlife Asian women during medical care, due to “embarassment, religious sensitivities and Eastern values”, it said in press material. </p>
<p>“Female sexual function in Asia is under-reported, under-treated and under-studied,” it said, adding that it is working on a second assessment to help build on the findings of the study.</p>
<div> <div> <p> <a> Wellness </a> </p> <h5> There's a better way to healthy eating without completely removing 'bad foods' from your diet </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> There's a better way to healthy eating without completely removing 'bad foods' from your diet </h1>
<div> <p>The new nutrition guidelines by the American Heart Association aim to focus on tackling overall dietary patterns that can best fit people’s lives and budgets. Here's how. </p> </div>
<p>There are no “good” foods and “bad” foods. Rather, it’s your overall dietary pattern that matters most when it comes to healthful eating.</p>
<p>That’s the main message from the American Heart Association in its latest nutrition guidelines to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need to totally avoid Big Macs, Cokes and French fries, but it does mean you should not regularly indulge in such fare if you want to stay healthy.</p>
<p>He added: “The goal is to make good nutrition possible for all. The healthier we can keep everybody in this country, the lower our health costs will be.”</p>
<p>In the 15 years since the heart association last issued dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, almost nothing has changed for the better. The typical American diet has remained highly processed.</p>
<p>Americans consume too much added sugars, artery-clogging fats, refined starches, red meat and salt and don’t eat enough nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and whole grains that can help prevent heart disease, diabetes and cancer.</p>
<p>But rather than become discouraged, the association decided to try a different approach.</p>
<p>HOW THE GUIDELINES WORK </p>
<p>In avoiding “no noes” and dietary revolutions, the new guidelines can foster gradual evolutionary changes meant to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>For example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion.</p>
<p>Or, if pasta is your main course, choose a product made from an unrefined carbohydrate like whole wheat, brown rice or lentils.</p>
<p>“The advice is evidence-based and applies to everything people eat regardless of where the food is procured, prepared and consumed.”</p>
<p>A HEALTHY DIET FOR YOU AND THE PLANET </p>
<p>If cost or availability is an issue, as is the case in many of the country’s food deserts where fresh produce is scarce, Dr Lichtenstein suggested keeping bags of frozen fruits and vegetables on hand to reduce waste, add convenience and save money.</p>
<p>Some wholesome protein choices that the committee recommended included fish and seafood (although not breaded and fried), legumes and nuts, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.</p>
<p>If meat is desired, choose lean cuts and refrain from processed meats like sausages, hot dogs and deli meats that are high in salt and saturated fat.</p>
<p>The committee’s advice on protein foods, published during the climate talks in Glasgow, was well-timed. Choosing plant-based proteins over animal sources of protein not only has health value for consumers but can help to foster a healthier planet.</p>
<p>“This is a win-win for individuals and our environment,” Dr Lichtenstein said.</p>
<p>However, she cautioned, if a plant-based diet is overloaded with refined carbohydrates and sugars, it will raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>And she discouraged relying on popular plant-based meat alternatives that are ultra-processed and often high in sodium, unhealthy fats and calories, and that “may not be ecologically sound to produce.”</p>
<p>Instead, use liquid plant oils like corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower, canola, nut and olive. They have been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent, an effect comparable to taking a statin drug.</p>
<p>All told, the dietary patterns that the committee outlined can go far beyond reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>They can also protect against Type 2 diabetes and a decline of kidney function, and perhaps even help foster better cognitive abilities and a slower rate of age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<h1> You’re allowed to complain about your kids, even after infertility </h1>
<div> <p>How can parents like me, who have struggled with infertility or pregnancy loss, reconcile gratitude for having a child at all with the everyday frustrations of parenthood?</p> </div>
<p>I clamped my hands over my ears as the obstetrician cranked up the volume on the ultrasound machine. After three pregnancy losses, I was convinced that we’d be met only with static.</p>
<p>“I think you’re going to want to hear this,” the doctor said. And there was the unmistakable drumming of my son’s heart.</p>
<p>I often find myself asking: How can parents like me, who have struggled with infertility or pregnancy loss, reconcile gratitude for having a child at all with the everyday frustrations of parenthood?</p>
<p>Though we were strangers, we spoke with the intimacy of mothers who had just crawled out of a foxhole together.</p>
<p>Dr Johnson observed that many of her patients with living children preface darker comments about parenting with the phrase: “I’m really grateful but …”</p>
<p>Parents can find themselves jumping through verbal hoops to avoid seeming insensitive to those who have been through the same sad journey.</p>
<p>“When you are part of a community bound by loss and its heaviness, there is some concern for what your experience is like for others,” Dr Johnson said.</p>
<p>Jay Tansey of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, found that being a sounding board for others helped him process the loss of his full-term daughter Bella in 2017.</p>
<p>“When we lost Bella, one of the least helpful comments made was how I should be happy with what we had – a healthy, wonderful two-year-old,” Pepper said.</p>

<p>The remark threw her into a shame-spiral, she added, making her question whether her grief and desire to have more children were negatively affecting her parenting.</p>
