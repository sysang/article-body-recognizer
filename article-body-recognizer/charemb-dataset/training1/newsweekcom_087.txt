<p>New York City is holding a "scaled back" version of the Times Square New Year's Eve ball drop event amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The Big Apple's beloved annual New Year's Eve celebration will take place with some additional safety measures in place, such as masking and vaccination requirements.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor <a>Bill de Blasio</a> stated: "We are leading the way on vaccinations, we have reopened safely, and every day we work toward building a recovery for all of us.</p>
<p>"There is a lot to celebrate and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year," the mayor added.</p>
<h2>What Time is the Times Square New Year's Eve Celebration?</h2>
<p>According to the official Times Square website, the celebration begins shortly before 6 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>At around 6 p.m. ET, the Times Square New Year's Eve ball will be raised to the top of the pole at One Times Square (Broadway at 43rd Street).</p>
<p>Then later at precisely 11:59pm ET, the ball will make its 60-second descent down the flagpole to ring in the New Year.</p>
<h2>How To Watch the Times Square New Year's Eve Ball Drop</h2>
<p>Viewers can catch the event live in person as well as on television and online via different channels.</p>
<p>Those attending the ball drop event in person are required to wear face coverings as well as show valid photo identification and proof of "full vaccination" against COVID-19.</p>
<p>This means that on December 31, 2021, the guest must be "at least 14 days after their second dose of a two dose COVID-19 vaccine or at least 14 days after their single dose of an approved single dose COVID-19 vaccine."</p>
<p>COVID-19 can be demonstrated via the following ways:</p>
<li>Using the NYC COVID Safe App</li>
<li>Using the New York State Excelsior App</li>
<li>CLEAR's Digital Vaccine Card</li>
<li>A photo or hard copy of your CDC vaccination card</li>
<li>An official vaccination record of a vaccine administered outside the United States.</li>
<p>Those unable to get vaccinated due to a disability will be required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test taken within 72 hours prior to the ball drop event, the mayor's office advised.</p>
<p>To attend the event in person, all guests will have to enter from Sixth or Eighth Avenue. As needed, the blocks will be closed off by police as they fill up northward, street by street.</p>
<p>The exact times for when the blocks will be closed to pedestrian and vehicular traffic will depend on when visitors begin arriving.</p>
<p>Previously, vehicle traffic from 45th Street through 48th Street in Times Square was closed by the early morning, while by 3 p.m. local time, the streets were closed from 42nd Street to 49th Street between Sixth and Eighth Avenue.</p>
<p>The Times Square website also advises visitors will not be able to return to the Square after leaving the event for any reason.</p>
<p>Several broadcast networks will be airing elements of the Times Square celebration. Detailed information on the New Year's Eve television broadcast pool feed can be found at the Times Square website.</p>
<p>The event will be available to view via a commercial-free webcast from 6 p.m. ET on December 31 to 12:15 a.m. on January 1, 2022, featuring the raising of the ball, live music performances and hourly countdowns.</p>
<p>The webcast will be streamed live on several websites, including TimesSquareNYC.org, NewYearsEve.nyc, LiveStream.com/2022 and TimesSquareBall.net.</p>

<h3>Britain officials say Omicron variant is less likely to cause hospitalization</h3>
<p>UKHSA chief executive Jenny Harries said the analysis "shows an encouraging early signal that people who contract the omicron variant may be at a relatively lower risk of hospitalization than those who contract other variants."</p>
<p>"Cases are currently very high in the U.K., and even a relatively low proportion requiring hospitalization could result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill", Harries added.</p>
<h3>350 million doses shipped globally, at-home tests expected in January</h3>
<p>The United States has shipped more than 350 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to more than 110 countries around the world.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shared the news during a press conference Thursday.</p>
<p>In addition, the Biden Administration has ordered 500 million at-home testing kits, that will be made available for free to Americans.</p>
<p>"We expect to get the first set of the 500 million (tests) in early January," Psaki said. "We expect that the rest will come in the weeks to follow."</p>
<p>She added the White House has been ''massively increasing'' its testing capacity and also has an "abundance" of masks at its disposal.</p>
<h3>FDA says the benefits of antiviral pills outweigh potential risks</h3>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the benefits of the newly approved COVID-19 antiviral oral treatments outweigh any potential risks.</p>
<p>The FDA approved Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's molnupiravir for emergency use authorization this week.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said each pill is effective against the Omicron variant but comes with its own health risks.</p>
<p>"The known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks," Dr. Cavazzoni said during a press call Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. John Farley, director of the Office of Infectious Diseases, said Paxlovid could interfere with other medications and should not be used if a patient has severe kidney or liver issues.</p>
<p>He added, however, that prescribing either drug also depends on availability of other COVID-19 treatments.</p>
<h3>FDA says both COVID treatment pills are effective against Omicron</h3>
<p>During a press briefing, U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated both approved at-home COVID treatment pills Paxlovid and Molnupiravir are effective against the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>The holiday travel rush continues across the country, despite the spread of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened more than 2 million travelers on Wednesday, compared to 1.9 million in 2019, pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>AAA predicts holiday travel will increase over 30% this holiday season, compared to 2020. More than 109 people are expected to travel 50 miles or more between December 23 and January 2, according to AAA.</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson boasts about U.K. COVID testing capacity</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson boasted about the U.K.'s COVID-19 testing ability ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p>"We have the largest testing capacity in Europe, as you know, 400 million tests," he said. "We've done twice as many as France, four times as many as Germany."</p>
<p>He thanked the Royal Mail for sending out 70 million lateral flow tests last week, three times more boxes sent out than a month ago.</p>
<p>"You're going to distribute up to 200 million lateral flow tests in the next month, and that's the equivalent to three for every person," he said.</p>
<p>Johnson noted the "oncoming tidal wave of Omicron" is going to put even more pressure on testing capacity but assured that the U.K. will continue to help those who need it most.</p>
<p>Because of the testing, Johnson said the U.K. is able to keep track COVID-19 infections and "understand the disease as it develops to keep it under control."</p>
<h3>FDA approves second at-home pill to help battle COVID</h3>
<p>On Thursday U.S. Health officials authorized Merck's COVID-19 pill, known as Molnupiravir. It makes the second medication approved for at-home use to combat the rapidly spreading Omicron variant.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, Merck's pill is for adults with early symptoms of COVID-19 who face the highest risks of hospitalization, including older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease.</p>
<p>Patients will be required to take four pills twice a day for five days.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have made an agreement to purchase enough doses to treat up to 3.1 million people.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval comes a day after the agency approved the first pill, called Paxlovid.</p>
<h3>New York opened federal COVID testing sites in lieu of the Omicron surge</h3>
<p><a>President Joe Biden</a> stated he will add federal emergency testing sites around the country in announcement Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Before Christmas, the first several of these federal testing sites will be up and running in New York City".</p>
<p>The White House announced Wednesday in a tweet that the first of these sites opened in NYC, with more to open in the next week.</p>
<h3>It's been one year since the first COVID vaccine was administered in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Wednesday marks one year since the first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky credits the success of the vaccination program to "collaboration across government and with partners across medicine and public health."</p>
<h3>Cleveland area hospitalized overwhelmed after recent Omicron surge</h3>
<p>Cleveland area hospitals battling the recent surge in Covid patients placed a "Help" ad in the local newspaper.</p>
<p>According to CNN reports, the ad stated, "We need your help,"<a> read the bottom of the ad</a>. "We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before.</p>
<p>"And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated."</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Viral Tweet Sparks Debate About Holiday COVID Testing Amid Huge Travel Expectations</h1><div> By Nick Mordowanec <time>On 12/21/21 at 11:59 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>How do families handle the holidays in the age of COVID-19?</p>
<p>Not very well, according to one woman's tweet that has gone viral with over 92,300 "likes."</p>
<p>The tweeter, Cassandra Basler, began her post from Saturday with: "How politicized is Omicron in Michigan?"</p>
<p>Then, she said she asked her family if all would comply with at-home rapid tests before convening together indoors.</p>
<p>She was ultimately uninvited from the festivities.</p>
<p>Data released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized Omicron as the most dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S., composing about 73 percent of new infections for the week ending December 18.</p>
<p>When data was released last week, Omicron was detected in less than 13 percent of new COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Responses to Basler's tweet were across the board.</p>
<p>Some, like user @MadMaxMKE, believe that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer should impose stringent orders across the board to mitigate future spread and slow down hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Another response stated: "If anyone in the comments section has advice for deradicalizing conspiracy theorist family members, please please please drop that advice right here."</p>
<p>One man, who is vaccinated and boosted and hosting a family gathering, said his son—a doctor—requested that all attendees take at-home tests. The man declined due to his vaccination status.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s administration said it will<a> provide free at-home rapid tests</a> to those who request them.</p>
<a>Scott's Cheap Flights said</a> that of those who were planning to travel for Christmas before Omicron, 87 percent have not changed their plans. Meanwhile, just 10 percent have canceled or postponed and 3 percent changed locations.
<p>And of those unsure about their plans prior to the Omicron wave, 27 percent have since decided not to travel while 45 percent are still undecided.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most glaring statistic is that although 62 percent of people are worried about Omicron affecting their holidays, 79 percent are more worried about the variant negatively impacting travel plans in 2022.</p>
<p>If you're considering a cruise, policies depend on the company, Travel+Leisure reported.</p>
<p>Norwegian Cruise Line is requiring 100 percent of its crew and passengers to be fully vaccinated, as well as mandates passenger testing before boarding – a policy that will remain "indefinitely."</p>
<p>Disney Cruise Line is only requiring passengers 12 and up to be fully vaccinated, with the expectation to adjust that requirement to kids 5 and older starting in 2022.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 cruise passengers and crew members tested positive for COVID-19, a setback for an industry forced to shut down for more than year due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>In total, 48 people on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas ship tested positive for the virus, a spokesperson for the cruise line wrote in a statement to Newsweek on Sunday. The ship set sail from Miami on December 11 and returned on Saturday.</p>
<p>All crew members were vaccinated and test for the virus weekly, while 95 percent of the 6,091 passengers were fully vaccinated, according to the statement. Ninety-eight percent of those who became infected with the virus were vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Each person quickly went into quarantine," the statement said. "Everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and we continuously monitored their health."</p>
<p>A booster shot is not currently required, though the cruise line recommends guests receive it before sailing, according to its website.</p>
<a>17 people tested positive for the virus earlier in December</a>.
<p>The outbreak comes as coronavirus cases spike in the United States, and the fast-spreading Omicron variant leaves the future of the pandemic uncertain.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the United States had a seven-day average of 125,775 new cases per day, up from 88,229 one month earlier, according to data from the <a>CDC</a>.</p>
<p>Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, warned during a Sunday interview with National Public Radio that the United States could <a>see as many as 1 million new cases per day</a> due to the variant.</p>
<p>"Even if it has a somewhat lower risk of severity, we could be having a million cases a day if we're not really attentive to all of those mitigation strategies," Collins warned.</p>
<div> U.S. Death <a>Florida</a> <a>Cruise ship</a></div>
<p>A 15-year-old boy reportedly fell to his death on a cruise ship last week.</p>
<p>A "man overboard" alarm sounded aboard the MSC Seashore after the boy fell from a balcony on Deck 16 of the ship at around 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday December 22, according to Crew Center.</p>
<p>But police confirmed that boy's death had happened aboard the cruise ship, which was returning to Miami after a five-day trip to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>"Once the vessel came into the port, they responded to a deceased person on the ship," Miami-Dade Police Detective Chris Thomas told <a>NBC</a> News.</p>
<p>Thomas said no foul play was suspected, but an investigation was underway to determine the exact cause of death.</p>
<p>In a statement, MSC Cruises, the cruise line that runs the MSC Seashore, said the teenager, who was traveling with his family, "appears to have died of suicide." He has not been identified.</p>
<p>"Our team immediately notified authorities and our care team assisted the young man's family on board," the statement said. "All of us at MSC Cruises are heartbroken. The family remains in our thoughts and prayers."</p>
<p>The "man overboard" alarm can be heard over a loudspeaker in videos some passengers aboard the MSC Seashore posted on social media.</p>
<p>The alarm can be heard in a <a>short clip</a> posted on TikTok by travel vlogger Austin Hamawy. "Sad to report last night on our cruise a 15 year old fell from the 16th floor. He sadly did not make it," the caption said.</p>
<p>In a <a>follow-up video</a>, Hamawy said it appeared the boy had died on impact after hitting a promenade on a lower deck of the ship. "My prayers go out to him and his family," he said.</p>
<p>The Miami-Dade Police Department and MSC Cruises have been contacted for additional comment.</p>
<p>The boy's death comes after a young woman fell from a Carnival cruise ship near Ensenada, Mexico earlier this December.</p>
<p><a>The woman went overboard</a> from the balcony of her stateroom aboard the Carnival Miracle ship at around 3 a.m. on December 11, Coast Guard Petty Officer Adam Stanton said.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard joined the Mexican Navy in a search for the woman, deploying a cutter called the Forrest Rednour as well as an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter. The search was <a>suspended after 31 hours.</a></p>

<p>The U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday suspended the search for a woman who fell overboard from a Carnival cruise ship.</p>
<p>The woman, in her mid-20s, went overboard from the balcony of her stateroom aboard the Carnival Miracle cruise ship near Ensenada, Mexico, at around 3 a.m. on Saturday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Adam Stanton said.</p>
<p>Coast Guard personnel from San Diego had joined the Mexican Navy in searching for the woman.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said on <a>Twitter</a> than an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter was also involved in the search and that the USCG Cutter Forrest Rednour is "scheduled to continue the search throughout the night."</p>
<p>But the Coast Guard later announced the search was being halted after more than 31 hours.</p>
<p>The cruise ship left on Thursday for a three-day voyage. It returned to port in Long Beach on Sunday, where the <a>FBI</a> was waiting to investigate, according to KABC.</p>
<p>Daniel Miranda, a passenger on the ship, told the station that an announcement went out at around 3 a.m. on Saturday that someone had gone overboard.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Saturday, Carnival said the ship was released and proceeded to Ensenada after assisting with the search.</p>
<p>"We advised Carnival Miracle guests this morning of an overboard incident involving one of our guests from the balcony of her stateroom," the statement said.</p>
<p>The Carnival Miracle has a total guest capacity of 2,680 and a crew of approximately 910, <a>according</a> to the Carnival Cruise Line website. The ship has 1,062 staterooms and 12 guest decks.</p>
