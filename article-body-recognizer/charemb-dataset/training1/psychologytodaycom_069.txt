<div> <div> <h1>Hoarding Disorder</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>According to <a>DSM-5</a>, the following symptoms are diagnostic of hoarding disorder:</p>
<li>There is a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their value or lack thereof.</li>
<li>The difficulty in discarding possessions is due to distress associated with getting rid of them.</li>
<li>The difficulty in discarding possessions leads to the clutter of living spaces and compromises the use of living spaces.</li>
<li>The hoarding creates clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning, including the ability to maintain a safe space.</li>
<p>In some cases, the difficulty in discarding items is accompanied by excessive acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no available space.</p>
<p>A hoarder may be completely convinced that the hoarding-related activity—difficulty discarding items, excessive acquisition of items—is not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between hoarding and collecting? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are signs that I am in the presence of a hoarder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can hoarding become dangerous? </h3> </div>
<a>stress</a> the individual feels, because of the chaos within the living space and complaints from family members, neighbors, and even local law enforcement.
<div> <h3> What is animal hoarding? </h3> </div>
<p>Hoarders do collect animals to an unhealthy level. And while there may be stereotypes of crazy cat ladies, there is not enough evidence showing that there are more female over male animal hoarders.</p>
<p>Problems of animal hoarding arise when pet owners:</p>
<p>• Do not provide proper <a>nutrition</a>, hygiene, and veterinary care. </p>
<p>• Do not provide a healthy environment.</p>
<a>traumatic</a> event, have difficulty making decisions, or have a family member who hoards are at higher risk of developing the disorder. The majority of people with hoarding disorder also suffer some type of depressive or
<p>The tendency to hoard often begins in <a>adolescence</a> and worsens as a person gets older.</p>
<div> <h3> Is hoarding related to laziness? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No. Laziness and messiness are not related to hoarding, which is a mental health disorder. People who hoard experience great anxiety and distress over their habits and tendencies.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Are hoarding and ADHD related? </h3> </div>
<p><a>ADHD</a> is commonly associated with hoarding, and there is research suggesting that individuals who have ADHD may show an increased risk for hoarding. According to the NIH, some 20 percent of hoarders may meet symptom criteria for ADHD.</p>
<p>Hoarding may persist for a lifetime, but effective treatment can help reduce the need to hold on to unnecessary items; it can also improve <a>decision-making</a>, stress-reducing, and organizational skills.</p>
<a>medication</a>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). One or the other, or both, may be employed. Early clinical trials suggest that compassion-focused therapy may be more effective than CBT alone.
<div> <h3> Can a hoarder be motivated to clean up? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>An individual cannot be forced to throw away clutter. Nor will he likely welcome help in discarding his hoarded items. He may well feel his boundaries are being crossed, and that he has the right to live any way he pleases.</p> </div>

<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms </li> <li> Causes </li> <li> Treatment </li> </ul> </div>
<p>According to the DSM-5, excoriation disorder can be diagnosed when the following criteria are met:</p>
<li>recurrent skin picking results in skin lesions</li>
<li>repeated attempts are made to decrease or stop the skin picking</li>
<li>the skin picking causes clinically significant distress—including a feeling of loss of self-control, embarrassment, and shame—or impairment in functioning</li>
<p>In most cases, skin picking does not generally occur in the presence of other individuals.</p>

<div> <h3> Is skin-picking caused by anxiety? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Anxiety disorders often co-occur with dermatillomania, and episodes of anxiety—whether they constitute a diagnosable disorder or not—are a common trigger of skin-picking episodes.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Is it possible to cure dermatillomania? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>There is no known “cure” for dermatillomania, but the disorder can become highly manageable with treatment—to the point where many individuals are able to go long stretches of time without picking at their skin.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Can medication treat excoriation disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>Medication</a>—particularly SSRIs—may provide some relief for symptoms of excoriation disorder, especially for individuals who are also struggling with anxiety, depression, or
<a>OCD</a>. Supplements have also been tested in small studies, with a few appearing to help reduce symptoms a significant amount. Overall, however, medication is not considered the first-line
<a>treatment for BFRBs</a>; therapy tends to be significantly more effective and does not come with the same risk of side effects.

<div> <div> <h1>Rumination Disorder</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Rumination disorder, or rumination syndrome, is a condition in which someone regularly regurgitates their food after eating it. The food is re-chewed and then either re-swallowed or spat out.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What are signs that someone may have rumination disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How is rumination disorder diagnosed? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is rumination different than vomiting? </h3> </div>
<p>The roots of rumination disorder are still mysterious, but the disorder involves contracting the muscles in the esophagus and diaphragm, which may then lead regurgitation to become a reflex, similar to burping.</p>
<p>A few environmental factors raise the risk of developing the disorder, including lack of stimulation, stressful events, and a problematic parent-child relationship, according to the DSM-5.</p>
<p>Rumination disorder is particularly high among those with developmental disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In those cases, regurgitation may be a tool for self-soothing or self-stimulation.</p>

<div> <h3> When does rumination disorder develop? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Rumination can occur throughout one’s lifetime. It often emerges in childhood, but it can begin in adulthood as well. In infancy, the disorder most commonly appears between 3 and 12 months, according to the DSM-5.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms </li> <li> Causes </li> <li> Treatment </li> </ul> </div>
<p>Pica is diagnosed when a person regularly eats non-food substances for a period of one month or longer, according to the DSM-5. A diagnosis is only given if the behavior is not developmentally appropriate or culturally supported. </p>
<p>Pica often occurs in the context of another mental health condition, such as autism, intellectual disability, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. In more serious cases, a person will receive both diagnoses.</p>
<p>People with pica may consume the following items: </p>
<div> <h3> How common is pica? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Has pica increased over time? </h3> </div>
<p>Yes, a report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that hospitalizations for eating disorders rose 24 percent between 1999 and 2009, and that pica hospitalizations rose 93 percent, more than any other eating disorder.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the common substances people with pica eat? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The two most common forms of pica are dirt-eating, which is also called geophagia, and starch-eating, also called amylophagia, research shows.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h3> Do people who have pica eat typical food? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>Yes, individuals with pica also generally consume typical foods and don’t have an aversion to nutritious food.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What does the word “pica” mean? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Pica comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird known to eat almost anything. Although magpies may be satisfied with any form of food, people with pica generally consume one or two <a>specific non-food items</a>.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Scientists don’t fully understand what causes pica. It most often occurs temporarily in childhood and during pregnancy, although adults and non-pregnant people can occasionally develop the condition as well.</p>
<p>Pica is not diagnosed based on craving unusual items—which many people experience during pregnancy—but rather consuming those items regularly for a sustained time period.</p>
<div> <h3> Can anxiety cause pica? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can memory deficits cause pica? </h3> </div>
<a>memory</a> deficits, particularly those acquired from brain injury,
<a>may cause pica;</a> studies have identified people who developed symptoms following an injury. One possible explanation is that brain injury may disrupt
<a>sensory perception</a> and therefore the ability to differentiate edible and non-edible foods.
<div> <h3> Is pica influenced by cultural norms? </h3> </div>
<p>If pica is a result of inadequate supervision, treatment may involve educating the family and teaching children to distinguish between food and non-food items, and addressing housing and economic needs if possible.</p>
<p>If pica is a result of stress, treatment may involve talk therapy or family therapy and the development of coping skills, such as learning stress-reduction techniques or finding a safe substance to chew on instead.</p>
<div> <h3> What medical complications can result from pica? </h3> </div>
<p>Pica can have serious consequences. Examples include:</p>
<p>• Poisoning, such as lead poisoning from eating chips of old paint or soil that has old paint in it.</p>
<p>• Obstruction of the bowel or airways from consuming or choking on indigestible materials such as hair.</p>
<p>• Obesity from consuming too many calories, such as eating laundry starch.</p>
<p>• Inadequate protein or energy—intake from consuming things like coffee grounds or oyster shells in place of real food.</p>
<p>• Nutritional deficiencies, such as the interference of soil with the absorption of iron, zinc, and potassium in the digestive system.</p>
<p>• Damage to teeth and gums from chewing abrasive materials such as twigs or metals.</p>
<p>• Infestations of parasites such as tapeworms resulting from consuming dirt or feces.</p>
<p>• High blood pressure, high levels of sodium salts in the blood, and abnormal liver functions such as those resulting from consuming large quantities of baking powder.</p>
<p>• Low birth weight, premature birth, mental and physical abnormalities among infants whose mothers practice pica during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Obesity is typically measured by body mass index, or BMI, a value calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. According to the Centers for Disease Control:</p>
<ul><li>A BMI of 25 to 30 is within the overweight range</li> <li>A BMI is 30 or higher is within the obesity range</li> <li>BMI of 40 or higher is considered severe obesity</li> </ul>
<p>According to the CDC, children with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile are considered overweight, while those with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile are considered obese.</p>
<div> <h3> How is obesity assessed? </h3> </div>
<p>Three key measures are used in assessing obesity:</p>
<p>• Body mass index (BMI): A measure of weight in relation to height</p>
<p>• Waist circumference: A measure of abdominal fat</p>
<p>• Risk factors for diseases and conditions associated with obesity</p>
<div> <h3> What risk factors are associated with obesity? </h3> </div>
<p>According to the NIH, other risk factors that are associated with obesity that can have a negative impact on health include: </p>
<p>• High blood pressure (hypertension)</p>
<p>• High LDL ("bad" cholesterol)</p>
<p>• Low HDL ("good" cholesterol)</p>
<p>• High triglycerides</p>
<p>• High blood glucose (sugar)</p>
<p>• Family history of premature heart disease</p>
<p>• Physical inactivity or a sedentary lifestyle</p>
<p>• Cigarette <a>smoking</a></p>

<a>nutrition</a>. A doctor can determine the healthiest rate for an individual to lose weight, while a nutritionist can teach them about healthy food choices, appropriate portion sizes, and new ways to prepare food.
<a>goals</a> and a slow pace can increase their chances of losing the weight and keeping it off.
<p>Exercise is an integral part of any weight loss and weight maintenance plan, as well as general health. It also reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, beyond what weight reduction achieves alone.</p>
<div> <h3> What percentage of weight should a person lose? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Will reducing dietary fat alone enough to lose weight? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What behavioral changes have an impact on weight loss success? </h3> </div>
<p>• Set realistic goals for weight reduction. One should engage in aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, three times a week, and try to increase physical activity in general.</p>
<p>• Eat only at the table. Avoid snacking in front of the TV, in bed, while driving, or while standing in front of the open refrigerator.</p>
<p>• Learn about appropriate portion sizes.</p>
<p>• Choose healthy snacks, such as fruits or vegetables.</p>
<p>• Learn <a>meditation</a> or yoga as a way of managing <a>stress</a>.</p>
<p>• Find ways to socialize that don't involve a meal or dessert.</p>
<p>• Keep a diet and exercise journal. This may help someone identify overeating triggers in their life.</p>
<p>• Find a support group or consider <a>psychotherapy</a> to help find support in the process.</p>
<div> <h3> What foods are better for a healthy diet? </h3> </div>
<p>According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, it’s important to stick to unprocessed, low-sugar food items, such as the following:</p>
<p>• Dairy such as yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, eggs</p>
<p>• Whole grain products</p>
<p>• Brown rice, whole-grain pasta</p>
<p>• Fish and shellfish</p>
<p>• Fresh or frozen fruits; if canned fruit is necessary, see options packed in water or juice, not syrup</p>
<p>• Fresh, frozen, or no salt added canned vegetables</p>
<p>• Low-fat or nonfat salad dressings</p>
<p>• Honey or low-sugar jam</p>
<p>• Herbs and spices</p>

<p>People with ARFID don’t consume enough to meet their nutritional or energy needs. The condition is classified as a feeding or eating disorder in the DSM-5, and a diagnosis would involve one of the following consequences:</p>
<ul><li>Significant weight loss</li> <li>Significant nutritional deficiency</li> <li>Dependence on enteral feeding or nutritional supplements</li> <li>Impairments to the person’s mental health or social life</li> </ul>
<p>A diagnosis is given if the person’s eating patterns were not due to a lack of available food, developmental stage, a cultural practice, another mental health condition, or a medical problem. </p>
