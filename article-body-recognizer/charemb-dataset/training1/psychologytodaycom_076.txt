<h1> The Real Crisis of Teen Mental Health </h1>
<h2> Parents deserve support, care, and compassion, not stigma and shame. </h2>
<li>Depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth have doubled during the pandemic.</li>
<li>Teens today report spending 75 percent of their waking hours on screens during COVID-19.</li>
<li>More than a quarter of teens would welcome reasonable screen time limits.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: AntonioGuillem/Bigstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>teenagers</a> are battling demons of their own. Recently, the U.S. Surgeon General went so far as to issue a public health advisory on the
<a>mental health challenges</a> that children and teenagers are facing in the midst of the pandemic.
<p>According to the <a>Surgeon General’s report</a>, depressive and <a>anxiety</a> symptoms in youth doubled during the pandemic, with 25 percent of youth experiencing <a>depressive symptoms</a> and 20 percent experiencing anxiety symptoms.</p>
<a>The Harris Poll</a> and commissioned by the National 4-H Council, the majority of teens (7 in 10) reported experiencing struggles with mental health. Most teens (61 percent) said that the pandemic has increased their feeling of
<a>loneliness</a>. And even more teens—79 percent of those surveyed—said that they wish there was an inclusive environment or safe space for people in school to talk about mental health.
<a>shame</a> other parents who are making difficult choices during these challenging times. Whether it's planning a family trip, deciding on counseling, or making the tough decision to pursue
<a>residential therapy</a>, parents must do what is best for their teenagers. Getting them help is a priority; getting distracted by parent shaming is wasted time and energy.
<p>The U.S. Surgeon General Advisory reminds us that technology can be closely tied to mental health. In light of this, parents should take time to examine their own digital life as well as their child's. They can do this by asking:</p>
<li>How does my child feel about the time they spend online?</li>
<li>Is my child engaging because they want to, or because they feel like they have to?</li>
<li>How can I create space for open conversations with my child about their experiences online?</li>
<li>How do I feel about my own use of technology?</li>
<li>How can I be a better role model for my child?</li>
<h3>Signs of a Distressed Youth</h3>
<p>Teens may not answer questions about their mental health to parents' satisfaction. Look for telltale signs of stress and <a>depression</a> such as:</p>
<li>Physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or exhaustion</li>
<li>Loss of interest in activities or loss of <a>appetite</a></li>
<li>Irregular sleep habits</li>
<li>Difficulty focusing or making decisions</li>
<li>Withdrawal, seclusion, or apathy</li>
<h3>How Parents Can Help Teens at Home</h3>
<p>If your child seems to be struggling with these issues, you can employ several strategies to help them manage their stress and anxiety:</p>
<a>goals</a> or share their experiences, take the time to acknowledge and encourage their efforts.
<li>Encourage and help your teens to take ownership of their health. Exercise, proper sleep, and nutritious food choices can reduce anxiety. When these habits improve how they feel, they will make them part of their routine. </li>
<a>screen time</a>. The majority of teens (and likely parents) are on their devices too much. Take time for the entire family to consider a
<a>digital diet</a> that is healthy for everyone. More than a
<a>quarter of teens</a> (26 percent) wish that someone (either their parent or school) would impose reasonable screen time limits on them.
<p>During these challenging times (and always), parents need support, care, and compassion from family, friends, and others. </p>

<h2> A book review of "Grief: A Philosophical Guide." </h2>
<p>This post is a review of Grief: A Philosophical Guide. By Michael Cholbi. Princeton University Press. 219 pp. $24.95</p>
<p>Socrates often described grief as a “sickness,” commonly experienced by women and inferior men. Poetry depicting “wailing and lamentations of men of repute,” he declared, should be censored.</p>
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a> of the American
<a>Psychiatric</a> Association noted that grief involved sadness,
<a>anxiety</a>, and mood changes similar to
<a>depression</a>, but did not classify it as a mental disorder because it is “the normal and culturally typical response to the death of a loved one.” A committee proposed removing the “

<a>anger</a>, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, and contain other emotions (

<a>academic literature</a> on psychological safety has demonstrated its powerful association with learning and performance in teams and organizations.

<a>goals</a> as well. Leadership does not depend on one’s title. Leaders can emerge at any level if they can motivate those with whom they collaborate to strive toward a common goal.
<h2> The Qualities of Great Leaders </h2>
<a>Genetics</a> appear to influence leadership ability, due to inherited
<a>education</a> and opportunity play a significant role as well.
<div> <h3> Are good leaders born or made? </h3> </div>
<a>about a third born and two-thirds made</a>. Some inborn traits such as
<a>intelligence</a> are important elements of leadership, but training,
<a>education</a>, self-development, and experience are at least as important.
<div> <h3> How do good leaders inspire others? </h3> </div>
<a>attention</a> to relationships and morale. One of the best ways to do that is to
<a>foster a culture of gratitude</a>, praising and thanking colleagues for the work they do and the ideas they contribute. Research finds that employees in such environments are more productive, and treat customers more courteously.
<div> <h3> Is charisma essential for leadership? </h3> </div>
<a>Charisma</a> is hard to define but it generally involves the ability to signal one’s
<a>confidence</a> and competence to others, and to convey understanding, through
<a>body language</a>, rhetorical skills, and
<a>persuasion</a>. Researchers are split on whether it is a necessary trait for effective leadership, but most at least see it as
<a>a signal of someone’s leadership potential</a>.
<div> <h3> Are men better leaders than women? </h3> </div>
<a>far more men than women reach top leadership positions</a>. One theory is that the qualities that help one become selected for such positions, like confidence,
<a>aggression</a>, and charisma, may be more prevalent in men, but the traits of effective leaders, like
<a>emotional intelligence</a>, humility, integrity, and coachability, are not.
<div> <h3> Do narcissists succeed as leaders? </h3> </div>
<a>narcissism</a>. In positions of leadership, narcissists may display charisma and even rally colleagues to perform in a crisis, but their sense of entitlement, resistance to criticism, striving for glory, and lack of empathy
<a>often leads to failure</a> to build successful organizations.
