<h3><a>Three Teens Allegedly Shot, Killed by a 14-Year-Old at Texas Gas Station</a></h3>
<div>Garland, Texas, Police Chief Jeff Bryan didn't release details on where and how the suspected shooter was arrested, only saying that he didn't turn himself in.</div>
<h3><a>Jury in Trial of Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes Still Yet to Reach a Verdict</a></h3>
<div>The jury, comprised of eight men and four women, completed Monday's deliberations without any indications as to how close they are to making a decision.</div>
<h3><a>Donald Trump Jr. Calls Dr. Fauci a 'Tyrant' for Supporting Vaccine Mandates on US Flights</a></h3>
<div>"So what then, force people at gunpoint?" Trump Jr. wrote. "This man is a tyrant and a threat to whatever freedom we have left."</div>
<p>Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Charles Donohoe were indicted in March and charged with conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding, among other charges, and remain in jail leading up to their trial scheduled for May 2022.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said the four men had many other options that actually are protected under the First Amendment to protest the election and express their thoughts about its results in a nonviolent, legal manner.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers also argued that the obstruction charge doesn't apply to their clients' cases because <a>Congress</a>' certification of the Electoral College vote was not an "official proceeding." Kelly disagreed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, another judge in the District of Columbia's federal court upheld prosecutors' use of the same obstruction charge in a separate case against two riot defendants.</p>
<p>Other extremist group members have been charged with conspiring to carry out coordinated attacks on the Capitol, including more than 20 people linked to the anti-government Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Nordean and Donohoe declined to comment on Tuesday's ruling. Attorneys for Rehl and Biggs didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>On the morning of Jan. 6, Proud Boys members met at the Washington Monument and marched to the Capitol before President <a>Donald Trump</a> finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House.</p>
<p>More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. At least 165 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor offenses punishable by a maximum of six months' imprisonment.</p>

<p>The state should also help to pay for testing done at county sites, Demings said.</p>
<p>Local governments, like in Orange County, where Orlando is located, have been forced to manage the COVID surge on their own, as Omicron quickly overtook the Delta variant as the dominant strain in Florida.</p>
<p>Some counties have reimplemented mask mandates for government workers and other municipalities have created additional testing sites due to demand.</p>
<a>Republicans</a> through his opposition to lockdowns and other virus rules.
<p>"A lot of people are wanting to get tested," Pino said.</p>
<p>In Palm Beach County, people were waiting for four hours to get a COVID-19 test at Gaines Park, the West Palm Beach <a>Police</a> Department said in a tweet.</p>
<p>At another site in Palm Beach County, dozens of people were in line before the testing site opened.</p>
<p>"It's a big line. We got here at 7 o'clock and there were already probably 50 to 60 cars over there," Ned Massee <a>told</a> television station WPTV. "We knew it was going to be crowded. That's why we came so early."</p>
<p>Officials in Miami-Dade County opened two new coronavirus testing sites and extended hours for testing at Zoo Miami in response to an increased demand.</p>
<p>"We are working around the clock to make sure Miami-Dade residents have access to testing to protect themselves and their loved ones during the holiday season," Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said in a news release on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She said the county has also distributed 152,000 take-home rapid test kits.</p>
<p>"Our residents are doing the right thing by getting tested if they were exposed, have symptoms, or to take extra precautions during the holidays, and that's why we are doing everything we can to expand access to testing countywide," the mayor said.</p>
<p>The Zoo Miami site is open for testing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, said Ron Gonçalves, General Manager for NOMI Health Florida.</p>
<p>"We don't have enough words to thank NOMI's frontline workers who are putting their lives on the line in administering tens of thousands of tests and vaccines daily, working long hours — even during the holidays," Gonçalves said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Demings said Tuesday that all Orange County workers would be required to wear face masks while on the job.</p>
<p>Officials in Hillsborough County, which is home to Tampa, also said that face coverings would be required in all indoor county facilities for workers and visitors regardless of a person's vaccination status starting Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The measure is being taken as a precaution for the health and safety of county employees as well as residents," Hillsborough County said in a statement.</p>

<p>Texas police arrested Richard Acosta Jr., the alleged getaway car driver for a weekend shooting that killed three teenagers and critically wounded a fourth, but say the gunman remains at large.</p>
<p>Acosta was charged with capital murder. He is being held on a $1 million bond and has no identified lawyer currently.</p>
<p>The suspected shooter is shown in the surveillance footage wearing a baseball hat, a blue surgical mask, and dark-colored athletics shorts. Authorities have not named a suspect.</p>
<p>"The shooter is at large," Lt. Pedro Barineau told <a>The Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, city police also said the 14-year-old boy who was initially identified as a suspect by Garland authorities Monday was released to his family and is "not being charged at this time."</p>
<p>The 14-year-old cooperated with investigators and was released due to new information investigators acquired after Acosta turned himself in.</p>
<p>"Detectives learned the 14-year-old male who was taken into custody has intimate knowledge of the shooting and he is cooperating with the investigation," said the Garland <a>Police</a> in a news release, according to <a>KDFW Fox 4 News</a>.</p>
<p>He is still a person of interest in the case, though, <a>KDFW Fox 4 News</a> reported.</p>

<p>Police said the shooter fired more than 20 rounds from a .40-caliber pistol before fleeing in the Dodge Ram pickup driven by Acosta, who they said also brought the gunman to the gas station,</p>
<p>Those killed were 14-year-old Xavier Gonazalez, 16-year-old Ivan Noyala, and 17-year-old Rafael Garcia, according to police. Before releasing their names, police had said two of the dead were 16 years old.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old who was a cook at the store was taken to the hospital following the shooting. Barineau said he is expected to survive.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooting was a retaliatory attack on one or more of the people in the store, Barineau said.</p>

<div> News Navy <a>Water contamination</a> <a>Pearl Harbor</a></div>
<p>The Navy has yet to say anything after a hearing officer recommended a facility polluting water near Pearl Harbor be defueled.</p>
<p>The Navy challenged the order, resulting in a hearing before the final ruling from the Department of Health.</p>
<p>The Navy must comply with the order "for the sake of our aquifer," he said, "and if they have any hope of rebuilding trust with our community that they have lost."</p>
<p>The water supply board stepped in due to concerns that the facilities could potentially contaminate more than just the Navy's own water system.</p>
<p>The Navy needs to admit that the facility, which began operating in 1943, has outlived its usefulness and that the fuel needs to be removed immediately, Lau said.</p>
<p>If the Navy persists in fighting the order, "the Board of Water Supply won't give up," Lau said. "And I'm not trying to threaten the Navy but understand that you are going to need to deal with us, whether you like it or not."</p>
<p>A Navy spokesperson said officials have nothing more to add on Tuesday, pointing to a statement by Rear Admiral Charlie Brown, the Navy's chief of information: "We are aware of the proposed decision and have no further statement at this time."</p>
<p>Lau said he hadn't yet received a response to a letter he sent last week asking President Joe Biden to intervene.</p>

<p>John Kevin McVoy Jr. was sentenced to 35 years to life for shooting and killing Susan Garcia while she was holding her 2-year-old son during an argument about the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>McVoy, 40, of Corona, California, was given the maximum sentence Monday, according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. He was convicted of murder last month.</p>
<p>McVoy was in a garage band with the victim's husband, Victor Garcia. Prosecutors said the two men argued over politics at Garcia's home in North Long Beach while practicing on Jan. 10, 2017.</p>
<p>McVoy was teased for saying he voted for Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Garcia told him to leave, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Irene Lee said Garcia snapped his fingers, pointed at the door, and said "Get the (expletive) out of my house," the <a>Long Beach Press-Telegram</a> reported.</p>

<p>Victor Garcia was shot in the head. He told the court on Monday that he was in a coma for months, underwent two brain surgeries and still has physical issues.</p>
<p>McVoy said he didn't intend to hurt anyone and apologized to the family.</p>
<p>"As far as my remorse, I think about this every day," he said.</p>
<p>At trial, McVoy's attorney argued that he shot Garcia in self-defense after being threatened but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Laura Laesekce said McVoy was at fault for bringing the loaded gun and aiming it at Garcia.</p>
<p>"There's no reason to be pointing a gun," she said. "Mr. Garcia should not bear the weight of this crime."</p>
