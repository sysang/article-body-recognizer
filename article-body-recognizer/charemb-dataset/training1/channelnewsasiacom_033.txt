<p>Meanwhile there are other reasons why cinemas could remain an integral part of daily life in Singapore.</p>
<p>“It’s been very attractive for retail malls to have cinemas … so in that context I think cinemas can always get good deals from landlords,” he said.</p>
<p>Each online session attracted an average of 30 to 50 participants from all walks of life.</p>
<p>While an interesting experience, Mr Tan believes that there will still be those who prefer to head back to the cinemas, especially for films that lend themselves better to the big screen or are not readily accessible online.</p>
<p>People are also keen to get back to a life with some degree of normality, he said, and returning to the cinemas like how it used to be before the pandemic is one thing that would help.</p>
<p>"It’s like exorcising the ghosts of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>“LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL”</p>
<p>With that, industry players seem reasonably confident that crowds will return to the cinemas – it’s just a case of when.</p>
<p>Progress in the country’s vaccination programme, as well as around key markets such as the United States, is one cause for optimism, they said.</p>
<p>Cinemas are also hoping the line-up of pandemic-postponed blockbusters will lure audiences back. Among the first out of the gate is the ninth instalment of the popular Fast Furious franchise, which officially opened in Singapore this week. </p>
<p>The latest in the racing film franchise already shattered pandemic box office records during its first weekend in the United States, with one media report calling it “<a>the strongest sign yet that life is left in movie theatres</a>”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Fast Furious 9 puts charge back into US movie theatres with US$70m opening</a></h3>
<p>Others coming up include Marvel’s superhero film Black Widow, DC comics film The Suicide Squad and action movie Top Gun Maverick.</p>
<p>“There is light at the end of the tunnel as the situation in the US has improved and studios are starting to schedule new releases,” said Mr Lau.</p>
<p>Mr Shaw reckoned that a box office recovery could “come pretty quickly with the huge pent-up stream of films” but he quickly added that operators will only be “doing as well as (they) are allowed to”.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be entirely up to the rules and regulations as to how many people will and can come to the cinemas,” he said.</p>
<p>Golden Village’s Ms Cheo noted that if reduced cinema capacities are to be extended into the last quarter of 2021 and beyond, more support may be needed.</p>
<p>That is why some operators are hoping for the current 50-person cap on attendance to be lifted.</p>
<p>While cinema halls can admit up to 250 people as long as they conduct pre-event testing, it “wouldn’t stack economically” for operators to do so, said Ms Tan from The Projector.</p>
<p>First, cinemas find it hard to absorb the cost of these tests and the hiring of additional manpower to administer them. DIY test kits are also out of the question as they cost around the same price as a movie ticket.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Cinemas, religious organisations to cut capacity to 100 people to avoid pre-event testing requirement</a></h3>
<p>Ms Tan is also unsure if cinema-goers will want to put up with the extra cost and inconvenience of pre-event testing for a movie.</p>
<p>NEW EXPERIENCES FOR THE FUTURE?</p>
<p>That said, Ms Cheo noted there are “many opportunities” ahead for the industry here to not just recover, but also potentially grow.</p>
<p>“As compared to other developed markets, Singapore has room to grow in terms of average box office spending and per capita cinema attendance,” she said.</p>
<p>The way forward, according to Golden Village, is to have “quality offerings in quality settings” such as its “new-generation cinemas”.</p>
<p>Last year, the company also entered into a proposed merger with Cathay Cineplexes, the third biggest cinema chain in Singapore. Both chains stated in the filing that they hope a merger will bring in more investors and create economies of scale.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Golden Village-Cathay merger proposed; will become Singapore's largest cinema operator if approved</a></h3>
<p>Smaller operators are also banking on unique experiences to set them apart.</p>
<p>EagleWings Cinematics, for instance, has already converted one of its standard halls into one that is more premium with fewer seats, side tables for meals and access to its lounge.</p>
<p>Its premium halls that seat between 12 to 18 people are also more pocket-friendly for those who want to rent the space for marriage proposals, birthday parties and other events, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Projector is about two months into its pop-up initiative – a 48-seat cinema, cafe-bar and creative space located in Clarke Quay that was transformed out of an abandoned Chinese nightclub.</p>
<p>Projector X, as it is called, will be on until the end of next year. </p>
<p>More importantly, the pop-up project allows experimentation with new cinema experiences such as food pairings with film.</p>
<p>“When we opened Projector X, I think a lot of eyebrows were raised but for us, it was also a good opportunity to do something positive in a whole negative landscape," said the founder.</p>
<p>Ms Tan and her team are also working on a new 150-seat, single-screen cinema at Grange Road. The permanent outlet is set to open late next year or early 2023.</p>
<p>“Our unique selling point has always been the fact that we are not your average cinema – not just our film, but our event programming and the vibe and energy you get when you come into our space.</p>
<p>“I think that's something that you can’t replicate easily, and what will continue to attract people,” she said.</p>
<p>For Mr Shaw, while it remains too early to speculate how the pandemic will alter the cinema experience, he said operators will need to be nimble and prepared for another COVID-19-like crisis.</p>
<p>Shaw Theatres has already been experimenting with different concepts, such as its kid-friendly hall in Jewel Changi Airport which features child-safe edges, soft lighting and lower-than-usual sound volume during screenings.</p>
<p>Asked if the cinema business will remain a profitable one in future, the affable Shaw family scion nodded with a laugh: “Yes – otherwise why be in a business that you know is going to fail? Just because this is a legacy business?”</p>
<p>“I remember the day last year when we announced to the staff that we were closing, and I told them that we’ll be back. We did and while the situation remains difficult, this too will pass.”</p>

<div> <div> <a> Ahmad Zhaki Abdullah </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Like many newlyweds, Elizabeth hopes to have a home of her own, where she can start a family with her husband. </p>
<p>However, the process of balloting for a Build-to-Order (BTO) flat, then having to wait at least another three to four years for the flat to be ready would take too long, she said. </p>
<p>“I've seen some cases with my friends who try (applying for a flat) several times and they don't get it, so we don't have that time to go ballot, and possibly have to wait more than five years,” she told CNA. </p>
<p>As such, the 27-year-old marketing associate is now looking for a resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat where she can start a family. </p>
<p>From the COVID-19 outbreak in migrant worker dormitories last year to disruptions in the supply chain for construction materials and restrictions on the entry of foreign labour, the ongoing pandemic has impacted the supply of public housing. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Smaller homes, shorter-lease units: How Singapore's housing landscape might change amid population shifts</a></h3>
<p>In April, the Ministry of National Development warned that about 85 per cent of BTO projects were about six to nine months behind schedule. </p>
<p>These delays have helped sparked greater demand for resale flats among home buyers, said ERA head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak. </p>
<p>“There's a strong demand for resale flats and the supply of resale is inflexible,” said Mr Mak. </p>
<p>“So as a result, we see demand stronger than supply (and) prices go up.”</p>

<p>RESALE PRICES ON THE RISE </p>
<p>Resale flat prices have been on the rise, with figures released by real estate portal SRX on Thursday (Jul 8) showing that prices for such flats had risen for 12 straight months as of June this year.</p>
<p>There was a 13.2 per cent year-on-year increase in the prices of resale flats from June last year, the data showed. </p>
<p>There was a year-on-year increase in resale prices across all flat types, with three-room units showing the greatest increase at 14.8 per cent.</p>
<p>Four-room units increased by 12 per cent, five-room homes showed an 11.6 per cent increase and executive flats went up 12.3 per cent. </p>
<p>The prices for mature estates increased by 10.9 per cent, while those for non-mature estates shot up 14.9 per cent from a year ago, SRX noted.</p>
<p>USE THE MAP TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN EXPECT TO PAY FOR A RESALE FLAT:</p>
<p>SRX figures showed that there were 30,834 resale flats sold between June 2020 and June this year. </p>
<p>Data released by HDB earlier this year showed there were 24,748 resale units sold in 2020, up from 23,714 in 2019. </p>
<p>According to SRX, there were 106 HDB flats that were sold for more than S$1 million in the first six months of 2021 alone - a threefold increase from the same period last year. </p>
<p>Industry watchers pointed to several other reasons for the rising prices. </p>
<p>Professor Sing also pointed to the “ultra-low” interest rate as another factor that induced more demand in the resale HDB market. </p>
<h3><a>READ: BTO projects expected 'to be delayed' by a year or more due to tightened COVID-19 border measures</a></h3>
<p>“Over 25,500 flats are estimated to reach their MOP this year, making them eligible to be sold in the resale market. These ‘younger’ flats, with longer leases and newer condition, also tend to fetch higher resale prices,” he added. </p>
<p>There is likely to be some continuing “upward pressure” on resale prices in the coming quarters, said Mr Ismail. </p>
<p>“For the full year 2021, we are projecting HDB resale prices to grow by 9 per cent to 10 per cent, owing to the sustained demand for HDB resale flats,” he said. </p>
<p>For now, high resale prices are skewed towards more mature, centrally located towns, said Prof Sing, although he noted that the increases could spill over to newer estates such as Punggol and Sengkang. </p>
<p>The median resale price for a four-room flat in Sengkang - where the oldest flats were built in 1997 - is S$472,000. </p>
<p>In Queenstown - which dates back to the 1950s - that figure is S$801,444.</p>
<p>Still, Propnex’s Mr Ismail noted that in non-mature towns, the average resale price had in fact been rising for 10 straight quarters, since the first quarter of 2019. </p>
<p>“In mature towns where flats tend to be costlier, their prices may grow at a slower clip as there could be some resistance to higher asking prices.”</p>

<p>THE ISSUE OF CASH OVER VALUATION </p>
<p>Prof Sing pointed that one of the issues that may affect the affordability of such flats for buyers is that of Cash Over Valuation (COV) prices, noting these would increase given the current resale flat boom. </p>
<p>COV refers to the difference between the transacted price and the unit’s official valuation by the HDB, which buyers must pay fully in cash.</p>
<p>This raised concerns in the 2010s, when some used official valuations as a base price, while negotiating the COV to add on to it. </p>
<p>HDB eventually stopped publishing COV data in 2014 and changed the system such that a flat’s valuation would only be revealed after buyers and sellers had agreed on a transaction price.</p>
<p>However, with resale prices again on the rise, the issue of COV prices is in the spotlight once again. </p>
<p>“COVs still appear in the current hot markets, when more buyers are chasing after limited supply in the resale market,” said Prof Sing. </p>
<h3><a>READ: More HDB resale flat buyers willing to pay prices higher than units' valuation, say property agents</a></h3>
<p>CNA reported in January that some property agents noted that 90 per cent of their resale transactions now entailed COV sums ranging from S$5,000 to S$20,000. </p>
<p>In April, TODAY reported that COV prices of between S$100,000 and S$200,000 were not unheard of, quoting one buyer who had paid a COV sum of about S$160,000 for a 27-year-old five-room HDB flat in Pasir Ris that month. </p>
<p>“COV has the unfortunate effect of accelerating the price growth, because no matter what the valuation is, the COV just pulls up the price further in the next month, in the next quarter,” said ERA’s Mr Mak. </p>
<p>One solution would be to simply ban the paying of COV, he said. </p>
<p>Mr Mak noted, however, that this may not solve the problem as buyers may just end up discreetly paying the amount to sellers to secure the flat that they want, without declaring it to the authorities. </p>
<p>Property analyst Ong Kah Seng said the resurfacing of high COVs could point to stiff competition between buyers trying to outbid one another. </p>
<p>This could result in buyers’ remorse should they realise they “overbid” for a flat, he said, urging buyers to do their due diligence and carefully consider buying a resale flat. </p>

<p>ACTING ‘AGAINST THE INSTINCT OF THE MARKET’</p>
<p>Rising resale prices have not escaped the attention of the authorities. </p>
<p>Speaking during the Committee of Supply debate for his ministry in March this year, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee pointed to the need to keep flats affordable. </p>
<p>For HDB flats in future developments such as the Greater Southern Waterfront, a new housing model would be introduced, he said. </p>
<p>“In short, as a social policy, we have to act against the instinct of the market,” he said. </p>
<p>Suggestions such as limiting the pool of resale buyers or imposing a longer minimum occupation period had been raised, he noted then. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Keeping public housing in prime locations like Greater Southern Waterfront affordable and fair</a></h3>
<p>NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING</p>
<p>Mr Ismail suggested that a fall in the resale prices of HDB flats may not necessarily be a positive thing. </p>
<p>Public housing remains the most affordable option here, he said, adding that the recent uptick in HDB resale prices is “not necessarily a bad thing”, coming after six years of price declines. </p>
<p>As for Elizabeth, although she cited cost as a consideration in choosing the right flat, the marketing associate said she is not willing to wait for prices to come down.</p>
<p>The enduring high demand for resale flats means fierce competition with others, she noted. </p>
<p>“I think if we see a unit now that we really, really like - then I think there is also a chance that someone else might want that unit as well,” she said.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Imagine being in a large, dark house - there are cameras, but you can't see in all the corners. </p>
<p>This is how Mr Eric Nagel, general manager for APAC at cybersecurity firm Cybereason, characterises the way the company hunted down a ransomware attack in a high-end Asian manufacturing company.</p>
<p>In a ransomware attack, hackers - or threat actors - use malicious software to encrypt files on a device, then demand ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, to undo their work.</p>
<p>The first signs of suspicion in this attack came from some abnormal communication between machines. Aware that something was wrong, but not knowing why, the company reached out for help.</p>
<p>Working like snipers, Cybereason threat hunters searched for the ransomware, while sales engineers and technical consultants mapped the enterprise’s ecology, pinning down the servers, workstations, laptops and operating systems.</p>
<p>Then they deployed the latest cybersecurity solution - an endpoint detection and response tool, also known as EDR.</p>
<p>The EDR tools works "a little bit like putting on all the lights and shining a spotlight everywhere in your house. So if something’s hidden in the corner, you'll find it,” said Mr Nagel.</p>
<p>Within a few days, an image of the attack had started to form.</p>

<h3><a>READ: 200 businesses hit by ransomware after breach at Florida IT firm</a></h3>
<p>Although the manufacturing company was only in the beginning stages of an attack, some of its assets had already been subjected to ransomware. Some files and computers had already been encrypted.</p>
<p>“In this particular case, it was more targeted and the company was never at systemic risk, but they were able to bring in services and technology quickly to mitigate, before it gets out of hand.”</p>
<p>Taking swift action to isolate the infected assets, the team was able to prevent the company from having to pay the ransom.</p>
<p>The attack on the manufacturing company is part of an increasing trend of ransomware incidents occurring globally.</p>
<p>This year, there have been some high-profile ransomware hacks. In July, a hit on US IT company Kaseya affected up to 1,500 businesses in 17 countries and paralysed hundreds of Swedish supermarkets. The perpetrators demanded S$70 million in bitcoin.</p>

<p>Two months before, a <a>ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline</a>, a US energy company, forced it to temporarily halt all its operations on a major pipeline that delivers nearly half of all fuel consumed on the US’s east coast.</p>
<p>Singapore has not been spared from similar high-profile attacks. In February, a ransomware group <a>stole the personal data of about 129,000 Singtel customers</a> after they breached a third-party file-sharing system.</p>
<p>The hackers stole information including names, addresses, phone numbers, identification numbers and dates of birth, as well as the bank account details of 28 former Singtel employees.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Cybercrime made up 43% of overall crime in 2020; more online threats linked to COVID-19</a></h3>
<p>Earlier this month, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) released its annual report on Singapore’s cyber landscape. There were 89 ransomware cases reported in 2020, a 154 per cent rise from the 35 cases reported in the previous year.</p>
<p>“Based on the reported ransomware cases, these local incidents were likely related to, and a consequence of, the global ransomware outbreak,” wrote CSA in its report.</p>
<p>“The pervasiveness of ransomware was never more pronounced than in 2020, as ransomware cartels innovated their tactics at an accelerating pace to ride on the pandemic wave.”</p>
<p>Average ransom payments also increased, as criminals targeted larger enterprises.</p>
<p>On its website, CSA noted that ransomware commonly spreads through phishing emails with malicious links or attachments. When victims click on those links or attachments, they will download ransomware from an external server.</p>
<p>Other methods of installing ransomware include malicious advertisements online, exploiting remote computer connections, unpatched Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and spam campaigns.</p>
<p>Sensitive and proprietary information could be lost if the data was not backed up.</p>
<p>To pressure victims to pay the ransom, threat actors may also threaten to publish the data online.</p>
<p>EVOLUTION OF RANSOMWARE TACTICS</p>
<p>A key trend in ransomware is the increasing sophistication of threat actors and their tactics.</p>
<p>Previously, ransomware groups only encrypted data. They would provide a key to decrypt the locked data after victims paid the ransom, said Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, general manager for Southeast Asia at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>
<p>Since two years ago, Kaspersky has observed organised crime groups getting involved and carrying out more targeted attacks.</p>
<p>“What they do is they use ransomware as a tool,” said Mr Yeo. “They go in, they lock up, and before they lock it up, they exfiltrate data, they pull the data out.”</p>
<p>Then these groups start to extort.</p>
<p>“Previously it was … you don’t pay, okay you lose the file, you have to reconstruct (the data) from your backup. But now, they will release it to the web,” said Mr Yeo.</p>
<p>Citing the prolific ransomware group Maze, which shut down in 2020, Mr Yeo noted that it had a website where they would gradually release more information until their clients gave in.</p>
<p>“That is the worrisome thing,” said Mr Yeo. “(It) is not just ransomware alone, it’s also the data exfiltration and the extortion.”</p>
<p>Said Mr Ng: “We are really looking at the growth of ransomware business as an organised crime business, and that has taken off significantly over the past few years, and particularly accelerated during our COVID-19 lockdown period.”</p>
<p>SINGAPORE AS A POTENTIAL TARGET</p>
<p>According to cybersecurity experts, Singapore is already an attractive target for ransomware groups. </p>
<p>Being a “highly digitalised society” with “very high” internet penetration, Singapore can expect a lot of ransomware attacks, said Mr Ng.</p>
<p>More digitalisation means that the “attack surfaces are always expanding to an attacker”, he added. As such, organisations need to pay attention to cybersecurity measures to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Singapore is also the Asia-Pacific headquarters for many companies, with “a concentration of data, a concentration of people”, said Mr Yeo. This makes the country a “sweet target” for ransomware groups.</p>
<p>He found that many companies in Singapore, like in other countries, still use traditional antivirus technologies from Symantec and McAfee, “still protecting against the risks of old”.</p>
<p>According to Mr Yeo, favourite targets are banks and telecommunication companies. Although service providers - such as those who provide hosting or outsourcing services - are commonly overlooked, they are prime targets as well.</p>
<h3><a>READ: SolarWinds hack was 'largest and most sophisticated attack' ever - Microsoft president</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: ‘No indication’ that SolarWinds hack adversely affected Singapore, says Iswaran</a></h3>
<p>With more adoption of technology and digital services, technology service providers become targets as they are able to “aggregate access” to many other enterprises, said Mr Ng.</p>
<p>“Because these entities will be keen to resume operations quickly and they will therefore be more willing to pay,” he added.</p>
<p>According to CSA’s report, small- and medium-enterprises (SMEs) comprised the majority of ransomware cases, even though ransomware operators were also looking for larger victims in the manufacturing, retail and healthcare sectors.</p>
<p>SMEs fall prey to ransomware more often as IT is probably not top of their concern, said Mr Yeo, adding that they might also feel that they are too small to be targeted.</p>
<p>But this is not true, he said. SMEs usually become victims to “spray and pray” tactics, where attackers send out as many spam messages, malicious emails or fake advertisements as possible to get users to download the ransomware.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE’S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>Companies are not the only organisations in hackers’ crosshairs. Globally, attackers have disrupted critical infrastructure and their actions have put lives at risk.</p>
<p>Last year, a ransomware attack caused IT systems at a German hospital to fail. A patient requiring urgent care had to be taken to another city, which delayed her treatment and led to her death.</p>
<p>In this month’s Singapore Parliament sitting, Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo noted that ransomware attacks are no longer contained in the digital domain.</p>
<p>“They now spill over into the physical realm, with real-world consequences. We have seen this globally, with the recent uptick in international ransomware attacks.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: New Zealand health systems hackers release patient details to the media</a></h3>
<p>In response to CNA’s queries about attacks on critical infrastructure, CSA said that to date there has been no indication to suggest that Singapore has been targeted by any ransomware group.</p>
<p>“However, we are not letting our guard down,” its spokesperson said.</p>
<p>To date, Singapore has also not experienced any ransomware attacks of a massive and systemic nature, or any which have impacted its Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators.</p>
<p>The critical sectors include energy, water, banking and finance, healthcare, transport, government, infocomm, media and security and emergency services.</p>
<p>Some of necessary measures include improving their detection of anomalous activity swiftly, backing up data regularly and keeping the backup offline and practising incident response and business continuity plans in case of a ransomware attack.</p>
<h3><a>READ: New initiative to help manage cybersecurity risks in Singapore’s critical information infrastructure</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Personal data of about 30,000 e2i clients potentially exposed after malware attack on vendor’s employee</a></h3>
<p>“These are on top of existing cyber resilience measures mandated for the CII sectors under the Cybersecurity Act,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Cybereason’s Mr Nagel thinks that Singapore is “not very far away” from a high-profile attack on its systems.</p>
<p>According to him, Singapore’s EDR deployment is about 40 per cent, similar to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“So the fact that most companies have still not deployed the newer breed of cyber solutions creates an opportunity for companies to get hit by ransomware or some other form of attack.”</p>
<p>He used the 2018 SingHealth personal data breach as an example of a cyberattack. About 1.5 million SingHealth’s patients’ records were accessed and copied, while 160,000 of those had their outpatient dispensed medicines’ records taken.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Singapore health system hit by ‘most serious breach of personal data’ in cyberattack; PM Lee's data targeted</a></h3>
<p>The data taken included names, NRIC numbers, address, gender, race and date of birth.</p>
<p>He also cited Singtel’s data breach.</p>
<p>While he found that CSA has done a “very good job” at improving awareness, having discussions with the public and private sector as well as driving the cybersecurity agenda, organisations still need to adopt EDR solutions.</p>
<p>“I think there’s still work to be done in the adoption, and that will minimise the risk to critical infrastructure and big enterprise in Singapore,” he said.</p>
<p>High-profile and systemic attacks are unavoidable, said Mr Yeo, adding that it is only a matter of “when and how”. </p>
<p>“It’s not whether you get attacked. It’s how you defend, how you minimise if you get it,” he said.</p>
<p>SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY POSTURE</p>
<p>Singapore is “one mark above” other countries, said Mr Yeo. “But that doesn’t mean that we should let our guards down.”</p>
<p>Regulatory pressure in Singapore is “well ahead”, he said, with CSA defining the country’s critical industry and who is supposed to regulate the industry, with regulations including data protection.</p>
<p>What companies need to do better, however, is taking responsibility. According to Mr Yeo’s observations, companies will outsource services such as finance or human resources and then neglect cybersecurity in those areas.</p>
<p>“It is important that they understand that they don’t outsource the security,” he said. Companies should either do an audit of the service provider or buy the add-on security package if the service provider offers one.</p>
<p>In addition, individuals are not taking the necessary steps to secure their own home networks, especially with Singapore’s current work-from-home arrangements.</p>
<p>Singapore must continue to increase its vigilance and awareness about evolving threats, said Mr Ng, as attackers will continue to look for new vulnerabilities and exploit people’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>“When you can do so, you can help yourself to reduce your exposure to cyberattacks and being able to do so, you can discover your footprint, identify potential data compromises … potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>“It can help you to reduce your own risks, whether your own organisation, or third-party, or supply chain, before attackers can do so,” he said.</p>
<p>FOR COMPANIES HIT BY RANSOMWARE</p>
<p>In June, Cybereason released research findings that showed that more than 50 per cent of organisations globally have been victims of a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Of the 100 companies surveyed in Singapore, Cybereason found that 90 per cent of businesses that chose to pay a ransom suffered a second ransomware attack, often at the hands of the same threat group.</p>
<p>So what should companies do, when falling victim to a ransomware attack? Kaspersky’s Mr Yeo has a simple word of advice: “Ask for help.”</p>
<p>“A lot of companies, they think they can solve it - they can’t. When they are hit by ransomware, it goes to show not just a ransomware problem. It goes to show that actually, the defence is a problem. That’s how they can get hit,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that even if companies solve the current problem, they have to do a “proper cleaning” and beef up their defences or they will get hit again.</p>
<p>HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE?</p>
<p>On whether Singapore should be worried about ransomware hacks, Mr Nagel said: “I think companies generally (are) not prepared enough.”</p>

<h1> Commentary: Binance’s exchange closure in Singapore could usher in more regulations on cryptocurrencies </h1>
<p>Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange with a daily turnover of US$76 billion, has withdrawn its application to start a cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore. This could herald more regulatory clampdowns, says NTU’s Chen Tao.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Chen Tao </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: News of Binance’s withdrawal of its cryptocurrency exchange application from Singapore on Dec 13 sent a small ripple that dampened investor sentiment towards the emerging global cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies extended declines after Binance’s move. Bitcoin, the world’s largest digital coin, fell as much as 3 per cent to about US$48,484, while Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency, dropped as much as 4.1 per cent. </p>
<p>The decision came at a critical time, as Binance is set to announce its decision for a global headquarters soon.</p>
<p>Binance’s move dampened speculation that Singapore, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is in the running. </p>
<h2>BINANCE IS NOT LEAVING SINGAPORE</h2>
<p>However, it’s too soon to conclude that Binance’s withdrawal is a setback. Closing its Singapore cryptocurrency trading platform does not mean the company is losing its business altogether in Singapore.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Binance has made moves to anchor itself in the financial hub. </p>
<p>Binance has invested in Singapore’s private securities exchange Hg Exchange (HGX) recently, acquiring an 18 per cent stake in the company just two weeks ago.</p>
<p>HGX has a Recognised Market Operator license. It currently trades shares in private companies as well as tokenised assets including rare whisky, art and real estate. </p>
<p>Through this investment, Binance can continue to grow its crypto business in Singapore. </p>
<p>Besides, Binance also plans to set up a blockchain innovation hub in Singapore, exploring initiatives such as incubation programmes, blockchain education and further investment opportunities.</p>
<h2>BINANCE IS UNDOUBTEDLY FACING REGULATORY PRESSURE</h2>
<p>With Binance’s growing global influence, regulators around the world have concerns its cryptocurrency exchanges could be used for money laundering or that investors could fall victim to scams and runaway bets. </p>
<p>Due to its opaque corporate structure, lack of financial information, as well as complex and high-risk financial product design, Binance is said to be “not capable of being effectively supervised”, according to UK financial regulators. </p>
<p>Authorities in Japan, Britain, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Lithuania, and Thailand are all paying closer attention to the company.</p>
<p>Some have banned the platform from specified activities, while others have issued warnings to consumers that they have no recourse to regulatory action if deals go south.</p>
<p>Although Singapore is considered a friendly destination for Binance to set up a new cryptocurrency exchange, the entity also faced strong pushback from Singapore’s regulators over concerns on weak consumer protection mechanisms. </p>
<p>While Binance claimed to have made improvements, it reportedly failed to meet the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s requirement for protection against money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
<p>And among several regulatory issues, a big one that prevents Binance from qualifying is the mystery of its global headquarters – which has tax and regulatory implications.</p>
<h2>DID MAS PULL THE TRIGGER TOO EARLY?</h2>
<p>The withdrawal comes after the MAS in September ordered Binance Singapore to stop all crypto transfers with the global exchange binance.com, which the regulator placed on an investor alert list. </p>
<p>So what’s really behind Binance’s withdrawal of its crypto exchange in Singapore? </p>
<p>Still, I wouldn’t read too much into these developments. This is but one more chapter in Binance’s long tussle with regulators all over the world, as the company adapts to regulatory pressures.</p>
<h2>FURTHER IMPLICATIONS FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES AND BLOCKCHAIN SECTOR</h2>
<p>However, Binance’s withdrawal could be a sign that the wheels are turning against cryptocurrency as regulators clamp down on this “wild wild west”.</p>
<p>A loose global regulatory landscape has allowed such firms to thrive. Binance has accumulated a huge following across the world, with channels on Telegram – a cross-platform instant messaging application – for users in more than 30 countries. </p>
<p>However, many industry experts agree that the largely unregulated development of the cryptocurrency industry in general and Binance in particular will soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>We can expect major cryptocurrency markets around the world, including the US, UK and several Asian markets, to impose more restrictions on the cryptocurrency industry in the near future.</p>
<p>Financial regulators are increasingly concerned that digital assets are growing drastically and should be regarded as systemically important so that speculation and undue risks that can spill over into the real economy can be curbed.</p>
<p>Given its anonymity, decentralised nature and rapid development, regulators now need to look at this new market of blockchain and crypto more broadly and work closely with market players to build a healthy regulatory environment.</p>
<p>As Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao once put it, the key to their growth lies in gaining user trust. Zhao also pointed out that despite the rapid development in digital capital, no more than 2 per cent of the world's population use cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>"In order to attract those 98 per cent of people, we need to be regulated," he said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> World economy to top US$100 trillion in 2022 for first time: Report </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: The world's economic output will exceed US$100 trillion for the first time next year and it will take China a little longer than previously thought to overtake the United States as the number one economy, a report showed on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>"The important issue for the 2020s is how the world economies cope with inflation, which has now reached 6.8 per cent in the U.S.," said Cebr deputy chairman Douglas McWilliams.</p>
<p>"We hope that a relatively modest adjustment to the tiller will bring the non-transitory elements under control. If not, then the world will need to brace itself for a recession in 2023 or 2024."</p>
<p>The report showed Germany was on track to overtake Japan in terms of economic output in 2033. Russia could become a Top 10 economy by 2036 and Indonesia looks on track for ninth place in 2034.</p>

<p>In its latest report, the ETRI said diesel fuel, gasoline and kerosene consumption are forecast to peak sometime around 2025 at about 390 million tonnes per year. The strong petrochemical demand will support rising consumption through to 2030.</p>
<p>Overall oil demand will fall after 2030 as transportation consumption declines amid the electrification of vehicles while chemical demand remains stable during the period, the ETRI said.</p>
<p>The ETRI also revised the peak of China's total primary energy consumption to 6.01 billion tonnes per year of standard coal by around 2030, from 5.6 billion tonnes per year by around 2035 previously.</p>
<p>This follows plans from the government to reduce coal consumption in China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, in an "orderly" manner as part of its drive to reach a peak in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>China's top leaders said at an agenda-setting meeting this month that the "gradual withdrawal of traditional energy sources should be based on the establishment of safe and reliable of new energy sources".</p>
<p>The ETRI also forecast the consumption of natural gas, a key bridge fuel during the energy transition and carbon reduction, will peak by 2040 at about 650 billion cubic metres per year, led by consumption from industry and power generators.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON: Just as it was recovering from the body blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has taken yet another hit from the Omicron variant of the virus, which has led to <a>a raft of new travel restrictions</a>.</p>
<p>First reported to the World Health Organization in South Africa less than a week ago, the new strain has rapidly spread everywhere from Africa to the Pacific, and from Europe to Canada, causing dozens of countries to announce travel restrictions.</p>
<p>The severity of the economic impact will depend on how dangerous the variant proves to be, and how well existing vaccinations stand up to it.</p>
<p>That has meant that even with the most favorable scenarios in mind, economists are already revising their 2022 forecasts downwards.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, which expects growth of 4.9 per cent for the next year, has been insisting for months that the coronavirus and its variants remain the main threat.</p>
<p>The economic impact could be "modest," in the order of 0.25 percentage points on global growth in 2022, if Omicron causes "relatively mild symptoms" and the vaccines are "effective", said Gregory Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics.</p>
<p>Those aspects "are going to be really key to how it affects the global economy and people's behavior," said Erik Lundh, an economist at The Conference Board.</p>
<p>Beyond government measures to contain the new strain, fear of infection could lead people to limit their own travel and economic activities, such as going to restaurants and reducing consumption, which will in turn impact growth, Lundh said.</p>
<p>Another risk is the exacerbation of the global supply chain crunch. Lundh pointed out that "a lot of air cargo is stored basically in the belly of passenger planes ... It's not just all sorts of FedEx planes".</p>
<p>"So if there are cancellations, if there's a lapse in demand for commercial flights for passengers, it does run the risk of limiting the route of trade," which could in turn worsen inflationary pressures as goods become more scarce.</p>
<p>In addition, a wave of Omicron infections "could cause some workers to temporarily exit the workforce, and deter others from returning, making current labor shortages worse," said Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics in a note.</p>
<p>Omicron has sparked more anxiety than any other variant since the emergence of Delta, itself already much more contagious than previous strains.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden, however, said on Monday (Nov 29) that there was "not a cause for panic," even if the United States has closed its borders to travelers from the southern African region where the variant was first detected.</p>
<p>As for vaccine manufacturers, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax have expressed confidence in their ability to combat the variant.</p>
<h2>INTEREST RATE HIKE DELAYED?</h2>
<p>However, the threat of a potentially more serious variant will complicate the task of central banks which could "postpone plans to raise interest rates until the picture becomes clearer," said Shearing.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is due to meet on Dec 15, with several others, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England meeting the day after.</p>
<p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said it will be a few weeks before drug makers know most of what they need to know about the new strain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, "uncertainty is damaging", said economist Daco.</p>
<p>"Every time you come back to a climate of uncertainty and fear, it slows down the recovery of the world economy."</p>
<p>On Monday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell himself warned that Omicron is a risk for the US economy, which together with China and the European Union is one of the engines driving the global economy.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why China continues to rise </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Zhang Jun </a> </div> </div>
<p>SHANGHAI: In just four decades, China’s economy has achieved an unprecedented level of wealth and development, and, until recently, its upward trajectory of economic growth and prosperity seemed set to continue.</p>
<p>This is not good news for China, which would prefer that the world maintain the economic openness it achieved in recent decades.</p>
<p>For that reason, China had been working hard to align its economic and trade activities with international rules and norms. But now it seems that China must prepare for a future characterised by higher trade barriers and restrictions.</p>
<p>To this end, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan makes clear that the country will seek to reduce its dependence on external demand. The “dual-circulation strategy” announced in the plan instead emphasises reliance on the country’s huge population.</p>
<p>China also plans to invest heavily in cutting-edge sectors, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, and work to achieve self-sufficiency in core technologies.</p>
