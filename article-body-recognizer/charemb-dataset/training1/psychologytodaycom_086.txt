<a>sexual</a> abuse (CSA). Survivors of CSA are two times more likely to experience re-victimization as an adult and are four times at greater risk of experiencing adult
<a>sexual assault</a>. Re-victimization has been attributed to symptoms of dissociation and/or hyper-arousal diagnosed with post-
<a>stress</a> syndrome. The latter two responses of dissociation and hyper-arousal are the same mechanisms associated with a women’s vulnerability to re-victimization. The
<a>defense mechanism</a> of dissociation that is used to protect oneself against the overwhelming physical and emotional effects of child sexual abuse are the same mechanisms that allow for continued re-victimization.
<a>self-esteem</a>, faulty judgments, and unhealthy boundaries make these mothers and their children susceptible to further victimization.
<a>aggression</a>, thus reinforcing their position of victim and need to maintain a defended stance towards others.
<a>attention</a> and focus, make rational and effective decisions, and discern between real and imagined threats. This reduces the individual’s ability to respond effectively to real threats, leaving them vulnerable to re-victimization.
<a>resilient</a> qualities erode and they begin to suffer from mental health symptoms. Re-victimization in adulthood predisposes and/or exacerbates mental health concerns including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,
<a>anxiety</a>, substance use, and
<a>suicidal</a> ideation. Increased symptomatology resulting from re-victimization further compromises and impedes a woman’s functioning and compromises her mothering capacities and her ability to care for her children.

<p>During one of our sessions, June said she thought she was going crazy and losing touch with reality.</p>
<p>At the beginning of their relationship, Luke was loving, attentive, and generous to both June and her son. She was happy when Luke came into her life. He was charming and seemed kind, caring, and understanding. </p>

<p>T - What are you feeling?</p>
<p>June shut down, her breathing slowed, and her shoulders dropped. To contradict the collapse, I reminded June to breathe and to stay with the feelings. The breathing fostered June to experience the sadness.</p>
<p>T - Where in your body do you carry the sadness?</p>
<p>T - Breathe into your heart. What is happening in your heart?</p>
<p>J - My heart is beating fast and it is dark and heavy.</p>
<p>T - Your heart is beating fast and it is dark and heavy. Can you remember another time in your life when you were sad and your heart was beating fast and was dark and heavy?</p>
<p>T – How old were you?</p>
<p>T - What did the little girl under the covers, who was listening to her dad beat up her brother feel at that moment?</p>
<p>T - What did you decide about yourself in that moment?</p>
<p>J - I decided I was powerless and I could not make a difference. I could not help my brother and I could not stop my father from hurting him. I felt very alone and I was in a lot of pain with no one to go to. </p>
<p>T - How does not speaking up for yourself and your son with Luke resemble the 6-year-old? Who is your father and who is your brother?</p>
<a>fear</a> stopped me from protecting my son and myself from Luke. It is exactly the same.
<p>June started to cry. Her tears were long overdue.</p>

<h2> 23 questions to find personalized baby steps to get you out of burnout’s pit. </h2>
<p> Posted January 9, 2019 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Burnout? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>You may think of the typical burnout as someone who’s been struggling to stay in the middle class. But burnout is an equal opportunity attacker.</p>
<p>A number of my clients are seven-figure successful but felt <a>burned out</a>, empty, wondering whether all the effort was worth it.</p>
<p>At the other end of the socioeconomic continuum, many people are burned out because they've been unable to hold a job that sustains even a modest living, and their personal life is equally dispiriting.</p>
<p>Burnout can lead to undue <a>sex</a>, drugs, and rock 'n roll, and the sense that nothing matters, or at least that nothing matters enough to justify working hard to improve your life.</p>
<p>What’s a burnout to do?</p>
<p>Burnout tends to be all-encompassing, so it must be tackled a bite at a time. Perhaps these questions will help you identify your next bite.</p>
<p>Change place of employment?</p>
<p>Improve skill set? (Hard skills or soft, e.g., listening, <a>management</a> of time, <a>stress</a>, <a>anger</a>?)</p>
<p>Reduce or eliminate substance use?</p>
<p>Increase, decrease, or otherwise change exercise routine?</p>
<p>Better treat a disease you have?</p>
<p>Get counseling for a mental health issue?</p>
<p>Try or change <a>medication</a> for a mental health issue?</p>
<p>Try <a>self-help</a> approaches: journaling, exercise, <a>thought replacement</a>, co-<a>coaching</a> with a friend or support group?</p>
<p>Find a new <a>romantic relationship</a>?</p>
<p>Improve an existing romantic relationship, maybe with clearer communication, better listening, and/or limit-setting, perhaps one issue at a time? By yourselves? With a counselor? With a friend or relative?</p>
<p>End an existing romantic relationship?</p>
<p>Find a new platonic friend?</p>
<p>Improve an existing platonic relationship?</p>
<p>End a platonic relationship?</p>
<p>Improve your relationship with your child or parent, for example, collaborative, limit-setting conversations with your child around drugs, sex, poor school performance, ill-advised friends, etc?</p>
<p>Recreational/creative life</p>
<p>Do you need to do more of one of your current recreational or creative activities?</p>
<p>Do you need to find a new recreational or creative activity or resurrect one you've done previously?</p>
<p>Do you spend sufficient time and perhaps money on what you most believe in, for example, your kids, a cause, your career?</p>
<p>Do you want to increase or decrease your spending or material things, products and/or services?</p>
<p>Does one or more of the questions above suggest how you might start to lift yourself from burnout’s pit?</p>

<p>Losing your job or romantic partner is, of course, painful. Here are some thoughts on how to prevent and cope with such a loss.</p>
<p>Preventing. Put yourself in your boss’s shoes. Would you be tempted to let you go? If that's more than minimally likely, why? Quality of work? Work ethic? Bad attitude? Office politics? </p>
<p>If you're not sure, review your previous performance evaluations and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<li>How often and for what do you get praised versus criticized?</li>
<li>How often are you given good assignments?</li>
<li>What’s the vibe you get from your boss, coworkers, and supervisees?</li>
<li>Is this all getting better or worse? </li>
<p>Now, is there anything you want to do about your situation? This might include:</p>
<li>Take steps to improve the quality of your work, work ethic, or attitude.</li>
<li>Learn a new, key skill.</li>
<li>Apply for other jobs in or outside your organization.</li>
<li>Confidentially query your network for job leads.</li>
<li>Make plans for self-employment.</li>
<li>If you think you're overpaid relative to your peers or your <a>productivity</a>, offer to take a pay cut.</li>
<p>Rebounding. If you've been terminated, could that be for the best, believing there’s a better or better-suited job out there for you? Or that you could use a little time to reflect on what the hell you really want to do with your life?</p>
<a>anger</a>, and the self-recrimination became more branded in their brain, remaining top-of-mind blockages.
<p>While everyone is different, you might try pushing yourself to move forward right away, If that fails, you can always revert to more grieving.</p>
<h3>Losing Your Romantic Partner</h3>
<a>sexual</a> compatibility, out-of-bed compatibility, the percent of the time you’re each glad you’re in the relationship, and the likelihood of your being happier on your own or in searching for a better relationship.
<a>Wise</a> One within you be solo for a while, search for deep love, or have a casual relationship or two?
<p>If you decide you want to try to maintain or grow a current relationship, strategies you could try include:</p>
<ul><li>Pledge to listen better.</li> <li>State your needs.</li> <li>Be a more generous lover.</li> <li>At least slightly improve a bad habit, for example, reliability, cleanliness, substance use, whatever.</li> </ul>
<p>Share your goal with your partner and ask how s/he feels about it, and if there is anything s/he wants to do to nurture the relationship. Would the two of you do better if a trusted friend or a counselor facilitated the discussion?</p>
<li>Ask your friends and relatives to set you up?</li>
<li>Create an honest <a>dating</a> app profile and reach out to people who strike you as likely even better than that fool who dumped you?</li>
<li>Consistent with COVID restrictions, go to some live event at which you could picture your romantic partner, for example, a particular class or professional conference?</li>
<p>Also think about how whether you want to be the same or different in your next relationship. For example, might you want to:</p>
<ul><li>Be more sharing or more low-maintenance?</li> <li>Be more giving or less so?</li> <li>Have stronger or looser boundaries?</li> <li>Be more of a grown-up or childlike?</li> </ul>
<p>Write a few-word reminder of your plan and keep it prominently on your desk, bathroom mirror, even as your computer screen’s wallpaper.</p>
