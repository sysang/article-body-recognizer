<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>December 9, 2021 at 9:02 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Happy Thursday! If you were expecting another meandering tech hearing yesterday in the Senate, you likely walked away pleasantly surprised. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: Researchers found Facebook has a hard time identifying political ads, and senators are proposing new social media transparency legislation. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The world is closing the gap with Europe on digital rules, E.U. competition chief says</div></h4></div></div>
<p>Europe may have led the way globally in setting rules around data privacy, but other countries are catching up when it comes to digital competition and content regulations, according to European Union competition chief Margrethe Vestager. </p>
<div><div><p>Vestager said that while Europe helped to pave the way for privacy laws globally by enacting their own rules, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the global landscape has shifted. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are highlights from our interview, edited for length and clarity:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The second thing is, we have said that if there is a business with a specific concern about the obligations, they should come to us directly, instead of taking the tour through government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But is that a concern you’ve heard directly from the White House or other administration officials?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>(Just before this interview, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo </i><a><i>publicly said</i></a><i> the U.S. has "serious concerns that these proposals will disproportionately impact U.S.-based tech firms.")</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You’ve talked about cooperation under the Biden administration with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. What does that look like day-to-day, and how does it differ from under the past administration?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>How was cooperation under the Trump administration?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I think on a team level, it was good. But since we didn't have the same number of cases in common, it was not as intense.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In your view, is it possible for a digital company with gatekeeper power to offer competing products without creating competition concerns or a conflict of interest?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are considering antitrust legislation along those lines. Are you meeting with those lawmakers while in town?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>(Later Wednesday, Cicilline tweeted a photo of their summit.)</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Do you have any message for them about what’s at stake here?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What’s your reaction to recent tech regulation in China?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sometimes people ask me, “Are you envious of China?” And the answer to that question is no, because we are trying to do something that we in our system consider legitimate. So no, not envious of China, not at all.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>December 10, 2021 at 8:56 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Happy Friday! A quick programming note: we'll be hitting your inboxes Tuesday to Thursday next week, our last three editions of 2021. We've almost made it, folks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: The Oversight Board meets with a Facebook whistleblower, and Senate Democrats call for another probe of the tech giant. First up:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>FCC majority remains elusive for Democrats</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, delays to FCC nominee Gigi Sohn’s confirmation, the appointment that would break the 2-2 split at the agency, mean the deadlock likely will extend into next year. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the GOP uproar, Democrats could still advance and confirm Sohn along a party-line vote — if only they could find the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sohn’s nomination is facing a fresh hurdle: the panel’s top Republican is calling for the committee to pump the brakes and vet her more closely for potential conflicts of interest. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans have voiced concern over her past role sitting on the board of Locast, a nonprofit television streaming service that shut down after facing allegations it violated copyright laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the top Republican on the Senate’s intellectual property panel, has called Sohn an “anti-copyright activist” and urged Biden to withdraw her nomination.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added that more thorough vetting “should be a prerequisite for further consideration by the committee.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Senator Cantwell did not ask her staff to obtain more information from ethics officials at the FCC,” Enright said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House also rebuffed Wicker’s remarks, pointing to commitments Sohn has already made to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, an independent federal agency that vets nominees for potential conflicts of interest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sohn and spokespeople for the FCC did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even if Senate Republicans don’t convince any Democrats that their concerns have merit, their tactics could still drag out the confirmation process even more. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Sohn, more delays mean more time in the Senate and less time at the FCC.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Welcome back to The Technology 202! Below: The latest on Amazon's deadly warehouse collapse and on Huawei's ties to surveillance. First up:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Facebook’s latest defense: Social media doesn’t hurt people. People hurt people.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>The remarks, which drew immediate backlash, are the latest example of the tech giant taking a defiant tone in the face of criticisms over its safety practices, rather than offering apologies as it did in the wake of prior scandals. </p></div>
<div><div><p>It’s not the first time the company has made that argument. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company repeated the stance in June in response to a call by its oversight board for an internal review of how the platform may have contributed to the violence on Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the pointedness of Bosworth’s latest comments struck a nerve. </p></div></div>
<p>The problem with his argument, critics said, is that it disregards the power Facebook and other social media companies have to influence how content is disseminated — and, in some cases, to prevent its platforms from being weaponized.</p>
<div><div><p>Howard Forman, professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at Yale University, and Antonio Casilli, sociology professor at the Institute Polytechnique de Paris:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Facebook is structuring a platform for how those communications happen,” including with the decisions it makes about what content to recommend and amplify, he said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook declined additional comment on Bosworth’s remarks and comparisons between his arguments and the NRA catchphrase. </p></div></div>
<p>While the link between online misinformation and real-world harm is far more difficult to trace than the trajectory of a bullet, Facebook and other social media platforms have been repeatedly accused of contributing to violence or even death.</p>
<div><div><p>The company responded by pointing to the steps it has taken to curb misinformation,</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bosworth touted those and other efforts as perhaps “the biggest covid vaccine campaign in the world” in his interview, arguing the company is taking on responsibility. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added, “But at some point, the onus is and should be in any meaningful democracy on the individual.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bosworth, one of Facebook’s more provocative leaders, doesn’t speak for the whole of the company as just one of its executives. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reid, the law school professor, said while Facebook is no “monolith,” it’s concerning to see someone of his stature stake out such a position.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>December 15, 2021 at 9:04 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Happy Wednesday! Below: Tesla faces new harassment lawsuits and U.K. regulators sound off on smartphone competition. First up:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden’s Commerce chief is under fire from Warren, progressives for defending U.S. tech giants</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We urge you to join the Biden administration’s whole-of-government commitment to eliminating abusive monopolies in every industry,” the groups wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive who founded the group, pushed back on Warren’s claim that Raimondo’s position is not in line with the broader administration.</p></div></div>
<p>On Wednesday, the Chamber of Progress and three tech trade groups sent a letter directly to Biden thanking him for his administration’s “strong defense of U.S. workers” in response to the E.U.’s proposals, the DMA and DSA.</p>
<div><div><p>Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading the campaign in the House, called it “imperative that our efforts in Congress are aligned with efforts around the world,” including Europe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Our top tabs</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Six women sued Tesla, accusing it of fostering a culture of sexual harassment at a California plant and other facilities</div></h4></div></div>
<li>Several women say they complained, but the behavior didn’t change.</li>
<li>Other women said that they feared talking to human resources because their superiors participated in the harassment.</li>
<li>Some women alleged they procured baggy clothes in an attempt to fend off their co-workers.</li>
<li>Some of the women say their experiences led to depression and anxiety, preventing them from advancing in their careers.</li>
<p>Eden Mederos, who worked at Tesla service centers, drew a line between her experiences and the behavior of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “He would make 69 or 420 jokes … which caused the technicians to be even worse,” Mederos said.</p>
<div><div><h4><div>A key committee advanced Europe’s proposed Internet rules</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The committee approved a ban on deceptive techniques designed to get users to do things they don’t want to do and restrictions on ads that target children, the Associated Press’s Kelvin Chan reports. </p></div></div>

<div><h1>Cyber world is starting 2022 in crisis mode with the log4j bug</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on cybersecurity news and policy.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joseph Marks</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 7:30 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome back to The Cybersecurity 202! My household managed to see family in Iowa and North Carolina over the holiday break and return to negative coronavirus tests. I wish everyone was so lucky. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: Beijing is monitoring western social media for criticism of the Chinese government, and Missouri's governor is doubling down on dubious claims that a reporter hacked a state website. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Expect big hacks this year</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The cybersecurity world is starting off 2022 in crisis mode. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But crises like log4j have become the norm rather than the exception during the past few years. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The big picture</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Digital threats of all sorts are growing far faster than the capability to defend against them. If past is prologue, 2022 is likely to be a year of big hacks, big threats and plenty more crises. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Fast response</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>There was some good news where log4j is concerned. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Government agencies and Big Tech firms moved rapidly to counteract the worst damage. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The private sector also moved far quicker to protect its computer systems against log4j than it has in previous years. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>But still</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>A lot of damage has already been done. </p></div></div>
<li>Hackers penetrated Belgium’s defense ministry using the log4j bug.</li>
<li>A Chinese hacking group used the bug to go after at least one large academic institution, the cyber firm CrowdStrike reported.</li>
<li>The bug was exploited by numerous ransomware hacking gangs, including one that hit a Vietnamese cryptocurrency platform and demanded $5 million in payment. Other hackers used the bug to steal computing power to mine cryptocurrency.</li>
<div><div><p>Log4j is especially dangerous because it affects an incredibly common piece of software code. That code helps software systems keep logs of past activities. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The keys</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>China monitors criticism on Western social media sites</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The systems used by state media, propaganda departments, cyber regulators, police and military agencies include:</p></div></div>
<li>“A $320,000 Chinese state media software program that mines Twitter and Facebook to create a database of foreign journalists and academics;”</li>
<li>“A $216,000 Beijing police intelligence program that analyzes Western chatter on Hong Kong and Taiwan;”</li>
<li>“A cybercenter in Xinjiang, home to most of China’s Uyghur population, that catalogues the mainly Muslim minority group’s language content abroad."</li>
<div><div><h4><div>Missouri's governor is doubling down on dubious claims a newspaper reporter hacked a state agency</div></h4></div></div>

<div><h1>Why 2022 could be a ‘watershed year’ for tech regulation</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 8:55 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome back to The Technology 202 and happy 2022! If you’ve already bailed on your New Year’s resolution, don’t worry, we’ve all been there. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: More on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Twitter suspension, and the 5G standoff between the federal government and the telecom industry. First up:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Why 2022 could be a ‘watershed year’ for tech regulation</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Up until now, the so-called techlash that ushered in historic scrutiny of Silicon Valley companies has been mostly toothless, producing few new rules in the United States to rein in their conduct. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But 2022 may finally be the year that policymakers turn their fiery tech rhetoric into significant regulation of the industry — if they don’t run out of time, first. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Even in the face of those potential pitfalls, several top advocates who for years have called on Washington to get tougher with Silicon Valley say they expect this year to be a turning point for efforts to rein in the tech industry.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here are three key battles to watch in 2022 — and how top lawmakers, advocates and industry leaders predict they will shake out:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The sprint to pass new antitrust laws on Capitol Hill</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Short-term delays, but long-term threats at the FTC</div></h4></div></div>
<p>Under the leadership of aggressive new Democratic enforcers, the FTC is set to consider expanding its power to crack down on privacy abuses and algorithmic discrimination by tech companies through an internal process known as rulemaking. </p>
<div><div><h4><div>A reinvigorated push to regulate social media</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the panel, said Congress faces “a pivotal turning point” in the bid to rein in the tech giants in 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jim Steyer is president of Common Sense Media. He is the founder. Ellen Pack is president.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Our top tabs</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Twitter permanently suspends Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account over repeated violations of covid-19 misinformation policy</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Greene’s ban comes nearly a year after Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump. That ban came after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The pro-Trump Internet has descended into infighting</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Telecom executives blasted a U.S. government request to delay launching 5G technology</div></h4></div></div>

<div><h1>Fears mount about Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on cybersecurity news and policy.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joseph Marks</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 7:23 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>Welcome to The Cybersecurity 202! I give “Being the Ricardos” a B-minus overall, but the performances were great, especially J.K. Simmons as William Frawley. It sparked some real “Nick at Nite” memories. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Below: Senators want details about government cyber protections for the transportation sector, and a Russian extradited to the United States may have inside information about the Kremlin's 2016 election interference. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Fears are mounting about possible Russian cyberattacks of Ukraine</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fears are mounting about a possible Russian military invasion of Ukraine — and the cyberattacks that would undoubtedly come with it.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ukraine has been the target of Russia’s most brazen cyber operations in recent years. Such attacks would surely accompany any land invasion launched by the roughly 175,000 Russian troops currently massed on the Ukraine border.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Cybersecurity experts are already noting an uptick in Russian cyber intrusions into Ukrainian government and civilian computer networks that could lay the groundwork for a major cyberattack. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin may also opt to launch cyberattacks that cripple Ukrainian infrastructure in place of a physical invasion, the Times reports. </p></div></div>
<div><p>The situation offers a harrowing example of the major role cyber capabilities are likely to play in any future military conflict — especially those involving the top tier of cyber-capable nations including Russia and China. </p></div>
<div><div><p>“Going forward, all physical kinetic military action that would be occurring in Eastern Europe will be preceded by a cyber pulse,” Tom Kellermann, head of cybersecurity strategy at VMware predicted to the Hill. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Russia is no stranger to mixing cyberattacks with conventional military operations</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Russia peppered Ukrainian computers with malware during 2014, according to the cybersecurity firm FireEye — probably aimed at stealing information to aid its invasion of Crimea that year.</p></div></div>
<li>The nation’s 2008 invasion of Georgia was accompanied by “denial-of-service” cyberattacks, which rendered numerous Georgian government websites inoperable by flooding them with more Internet traffic than they could handle.</li>
<li>Russia pummeled Estonia with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 that’s widely viewed as the first major case of nation-on-nation hacking.</li>
<div><div><p>Biden told Putin during a phone call last week that the United States will “respond decisively” to an invasion, according to a statement by press secretary Jen Psaki. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s some evidence that effort may have yielded positive results. But rising tensions between the nation could thwart any progress. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The keys</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A bipartisan group of senators wants to know how the Biden administration is defending the transportation sector against hacking</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The letter cites numerous cyber threats to transportation infrastructure — most prominently a 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline that threatened to cut off gas supplies to the southeastern United States. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A Russian hacker extradited to the United States reportedly has information on Russia’s 2016 election interference</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Klyushin may also have access to information about other Russian intelligence operations, sources told Bloomberg. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The fight to end the filibuster could deliver election security reforms (if it works)</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the bills Senate Democrats want to pass is the Freedom to Vote Act, which primarily focuses on ballot access but is also chock-full of proposals sought by election security advocates. It would:</p></div></div>
<li>Require states to conduct post-election audits</li>
<li>Set up an advisory committee focused on election audits at the Commerce Department</li>
<li>Formally add “election infrastructure” to the Department of Homeland Security’s list of “critical infrastructure” sectors</li>
<li>Block states from using voting machines that aren’t manufactured or assembled in the United States and require them to have their software “developed and stored in the United States”</li>

<div><h1>Biden’s coronavirus testing push will need to face the ghost of websites past</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 9:10 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden’s coronavirus testing push will need to face the ghost of websites past</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>If history is any indication, though, the portal’s launch could face some of the same technological stumbling blocks that have plagued similar projects in the past.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, major questions remain unanswered about how the White House will stand up a website that can meet the soaring demand for tests. Here are a few: </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>How will the site handle a likely massive surge in traffic?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>White House spokesman Kevin Munoz declined to answer questions about how the plan will account for a potential surge in traffic, among other issues, noting that many of the details are still “forthcoming.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>How will it serve underserved communities with sparse Internet access?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Accessibility is really a critical piece of it,” Wanger said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She added, “Making sure that the website also comes with analog ways to order these tests and get access to these services is going to be really critical on the health equity side.”</p></div></div>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said late last month that the website will be “ready when tests start to be ready” and “will ensure tests are available equitably and that they will be attained with ready access.”</p>
<div><div><h4><div>How will it protect Americans’ private data?</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>They called on the federal government to implement guardrails to protect users’ data from itself, private companies and external bad actors alike. The new project runs some of the same risks. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the outstanding questions, both Wanger and Chopra said they believe the executive branch now has the technical expertise to consider and tackle these challenges. </p></div></div>

<div><h1>Don't mess with Texas (election results)</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on cybersecurity news and policy.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joseph Marks</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>Yesterday at 7:59 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome to The Cybersecurity 202! My sincerest sympathies to Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and everyone else stuck for a day or longer on I-95. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Below: The Federal Trade Commission is threatening penalties if companies don't protect themselves against the log4j bug, and a phony encrypted messaging app the FBI used to lure criminals was collecting location information, too.</p></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Texas can't find election fraud either</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another partisan-led audit of the 2020 election is underway. And, once again, it's failing to turn up anything nefarious.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Like Arizona?</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The key takeaway from both efforts: Claims that the 2020 election was undermined by substantial fraud or hacking have no basis in evidence, but Trump and his allies will keep making those claims no matter what happens. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, look closer and there’s a big difference between the Texas and Arizona audits. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unlike in Arizona, Texas officials followed a conventional process in auditing the county election results (although Democrats in the state still opposed the review, calling it partisan-motivated).</p></div></div>
<li>Texas, by comparison, was highly professional. The audit was led by Republican Secretary of State John B. Scott’s office and focused mainly on traditional auditing procedures that are typically uncontroversial.</li>
<div><p>Texas officials nevertheless described their review as a “full forensic audit,” a phrase popularized by the Maricopa audit and often touted by Trump allies, but which has no agreed-upon meaning among election officials. </p></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Mess in Texas</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Texas audit has resulted in less costly damage than the Arizona one, but it’s far from harmless. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In an ideal world these kinds of things would be set down in legislation and budgeted for properly, not weaponized in response to someone’s political sour grapes,” Levine said. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The audit also diverted time and resources from election officials’ other priorities, including dealing with security issues. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The keys</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A federal regulator threatened fines if companies don’t protect themselves against the log4j vulnerability</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Companies that don’t quickly fix the bug could harm consumers and open themselves up to mammoth financial penalties, the Federal Trade Commission said. </p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Google is manipulating browser extensions to stifle competitors, DuckDuckGo CEO says</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Google is already facing mounting legal challenges from regulators globally who accuse the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly over its search and digital advertising businesses. </p></div></div>
<p>But now one of its most prominent rivals is alleging that the titan is abusing browser extensions to favor its products and stifle competitors, adding a new wrinkle to the high-stakes antitrust debate and momentum to calls for new regulation.</p>
<div><div><p>Weinberg said the tweaks — although subtle — have had a major impact. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s the first time the company is publicly speaking out about how the practice has impacted its business, including what it says are millions in potential lost revenue since Google changed its prompts in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“For search engines like us that are trying to actively allow consumers to switch, [or] choose an alternative, they're making it unreasonably complicated to do so and confusing consumers,” Weinberg said of Google. </p></div>
<div><div><p>McAlister said the notification appears “regardless of the user’s chosen search provider,” and that some other browsers have “similar policies.”</p></div></div>
<p>Weinberg said he hopes by speaking out about the tactic it will strengthen calls for bipartisan antitrust legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill to ban major platforms from prioritizing their own products and disadvantaging rivals. </p>
<p>Weinberg said the drop in user retention via their extension on Chrome, which was previously unreported, is one of the most “direct” pieces of evidence they have seen about how Google’s practices have harmed their business. </p>
<div><div><p>“I think it really helps to make it concrete and show some very specific examples of where things are happening,” he said during a 30-minute video interview. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s a finding that could also serve as fodder for state and federal enforcers as they press ahead with their antitrust lawsuits against the tech behemoth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added, “We’ve been in touch with the DOJ and we’re trying to help them, and the states for that matter, in their case to provide them with any information that would be helpful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But those legal bouts are poised to drag out over several years, which Weinberg said makes the need for Congress to act and pass new laws even more pressing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We definitely need momentum on real legislation,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The two other countries that we’re focused on is Australia and the [United Kingdom],” Weinberg said. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those are just two more regions where Google and other tech giants are now facing surging efforts to overhaul regulation of their sector.</p></div></div>
