<a>medication</a> (Epidiolex), CBD is FDA-approved to treat two severe forms of
<a>childhood</a> epilepsy. Commercially, CBD is sold as oil, capsules, and topical creams, or added to foods and beverages. Many who purchase it seek to reduce inflammation, soothe pain, or ease
<a>psychosis</a>-like symptoms. It’s also thought to be safe by most researchers who study it. But experts caution that some commercial CBD contains THC or other contaminants, either of which may trigger negative reactions.

<h2> CBD and Mental Health </h2>
<p>CBD has shown promising results as a potential treatment for a wide range of mental and physical ailments, including epilepsy, anxiety, opioid addiction, <a>insomnia</a>, schizophrenia, and <a>chronic pain</a>.</p>
<p>But evidence of its benefits is still highly preliminary, experts warn. More research is needed both to be sure of its effects and to establish appropriate dosing recommendations.</p>
<div> <h3> Can CBD help with insomnia? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can CBD help with anxiety? </h3> </div>
<a>relieve symptoms of anxiety,</a> research suggests, and it may therefore help treat conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder,
<a>social anxiety</a> disorder, and post-
<a>stress</a> disorder. But scientists still don’t understand how exactly CBD affects the brain to deliver those benefits.
<div> <h3> Can CBD help with addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>dampening drug cravings,</a> according to a clinical trial of individuals addicted to heroin who took CBD once a day. The benefits lasted for a week after the last dose of CBD. The compound may also help with addiction by easing anxiety and stress.
<div> <h3> Can CBD help with schizophrenia? </h3> </div>
<a>CBD might help treat schizophrenia</a> down the road. A few small trials have found that CBD led to lower levels of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, and improved
<a>cognition</a> for those with schizophrenia. But another trial with lower doses of CBD found no difference in symptoms, so more research is necessary.
<div> <h3> Can CBD help with seizures and epilepsy? </h3> </div>
<a>CBD to treat severe forms of childhood epilepsy,</a> Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, through the drug Epidiolex. The drug can be an effective treatment option to reduce seizures, sometimes with a combination of anti-seizure medications.

<h1> 7 Types of Loneliness, and Why It Matters </h1>
<h2> One key — maybe the key — to happiness is strong connections to other people. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Understanding Loneliness </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>One major challenge within <a>happiness</a> is <a>loneliness</a>. The more I’ve learned about happiness, the more I’ve come to believe that loneliness is a common and important obstacle to consider.</p>
<p>To be happy, we need intimate bonds; we need to be able to confide, we need to feel like we belong, we need to be able to get and give support. In fact, strong relationships are key — perhaps the key — to a happy life.</p>
<p>Of course, being alone and being lonely aren’t the same. Loneliness feels draining, distracting, and upsetting; desired solitude feels peaceful, creative, restorative.</p>
<p>Once we’ve pinpointed the particular kind of loneliness we’re experiencing, it may be easier to spot ways to address it.</p>
<p>Here are some types I’ve identified. What have I overlooked?</p>
<p>1. New-situation loneliness. You’ve moved to a new city where you don’t know anyone, or you’ve started a new job, or you’ve started at a school full of unfamiliar faces. You’re lonely.</p>
<a>attachment</a> of a romantic partner. Or maybe you have a partner, but you don’t feel a deep connection to that person.
<a>friendship</a> is the ability to confide and trust, so if that’s missing, you may feel lonely, even if you have fun with your friends.

<h2> Being alone and feeling lonely are two different experiences. </h2>
<p>So what happens when we feel as though we have been stripped of connection? <a>Loneliness</a> sets in.</p>
<p>The feeling of loneliness can exist in us even when we are surrounded by people. We can be in the midst of a crowded room, we can be the life of the party, we can be on a stage in front of our peers, and yet feel incredibly lonely.</p>
<p>So how do we deal with, work through, and cope with loneliness? We need to first acknowledge that it’s there.</p>
<a>self-worth</a>. We may also have a tape of negative
<a>self-talk</a> trying to convince us that we will never find love, that we will never be happy, and that we are inherently flawed due to not making this relationship work.
<a>mindfulness</a> (non-judgmental awareness) to our internal narrative, it sets in motion a process that can prevent driving ourselves into a
<a>anger</a> compounds the intensity of our loneliness.
<a>self-sabotage</a>? Did we try to change ourselves to make it work? Are we feeling lonely because we miss the person, or because we miss the idea of being in a relationship? These are important questions to ask ourselves.
<a>authenticity</a> in our relationships. If we feel as though our peers don’t truly know us, that they don’t see the “real me,” or that they misunderstand us, this may be a reflection of our own lack of authenticity.
<p>Living our authentic truths can be incredibly difficult, especially if we struggle with lack of self-worth and with an abundance of shame. This internal incongruence can lead to feelings of loneliness in all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>You are not alone. Not now, and not ever.</p>

<h2> How Extroversion is Measured </h2>
<a>personality type</a> can help an individual choose a

<a>Online personality tests</a>, while imperfect, may help someone determine if they’re closer to being an extrovert or an introvert.
<div> <h3> How do I know if I’m an extrovert? </h3> </div>

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Marriage</h1> <p>Monogamy</p> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Marriage is the process by which two people make their relationship public, official, and permanent. It is the joining of two people in a bond that putatively lasts until death, but in practice is often cut short by separation or divorce.</p>
<h2> How to Make Marriage Work </h2>
<div> <h3> How does marriage change people? </h3> </div>
<a>becoming a spouse appears to change one’s personality</a> as well, especially in the early years of marriage. Men, for example, tend to become more
<a>conscientious</a> and introverted than they were when single, and women more emotionally stable. But both tend to become less agreeable.
<div> <h3> What are the strongest signs that a marriage will succeed? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What can couples do to keep a marriage happy? </h3> </div>
<a>They act like they’re still dating</a>; remain focused on each other’s positive traits; express
<a>gratitude</a>; and recognize that external pressures may be causing them
<a>stress</a>, rather than blaming each other.
<div> <h3> What mistakes should new couples watch out for? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s the best way to handle problems with your partner? </h3> </div>
<a>assume their spouses are doing the best they can</a>, remain
<a>empathic</a> toward the other person, speak honestly and compassionately about what bothers them, and seek solutions together rather than demanding change tend to be more successful.
<div> <h3> Can you make a marriage divorce-proof? </h3> </div>
<a>divorced</a>. To divorce-proof a marriage, research suggests, partners should not rush into it; make sure they share the same values and level of commitment; and
<a>avoid idealizing each other</a> in ways that lead to eventual disappointment.
<div> <h3> Can partners change each other? </h3> </div>

<a>intimacy</a> in a relationship or fuel insecurity that manifests as
<a>anger</a> or avoidance. Learning how to address sexual concerns together honestly and openly, experts agree, is the key to maintaining intimacy long-term, but that’s often easier said than done.
<div> <h3> What is the biggest challenge to satisfying sex in marriage? </h3> </div>
<a>many partners endure unsatisfying sex for years</a> just to avoid such conversations. Individuals may worry that sexual concerns could threaten the relationship, hurt a partner’s feelings, or upset their own
<a>self-image</a>. Finding the courage to speak openly about sex, though, should only strengthen a bond.

<a>are generally romantic and affectionate</a> outside the bedroom: They say I love you every day, kiss each other for no reason, share compliments, have dates, cuddle, and express affection in public.
<h2> How We Find Partners </h2>
<a>happiness</a>. The science of relationships offers some insights into how successful partners tend to find each other, but whether or not a marriage will last ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the individuals deciding to unite.
<div> <h3> What do partners need to know about each other before getting married? </h3> </div>
<a>learn as much about each other’s values and priorities as possible</a> before becoming engaged, such as how they approach chores, money, and work, what their triggers and past
<a>traumas</a> are, and whether they hold traditional notions about
<a>gender</a> roles in marriage.
<div> <h3> Can marriage succeed with a partner who’s much older or younger? </h3> </div>
<a>many couples with more significant age differences also thrive</a>. Individuals within the relationship may perceive each other's age differently than outsiders and some people may choose partners based on factors other than age.
<div> <h3> Are marriages more successful when partners are similar or different? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Do people who live together first have happier marriages? </h3> </div>
<h2> Monogamy vs. Polygamy </h2>
<div> <h3> How did people become monogamous? </h3> </div>
<a>mating</a> with multiple partners are all
<a>remnants of millennia of polygamy</a>.
<div> <h3> How common is polygamy today? </h3> </div>
<a>consensual nonmonogamy</a>, is much more common in those regions than elsewhere.
<div> <h3> How do open marriages succeed? </h3> </div>
<a>satisfied personally and with their relationship</a> as are their monogamous peers—but are more fulfilled sexually. Polyamorous relationships can thrive if partners
<a>establish boundaries that meet everyone’s needs</a>, communicate effectively, and consciously practice the same relationship maintenance techniques as other couples.
