<h2> The Physical Benefits of Happiness </h2>
<p>Researchers have pinned down connections between happiness and more specific aspects of health, such as the immune response we mount in response to a virus or how long our lives will ultimately be.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the physical benefits of happiness? </h3> </div>
<a>physical health benefits,</a> such as lower blood pressure, reduced risk of stroke, a stronger immune system, and even a longer life. Positive emotions are also linked to a reduced risk of injury in young adults and frailty in older adults.
<div> <h3> Do happier people live longer? </h3> </div>
<p>Yes, <a>happiness is correlated with a longer lifespan.</a> People who report feeling a stronger sense of happiness and well-being live longer, on average, than do those who report weaker feelings, and the effect exists for both men and women.</p>
<div> <h3> Can happiness boost your immune system? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s responsible for the connection between happiness and health? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can happiness cure any diseases? </h3> </div>

<h1> Social Anxiety Is My Old Friend </h1>
<h2> Helping your anxious child master their fears. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Painful childhood memories not only stay with you but potentially alter your behavior for years to come. </li>
<li>Mindfulness practices such as focused breathing and guided imagery are important skill sets for anxious children. </li>
<li>Anxious children often develop an intricate internal dialogue that often fuels their uncomfortable feelings. </li>
<li>Parents who are curious about their child's internal world greatly help their child develop coping strategies and resilience. </li>
<p>I have a secret to share: I suffer from <a>social anxiety</a>.</p>
<a>outgoing</a> and friendly, even engaging. But what is going on inside tells a different story.
<p>They would look at me. You know that look — a bit curious, a bit of pity. Then they would quickly forget I was present. I am not sure which hurt most.</p>
<p>This is one of the skills I strive to help my clients develop: trusting your instincts. Learning to tune in, to be present with yourself, helps you to develop that skill.</p>
<p>I teach my clients to use focus on their breathing, to take a few deep breaths in and out. This is extremely powerful and significant to learning how to quiet the mind enough to hear one’s own instincts.</p>
<p>In that hallway, if I had started to really panic or had pulled out my phone and texted my mother for help, I would have skipped the step of checking in with myself, and missed a crucial step in my development.</p>
<p>Being present with your thoughts and feelings is a good skill for everyone, but is especially important for those with social anxiety.</p>
<p>What does social anxiety feel like? Are you extremely afraid of being judged by others? Are you self-conscious in everyday social situations? Do you avoid meeting new people? Do you overthink what you said after spending time with friends? </p>
<a>phobia</a>, is extreme fear and anxiety that leads to avoidance of work, school, and other activities. It is common to feel nervous in new situations or social situations, but people who suffer social phobia experience "
<a>overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness</a> in everyday social situations, and "have a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions."
<p>How can you help your child if you suspect they are suffering from social anxiety?</p>
<li>Speak to a trusted doctor, therapist, or school counselor for suggestions on how to assist your child. </li>
<li>Consider enrolling them in <a>therapy with a licensed professional.</a></li>
<li>Commit to a <a>mindfulness</a> practice for you and your child that focuses on quieting your mind and listening to your heart.</li>

<h1> The Lemon Test: Introverts Are More Aroused Than Extroverts </h1>
<h2> How you respond to lemons may help explain why you feel shy in social groups. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Introversion? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>The amount of saliva produced from placing a few drops of lemon juice on the tongue can reveal one's level of introversion.</li>
<li>The Reticular Activating System (RAS) is a brain system that responds to stimuli like food or social contact.</li>
<li>Because introverts experience higher levels of RAS cortical arousal to begin with, even a little arousal may leave them feeling overstimulated.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: engin akyurt/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>extroverts</a> due to natural differences in the biology of nervous systems. The key idea was that introverts are characterized by a state of
<a>higher cortical arousal</a> which increases wakefulness, vigilance, muscle tone, and heart rate. Consequently, they really do not need much stimulation to push them beyond the threshold of relaxation and into the realm of
<a>anxiety</a> and overstimulation. Extroverts, however, have a lower starting point for arousal and therefore need more stimulation to get to the same point.
<p>The amount of saliva you produce after placing several drops of lemon juice on your tongue might reveal just how introverted you are. </p>
<h3>Why Do Introverts Produce More Saliva?</h3>
<p>Lemon juice provides the perfect food stimulus to test this. For many of us, squeezing fresh lemon juice on your tongue makes your mouth water, and it does so because your RAS is responding to the incoming lemon juice.</p>
<h3>Take the Test Yourself</h3>
<p>Try this simple test with friends and family and compare your results.</p>
<p>Hold half a lemon on your tongue for about 20 seconds. Then without swallowing, close your mouth for two seconds. What do you notice? Excessive saliva? Or the usual amount?</p>
<h3>Compare Yourself with a Friend</h3>
<p>You will need: Lemon juice, a kitchen scale, some cotton balls</p>
<li>Hold half a lemon on your tongue for 20 seconds. Then without swallowing, close your mouth for two seconds. Put the cotton ball in your mouth and close your mouth for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Use the cotton balls to mop up all the saliva that you produce. When you’ve mopped it all up, put the cotton ball on your kitchen scale to measure the weight.</li>
<li>Compare your results with your friends and family, and see whose weighs the most. I expect you will find that introverts produce a lot of saliva in response to lemon juice relative to that produced by extroverts.</li>

<h1> The Real Reason Anxious People May Struggle in Relationships </h1>

<a>article</a> published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology examines the impact
<a>social anxiety</a> can have on a person's ability to sustain a healthy romantic relationship. The results suggest that while socially
<a>anxious</a> people are more likely to struggle with romance, it may be due to factors other than their anxiety, such as underlying
<a>depression</a> or other psychological issues.
<a>divorce</a> than are non-anxious adults," say the researchers led by Christian Hahn of the Nova Scotia Health Authority. "A subset of socially anxious individuals, however, maintain positive
<a>romantic relationships</a>, but relatively little is known about how social anxiety may be associated with the factors that allow for this successful maintenance of romantic relationships."
<li>Relationship Assessment Scale: A seven-item self-report scale measuring relationship satisfaction with questions such as, "How well does your partner meet your needs?" (1 = not at all, 7 = very well).</li>
<li>Dyadic Trust Scale: An 8-item measure of trust in a romantic partner, defined as one's belief in a partner's honesty, good intentions, and kindness (e.g., "I feel that I can trust my partner completely").</li>
<li>Commitment Scale: A 15-item elaborated version of the Investment Model Scale measuring perceptions of social support in <a>stressful</a> events.</li>
<p>The researchers found that both social anxiety and depression were indicative of lower relationship satisfaction, social support, and dyadic trust.</p>
<p>But there's more to the story. For one, the researchers also found a tendency for socially anxious people to express a heightened commitment in their relationships.</p>
<a>motivation</a> to remain committed in a romantic relationship, even though they may not always engage in intimacy-promoting behaviors that extend the longevity of the relationship.
<p>The researchers also dug deeper into the association between social anxiety and relationship satisfaction, exploring its connection with co-morbid depression.</p>
<p>The researchers believe their findings may help clinicians develop better treatments for social anxiety in the future.</p>
