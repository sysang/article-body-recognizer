<h1> 3 Ways Partners Can Turn Down Sex Without Hurt Feelings </h1>
<h2> Keep three key things in mind when turning down sex. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Maybe sex seems like a fun and welcome distraction. In that case, great! Enjoy it.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re thinking something more along the lines of “Are you kidding me? You want sex right now? That's certainly not happening!”</p>
<p>As I've written about <a>previously</a>, <a>sexual</a> rejection can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if one person is largely (or even entirely) responsible for initiating sex in a relationship.</p>
<sup>1</sup> Here are three approaches to keep in mind.
<p>1. Clearly explain why you're saying no.</p>
<p>If you’re not in the mood for sex when you’re partner initiates it, one of the best things you can do is explain to them why you're not in the mood.</p>
<a>stress</a> at work, share that. It helps your partner understand your inner world a bit better and shows that your lack of interest in sex isn’t a reflection of your lack of interest in your partner.
<p>2. Suggest another time — soon(ish).</p>
<p>Likewise, when it comes to sex, a flat out "no" can feel pretty harsh. We similarly tend to wonder, how long is that "no" for? And should we ask again in an hour? A day? A week? Never? Are they trying to tell me something else by turning down sex?</p>

<p>3. Find another way to connect.</p>
<p>Just because you're not in the mood for sex doesn't necessarily mean you have to turn down other bids for connection and closeness.</p>

<p>B. Go along with it even though you’re not in the mood. You already know you won’t enjoy it—just too many things on your mind.</p>

<div> <h3> What are the keys to great sex? </h3> </div>
<a>the keys to a great sex life</a> are being able to stay in the moment,
<a>communicate with each other honestly</a> about their sexual wants—and have empathy for their partner’s, be vulnerable, and remain open to trying new things together.
<div> <h3> Are we having enough sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does having more sex make couples happier? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How important is what couples do after sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is it more important for a man or a woman to feel sexually satisfied? </h3> </div>
<a>the woman’s satisfaction is more predictive</a> of overall relationship satisfaction for both partners than the man’s—and
<a>a decline in a woman's sexual desire</a> is more predictive of relationship troubles than a decline in a man's.
<div> <h3> Can great sex survive marriage? </h3> </div>
<a>even as sexual satisfaction begins to decline</a> in many relationships, overall satisfaction remains high. But when partners’ levels of desire start to diverge widely, it’s crucial that the concern be addressed.
<div> <h3> How can couples rediscover their passion? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is love? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does love require passion? </h3> </div>
<a>a decrease in passion</a> is less of a problem than a couple’s belief that once it decreases it can’t be restored; partners who understand that it waxes and wanes are more likely to rekindle it, and stay together.
<div> <h3> Do men or women usually say “I love you” first? </h3> </div>
<a>say those three words first</a>, and more likely to report having felt love first in a relationship.
<div> <h3> How can partners negotiate “unconventional” sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Should I tell my partner about my sexual fantasies? </h3> </div>
<a>couples that acted on a fantasy</a> reported that it went well (with the exception of threesomes).
<div> <h3> Is sexting good for a relationship? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is BDSM good or bad for a long-term relationship? </h3> </div>
<h2> Facing Sexual Challenges </h2>
<div> <h3> What can you do when a partner becomes sexually coercive? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual coercion</a> and unwanted intimacy—even if it’s not physically aggressive—is a serious concern that partners should address before it becomes normalized, and seek to reestablish healthy boundaries and ground rules.
<div> <h3> How do women with high sex drives manage relationships? </h3> </div>
<a>Women with high sex drives</a> may find increased satisfaction through greater mental presence during sex and more open communication with their partners about their desires and fantasies.

<h1> 5 Ways Long-Term Couples Hold Onto Their Sexual Desire </h1>
<h2> Everything learned from 64 studies spanning three decades. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: LightField Studios/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Sexual desire is often described as “elusive," "misunderstood," or "complex." But after decades of studying the topic, researchers know more than ever about what helps couples maintain sexual desire in long-term relationships.</p>
<p>Here are five prominent themes determined to help couples maintain sexual passion. (The complete list of factors can be found <a>here</a>.)</p>
<p>2. Autonomy. While feeling close and connected to a partner is crucial for relationship satisfaction, there is a downside to being so close that we lose sight of ourselves and start to feel like "just" a couple.</p>
<p>The key is that our <a>motivation</a> is a relationship-enhancing one. Our desire and satisfaction do not increase if we are having sex with our partner to avoid a negative consequence, such as them being angry or upset.</p>
<a>flirting</a> with a crush and making small changes in your bedroom decor.
<p>The idea is to embrace your sexual interests and grow alongside your partner. This also helps avoid sexual monotony and routine.</p>
<h3>What We Still Don't Know</h3>
<a>same-sex</a> couples. These areas require additional exploration to further our understanding of sexual desire that can be generalizable to a larger and broader population.
