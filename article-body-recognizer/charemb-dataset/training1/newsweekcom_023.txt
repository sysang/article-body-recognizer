<p>On Monday, Foster died at the age of 31 while in custody in Pickens County Jail in Carrollton, Alabama. He had been arrested two days prior to his passing following a high-speed chase with police that ended in a crash.</p>
<a>Police</a> Department Chief Richard Black said he was concerned about Foster's unstable behavior following Saturday's arrest and arranged for his family to bail him out of jail in order for Foster to be evaluated at a hospital in nearby Birmingham.
<p>But a fight on Sunday prevented Foster's release.</p>
<p>"Wells was asleep and Foster stood over him attempting to steal his socks before repeatedly striking Wells to the chest, rib cage and abdomen area," one court document said.</p>
<p>The report also stated Wells had to be taken to a hospital to seek treatment for bone bruises and chest swelling suffered during the attack.</p>
<p>Records showed Foster was booked on an additional three felony counts of assault and one of third-degree battery on Sunday, and those charges kept him in custody before he died on Monday.</p>
<p>Speaking with NOLA.com, Foster Sr. said sheriff's deputies told him his son was transported on Monday in a patrol cruiser to a hospital about a half-hour away from the jail, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Foster's father said his son was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 10 years ago, and family members said he may have been experiencing a mental health episode while in custody.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the Pickens County Sheriff's Office and Foster's family for comment.</p>
<p>Tributes poured in on Thursday and Friday for Demaryius Thomas, a four-time NFL Pro Bowler with the Denver Broncos, who died at the aged 33 at his home in Rosewell, Georgia.</p>
<p>Thomas was found dead in his home on Thursday night, the Roswell <a>Police</a> Department confirmed in a statement to NFL Media.</p>
<p>Tim Lupo of Rosewell Police told <a>CNN</a> that based on preliminary information, the former NFL player's death was caused by a medical issue.</p>
<p>The Broncos said in a statement that they were "devastated and completely heartbroken by the sudden, tragic passing of Demaryius."</p>
<p>"Demaryius' humility, warmth, kindness and infectious smile will always be remembered by those who knew him and loved him."</p>
<p>"We have lost an incredible player and a special person in Demaryius Thomas. Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the Thomas family and all who are grieving this unimaginable loss."</p>
<p>The NFL issued a statement saying, "The NFL family mourns the tragic loss of Demaryius Thomas and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones."</p>
<p>Steve Atwater, former Denver Broncos player, tweeted: "RIP #DemaryiusThomas. My heart is hurting right now. We'll never forget you my brother."</p>
<p>Erica Cobb, host of the Daily Blast Live, tweeted a photo of her and Thomas.</p>
<p>"I will remember you for teaching me, for my first time away from home, to find home and family in places that weren't innately my own. I hope people remember your pure heart, because I certainly will. R.I.P."</p>
<p>Thomas was born on December 25, 1987, in Montrose, Georgia. From high school, he was recognised a gifted athlete, winning multiple awards in basketball, football and track.</p>
<p>He began his career in the NFL with the Denver Broncos in 2010, after playing for the Georgia Tech team as a receiver between 2007 and 2009. He finished his career at Georgia Tech with 120 receptions for 2,339 yards and 14 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Thomas won two AFC championships and Super Bowl 50 with the Broncos. He is second all-time in Broncos history in receiving yards and was a five-time Pro Bowl selection.</p>
<p>During the 2018 season, Thomas went to the Houston Texans, before having a brief stint at New England Patriots. He later ended his career with the New York Jets – retiring from the NFL in June 2021.</p>
<p>Thomas had 724 catches for 9,763 yards and 63 touchdowns in 143 career games.</p>
<p>NFL star Tom Brady eulogized the late Demaryius Thomas on <a>Twitter</a> Friday, calling his former teammate "a source of light."</p>
<p>Brady, the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a seven-time Super Bowl champion, played with Thomas on the New England Patriots during the 2019 season.</p>
<p>"We were all blessed with his humility and positive spirit," Brady wrote of Thomas.</p>
<p>Thomas was found dead in his home in Roswell, Georgia, on Thursday. He was 33 years old. Thomas played 10 seasons in the <a>NFL</a> as a wide receiver and enjoyed his greatest success as a member of the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>Though Brady and Thomas didn't play on the same team together long, Brady's tweet indicated the two men had bonded off the field and had spent time together recently.</p>
<p>LaTonya Bonseigneur, Thomas' cousin, told the Associated Press on Friday that Thomas' family believed his death resulted from medical issues he had been experiencing for more than a year.</p>
<p>"He had been suffering from seizures for over a year, and we believe he had a seizure when he was showering," Bonseigneur told the news agency.</p>
<p>During his career, Thomas played for the Broncos, the Houston Texans, the New England Patriots and the New York Jets. He caught 724 passes and made 63 touchdowns.</p>
<p>He was a four-time Pro Bowl selection and won two AFC championships with the Broncos. In 2016, he was a key part of the team's Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p>Thomas returned to the Denver Broncos in June 2021, to officially retire as a member of the team.</p>
<p>"We are devastated and completely heartbroken," the Broncos said in a statement. "Demaryius' humility, warmth, kindness and infectious smile will always be remembered by those who knew him and loved him."</p>
<p>The NFL also issued a statement about Thomas' passing. It read: "The NFL family mourns the tragic loss of Demaryius Thomas and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones."</p>
<p>A police report has revealed new details into the recent death of former NFL wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on Thursday night.</p>
<p>When they reached the bedroom shower, officers noticed Thomas, 33, unconscious lying on the floor of the shower. The report also said that one of the responding officers tried to pull Thomas' arm but "his whole body moved" as the officer pulled it.</p>
<p>"It was apparent from rigor mortis that Demaryius was deceased," the incident report said. "Roswell Fire arrived on scene and pronounced Demaryius deceased."</p>
<p>After he was pronounced deceased at the scene, Thomas was transported to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, according to the incident report.</p>
<p>While speaking with the Associated Press on Friday, Thomas' first cousin, LaTonya Bonseigneur said that the former NFL wide receiver "had been suffering from seizures for over a year."</p>
<p>According to the AP, Roswell Police Public Information Officer Tim Lupo said that preliminary info shows that Thomas' death "stems from a medical issue, and our investigators currently have no reason to believe otherwise."</p>
<p>Before he was drafted, Thomas played college football with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and was named first-team All-ACC in 2009.</p>
<p>Shortly after the news of his death became public, dozens of Thomas's former teammates and fellow NFL players expressed their condolences on social media.</p>
<p>"The NFL family mourns the tragic loss of Demaryius Thomas and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones," the NFL said on <a>Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady had quite a week. He was named Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year," broke an unthinkable <a>NFL</a> record and extended another incredible record that he already owned.</p>
<p>He also tied another NFL mark he owns with Dan Marino. Not bad for a transplanted "Florida man."</p>
<p>The Buccaneers needed overtime to beat the Buffalo Bills, 33-27, Sunday afternoon in Tampa. Brady tossed a 58-yard touchdown pass to Breshard Perriman for the game-winning score.</p>
<p>With Brady's touchdown pass to Perriman, he has now tossed 72 scoring strikes against the Bills. That's tied for the most by a quarterback against a single opponent, tied with Marino's 72 against the Jets and, um, Brady's 72 against the Dolphins.</p>
<a>Aaron Rodgers</a> and Patrick Mahomes.
<p>Brady won six Super Bowl championships with the New England Patriots before becoming a free agent and signing with Tampa Bay during the 2020 offseason. He needed just one season to win the title there.</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are currently 10-3 this season. If the playoffs were to begin right now, the Buccaneers would be seeded third in the NFC behind Arizona (10-2) and Green Bay (10-3).</p>
<a>NFL</a> and several professional football teams.
<p>"I think we need to redo all the divisions for the NFL and I think I figured out how it should be done," TikTok user @btrait, or Becca, <a>said in her video.</a></p>
<p>She then cuts to a greenscreen that shows the new divisions and how they are broken down.</p>
<p>She continued her tongue-in-cheek video and said each team should have the opportunity to "shine" in their own category.</p>
<p>Becca went through other proposed divisions, which included a "Horses Division," "Human Division" and "Myth Division."</p>
<p>"You got our attention, let's talk," the verified TikTok account for the NFL commented.</p>
<p>"No need to talk about it, my new divisions are flawless," Becca replied.</p>
<p>Commenters chimed in with their suggestions on various changes they would make to the divisions.</p>
<p>"We oppose being placed in the Myth Division because Vikings did in fact exist," the petition read.</p>
<p>The New York Jets were also looking to be moved to a different division. Though originally placed in what Becca dubbed the "Rando Division," which she said were essentially nouns, the team hoped to be moved into the "Birds Division."</p>
<p>Some other teams were satisfied with their division placement, like the Kansas City Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders.</p>
<p>"We're into this," the Chiefs' official TikTok account commented.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be left out, other teams and leagues asked Becca to recreate divisions for their respective sports.</p>

<p>Former New York Jets wide receiver Josh Bellamy was sent to federal prison in Florida Friday after using his company, Drip Entertainment LLC, to fraudulently obtain $1.2 million from COVID-19 relief funds.</p>
<p>Bellamy, 32, was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in June. He is also required to pay restitution.</p>
<p>According to court records, Bellamy used false information and falsified documents, allegedly created by his accomplice James Stote, to obtain a $1.2 million loan for his company from the Paycheck Protection Program.</p>
<p>Bellamy admitted to using the loans for personal purchases such as a stay at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and to buy luxury items like jewelry.</p>
<p>Bellamy also told investigators that he paid more than $311,000 to Stote for his role, according to the prosecution. Stote is alleged to have been responsible for putting together and submitting the fraudulent documents needed for the loan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bellamy is alleged to have solicited loans for his family members and close associates.</p>
<p>The PPP was a part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security act. The PPP was designed to provide forgivable loans to businesses struggling because of the pandemic but has been at the the center of multiple fraud claims.</p>
<p>Stote was charged in June 2020 with wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud. His case is pending.</p>

<a>NFL</a>'s Sunday Night Football matchup featuring the Packers and the Chicago Bears. During the second quarter of the game, the veteran broadcaster began to speak about the season that Rodgers was having.
<p>Rodgers was previously fined by the NFL after it was determined that he had lied when asked by the media if he had been vaccinated. Rodgers replied that he was "immunized" but did not state that he had received the vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the league stated that the quarterback had also broken a number of other guidelines related to protocols for unvaccinated players. This included attending a party while maskless, according to reports.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old later contracted COVID-19 and missed ten days due to the NFL's quarantine protocol.</p>
<p>While many football broadcasters, such as former Pittsburgh Steelers star Terry Bradshaw, expressed anger at Rodgers for his misleading comments, Collinsworth went the other way, hailing him for being "honest".</p>
<p>"He had a lot of different things going on this year, for sure...he'll tell you what he thinks about everything," Collinsworth continued.</p>
<p>People online were quick to point out the seemingly strange moment, and pondered as to why the television veteran would refer to Rodgers as honest given his issues with the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Have you ever heard a guy be more honest...yes, Cris, most definitely have heard others be more honest," tweeted Arizona Daily Star reporter Michael Lev.</p>
<p>"Kind of rich for Cris Collinsworth to praise Aaron Rodgers for being honest considering the whole 'I'm immunized' thing," added <a>NBC</a> Chicago's James Neveau.</p>
<p>Another user responded to Collinsworth's commentary by tweeting out a humorous GIF of actor Tom Cruise in a confused state.</p>
<p>Some people online also expressed anger at what they felt was a broadcast that heavily skewed towards Packers favoritism, given that Sunday Night Football is a national broadcast.</p>
<p>The Green Bay quarterback has stood by his remarks, although he did apologize that some people had found his comments on the vaccine misleading.</p>
<p>"I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading. To anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility," Rodgers said on The Pat McAfee Show.</p>
<p>"I'm an athlete, not an activist," Rodgers continued. "I'm going to get back to doing what I do best and that's playing ball."</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding their quarterback did not seem to phase Green Bay. After eating the Bears 45-30 on Sunday, the Packers have won three out of their last four games and sit on top of the NFC North division with a 10-3 record.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons has claimed there are some "conspiracy" theories about Michele Tafoya and her recent absence from NBC's Sunday Night Football, a weekly television broadcast of <a>National Football League</a> (<a>NFL</a>) games.</p>
<p>Tafoya, a sideline reporter for Sunday Night Football who began her 11th season on the show this September, has been on a three-week absence.</p>
<h2>What Bill Simmons Said About Michele Tafoya's Absence</h2>
<p>In a December 13 episode of The Bill Simmons Podcast<a>,</a> the host of the podcast said: "There's some good conspiracy stuff going on" about Tafoya's absence.</p>
<p>Simmons reportedly said: "Because she [Tafoya] hosted 'The View' in the beginning of November. She was in the conservative seat, then a couple weeks later, all of a sudden, just on a bye. Taking a break.</p>
<p>"It would be one thing if the show was on 52 weeks a year, but it's only on 17 weeks a year. Do you need three weeks off during a 17-week season?," the podcast host added.</p>
<p><a>The Post's March and tweeted Monday</a>: "I will agree Tafoya's three games off out of around 20 is a bit odd in a 5 month season.</p>
<p>"Al Michaels [a <a>broadcaster for </a>Sunday Night Football<a>]</a> had two off so far and Cris Collinsworth [a game analyst for the show] had one," Marchand noted.</p>
<a>ABC</a>'s The View about Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers football team, and his exit from the NFL.
<p>The reporter appeared on The View on November 2 and 3 and worked the rest of the games through Thanksgiving on November 25, according to the Post's Marchand.</p>
<p>During Tafoya's appearances, she spoke about not having much sympathy for Kaepernick being out of the NFL.</p>
<a>Netflix</a> series, he's got Nike endorsements..."
<p>Addressing The View audience, she said at the time: "Oh, you're all gonna groan at me, bring it on, bring it on."</p>
<p>Host and reporter Kathryn Tappen has been filling in for Tafoya in her absence. Simmons also noted if he were Tafoya, he'd be concerned about his replacement possibly doing a "better" job than himself.</p>
<p>He explained: "If I'm Michele Tafoya, aren't you protecting your seat?</p>
<p>"I don't want anybody guest-sideline reporting for me. What if they're better than me?," he said.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Tafoya for comment.</p>

<p>Former NFL player Phillip Adams had "severe" Stage II chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) when he killed six people in the spring of 2021, according to a doctor from Boston University's CTE Center during a Tuesday press conference.</p>
<p>"Severe frontal lobe pathology might have contributed to Adams' behavioral abnormalities, in addition to physical, psychiatric and psychosocial factors," Dr. Ann McKee, director of the university's CTE Center, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Adams' family had given officials their approval for the university to do a CTE study on his brain. CTE is a disease that affects the brain, and repetitive head trauma is thought to be responsible for bringing it on in some people.</p>
<p>Hernandez's brain was also donated to Boston University to be studied. McKee said in 2017 that Hernandez suffered from CTE to a degree Boston University researchers had never seen in a person of Hernandez's age.</p>
<p>McKee said more than 315 former NFL players have received posthumous diagnoses of CTE. In CTE studies, most of the players who died in their 20s and 30s had Stage II of the disease. Hernandez was found to have Stage III.</p>
<p>Adams' "predominantly frontal lobe CTE pathology, which resulted in atrophy, or shrinkage, of the brain, was similar in severity to Aaron Hernandez," according to McKee.</p>
<p>Alonzo Adams, Phillip's father, said after the shooting that he believed football played a part in his son's mental issues.</p>
<p>"I can say he's a good kid," Alonzo Adams told <a>NBC</a> affiliate WCNC-TV. "I think the football messed him up."</p>
<p>Update 12/14/21, 11:50 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include more comments from Dr. Ann McKee's press conference. </p>
<p>The human remains of a woman who reportedly went missing in April may have been discovered in Texas last week.</p>
<p>According to a Facebook post published by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, local investigators along with members of the nonprofit Texas Eqqusearch recovery organization on Dec. 10 to search and excavate a site in northern Harris County.</p>
<p>The remains were referred to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. As of Tuesday, online case records showed that the cause and manner of death associated with the remains were still pending.</p>
<p>Records also indicated that the place of death was Spring, Texas, where Pomaski was last seen alive. It remains unclear when an autopsy will be performed.</p>
<p>"These remains have not been identified and there is no timeline for identification," said Michele Arnold, public information officer for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, told Newsweek on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In April, Ware was arrested and charged with two counts of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon.</p>
<p>Ware was released on bond on April 20. The last post on Pomaski's <a>Facebook</a> page is that she entered a relationship with Ware on April 23.</p>
<p>Thomas Gilliland, a deputy with the Harris County Sheriff's Office, told Newsweek on Tuesday that the only information being released by investigators in relation to Pomaski's disappearance is a missing person report.</p>
<p>On May 19, her case was transferred to the Harris County Sheriff's Office Homicide Unit for further investigation. Officials believed that due to the "suspicious circumstances" regarding her disappearance, she may have been a victim of foul play.</p>
<p>The Harris County District Attorney's Office could be reached for additional comment.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is requested to contact the Harris County Sheriff's Office or Crime Stoppers at 713-274-9100.</p>
<p>Adams, who was a defensive back and was originally drafted by the San Franciso 49ers, <a>allegedly shot six people</a> before killing himself on April 7 in South Carolina.</p>
<a>Adams had "severe" Stage II CTE</a> at the time of the shooting. She said "severe frontal lobe pathology might have contributed to Adams' behavioral abnormalities."
<p>Following the announcement, his family said in a statement they are thankful for being able to "have a better understanding of the mental turmoil that Phillip was dealing with during the last moments of his life."</p>
<p>But they said they were not surprised by the diagnosis, though noting "it is shocking to hear how severe his condition was."</p>
<p>They added that he previously sought help for the possibility of having the brain disease.</p>
<p>Adams' father Alonzo Adams told WCNC-TV, a Charlotte-based TV news station, that <a>he believes "football messed him up."</a></p>
<p>"He was a good kid. He was a good kid," he told the news station. "He didn't talk much and he didn't bother nobody."</p>

<p>The <a>NFL</a> is mandating that coaches, front-office staff, and team personnel must get a COVID booster by Dec. 27, as 36 players were put on the league's COVID list as of Monday.</p>
<p>All Tier 1 and Tier 2 individuals who have been inoculated fall under the league's requirement. However, players, although they fall under Tier 1, are not required as there are ongoing discussions between the league and the NFL Players Association.</p>
<a>CDC</a> advises that individuals should get a booster shot if they received a second dose of the
<a>Pfizer</a> or Moderna vaccine six months prior. A person who was inoculated with the single-dose Johnson Johnson shot over two months prior should get a booster shot.
<p>"Given the increased prevalence of the virus in our communities, our experts have recommended that we implement the CDC's recommendation," the league wrote in a memo to teams Monday that was acquired by t<a>he Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>However, those who are currently eligible must receive the booster shot within 14 days of becoming so.</p>
<p>Teams were requested to supply booster shots as soon as possible to eligible tiered staff, and to think about providing them for players, staff families and cohabitants.</p>
<p>Seahawks coach Pete Carroll addressed the possibility of players getting complacent about the virus.</p>
<p>"It is about being diligent. Diligence comes from the constant reminders and the discipline that it takes to stick with it."</p>
<p>"That shows our protocols are working and they're doing what they're designed to do, which is to prevent the virus from spreading in an uncontrolled manner throughout teams," Sills said.</p>
<p>But the more recent numbers are alarming, particularly on Monday.</p>
<p>"It's so far away from personal rights. I don't get it. ... It's constant as anything we've ever been around. We just have to do a good job. I've got to do better. I have to remind guys more."</p>

<p>Spectator sports like the NFL, <a>NBA</a> and <a>NHL</a> currently face uncertainties as all three professional leagues are seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>In the NFL, dozens of players have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week and even more have been placed under the league's COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the NFL for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Chicago Bulls have placed several players on the league's health and safety protocol list, which resulted in the NBA postponing two of their games on December 14 and December 16.</p>
<p>"Ten Bulls players, along with additional staff members, are currently in the NBA's Health and Safety protocol," the NBA said when the league announced the postponement.</p>
<p>The Bulls are reportedly 100 percent vaccinated against COVID.</p>
<p>While speaking with the New York Times, NBA spokesman Mike Bass said, "Like the rest of the country, and as was predicted by our infectious disease specialists, we have seen an increase of cases around the league."</p>
<p>"As we have since the pandemic began in March 2020, we will continue to follow the science and data, and will, in close partnership with the players' association, update our protocols as deemed appropriate by our medical experts," Bass said.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the NBA for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>
<p>The Associated Press also recently reported that the NHL is working to reimpose stricter COVID-19 policies, such daily virus testing, citing anonymous sources with direct knowledge of discussions between the NHL and the NHL Players' Association.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the NHL for comment.</p>
<p>Some NHL players have also pushed to not appear in the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing as part of their collective bargaining agreement with owners, according to ESPN.</p>

<p>A pair of Florida men pleaded guilty to a $35 million COVID-19 fraud scheme that involved a local Florida rapper and an ex-NFL player, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Thursday.</p>
<p>In total, the pair submitted at least 79 fraudulent loan applications that were worth at least $35 million, and had reportedly planned to submit more before being caught.</p>
<p>The fraudulent loans reportedly involved the use of false IRS forms, fake payroll numbers, and falsified bank statements.</p>
<p>The two each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Stote and Augustin's scheme was reportedly part of a large COVID-19 fraud ring involving a number of high-profile individuals, including Florida rapper Diamond Blue Smith.</p>
<p>An additional loan that Smith received was reportedly worth over $700,000.</p>
<p>Smith admitted to using Stote and Augustin to help prepare the fraudulent applications, paying them each kickbacks of $250,000 in order to secure their assistance.</p>
<p>Once receiving the loans, Smith spent the money on a number of luxury items, including a Ferrari, as well as gambling at Florida's Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>Smith was originally charged with wire fraud in October 2020, according to the DOJ. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (<a>FBI</a>) called Smith's sentencing "a deterrent to anyone who would commit fraud targeting COVID-19 relief programs."</p>
<p>Beyond Stote and Augustin, the original 2020 complaint named a number of other co-conspirators in the massive scheme.</p>
<p>One of the notable names mentioned was former <a>NFL</a> wide receiver Josh Bellamy. The 32-year-old played with five different NFL clubs from 2012 to 2019, including the Chicago Bears.</p>
<p>Bellamy allegedly paid Stote a $300,000 kickback to help him prepare a fraudulent loan application, which eventually led to a $1.2 million loan for Bellamy's company, Drip Entertainment, according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>The loan was similarly used towards a number of luxury items like jewlery, and also spent at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>Bellamy was charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy related to the scheme. He pleaded guilty this past June and was sentenced to 37 months in prison on Monday.</p>
<p>In total, the scheme involved at least 11 other defendants who were charged, according to DOJ filings.</p>

<p>NFL star Vincent Jackson had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of his death, his family have said.</p>
<p>Jackson, a former wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was found dead in a hotel room in Florida in February this year. He was 38 years old.</p>
<p>His cause of death was not immediately clear, but his family have told The New York Times that the NFL player was diagnosed with CTE, a degenerative brain disease, after his death.</p>
<p>CTE is found in people who have a history of repetitive trauma to the head and brain, <a>such as athletes</a> who play contact sports, according to the CTE Center in Boston University.</p>
<p>CTE occurs when repeated brain trauma leads to the malfunction of a protein called tau. This malfunction causes a chain reaction in other proteins and the damage spreads throughout the brain.</p>
<a>YouTube explainer</a> for the Concussion Legacy Foundation. According to The New York Times, Vincent Jackson's widow Lindsey Jackson agreed to speak out about the condition in order to help families of other former football players spot CTE's effects.
<p>"I think the message is, if you played for a long time and you're experiencing symptoms, it's very likely that this is what it is," she told the newspaper.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a>it was reported</a> that CTE may have been a factor in the case of Phillip Adams, a former NFL player accused of shooting and killing six people in April this year. Adams then took his own life.</p>

<p>The man previously convicted of killing former NFL running back Joe McKnight had his conviction of manslaughter overturned and is no longer allowed to be tried on a murder charge under double jeopardy laws.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld District Judge Ellen Shirer Kovach's February ruling that Ronald Gasser could not be retried under a murder charge because it would be unconstitutional in a 2-1 panel vote.</p>
<a>Supreme Court</a> ruled that the non-unanimous 10-2 vote in the verdict was unconstitutional and the case needed to be retired.
<p>The prosecutor in the case wanted Gasser on charge for murder in the new trial. The idea was declined after Kovach ruled it would be unconstitutional to have him be retried under the murder charge because it violates double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Gasser remains jailed pending trial.</p>
<p>The Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office declined to comment on Thursday.</p>
<p>McKnight was a high school football hero at Louisiana's John Curtis Christian School who played three seasons for the New York Jets and one with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>Gasser fatally shot McKnight on December 1, 2016, after what authorities described as a rolling 5-mile (8-kilometer) traffic dispute and chase over a New Orleans area bridge.</p>
<p>One prosecutor acknowledged to the jury that he was "driving like a jerk." But prosecutors argued that Gasser escalated the conflict, following McKnight down an exit that he would not ordinarily have taken.</p>
<p>Gasser's defense team insisted he fired at McKnight in self-defense.</p>

<p>The NFL postponed two games this weekend into next week because of COVID-19 issues within a pair of teams. Twelve games are in the books, though, and there have been plenty of incredible feats and facts so far.</p>
<p>The biggest shocker of the weekend was the lowly Detroit Lions knocking off the Arizona Cardinals, 30-12. The Lions had the worst record entering the league at 1-11-1 while the Cardinals had the best record at 10-3.</p>
<p>Here are 12 more interesting facts from the weekend so far:</p>
<li>Detroit's win over Arizona marked the second time in two years that a team with one win or fewer beat a team with 10 or more wins. In 2020, the New York Jets (1-13) beat the Cleveland Browns (10-4), 23-16 in Week 16.</li>
<li>The Buccaneers led the league in points per game, but were shutout Sunday night. They became the first team since the 1970 NFL merger to lead the league in points and get shutout in either December or January—and it happened at home in Tampa.</li>
<li>Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger passed for 148 yards in a 19-13 win over the Tennessee Titans, giving "Big" Ben 63,562 career passing yards. That moves him past Philip Rivers and into fifth all-time in that category.</li>
<li>Since the Indianapolis Colts defeated the New England Patriots on Saturday, no AFC teams can clinch a division title by Week 15, marking the first time since 2002 that AFC teams enter Week 16 with no divisional winners declared yet.</li>
<li>With five games remaining this weekend, 28 of the league's 32 teams are still in contention for a playoff spot. The most teams ever in contention at this point of the season has been 27, which was set three times (1982, 1995, 2004).</li>
<li>Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs grabbed his league-leading 10th interception of the season in his team's 21-6 win over the New York Giants.</li>
<li>The Cowboys forced four turnovers Sunday for their third-consecutive game, a feat that hasn't been done in a three-game span since the 2007 Detroit Lions.</li>
<p>There are still two more games to play on Monday night and two more on Tuesday, so things could get even more interesting.</p>
<p>Taylor reportedly turned himself in after Pembroke Pines police told him there was a warrant out for his arrest, and was released after being booked into Broward County jail and posting $500 bail Thursday.</p>
<p>Taylor's attorney Arthur Aidala said in a statement that Taylor was compliant with officers, and has acted in accordance with the regulations of his sex offender status for the last 10 years, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Judge William Kelly ruled in 2011 for Taylor to be placed on the lowest level of the registry as he felt it was unlikely Taylor represented a risk to the public or that he would repeat his actions that brought the initial charges, according to ESPN.</p>
<p>Level 1 sex offenders are required to register for 20 years, while the higher two levels are permanent designations.</p>
<p>Taylor spent his entire 13-season career with the New York Giants and helped the team win Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991.</p>
<div> Sports NFL <a>National Football League</a> <a>Omicron</a></div>
<p>The National Football League and its players' union agreed on Saturday to roll back COVID-19 testing protocols for vaccinated players.</p>
<p>The decision comes as the Omicron variant continues to spread across the country. Three games were moved back on the Week 15 schedule due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>The first day of the league's new protocols saw 47 players put on the reserve list, which is designated for players that have been exposed to COVID-19. Many of the players put on the list were asymptomatic and vaccinated.</p>
<p>However, some experts are skeptical of the effectiveness of the new protocols due to the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Almost 95 percent of players and team staff members are vaccinated.</p>
<p>The move aligns with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The <a>CDC</a> recommends "diagnostic testing" only for symptomatic or close-contact vaccinated people, and "screening tests" only for unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>Gupta, an informal consultant for the Seattle Seahawks on COVID-19 issues and an adviser for Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners, says the NFL is "ahead of the curve" with target and voluntary testing.</p>
<p>It's fair to wonder if the NFL is putting its desire to finish the season uninterrupted ahead of health and safety. But the league and its team of doctors point to science and data.</p>

<div> Culture NFL <a>Babies</a> <a>Indianapolis Colts</a></div>
<p>NFL star Ryan Kelly has received an outpouring of support after he and his wife announced the death of their baby.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Colts player and his wife Emma experienced a pregnancy loss at 19 weeks and have shared the sad announcement on social media.</p>
<p>On Monday, the couple announced that their daughter, Mary Kate, had passed away.</p>
<p>Emma Kelly was 19 weeks pregnant with the couple's first child when she discovered her daughter's "little heart just stopped for reasons unknown" and that she would have to be delivered early.</p>
<p>Emma Kelly gave birth to Mary Kate on December 14 after 48 hours in labor.</p>
<p>"I was 19 weeks along, 1 week from the halfway mark. Women have a 1 percent chance of losing their baby this far along, and yet somehow, here we are."</p>
<p>Ryan Kelly shared his own post to his late daughter, writing that "nothing made me happier than being your Dad."</p>
<p>He continued: "You were simply a miracle and always will be. I'm sorry you never got to open those sweet eyes and see us or take your first steps but you have angel wings now."</p>
<p>Colts coach Frank Reich has said that Ryan Kelly can take all the time he needs before returning to the field.</p>
<p>"What we've said to Ryan is 'Hey, take all the time you need, we're 100 percent behind you and Emma,' " Coach coach Frank Reich said, per <a>Yahoo</a>. "'We're here to support you, and when you're ready to take that step, we're right here.'</p>
<p>"I'm just not going to push that," Reich said. "Far as I know, it could be tomorrow, it could be a week from now. Whatever it is, we're 100 percent behind him."</p>
<p>Reich said he and the team are behind Ryan Kelly as he and his wife mourn their tragic loss.</p>
<p>"These situations, as I think we all know, in life, there's no perfect formula for how to handle these situations," Reich said. "Everybody has to go through their process as a family. The mourning, and the healing steps that it takes."</p>
<p>Former Colts player, Darius Butler reached out to Ryan Kelly on <a>Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"Praying for Ryan Kelly and his family," he posted.</p>
<p>"Praying for y'all bro," he said,</p>
<p>While sports reporter Larra Overton added: "Embracing you and Emma with prayers, strength, love and faith."</p>
<p>Before the games were moved, the league opened discussions with the NFL Players Association to cancel the games because of COVID outbreaks affecting the Browns, Rams and Washington.</p>
<p>But two player reps with knowledge of the discussions told the Associated Press canceling the games was never the No. 1 plan. Both reps spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the conversations.</p>
<p>NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the AP on Wednesday: "Our goal has been to play the season as scheduled in a safe, responsible way."</p>
<p>Tretter said the union's executive committee voted unanimously "that our position needed to be that games need to be rescheduled and not canceled and we pushed the league to that resolution."</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is focused on the games and not when they will be played.</p>
<p>"You don't worry about it because it's out of our control, so we can't worry about things we can't control," he said.</p>

<p>The events that led to his meteoric rise in the NFL, via a $5.50 an hour job and the Arena Football League (AFL), are played out in the new movie American Underdog, which arrives in theaters on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Shazam! star Zachary Levi has the honor of playing the Hall of Famer but his co-star Anna Paquin has an equally as important role.</p>
<p>American Underdog is more family drama than sports biopic, with Paquin playing Kurt's wife Brenda Warner, whom Kurt credits with helping him achieve his sporting ambitions.</p>
<p>When it came to casting the younger versions of themselves, they were both thrilled with the choices—eventually.</p>
<p>"Make no mistake, we were constantly vetting them," Kurt chimes in, "We were constantly looking on set like, 'Are they gonna be able to pull this off?' But they got it."</p>
<p>Movie Kurt's story begins in college when he meets Brenda, who is already a mother to two children, one of whom, Zack, is blind after he was accidentally dropped by Brenda's ex-husband.</p>
<p>"That relationship between Kurt and Zack was really the key of the whole film," says Andrew Erwin, one half of the Erwin brothers, the co-directors of American Underdog.</p>
<a>Beto O'Rourke</a>, Kurt wrote: "He hit the nail on the head he did so not by dividing the 2 sides but by joining them together in realizing the freedoms of our country have been forged by soldiers but also by many others who have fought in diff ways!"
<p>Three years on from that statement on the taking of the knee—five years on from when Colin Kaepernick first made the gesture—Kurt wants people to be able to share their own beliefs without persecution and judgment.</p>
<p>"For me, stand for what you believe in, whatever that is. So I'm never going to criticize anyone if they feel strongly about something and for representing that."</p>
<p>American Underdog is out in movie theaters in the United States from December 25.</p>
