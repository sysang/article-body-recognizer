<p>Gardens with Purpose said it has been conducting classes for the public and students to create awareness about urban farming.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to work on this project as I believe it will get people to reimagine urban farming and how they too might start growing their favourite vegetables,” said Ms Joanne Ng, owner of the local urban farming school.</p>
<p>In recent years, urban farms have gained popularity in Singapore. These include farms built on top of multistorey car parks in the heartlands, on the side of HDB buildings, as well as in laboratories.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also underscored the importance of local food production as a buffer in the event of global supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Last year, the Government announced a master plan to <a>transform the larger Lim Chu Kang area</a> into a high-tech agri-food cluster to bolster Singapore’s food security and also create jobs.</p>
<p>Singapore has set a target of meeting <a>30 per cent of its nutritional needs</a> with food produced locally by 2030. Currently, Singapore imports more than 90 per cent of its food.</p>

<p>SKJERVOY: In the pale winter darkness of northern Norway, a huge flock of seagulls circles above an Arctic fjord, signifying the presence of a group of unusual predators in the water below.</p>
<p>With Arctic sea ice shrinking at record levels due to global warming, killer whales are expanding their hunting grounds further north and spending more time in polar waters, US scientists say.</p>
<p>But the giant mammals, also known as orcas and which are at the top of the food chain, risk creating an "ecological imbalance" in the Arctic by preying on endangered species, warned a University of Washington study this month.</p>
<p>When AFP visited the vast Skjervoy fjord in the Arctic Ocean, 70 to 80 killer whales could be seen gathering in family clans of about 10, including calves under a year old.</p>
<p>"Through acoustic surveys, we have detected orcas in the Barents Sea in November between Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, so they are clearly following the edge of the ice," Marie-Anne Blanchet of the Norwegian Polar Institute told AFP.</p>
<p>The killer whale, which with a global population estimated at 50,000 is found in almost all of the world's seas, feeds on Arctic prey such as the beluga whale and, most likely, some species of seal, the specialist said.</p>
<p>The whales' changing migration patterns are also linked to the fact that their food of choice, herring, is also moving further north, for reasons that are still unclear.</p>
<p>"They are predators with a great capacity to adapt, so they are opportunistic," Blanchet said.</p>
<p>The new hunting grounds are also leading to unprecedented conflict with humans.</p>
<p>In the waters off Greenland's capital Nuuk, four orcas, considered an unwelcome competitor by local fishermen and hunters, were killed at the end of November, an act permissible under Greenlandic law.</p>
<p>A University of Washington study presented at the beginning of December found that the increased migration of super predators is a consequence of the increasingly long season when the Arctic Ocean is free of ice.</p>
<p>"It's not necessarily that killer whales haven't been reported in these areas before, but that they appear to be remaining in the area for longer periods of time," co-author Brynn Kimber wrote.</p>
<p>The Arctic is warming three times faster than the rest of the planet, impacting the extent of the ice pack and the ecosystems that depend on it.</p>
<p>Arctic sea ice, which is also getting thinner, has shrunk on average by more than 13 percent per decade over the past 40 years.</p>
<p>By the end of the summer of 2012, it had reached its lowest level on record, at 3.4 million square kilometres, almost half the size it was during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Analysing eight years of acoustic readings, Kimber's team also detected killer whales in the Chukchi Sea between Alaska and Russia during the months when it used to be frozen, as well as with greater frequency during the summer.</p>
<p>The study warned that the hunter, which also chases after prey in packs, is increasingly attacking the endangered bowhead whale, a species left exposed by the retreating ice pack.</p>
<p>These attacks are "likely to increase due to longer open water seasons," the researchers said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Giant rubber whale helps Kiwi rescuers battle beachings </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>WELLINGTON: A two-tonne rubber whale can take on a life of its own in the frigid shallows of a windswept New Zealand beach, particularly when a bedraggled group of would-be rescuers is trying to wrestle it into a harness.</p>
<p>"Keep the blowhole clear... you're too close to the tail, one swipe can do a serious injury to yourself and the whale," an instructor yells as the Wellington rain lashes his pupils.</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort, enthusiasm levels remain high as the group successfully manoeuvre the five-metre long pilot whale replica onto a mat between two inflatable pontoons.</p>
<p>The giant black dummy, and a smaller 200kg version representing a dolphin, are eventually guided to deeper waters by volunteers trained by the New Zealand whale rescue charity Project Jonah.</p>
<p>Filled with water the latex marine mammals help teams prepare for real emergencies - New Zealand has one of the highest whale stranding rates in the world.</p>
<p>Around 300 animals beach themselves annually, according to official figures and it is not unusual for groups of between 20 and 50 pilot whales to run aground.</p>
<p>But numbers can run into the hundreds when a "super pod" is involved -- in 2017, there was a mass stranding of almost 700 pilot whales.</p>
<p>"There are always going to be strandings - there was one on Monday, there'll probably be one next week," Project Jonah's communications manager Louisa Hawkes told about 30 trainee whale medics during a course in Wellington.</p>
<p>The wait turns out to be considerably shorter, with a baby pilot whale found stranded in Christchurch that same morning.</p>
<p>As the course continues in a community hall, a Project Jonah coordinator paces outside giving advice via mobile phone to wildlife rangers at the opposite end of the country desperately trying to save the animal.</p>
<p>Sadly, their efforts prove futile and the infant is euthanised a few hours later when its pod cannot be located.</p>
<p>"Strandings are incredibly emotional," Hawkes tells the volunteers. "If a whale isn't refloated it can really, really hurt, particularly if you've bonded with it.</p>
<p>"You need to ensure you have the resilience needed to cope with whatever's going to happen."</p>
<p>No one knows why whales strand but Hawkes said it sometimes occurred when old, sick or injured animals swam ashore and other pod members followed.</p>
<p>She said one orca, a male named Nobby, had been rescued on seven separate occasions from North Island beaches after beaching himself chasing stingrays for food.</p>
<p>Most mass strandings in New Zealand involve pilot whales on gently sloping beaches, which confuse their sonar making them think they are in open waters.</p>
<p>Other pod members then beach themselves trying to respond to the trapped whale's distress signals.</p>
<p>The South Island's notorious Farewell Spit, a 26-kilometre (16 mile) hook of sand that protrudes into the sea, has been the scene of at least 10 pilot whale strandings in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>"It's what we call a perfect whale trap," Hawkes said.</p>
<p>Many stranded whales are found to be malnourished because their stomachs are full of plastic pollution, while explosions from undersea mining and naval exercises have also been linked to groundings.</p>
<p>Project Jonah was established in 1974 and is regarded as a world leader in whale rescue, helping train New Zealand's conservation department and police in what to do when strandings occur.</p>
<p>The charity has a network of 4,000 volunteers it can mobilise during mass standings, most of them ordinary people who have undergone basic training in becoming marine mammal medics.</p>
<p>Aside from the emotional toll, Project Jonah warns that whale rescue involves numerous physical risks, including possible injury from the thrashing animals.</p>
<p>The whale's blowhole expels bacteria and fungi, while the water around the stranded animals is soon contaminated with faeces and blood, the latter of which can attract sharks.</p>
<p>Even dead whales pose a hazard because their bellies fill with gas as they decompose, and can cause the carcasses to explode.</p>
<p>Hawkes, a former youth worker who has been involved with Project Jonah for nine years and lost count of the animals she has saved, said it was worth it to see a stranded whale swimming off into the distance.</p>
<p>"It's one of the most enriching, rewarding experiences of your life - it's something that will touch you," she said.</p>
<p>"To be able to help out these marine mammals at the most stressful moment of their life is an absolute privilege."</p>

<div> <div> <a> Rashvinjeet S Bedi </a> </div> </div>
<p>SHAH ALAM: As Mr Azwadi Awang, 35, and his neighbour placed four children from their families onto a small boat manned by a volunteer on Sunday (Dec 19) evening, they could only watch in horror as it capsized in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>Without thinking twice, they quickly jumped into the floodwaters of Taman Sri Muda, Shah Alam to save all the children, including a one-year-old baby. </p>
<p>“My heart was in my mouth and I didn't know what to think except to jump in the water,” he recounted to CNA when met at the township on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the children were safe. After a while, they managed to put the one-year-old baby and her aunt as well as another child back on the boat.</p>
<p>Altogether, 15 people from three families who were all neighbours were trying to seek refuge from the floodwaters in a house which was slightly higher than others in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On Monday, they were eventually rescued by the Fire and Rescue Department (Bomba) personnel who had been mobilised from Penang. </p>
<p>“I am relieved that we are all safe, but I can’t think of what lies ahead for us when we get home. Everything is lost,” said Mr Azwadi.</p>
<p>The water engulfed the first floor and almost reached the second floor of his home. His three cars and three motorcycles were submerged in water.</p>
<p>The township of Taman Sri Muda is among the worst affected areas following heavy downpours that pounded Peninsular Malaysia from last Friday until Saturday. The flooding has been described as a “once in a hundred years” event.</p>
<p>Many stranded residents had to wait until Monday before being rescued. Shah Alam police reportedly said on Monday that seven people have been found dead in Selangor state, including four in Taman Sri Muda.</p>
<p>As the water level slowly receded to waist level on Monday, some Taman Sri Muda residents opted to try to get out of the flood zone by themselves, as they could not wait any longer for help.</p>
<p>Some people were even seen holding on to tyres and other plastic items while evacuating from the flooded area.</p>
<p>On Monday, the authorities could be seen stepping up efforts to evacuate those stuck in their homes by boats.</p>
<p>Housing and Local Government Minister Reezal Merican Naina Merican said that a total of 321 personnel, including those from Bomba, police, army and related agencies had been mobilised to immediately evacuate flood victims in Taman Sri Muda.</p>
<p>He said the area, which has about 4,400 houses, was the main focus of rescue efforts and evacuation of flood victims.</p>
<p>"Rescue efforts are quite difficult and there are also homes where water is stagnant. However, efforts to distribute food are ongoing,” Bernama quoted him as saying during a media conference.</p>
<p>Reporters were brought on a Malaysian Civil Defence Force truck to inspect the flooded area but the truck had to turn back after around 100m, as the waters were too high for it to pass through.</p>
<p>The bonnets of several vehicles were barely visible, after they were submerged by floodwaters that burst from the Klang River located next to the housing area. </p>
<p>Another Taman Sri Muda resident who was rescued on Monday was Ms B Jayamani, 45.</p>
<p>Together with her mother, sister-in-law and a pet dog, the group was evacuated using a boat. Her brother, Mr B Tiyagu waded through the waters, holding another pet dog. </p>
<p>Ms Jayamani said one of her pet dogs was left behind as it was afraid of water. </p>
<p>Recounting the ordeal, she said the group did not have their own food for two days. However, their immediate neighbours cooked for them and gave them food through the windows on the first floor.</p>
<p>She said that besides the loss of their vehicles and electrical appliances, her younger brother’s wedding clothes and invitation cards worth about RM5,000 (US$1,183) had been lost in the flood. He was supposed to get married in two months. </p>
<p>“Everything is gone. I don’t know how to build back,” she said.</p>
<p>She said that there is an elderly lady living across from her who is believed to be still trapped at home.</p>
<p>On Monday, some of those who were evacuated earlier tried to return to Taman Sri Muda, either to check on the damage or seek news about their loved ones.</p>
<p>Ms Irniyusnita Mat Deris, 39, was among those who returned to the neighbourhood after being evacuated. She was hoping to get news of her sister and the latter’s child who is asthmatic. </p>
<p>She and her husband had walked out of their home on Saturday evening when floodwaters were at their waist level.</p>
<p>Her 10-year-old son had just undergone circumcision a few days back. Her husband had carried him for four hours so that they could get to a safer place. </p>
<p>Her sister and her child are currently at an evacuation centre in the area but she has lost contact with them.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about my belongings, I am only worried about them,” Ms Irniyusnita said, sobbing heavily.</p>
<p>A supervisor of a motorcycle shop Hasrena Aidil, 39, was hoping to check on the damage from the flooding. Her car at the workshop as well as about 87 motorbikes were submerged in water. </p>
<p>Earlier, she and her colleagues had evacuated and sought refuge with another colleague who was living in a flat about 2km from their workplace.</p>
<p>She remembered having to tiptoe and raise her hands, so that her mobile phone would not get submerged.</p>
<p>She was rescued by volunteers on Sunday and tried to return to her workplace on Monday but was unable to do so.</p>
<p>“I’m just frustrated and disappointed that the authorities have been slow to act,” she said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Woodside, Keppel to study hydrogen supply to Singapore </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: Woodside Petroleum is working with units of Keppel Corp and Osaka Gas to study a long-term supply of liquid hydrogen from Western Australia to Singapore and potentially Japan, the companies said on Wednesday (Dec 22).</p>
<p>The study, which is in line with the Singapore Green Plan, will go on until mid-2022, before the companies decide on their next move.</p>
<p>For Woodside, Singapore and Japan would be ideal export destinations for hydrogen from its planned H2Perth Hydrogen facility in Western Australia, while Keppel Data Centres said it is studying the use of hydrogen to power its data centres.</p>
<p>City Energy, owned by Keppel Infrastructure Trust, said it would look into using hydrogen to help cut carbon emissions from its town gas manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>Osaka Gas, which has a partnership with City Energy in Singapore, said it would contribute its know-how from the LNG import business to help develop a hydrogen supply chain between Australia and Singapore.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'It's no more': Philippine surfing paradise wiped out by typhoon </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>GENERAL LUNA, Philippines: Resort and bar owners on a Philippine island popular with surfers and tourists were expecting a bumper Christmas holiday after COVID-19 restrictions finally eased. Then Super Typhoon Rai wiped them out.</p>
<p>The strongest storm to hit the archipelago this year cut a swathe through Siargao, a tropical paradise known for its sandy beaches, big waves and relaxed vibe.</p>
<p>Packing wind speeds of 195kmh as it made landfall on the island last Thursday (Dec 16), Rai uprooted palm trees, shredded thatched roofs, smashed wooden buildings, and toppled power poles.</p>
<p>The widespread destruction left the island - voted the best in Asia by Conde Nast Traveler readers this year - unrecognisable.</p>
<p>"The day after the storm, we went outside and we were like 'wow, this is Siargao now, it's no more'," Claudine Mendoza, 27, a sous chef at a beachfront resort, told AFP.</p>
<p>"Even Cloud Nine is no more, it was really devastated," Mendoza said, referring to the island's surf break where a wooden boardwalk - a favoured selfie spot for tourists - was swept away by the typhoon.</p>
<p>The storm is a bitter blow for tourism operators, hitting them a week before the Christmas holidays when many Filipino families typically head to the country's famed beaches and dive spots.</p>
<p>Pandemic travel restrictions decimated visitor numbers to the island in the past two years, leaving many resorts, cafes, souvenir shops and tour guides struggling to survive.</p>
<p>But domestic tourism began to pick up in recent months as the government relaxed rules to boost economic activity - though it kept a <a>ban on foreign travellers entering the country</a>.</p>
<p>"Everyone was so happy, the island was lively again," Mendoza said. "Then suddenly the storm came."</p>
<p>Now, business owners face expensive repairs or having to start from scratch, and their employees an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Some are wondering if it is even worth trying to begin again.</p>
<p>"This typhoon is much worse for us than the pandemic - the pandemic didn't cause any (structural) damage," said resort owner Anton Alvarez.</p>
<p>"We think we have the capacity to rebuild but there's no point in rebuilding if it's just us - we need the whole of Siargao to rebuild."</p>
<h2>"WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?"</h2>
<p>With electricity across the island knocked out, there is no signal or Internet, which has hampered efforts of disaster agencies to assess the full extent of the death and destruction caused by the storm.</p>
<p>A least <a>375 people were killed on the islands hit by Rai</a>, national police have reported - including 167 in the region that includes Siargao.</p>
<p>Farmers and fisherfolk have also seen their livelihoods destroyed, and thousands of families left homeless.</p>
<p>Elka Requinta, a marketing coordinator on Siargao, said the strength of the typhoon caught everyone by surprise.</p>
<p>"We didn't expect it to be this bad," said Requinta, 36.</p>
<p>"You have locals who were hit because I don't think there was a call for any evacuation from the government."</p>
<p>It could take months for power to be fully restored to the island, making it difficult for business owners to talk to their partners and investors about the future.</p>
<p>Alvarez said he would like to reopen his resort within 12 months, but admitted that was "pretty optimistic".</p>
<p>"What will happen now?" asked Mendoza.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'A little aid would help': Typhoon Rai survivors in the Philippines beg for food </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SURIGAO CITY: Jennifer Vetonio stands on a road in the southern Philippines begging for money and food from passing drivers.</p>
<p>A week after Super Typhoon Rai destroyed her house, she has not received a scrap of government aid.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless after Rai cut a swathe through the vast archipelago last Thursday (Dec 16), knocking out power across entire islands and leaving desperate survivors pleading for help.</p>
<p>"We don't have food, my baby has no milk or diapers," said Vetonio, 23, in the devastated city of Surigao, on the northern tip of Mindanao island.</p>
<p>"I hope the government will help us - even a little aid would help us recover," she said, holding a plastic bottle with the top cut off that she uses to collect alms from motorists.</p>
<p>The military, coast guard and humanitarian organisations have ramped up efforts to get food, drinking water and temporary shelter to the hardest-hit islands.</p>
<p>President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a state of calamity in the typhoon-affected areas, where at least 375 people were killed, freeing up funds for relief efforts and giving local officials power to control prices.</p>
<p>But the scale of the destruction, lack of mobile phone signal or Internet in many areas, and depleted government coffers after the COVID-19 response were hampering efforts to distribute aid.</p>
<p>The damage caused by Rai has been likened to Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.</p>
<p>Siargao, Dinagat, Mindanao and Bohol islands are among the most devastated by the latest storm, which tore off roofs, shredded wooden buildings, felled concrete power poles and uprooted trees.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> 'It's no more': Philippine surfing paradise wiped out by typhoon </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>"So many houses were destroyed," Red Cross chairman Richard Gordon told AFP.</p>
<p>"Destruction is destruction. It's just the cycle of poverty all over again."</p>
<p>Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season: Most cyclones develop between July and October.</p>
<p>Anna Cloren from the state weather forecaster said the storm intensified faster than expected, and initial data showed it had dumped more rain than Haiyan.</p>
<p>Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.</p>
<p>The Philippines - ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change - is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.</p>
<p>In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest storm ever to have made landfall, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing. The death toll from Rai is not expected to get anywhere close to that number.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 people were still in evacuation centres or sheltering with relatives, the national disaster agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Thousands of acres of crops have been wiped out, fishing communities devastated and tourism operators left with no livelihood.</p>
<p>Long queues of people waiting to refill empty water drums or fill up motorbike fuel tanks have been seen across the affected regions.</p>
<p>"Humanitarian needs and gaps are high across all sectors and the humanitarian situation may further deteriorate if these needs are not addressed immediately," the United Nations' humanitarian office warned.</p>
<p>"On the first day we got maybe a kilogram of rice each," said Maria Consumo, 41, who is six months pregnant and begging for handouts on the side of a road near Surigao City.</p>
<p>"We think they gave priority to Siargao," she said, referring to the popular tourist destination where Rai made landfall packing wind speeds of 195kmh.</p>
<p>Marites Sotis, 53, said most of her family's coconut trees were knocked down by the storm and it would take years to grow more.</p>
<p>"We're back to square one," she said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Japan picks operators for 3 offshore wind power projects </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Japan's industry and land ministries have selected three consortiums, all led by Mitsubishi, as the operators for three offshore wind power projects in Akita, northern Japan, and Chiba, near Tokyo, they said on Friday (Dec 24).</p>
<p>The announcement is the second set of results of government auctions for offshore blocks under a new law to promote wind power as Japan aims to boost renewable power capacity to help achieve its 2050 goal of becoming carbon neutral.</p>
<p>The winner of the 391 megawatts (MW) wind farm off the coast of Choshi in Chiba is a consortium of Mitsubishi Corp Energy Solutions, Mitsubishi Corp and C-Tech Corp, a subsidiary of Chubu Electric Power Co Inc.</p>
<p>Another consortium of the same three companies also won the 479 MW project off the coast of Noshiro, Mitane and Oga in Akita.</p>
<p>A third consortium of the same three companies and Venti Japan Inc, Akita-based renewable energy firm, was selected for the 819 MW project off the coast of Yurihonjyo in Akita.</p>
<p>The three projects are scheduled to start operation between September 2028 and December 2030.</p>
<p>Five groups each participated in the tenders for the two blocks in Akita while two consortium bid for the Chiba area, the ministries said. The tenders were held from Nov 27 last year to May 27 this year.</p>
<p>Governments worldwide are expected to offer a record number of tenders for offshore wind sites and capacity this year, with more than 30 GW on the block, as more and more countries strive to boost wind power to reduce carbon footprints.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Discipline key to India's dominant day, says Agarwal </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PRETORIA: Mayank Agarwal believes discipline and application were the key elements to India’s commanding score of 272 for three on day one of the first test against South Africa on Sunday.</p>
<p>After electing to bat, India looked largely untroubled on a slow wicket with Agarwal scoring 60 in a first-wicket stand of 117 with KL Rahul who finished the day on a patient 122 not out.</p>
<p>"We really applied ourselves as batsmen, we were really determined and disciplined about how we went about it," Agarwal told reporters at Centurion Park.</p>
<p>"There was a bit of moisture in the wicket early and that is why a few balls kicked from a length. It got a little better to bat on as the day progressed and got a little quicker.</p>
<p>"The crucial point for us is getting partnerships. We had a good partnership first up and then with Virat (Kohli) and KL, and now with Ajinkya (Rahane) and KL. Making our partnerships bigger and bigger is the key."</p>
<p>Agarwal said the other batsmen could learn from Rahul's organisation at the crease.</p>
<p>"He really understands where his off-stump is, he is getting into line with the ball and leaving really well. He is very disciplined with his game-plans and his mindset. He is looking to bat sessions and bat through (the innings) when he gets set."</p>
<p>Sri Lanka scored 396 in the first innings at Centurion exactly a year ago and still lost the test, though India will point to a far superior bowling line-up to test the South Africans.</p>
<p>"We will just try and get as many as well can," Agarwal said. "The first hour (on Monday) will be crucial and if we can (get through that) then we can definitely pile on a good total. A score of 400 plus would be good."</p>

<p>STOCKHOLM: Norway's double Olympic cross country skiing champion Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg will miss the 2022 Games in Beijing due to health issues, the country's winter sports governing body said on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>The Norwegian Ski Federation (NSF) said the 31-year-old, who won gold in the team sprint in Sochi in 2014 and the 4x5km relay in Pyeongchang in 2018, would miss the Tour de Ski and the Olympics.</p>
<p>Oestberg returned to the national team in November after almost two years of health problems, in which the results she returned in physical tests were not deemed to be high enough for the ski federation to clear her to compete.</p>
<p>Oestberg won the overall World Cup title in 2019.</p>
<p>"I have put in a huge amount of work, done my best, felt good and enjoyed participating in cross-country skiing again. (My) dreams are shattered, but I can do nothing but look forward," she said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Arsenal v Wolves Premier League game postponed due to COVID-19 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers' Premier League match at Arsenal on Tuesday has been postponed due to COVID-19 cases and injuries in the Wolves squad, the league announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>A total of 15 Premier League games have been postponed this month due to COVID-19, but the league said it intended to continue the fixture schedule where safely possible.</p>
<p>The Premier League only grants a postponement if a club has fewer than 14 players - 13 outfield players and one goalkeeper - available, with the board examining requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>It is the second Wolves match to be postponed this season after their Boxing Day clash at home to Watford was also called off due to COVID-19 cases in the Watford camp.</p>
<p>Earlier, Leeds United's home game against Aston Villa on Tuesday was also called off due to positive COVID-19 cases and injuries in the Leeds squad.</p>

<p>Leeds United's home Premier League game against Aston Villa on Tuesday has been postponed due to positive COVID-19 cases and injuries in the Leeds squad, the league said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Fourteen Premier League games have been called off this month due to COVID-19, but the league said its intention was to continue the fixture schedule where safely possible.</p>
<p>"Following a request from Leeds United, the Premier League Board met today and regrettably agreed to postpone the club’s home fixture against Aston Villa, due to be played at 17:30 GMT on Tuesday 28 December," the league said in a statement.</p>
<p>Leeds's trip to Liverpool on Boxing Day was postponed for similar reasons, while positive cases in the Villa camp forced the league to postpone their home game against Burnley on Dec 18.</p>
<p>Leeds said that while there were no new cases in the playing squad, the majority of those who returned positive tests ahead of the Liverpool game were still in isolation.</p>
<p>Leeds are 16th in the league standings with 16 points from 18 games, six points adrift of 10th-placed Villa, who host Chelsea later on Sunday.</p>
