<h1>Most Americans favor keeping Roe v. Wade: polling</h1>
<h2>The landmark ruling is being challenged in a case concerning a Mississippi abortion law that the high court justices hear on Wednesday.</h2>

<p>Most Americans support keeping the landmark U.S. Supreme Court 1973 abortion decision <a>Roe v. Wade</a> in place, according to recent national surveys.</p>
<p>The landmark ruling is being challenged in a case concerning <a>a Mississippi abortion law</a> that the high court justices are hearing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other recent national polls showed similar findings. </p>
<p>According to an <a>ABC News/Washington Post </a>survey conducted early last month, 60% of Americans said Roe should be upheld, with 27% saying the ruling should be overturned.</p>
<a> Marquette Law School</a> national survey conducted in September wanted to see Roe overturned by the Supreme Court. The findings were in line with larger polls conducted by Gallup and Pew Research earlier this year.
<div> <div><p> Fox News national poll on support for overturning the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. (Fox News)</p></div></div>
<p>Going past the top lines, the Fox News poll indicated that for the first time, over half of Republicans (53%) joined majorities of Democrats (77%) and Independents (64%) in saying Roe should remain the law of the land. </p>
<p>Seven in 10 White Catholics (72%) and nearly half of White evangelical Christians (49%) also thought the decision should stand.</p>
<p>The Roe ruling established a constitutional right to abortion. It also prohibited states from banning the procedure before fetal viability, or around 23 weeks. The Mississippi law bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<a>Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research</a> poll conducted in June said that abortion should be illegal in most cases in the second trimester. That figure jumped to 80% for the third trimester.

<h1>Fox Business Poll: Higher crime rates across the US a large concern for voters</h1>
<h2>Eight in 10 registered voters are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about the crime surge</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>New poll shows 77% of voters concerned about crime </a></h4> <p>Fox News contributor Leo Terrell on a new FOX Business poll and White House praising the San Francisco mayor for crime crackdown.</p></div></div>
<p>As crime rates continue to soar across the <a>country</a>, a new Fox Business survey finds almost 8 in 10 registered voters (77 percent) are "extremely" or "very" concerned about the surge.</p>
<p>The only issue more pressing is inflation (84 percent "extremely" or "very" concerned).</p>
<p><a>GEORGIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ALLEGEDLY RAPED GIRL IN BOYS' BATHROOM</a></p>
<p><a>Voters</a> are also troubled, to a slightly lesser degree, about <a>taxes</a> (71 percent), the deficit (69 percent), <a>coronavirus</a> (68 percent), and being able to pay bills (63 percent).</p>
<a>Democrats</a> (81 percent) followed by inflation (75 percent) and higher crime rates (67 percent) while for Republicans inflation (91 percent), crime rates (84 percent) and taxes (83 percent) round out their top three.
<p><a><u>SAN FRANCISCO POLICE UNION: MAYOR'S CRIME CRACKDOWN IS ‘ACKNOWLEDGMENT’ THAT DEFUND POLICE WAS ‘MISTAKE’</u></a></p>
<p>Democrats are most likely to cite the availability of guns (26 percent), while for Republicans the top reason is the breakdown of moral values (27 percent).</p>
<p><a><u>NFL TORCHED BY SHERIFFS GROUP FOR FUNDING ‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ GROUPS</u></a></p>
<p>All of this helps explain the 6-point increase in disapproval for President <a>Biden’s</a> job rating on crime: 57 percent disapprove now vs. 51 percent in August. </p>
<p>Democrats (+11 points), seniors (+11), women (+10), and rural voters (+10) are just some of the groups more likely to disapprove of Biden’s performance on crime now compared to August.</p>
<p>Biden’s overall job rating stands at 47 percent approve vs. 51 percent disapprove. That is a slight improvement from last month (44-54 percent).</p>

<p>A sizable majority is concerned about the coronavirus pandemic, and the number saying the virus is "not at all" under control has inched up, according to a new Fox Business survey of registered <a>voters</a> nationwide. </p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent think the <a>pandemic</a> is under control (8 percent completely and 19 percent mostly), while 44 percent say it is just somewhat contained. Twenty-eight percent think it is not at all under control, up 6 points since October. </p>
<p><a><u>COVID-19 SHUTDOWNS RETURN ON SMALLER SCALE, BUT ARE BIGGER SHUTDOWNS COMING? </u></a></p>
<p>Still, there is considerably more optimism compared to last December when 50 percent felt the <a>virus</a> wasn’t at all under control.</p>
<p>Those most likely to believe the virus is contained include self-described "very" conservatives, voters under age 35, urban voters, and Hispanics. </p>

<p>Biden’s overall job approval ticked up 3 points this month: 47 percent approve vs. 51 percent disapprove. Last month it was 44-54 percent. </p>
<p>Two-thirds of voters are concerned about the pandemic, which is about the same number worried about the federal deficit and <a>taxes</a>, but fewer than feel concerned about inflation and U.S. <a>crime</a> rates.</p>
<a>inflation</a>, and almost as many blame
<a>government spending</a>/regulations and price gouging. Smaller majorities say Biden’s leadership and regular economic ups and downs are responsible.
<p><a>Democrats</a> are most likely to blame inflation on the pandemic, while for <a>Republicans</a> it’s government spending/regulations. </p>

<p>By a 5-point margin, more voters favor than oppose Biden’s plan to require vaccines or testing for workers at large businesses. His plan is currently held up by court challenges.</p>
<p>The most popular requirement, with two-thirds in favor, is the mask mandate for <a>travelers</a> on planes, trains, and buses. Biden recently extended this requirement through mid-March. </p>

<h1>Fox Business Poll: Voters think Biden is making inflation worse</h1>
<h2>Two-thirds say inflation has caused them financial hardship</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Democrats, Biden at crossroads on inflation</a></h4> <p>Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., sounds off on Biden administration policies exacerbating inflation on 'Your World.'</p></div></div>
<p>Voters are worried about inflation -- and they think the <a>White House</a> is making it worse. </p>
<p>A new Fox Business poll finds that when it comes to rising prices, twice as many think the <a>Biden</a> administration’s actions are hurting rather than helping.</p>
<p>In addition, by a 25-point margin, voters believe President Biden’s proposed social <a>spending</a> plan would push inflation higher and by 6 points they think it would hurt the economy. </p>
<a>Democratic</a> pollster Chris Anderson, who along with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw, conducts Fox polls. "If the spending plans start to have positive impacts in people’s lives, maybe some will reconsider their view of Biden."
<p><a><u>INFLATION IS REAL. SO WHY IS THE LIBERAL MEDIA STILL LYING ABOUT IT?</u></a></p>
<a>economy</a>. That’s more than double the number who say the deficit or income inequality. Fewer than 1 in 10 say supply chain issues, labor shortages, government regulations, or big tech monopolies.
<a>inflation</a> -- and about the same number blame regular economic cycles. Larger and roughly equivalent majorities blame the pandemic, government spending and regulations, and company price gouging.
<p>The new survey, released Wednesday, finds that rising prices over the last six months have caused financial hardship for two-thirds of voters. That climbs to three-quarters among those living in lower-income households.</p>
<p><a><u>MIKE ROWE: LOW LABOR PARTICIPATION PAIRED WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT A 'MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY'</u></a></p>
<a>Republicans</a> saying they’ve been hurt -- nearly five times the number of Democrats who say the same. For comparison, one-third of Democrats said they had been hurt by former President
<a>Donald Trump’s</a> economic policies in a December 2018 Fox News survey.
<p>Just 1 in 6 voters say they are better off financially than they were a year ago, and a majority rates their personal financial situation negatively. That’s a reversal since August, when over half said their finances were in positive shape.</p>
<p>Three quarters rate the national economy negatively -- and nearly half think things will get worse in the coming year. </p>
<p>Only 1 in 4 are optimistic the economy will get better in 2022.</p>
<p>That’s how the president’s ratings on the economy end up underwater by 21 points, down from +6 in April.</p>
<p>Approval of the president’s performance is below 40 percent on every issue tested, with one exception: just under half approve on coronavirus. Roughly 6 in 10 disapprove on the economy, crime, government spending, immigration, and taxes.</p>
<p>Biden’s overall job rating is upside-down by 4 points: 47 percent approve and 51 percent disapprove. That’s a bit of an improvement since last month, when it was 44-54 percent. His highest, 56-43 percent, came in June. </p>
<p>The numbers are worse when voters are asked how things are going in the country, as two-thirds are dissatisfied. That means dissatisfaction is up 12 points since Biden’s 100-day mark in April.</p>
<p><a>'BOOMING' BIDEN ECONOMY? 'THE FIVE' BLAST LIBERAL MEDIA, DEMS FOR FLATTERING INFLATION COVERAGE</a></p>
<a>Congress</a>. When asked their preference in the 2022 congressional election, if they were voting today, more would back the Republican candidate in their district over the Democrat by 4 points.
<p>-- Views among independents are somewhat grim: 1 in 10 independents say they are better off financially than they were a year ago and 1 in 5 expects the economy will be better next year. </p>

<p>With rising prices, escalating crime rates, and the approach of year three of a global <a>pandemic</a>, 7 in 10 voters think it was another bad year for the country — and over half feel it was bad for them personally.</p>
<p>The new Fox Business survey of registered voters finds 70 percent say 2021 was a clunker for the <a>country</a>. While that is better than the 78 percent who felt that way about 2020, it’s still much worse than the 38 percent who called 2019 bad. </p>

<h1>Cruz blasts ATF nominee Chipman over 'troubling allegations' of racism, appearance on Chinese state TV</h1>
<h2>GOP senators are demanding a second hearing for ATF nominee David Chipman</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)</a> nominee, citing his past alleged comments about Black ATF agents and a previously undisclosed appearance on a
<a>Chinese</a> propaganda media station.
<p>Cruz, R-<a>Texas</a>, is among the 11 GOP senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee who are demanding Biden’s embattled ATF nominee David Chipman face a second hearing, which Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has previously denied.</p>
<p><a>BIDEN ATF NOMINEE CHIPMAN FAILED TO DISCLOSE CHINESE STATE TV HIT USED AS PROPAGANDA BY THE COMMUNIST STATE</a></p>
<p>Cruz slammed the committee as having a "consistent pattern of focusing on partisan priorities of Democrats at the expense of fulfilling our responsibility to the American people." </p>
<p>He said Chipman’s nomination raises "very serious concerns" because of his work with pro-gun-control groups like Giffords and Everytown, and due to new, "disturbing" allegations of racism and of participating in communist propaganda.</p>
<p>Cruz cited <a>a July article by The Reload</a> that said multiple ATF sources confirmed the existence of a complaint alleging Chipman denigrated Black ATF agents who were up for promotion during his previous stint at the agency.</p>
<p>"These are troubling allegations and yet, the chairman of this committee has said it's not worth the committee's time to have a hearing and to let Mr. Chipman answer these allegations," Cruz said. </p>
<p>"Apparently, Senate Democrats do not care if he made racist comments in his role in office as a supervisor. They do not care if he created a racially discriminatory and hostile environment by making racist comments."</p>
<a>a story Wednesday by Fox News</a> that said Chipman failed to disclose to the Senate a 2012 media appearance on Chinese state TV, which may have been used as propaganda by the communist state to cover up a mass stabbing of children.
<p>Cruz’s comments come a day after the 11 Republican members of the committee, led by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, <a>sent a letter to Durbin</a> urging him to schedule a second hearing to immediately address the new allegations.</p>
<p>Durbin has reiterated his support Chipman, stating Monday that he is "well-qualified and has been extensively vetted for the role" and "deserves to be confirmed."</p>

<a>Cruz protested the nomination of David Chipman</a> to run the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) bureau, citing his past alleged racist comments about Black ATF agents and a previously undisclosed appearance on a
<a>Chinese</a> propaganda media station, as well as his support for banning AR-15s. The White House announced in September that it had withdrawn Chipman’s nomination due to bipartisan backlash over his stances on gun control.

<p>"Senate Democrats are not even hiding the fact that Ms. Pérez has been nominated precisely because she will be a partisan from the bench," <a>he said</a>.</p>

<a>"vocal and aggressive"</a> on the side of lawlessness and will "refuse" to prosecute crimes.
<p>Last month, as Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed tens of thousands of troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine, signaling an imminent invasion, Cruz turned up the heat on Biden’s appointees.</p>
<p>On Nov. 3, during the hearing of Biden’s nominee to the 9th Circuit Gabriel Sanchez, <a>Cruz claimed Sanchez</a> "played a leading role in legislation that would allow violent offenders to qualify for parole" and made communities "less safe."</p>
<a>Cruz characterized Saule Omarova</a>, Biden’s Treasury pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as "hellbent on destroying the oil and gas industries."
<a>Biden withdrew her nomination</a> this month at her request, saying his nominee had been "subjected to inappropriate personal attacks that were far beyond the pale."
<a>"broke" the U.S. immigration system</a>. The next day,
<a>Cruz blasted Federal Trade Commission nominee Alvaro Bedoya</a> during his Senate hearing as a "left-wing activist, a provocateur, a bomb-thrower and an extremist."
<p>On Dec. 2, <a>Cruz slammed Biden's nominee</a> to be the new federal district judge for Southern New York, Dale Ho, during his hearing as an "extreme partisan" and "radical."</p>
<p>On Dec. 7, Cruz objected to a motion to confirm Biden’s nominee for chief of protocol at the State Department, Rufus Gifford, after Senate Democrats refused to pass his Nord Stream 2 sanctions.</p>
<p>On Dec. 15, <a>Cruz characterized Biden’s nominee to the Second Circuit</a>, Alison Nathan, as a "partisan" and "ideological" extremist who is soft on crime.</p>
<p>After Cruz and Senate Democrats stuck their deal on Dec. 18, a total of 56 nominations sailed through the Senate on voice votes, including former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as ambassador to Japan. </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promised Cruz that a vote on the Nord Stream 2 sanctions would be held by Jan. 14 but will require 60 votes, which means Cruz has his work cut out for him in an evenly divided 50-50 Senate.</p>

<h1>Sen. Cruz scores a future vote on Russian pipeline sanctions in deal with Democrats</h1>
<h2>Debate on Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanction enforcement will occur in early January 2022</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>The months-long blockade on Senate-confirmed ambassadorships came to close Saturday morning after Texas Republican <a>Sen. Ted Cruz</a> reached a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p>Cruz has relied on the limited powers of the Senate minority to block President Biden’s nominations to fill top foreign positions in protest to the president’s sanction reversal on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. </p>

<p>Republicans have repeatedly contested the president’s July decision that allowed for the unimpeded construction of the major pipeline which will pump Russian gas to the European Union.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said the decision was made to preserve U.S.-German relations as the pipeline would funnel gas right into Germany. But Republicans argue the move opened up Ukraine to Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Fox News could not immediately reach the White House or Schumer for comment on the deal that could open the pipeline back up to U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p><a>SEN. ERNST SAYS SENATE CAN OVERRIDE BIDEN TO SANCTION RUSSIA’S NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE</a></p>
<p>A source familiar with the negotiations told Fox News the likelihood that sanction approval makes it through the Senate is "generally high."</p>

<p>But it remains unclear if Republicans would be able to garner enough support in the lower chamber to override a presidential veto if it made it to the president’s desk.</p>
<p>Despite previous hesitation to implement sanctions on the pipeline, recent steps taken by Germany and comments made by the Biden administration suggest the tide could be turning on Nord Stream 2 sanctions. </p>
<p>Germany last month slowed progress on the pipeline when a German regulator suspended the certification process of the pipeline, due to a legal paperwork issue.</p>
<p>Additionally, Minister of Germany’s Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, warned Russia of "severe consequences" and threatened to block the pipeline’s completion if the Kremlin attacked Ukraine, <a>reported DW</a> Saturday.</p>
<p>A similar tone was taken by U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan last week when he suggested the pipeline could be used as a <a>bargaining chip</a> to deter Russian aggression.</p>
<p>"The fact is that gas is not currently flowing through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline," he told reporters. "Which means that it is not operating. </p>
<p>"Indeed, it is leverage for the West because if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk and invade Ukraine," Sullivan added. </p>
<div> <div><p> Russian President Vladimir Putin holds a video conference to address participants in a congress of the United Russia party marking the 20th anniversary of the party founding, in Moscow, Russia. </p></div></div>
<p>Republicans have long argued the pipeline would bolster the Kremlin and pose a greater threat to European energy security. But the argument on sanctions appears to have shifted and is no longer a debate on if, but when. </p>
<p>While Republicans on the Hill have advocated for preemptive sanctions, Democrats are expected to back implementing sanctions only if Russia invades Ukraine – a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned against. </p>

<h1>Cruz, Republicans sign amicus brief backing Navy SEALs suing over Biden vaccine mandate</h1>
<h2>The brief comes amid warnings against the mandate by Republicans</h2>
<p>Sen. <a><u>Ted Cruz</u></a>, R-Texas, and several of his fellow Republican legislators signed an amicus brief backing the Navy SEALs suing <a><u>President Biden</u></a> and the administration over his military COVID-19 vaccine mandate.</p>
<p>Cruz led seven of his Senate colleagues on the brief, which was also joined by 38 House Republicans led by House Republican Conference chair Mike Johnson of Louisiana.</p>
<p>The lawmakers wrote in support of the 26 Navy SEALs and other Naval service members, arguing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment protected their religious freedom rights to object to the Navy vaccine mandate.</p>

<p>"They are only in conflict here because Defendants refuse to accommodate Plaintiffs’ religious objections even as they accommodate those who will not receive the vaccine for non-religious reasons," they continued.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Republicans argued that the Biden administration pushing the vaccine mandate "in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs does not come close to satisfying the strictest scrutiny Congress demands in RFRA."</p>

<h1>Ted Cruz warns Dem nastiness towards Manchin could backfire: 'We would welcome him' into the Republican Party</h1>
<h2>Cruz says he told Manchin, 'Look, one of the two parties actually likes you'</h2>
<p>Sen. <a>Ted Cruz</a>, R-Texas, hailed his Democratic colleague Joe Manchin, W. Va., following his shocking declaration he could not support Build Back Better. </p>
<p><a><u>REP. BYRON DONALDS CALLS MANCHIN KILLING BUILD BACK BETTER ‘GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY': THAT BILL WAS ‘TRASH’</u></a></p>
<p>Cruz slammed how "nasty" and "vicious" many <a>Democratic</a> lawmakers have been in response to his opposition to <a>President Biden's</a> signature legislation and how their demonization of him could backfire on the entire party.</p>
<a>Texas</a> lawmaker recalled an exchange on the Senate floor between Manchin and a group of
<a>Republicans</a> and the suggestion that they make the
<a>West Virginia</a> Democrat "the chairman of the committee on everything" and how Cruz told Manchin, "Look, one of the two parties actually likes you," causing Manchin to "roar" with laugher.
<p>"We like him! He's a very nice, affable guy. And if they're hateful enough, they might convince him there's no longer a home for him," Cruz said. </p>
<p><a><u>MANCHIN SAYS HE ‘CANNOT VOTE' FOR BUILD BACK BETTER: ‘I’VE DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE'</u></a></p>
<p>Cruz went on to knock the "arrogant" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki for "insulting" Manchin from the <a>White House</a> podium and the "mountains of nastiness" heaped by Sen. <a>Bernie Sanders</a>, I-Vt.</p>
<p>"I'm a big believer in you get more flies with honey than with vinegar. And they're certainly throwing a lot of vinegar at him right now," Cruz added. </p>
<div> <div><p> (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)</p></div></div>
<p>Manchin shook the political landscape during his exclusive interview on <a><u>"Fox News Sunday,"</u></a> announcing he "can't vote" for President Biden's signature legislation. </p>
<a><u>Manchin told "Fox News Sunday" guest host Bret Baier</u></a> Sunday. "And I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can’t. I’ve tried everything humanly possible. I can’t get there."
<p>"You’re done? This is a no?" Baier asked.</p>
<p>"This is a no on this piece of legislation," Manchin said. "I have tried everything I know to do."</p>
<p>The senator said that the rise in inflation, the national debt and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic helped him come to his decision on the <a><u>massive social spending bill.</u></a></p>

<p>According to Kirk, Republicans have "an amazing advantage" over those on the left. </p>
<p>"Their ideas are awful; they tend to be very angry, bitter people," he said. "They're always trying to destroy, and they've never built anything in their life, ever."</p>

<p>"The left is fundamentally trying to change the country," Jordan added. "I think it's turning around, I really do. … The American spirit is strong."</p>
<a><u>Ted Cruz</u></a>, R-Texas, said he is playing his part by "leading the fight stop every dumb-- thing
<a>Schumer</a> are doing" in an attempt to help get more conservatives elected.

<p>If at first you're not the nominee, try, try again?</p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz of <a>Texas</a> said again on Wednesday that he would be "absolutely" open to running for president in the future, recalling his unsuccessful 2016 run in which he placed second.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, in a heartbeat. I ran in 2016. It was the most fun I've ever had in my life," Cruz said in an interview for the Truth Gazette. "We had a very crowded field, 17 candidates in the race, a very strong field. And I ended up placing second."</p>

<p>Cruz expanded on his answer, explaining that his second-place finish in 2016 almost guaranteed him another shot at the Oval Office, citing the precedent of runner-ups in the <a>GOP</a> before him.</p>
<a>Cruz</a> said. "That's played out repeatedly. You come in with just an enormous base of support."

<p>The two-term senator, in a Fox News Digital interview, also highlighted that "when I ran in ’16, it was the most fun I’ve had in my life," and that he "absolutely" is considering another White House bid in 2024.</p>

<h1>Balanced budget amendment needed to get US fiscal house in order</h1>
<p>The United States is now running <a>trillion-dollar deficits</a> each and every year, and the U.S. national debt is closing in on $30 trillion. </p>
<p>That amount of debt equals almost <a>$230,000 per taxpayer</a>. In 1960, the debt to GDP ratio was around 54%. Now, it is 125%. </p>
<p>As much as I oppose the <a>Democrats current spending plan</a>, called Build Back Better, I also acknowledge that Republicans through the years have not done a great job in getting our nation’s fiscal house in order either. </p>
<p><a> MANCHIN IS RIGHT, THE INFLATION TAX IS REAL. IT'S TIME TO STOP BIDEN'S BUILD BACK BETTER</a></p>
<p>I have long been convinced that neither Democrats nor Republicans have the discipline to regularly balance the budget. Special-interest politics on the left and right make it tough to get our fiscal house in order. </p>
<p>What rational person thinks Congress will ever do the hard things required to balance our budget? We have only accomplished that objective a handful of times in the last 50 years. </p>
<p>With our national debt nearing $30 trillion, it is clear that there is a structural problem that must be addressed. That is why we need to again push for passing a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. </p>
<blockquote><p>A balanced budget constitutional amendment provides the best hope of regaining and maintaining fiscal sanity.</p> </blockquote>
<p>A BBA will force Congress to balance its budget every year. I know this will work in Washington just like it works in my home state of South Carolina. </p>
<p>Under our state law, the legislature and governor are constitutionally mandated to balance the budget yearly. They are forced to make the tough choices and unable to pass mountains of debt onto future generations. </p>
<p>In order for a BBA to become law on the federal level, we need a constitutional amendment to be passed by two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. </p>
<p>Congress came within one vote in the Senate from passing and sending a BBA to the states for ratification in 1995. In the 25 years that have passed, we have added almost $25 trillion to the national debt. </p>
<p>It is time to try once again. </p>
