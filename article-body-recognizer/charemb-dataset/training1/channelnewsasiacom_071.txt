<p>SINGAPORE: As COP26 approaches, Singapore has made several announcements regarding plans to decarbonise its energy sector. </p>
<p>Chief among them is its plan to import 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon or renewable sources by 2035. </p>
<p>Amid the global energy crunch and disruptions to the local electricity retail market, Singapore’s plans to diversify its energy sources are a welcome development.</p>
<p>However, purchasing electricity overseas exposes Singapore to the internal political dynamics of its partners. </p>
<p>Importing electricity is not simply a convenience for Singapore, but a necessary measure to meet its electricity needs and climate goals.</p>
<p>Around 95 per cent of Singapore’s electricity supply is dependent on imports of natural gas.</p>
<p>Plans to indigenously produce renewable energy through rooftop and floating solar installations are important steps but would at best fulfil 4 per cent of the island’s electricity needs by 2030.</p>
<h2>PLANS IN PLACE FOR IMPORTING ELECTRICITY</h2>
<p>To meet Singapore’s climate target of peaking greenhouse gas emissions around 2030 and halving them by 2050, it is necessary to seek green energy from abroad.</p>
<p>At present, Singapore will trial importing up to 100 megawatts (MW) each of low-carbon or clean electricity from three sources: Malaysia, solar power from Indonesia, and hydropower from Laos via Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>These plans help lay the basis for the long-awaited ASEAN Power Grid, which will help facilitate cross-border electricity trading, creating considerable efficiency gains across the region.</p>
<p>However, the country that most directly determines if Singapore can reach its electricity-importing goals is Australia.</p>
<h2>POLITICAL UNDERCURRENTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TRADE</h2>
<p>While these plans give cause for optimism, they are subject to local pushback in exporting countries. Two overlapping political forces might derail Singapore’s attempts to import renewable energy from its partners.</p>
<p>Subsequent policy changes, such as further restrictions on new coal plants or the removal of subsidies for downstream investments, would hurt the bottom line for the industry.</p>
<p>Second is the issue of energy nationalism. Indonesia in February 2020 announced it will end natural gas exports to Singapore to concentrate on domestic use after the existing contract expires in 2023.</p>
<p>Malaysia’s recent announcement that it will limit renewable energy exports to Singapore to meet its own climate goals follows this trend too and might complicate plans to expand electricity trade trials.</p>
<p>Granted, investments could incentivise countries to continue supporting projects. The Sun Cable project, for example, runs through Indonesian waters, but also includes US$2.5 billion (S$3.37 billion) of promised investments into the country.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the combination of these two issues means that the renewable energy export policy of these countries might be subject to political compromises and bargaining between different interest groups.</p>
<p>The coal industry is politically influential, employing around 40,000 Australians across several mining towns located in swing constituencies.</p>
<p>With an election next May, current Prime Minister Scott Morrison will have his hands full balancing the different interests of the Liberal and National parties in his coalition.</p>
<h2>ENERGY DIVERSIFICATION IS KEY</h2>
<p>The move to increase the share of renewables in Singapore’s energy mix might increase prices but would be offset by gains in energy security and sustainability.</p>
<p>Thus, the current approach of importing 30 per cent of Singapore’s energy needs is a much needed compromise. Policymakers will have to stay flexible and set more ambitious targets towards cleaner energy when opportunities arise. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation, each 100MW link with Indonesia and Malaysia would only provide 1.5 per cent of Singapore’s peak electricity demands. When combined, however, the network of energy sources would help to create a more resilient energy landscape.</p>
<p>While a fully realised ASEAN power grid remains a work-in-progress, it would not only benefit Singapore’s energy transition, but those of other ASEAN member states as well. This is a worthy goal to aspire towards.</p>

<div> <p> <a> Commentary </a> </p> <h1> Commentary: What’s Singapore’s scorecard at COP26? </h1> <div> <p>Singapore doesn't have a firm deadline for reaching net zero, but its path there is clear, says OCBC economist Howie Lee.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Howie Lee </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore only contributes about 0.1 per cent of global carbon emissions but has been actively participating in its Paris Agreement commitments.</p>
<p>It is also the only ASEAN country to-date that has a carbon tax, although neighbouring countries such as Indonesia may implement carbon price mechanisms in the near future.</p>
<p>MAS is also the only central bank, other than the Bank of England, to publish a separate sustainability report beginning 2021.</p>
<p>Granted, Singapore has yet to set a firm deadline on when it'll achieve net zero emissions. The current target is to halve 2030 peak emissions by 2050, and to reach net zero "as soon as viable" after that.</p>
<p>But the repertoire of energy plans announced recently, including forays into hydrogen and carbon-capture technology, will aid decarbonisation efforts.</p>
<p>At COP26, Singapore announced it will join the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out unabated coal (whose carbon emissions are not captured and stored) from its electricity mix by 2050.</p>
<h2>LAND SPACE, NOT POLITICAL WILL, THE BIGGEST CONSTRAINT</h2>
<p>More so than political will or funding issues, the biggest constraint to Singapore’s climate ambitions has to do with its limited land space.</p>
<p>The country’s carbon emissions can be nailed down to two main sources: Industrial activity (46 per cent), and power generation (39 per cent).</p>
<p>Both these sectors would require carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for carbon sequestration. Such facilities take up valuable land space.</p>
<p>The construction of renewable energy complexes, such as solar farms, would also prove challenging in land-scarce Singapore. </p>
<p>Beyond planting more trees and pushing for wider electrification, Singapore has to get creative in its decarbonisation pathways. For example, it has deployed solar panels on floating platforms.</p>
<p>Singapore is also looking to incorporate green hydrogen and carbon-capture storage technology into the energy mix in the medium term.</p>
<h2>SINGAPORE’S ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL CARBON MARKETS</h2>
<p>Of interest is Singapore’s active role as co-facilitator on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in COP26, which outlines creating an international carbon market to help countries meet emissions-reduction targets.</p>
<p>As co-facilitator, Singapore’s role is to listen and bring forward solutions from multiple countries on setting up this market. </p>
<p>Singapore has been chosen because of its reputation as an honest and fair broker on international arenas. This is a role that Singapore has never taken for granted.</p>
<p>Singapore is also aligned with global efforts to slash private sector emissions. For example, the LowCarbonSG initiative was launched a week before COP26 to enable local businesses to track their emissions.</p>
<p>This was announced shortly before the World Business Council for Sustainable Development proposed setting corporate determined contributions (CDCs) in the private sector.</p>
<h2>CLEAR RULES NEEDED FOR INTERNATIONAL CARBON MARKET</h2>
<p>International carbon markets have shown much progress since the Article 6 was laid out in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The emergence of carbon standards like Gold Standard, Verra and Climate Action Reserve, coupled with the growth in the voluntary carbon market, shows that there is already an implicit drive in the market to incorporate climate responsibility.</p>
<p>These mechanisms help lower barriers to international transfer of carbon credits, even when Article 6 rules have been loosely defined since the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>What is needed for a stronger integrity of the international carbon market is a clearer set of rules. </p>
<p>Different carbon standards still adopt varying levels of carbon credit recognition – together with the unique rules in each country’s cap-and-trade market, it makes for a large melting pot of interpretations.</p>
<p>An integrated global carbon market would need coherence, which comes from a defined framework. Singapore will have to build consensus among multiple nations on how best to serve this purpose.</p>
<p>The financial market is leveraging Singapore’s unbiased reputation and market infrastructure to resolve thorny issues such as carbon credit double-counting and additionality recognition by the end of COP26.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle in global climate ratification is having to reach a broad consensus among a hundred over nations with differing interests. </p>
<p>Hopefully, by the end of this century, history books will show COP26 as the turning point for the climate and Singapore as having contributed towards that goal in a unique but significant way.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Faced with a climate emergency, young Singaporeans are rightly thinking twice about having kids </h1>
<div> <p>Polls showing youths are thinking twice about having children should create positive momentum for change – for countries and individuals, says Ng Chia Wee.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ng Chia Wee </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: In his remarks at the opening day of the COP26 Summit, US President Joe Biden proclaimed that “this is a decisive decade” to flight climate change. </p>
<p>Whether the world seizes the opportunity to act, or condemns future generations to suffer, will be determined in the coming years. </p>
<p>And this last choice is unexpectedly intertwined with the climate emergency.</p>
<p>According to a recently published survey of 10,000 young people aged between 16 and 25, almost four in 10 respondents were hesitant to have children because of the climate crisis. </p>
<p>Looking at the results, I could not help but wonder how Singapore’s youth would have responded.</p>
<p>The results from the TODAY Youth Survey 2021, released on Nov 10, provided a clue. </p>
<p>According to the survey of 1,066 respondents aged 18 to 34, 22 per cent of respondents said climate change was a concern for them when thinking about having children.</p>
<p>When the climate crisis becomes similarly disruptive, and its effects more keenly felt here, it is very likely that parenthood concerns stemming from it will rise. </p>
<p>What is the responsible thing to do? </p>
<p>On the one hand, every couple must have the right to have children if they wish to. It is a privilege to give life, and for some, raising children brings incomparable joy.</p>
<p>Societal, cultural and religious influences are present too, and these should not be ignored. For ageing societies like Singapore, an even lower birth rate will also exacerbate economic pressures stemming from a shrinking workforce.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is perfectly reasonable to question if it is morally acceptable to bring a child into this world knowing that he or she will face increasingly severe climate disruptions in his or her lifetime. </p>
<p>As 29-year-old Sherilynn Loh had previously told CNA: “There’s the pandemic, there’s changes in air quality due to global warming, temperatures rising … And we don’t know what that’s going to look like 20 years from now.”</p>
<p>Her sentiment echoes that of Chloe Abigail, who voiced her concern in an episode of the online talkshow ZULA ChickChats.</p>
<p>“With the way the environment is going towards in terms of climate change … what kind of world are we leaving behind for our children?” she asked. </p>
<p>With the outlook uncertain, the best we can do for now is to make it a little less pessimistic. </p>
<p>Governments will play a heavy role in this; unsurprisingly, the study led by Bath University researchers also linked youth climate distress with perceived government inaction. </p>
<p>As COP26 was underway, environmental and climate youth organisations in Singapore issued an urgent call for national leaders to “boldly accelerate climate action” and for youths to “be recognised as equal partners”.</p>
<p>The Government should heed this call to give youths greater confidence their children will see a less devastating world. </p>
<p>At the same time, youth themselves must do more too. True, around 60 per cent of our national emissions are industrial, but that should not excuse individuals from also holding themselves to higher standards.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling paralysed by the climate-driven moral dilemma of having kids, those who have children could commit themselves to far greener standards in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Cut down on air travel and private transport, consume less red meat, give up the air-con in favour of fans and natural ventilation, stop indulging in unnecessary flash sale purchases, and pay for eco-friendly products even if they cost more.</p>
<p>We can take comfort in the knowledge that we are upholding our responsibility to set good examples for our children, and are contributing to a virtuous cycle of environmental consciousness when they start to model our behaviour. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Even car makers think buying an electric vehicle is starting to look like a good idea </h1>
<div> <p>Tesla’s recent US$1 trillion market capitalisation is a sign of broader shifting sands in the electric vehicle market, says NTU’s Clive Choo.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Clive Choo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: 2021 may well be the year the electric car turned a corner.</p>
<p>The share price of iconic electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla soared 13 per cent in one day in October, after Hertz reportedly ordered 100,000 Model 3 cars in a deal that catapulted Tesla’s market capitalisation to more than US$1 trillion. </p>
<p>There are broader promising signs of this accelerating growth given a year-on-year global growth in the first half of 2021 of 168 per cent, according to the Electric Vehicle World Sales Database.</p>
<p>The global electric car market has been growing exponentially, with an estimated 16 million to be in operation by end-2021. </p>
<p>China, Europe and the US are leading this revolution with a combined market share of 94 per cent for the first half of 2021. </p>
<p>These trends are reflected in Singapore which registered 487 Tesla cars sold between July and September, a surge compared to the 30 sold in the first six months of 2021, despite costing more than three times as much as in the US. </p>
<p>But at a modest market share of 1.4 per cent of total new cars registered in Singapore this year, this EV growth has also gotten started.</p>
<h2>BREAKTHROUGHS WITH GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND COMMERCIAL DEALS</h2>
<p>EV technology has hit a threshold that should allay concerns from drivers of internal combustion engines (ICE) cars. </p>
<p>Today’s battery technology allows a driving range of 1,000 km and a charging speed of five minutes to reach 80 per cent of full capacity at the top end of the EV market. </p>
<p>Two to three years will be needed before such battery technology becomes mass produced. Most EVs require at least 30 minutes charging time currently. </p>
<p>Those with range anxieties and concerns over the accessibility of battery charging points should be assuaged with the average range of over 400 km per full charge. </p>
<p>The outlook for the global EV industry will only get brighter. Government assistance to roll out a comprehensive charging infrastructure underway around the world will accelerate the pace of the development of EV market. </p>
<p>An infrastructure stimulus package unveiled by China in 2020 earmarked US$1.4 billion, with plans for more fast-charging points in suburban locations.</p>
<p>A slew of EU legislation like the Energy Performance of Buildings Directives requires real-estate owners to install at least one EV charging station in their properties.</p>
<p>WATCH: Electric cars vs petrol car - costs, performance, emissions and range.</p>
<p>The rise of the EV is also heralding a new age of competition in the auto industry. </p>
<p>By 2026, Volkswagen plans to integrate all EV manufacturing into one platform, achieving cost savings in production, improved efficiencies in battery tech and better electronics systems.</p>
<p>In its New Auto 2030 presentation in July, the company has said it sees EVs reaching price parity with ICE cars by 2025 and forecasted that half of their vehicle sales will come from EV by the end of this decade. </p>
<p>Similarly, Nissan targets for half of all sales to come from EVs and hybrid vehicles by 2030.</p>
<p>Bloomberg and McKinsey have suggested a similar timeline for when electric cars make a sensible economic choice over ICE vehicles.</p>
<h2>THE GREEN PUSH FOR EVS</h2>
<p>Coming on the end of the biggest global climate conference COP26 in Glasgow, the push for EVs is also in sync with larger, undisputable forces pushing for decarbonisation for the long term. </p>
<p>Singapore is one of the 30 or more countries to support the Paris Agreement, with EVs playing a big part in Singapore’s Green Plan. </p>
<p>Land transport makes up over a tenth of Singapore’s total emissions today and phasing out ICE vehicles by 2040 is a key goal. Having a robust charging infrastructure are critical to realising these ambitions.</p>
<p>This is matched by the country’s 75,000 charging stations - one-third of the total EU’s charging stations – with 190,000 households have their own charging ports. </p>
<h2>COSTS OF EV OWNERSHIP IS UNCERTAINTY</h2>
<p>Climate action aside, car owners should already be seriously considering buying a EV when their Certificate of Entitlement (COE) runs out.</p>
<p>Even today, the ownership economics of EV and ICE cars will reach parity over time. Though the retailing price of an EV is greater than an ICE car, they pay off with lower running costs of ICE cars. </p>
<p>With the Vehicular Emissions Scheme, coupled with the Electric Vehicle Early Adoption Incentive, buyers can enjoy maximum combined cost savings of up to S$45,000 today if they purchase a new, fully electric car. </p>
<p>But if it wants to increase the EV population, a combination of incentives such as the lowering of road tax, import duty for EV and tweaks to the COE system will be needed to nudge car drivers. </p>
<p>Singapore also needs to consider how the restructuring of the matured ICE industry can be accelerated.</p>
<p>If plans to ramp up charging points remain on track and assuming carmakers can get manufacturing costs down further, the promise of more EVs and a cleaner environment can be expected. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Your first EV is likely to be a Nissan, not a Tesla </h1>
<div> <p>Nissan's US$17 billion investment will transform the electric vehicle industry and usurp Tesla's dominance, as the demand for EVs continue to increase, says a supply chain expert.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tom Stacey </a> </div> </div>
<p>CAMBRIDGE: Nissan recently announced a new £13 billion (US$17 billion) investment to help transition its business to being focused around electric vehicles (EVs).</p>
<p>The investment is centred around its Sunderland plant in the north east of England, which already makes the popular Nissan Leaf, and a plan to build 23 new electric models by 2030.</p>
<p>China’s SAIC is in second place thanks to its Wuling Hingguang Mini, which is the best selling EV in China. After that come Volkswagen, BYD and Hyundai.</p>
<p>So why are many of the traditional players that have built their businesses on internal combustion engines so far behind Musk, and can Nissan buck the trend?</p>
<h2>WHY SOME HAVE STRUGGLED</h2>
<p>Tesla created the first serial production EV with lithium-ion batteries in 2008 with the launch of the Roadster sports car.</p>
<p>It has gone on to evolve a suite of vehicles whose range, performance and efficiency are arguably the best in the business – as reflected by the company’s impressive growth and profitability.</p>
<p>Nissan has certainly served its time, having debuted the Leaf in 2011, which is one of the best selling EVs of all time, having sold half a million units over a decade.</p>
<p>But if there has been a lesson in this sector, it’s that being successful at making vehicles with internal combustion engines does not guarantee success at making EVs.</p>
<p>An example is General Motors (GM). GM was there all the way back in the late 1990s with its ground-breaking EV1. These little cars, loved by their owners, showed how an all-electric future could look.</p>
<p>GM tried again to crack EVs with its Volt in 2010, which was also popular until being killed in 2018 (the demise was blamed on an ageing production facility).</p>
<p>It also launched the Bolt in 2017, which was designed to be a relatively cheap, long range EV. But while it achieves this, it has been plagued with battery issues.</p>
<p>The knowledge that Bolt packs can catch fire has become so pervasive that car parks in the US have reportedly been banning them from entering.</p>
<p>GM says it now has a solution, and has recalled tens of thousands of Bolts to have their battery packs replaced. But as a result, production of new Bolts is currently suspended until late January.</p>
<p>GM also promises some 20 new EV models by 2023, but recently came in for criticism after displaying no EVs at the 2021 LA Auto Show (whose theme was electrification). </p>
<p>Given that President Biden recently credited GM with leading the industry in EV manufacture, this surely raises eyebrows.</p>
<p>Toyota was also a key player in moving the industry to greener vehicles with its hybrid cars of the late 1990s, but is now also playing catch up.</p>
<p>It has only just, in December 2021, released its first volume production EV, the bZ, after going much further than others with developing hydrogen-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>Toyota’s hydrogen-powered Mirai failed to gain market share in the way that EVs with batteries have, selling just 316 in Europe in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>Toyota is reportedly also teaming up with China’s BYD to launch a US$30,000 EV in 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Volkswagen is the legacy automaker seen as most likely to catch up with Tesla’s EV production rate – potentially by 2024. The German giant is spending some €35 billion (US$39.5 billion) on the sector.</p>
<p>But Volkswagen acknowledges that it takes them three times as long as Tesla to make its flagship EVs, making the gap in capabilities painfully apparent. It aims to narrow the gap to double in 2022.</p>
<p>If we have learnt anything from Tesla and also Chinese EV entrants such as NIO, BYD and XPeng, it’s that bespoke electric chassis make better electric cars.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Nissan and its alliance partner Renault, they already have such a bespoke EV platform.</p>
<p>Known as CMF-EV, it allows the group to share a number of components across different EVs and maximise the efficiency of manufacturing them.</p>
<p>From observing Tesla, the second vital factor to producing EVs at scale (and profitably) is to make your battery packs as close to the final assembly factory as possible, reducing transport cost and time.</p>
<p>Again, Nissan ticks this box. Its Sunderland plant, which not only produces the Leaf but will also produce its successor, is situated very close to the Envision battery “gigafactory” that supplies it.</p>
<p>Chinese-owned Envision plans to produce 38GWh of batteries a year – enough to power 500,000 new cars, which would put Nissan on par with Tesla’s factories in the US and China.</p>
<p>So with its years of EV knowledge, efficient battery supply chains and bespoke EV platform, Nissan could very well be the legacy automaker that ends up being able to compete with the new kids on the block.</p>
<p>But if it fails to capitalise on its advantages to reinvent itself as an EV-first company, we have seen from numerous other companies that being an early runner is certainly not enough on its own.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why have energy retailers folded so quickly in Singapore? </h1>
<div> <p>Four energy companies have announced exits and two others are reviewing their business models – did liberalisation of the Singapore energy market lead to cracks previously unseen? Two energy experts explain.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> David Broadstock </a> <a> Kim Jeong Won </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: In recent weeks, something unusual happened in Singapore’s energy market which raises important questions. iSwitch, Ohm Energy, Best Electricity and SilverCloud Energy exited the retail side of the electricity market.</p>
<p>Another two companies – Diamond Electric and Union Power – have stopped accepting new customers while they review and restructure their business models. These companies have attributed their actions to soaring wholesale electricity prices. </p>
<p>What’s behind this flurry of moves among local electricity retailers? First, we need to understand how the market works.</p>
<p>Between Oct 1 to 14, the average USEP was closer to S$400/MWh. This represents only the cost of electricity and doesn’t consider operational costs.</p>
<p>However, regulated tariffs – the price of electricity the state power provider must offer to customers – imply retailers will be effectively capped at a selling price nearer S$250/MWh at least for the near future.</p>
<p>The regulated tariff establishes a boundary for electricity prices that retailers will face and plays a role to help ensure that customers don’t pay too high a price.</p>
<p>On Oct 19, the Energy Market Authority (EMA), responding to the sudden and extreme market fluctuations, introduced several safeguard measures for consumers and pre-emptive energy security measures for generators.</p>
<h2>DID OEM FAIL TO DELIVER ON ITS OBJECTIVES?</h2>
<p>We would argue that the OEM, by itself, has not failed as such, but has demonstrated a painful level of sensitivity to external forces, in this case, the international market for natural gas which is presenting abnormally high prices.</p>
<p>The recent lack of resilience warrants attention, and action is needed to ensure the OEM does not lose its ability to facilitate a commercially viable and competitive marketplace.</p>
<p>Market liberalisation permits and promotes competition. Within a competitive market, firms who can provide a good or service at a lower cost will attract customers away from more expensive suppliers. </p>
<p>A liberalised market is good for consumers who benefit from lower prices due to unavoidable price competition among retailers. However companies that lose price competitiveness or cannot bear low prices are inevitably excluded. </p>
<p>This ability for firms to exit is part of the suite of natural economic mechanics that make a liberalised market attractive in the first place. </p>
<p>For some companies like Ohm Energy, their pricing plans, lower than the regulated tariff approved by the EMA, had become unsustainable under the volatile electricity market. </p>
<h2>HIGH DEMAND AND SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS DRIVING PRICES UP</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, what happens in the global energy market has a direct impact on ours. In these last few weeks, the market is not operating “within normal parameters”.</p>
<p>The price volatility in the domestic wholesale and futures markets prevents any viable business operations, and it’s anyone’s guess for how long.</p>
<p>The first price paid in electricity production is determined by the global market for natural gas, of which Singapore is a price-taker – which means it must accept whatever prevailing price is offered in the market. </p>
<p>Singapore has long-term contracts for pipeline gas – these are negotiated well beforehand so an increase in the gas price may not significantly impact market participants in the near term if all other conditions are stable. </p>
<p>However, Singapore’s heavy reliance - around 95 per cent - on natural gas for power generation makes this issue more challenging. </p>
<p>While higher domestic demand for electricity required more generation and more natural gas as fuels, the gas supply from Indonesia was smaller than usual due to the rising electricity demand in Indonesia and an incident at West Natuna gas field.</p>
<p>One may question if businesses had failed to take into proper account the potential for market fluctuations and shored up some reserves in advance. But the current levels of volatility, and extent and duration of price hikes are unprecedented.</p>
<h2>TIGHTER REGULATION ON RETAILERS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS</h2>
<p>Liberalisation of the retail electricity market aims to improve the quality of service and increase benefits to consumers by encouraging competition among the retailers in the private sector.</p>
<p>However, market consolidation in Singapore’s OEM will create short-term market disruptions and the market regulator may need to take further efforts to protect retailers and electricity consumers.</p>
<p>In the UK, supplier failures and poor customer service occurred as the number of retailers increased in the market.</p>
<p>To address these problems, UK regulator Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) introduced new requirements for supplier licensing in 2020. </p>
<p>One of the new requirements is that suppliers should report to Ofgem when they meet 50,000 and 200,000 customers and get milestone assessments.</p>
<p>Ofgem also can request retailers undertake independent audit when there are concerns about the retailer’s financial health or customer service capabilities. </p>
<p>In Singapore, EMA has prudential and technical requirements for new electricity retailer licensing but does not have specific evaluation guidance about existing licensees.</p>
<p>Although there may be discomfort towards further government intervention in the market, occasional assessments like Ofgem’s would strengthen market resilience by ensuring retailers preparedness for the changing business environment.</p>
<h2>ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF SINGAPORE’S ELECTRICITY MARKET</h2>
<p>Beyond regulating retailers, we can enhance the resilience of the electricity market through the diversification of fuel sources. Natural gas has an extremely high share in Singapore’s generation mix, and this is unusual.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Who would have thought small businesses can be pretty dysfunctional? </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Adrian Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Eight years ago, I commissioned Night Owl Cinematics (NOC) to do some promotional videos for my small recruitment business.</p>
<p>One was titled "10 Types of Singaporean Bosses".</p>
<p>From the ruthlessly demanding manager to the mercurial, emotional wreck, it was an over-the-top attempt to capture the stereotypes of bosses and maybe try to laugh at our situations.</p>
<p>Those were simpler times. NOC just started their channel as a passion project out of an apartment in West Coast. </p>
<p>They did not have a sizeable past portfolio. But their sincerity shone through so I engaged them.</p>
<p>Reading what they are going through now pains me. Re-watching that old video this week felt pretty ironic when it mirrored some of the allegations around workplace harassment and corporate misdeeds thrown at Sylvia Chan and Ryan Tan.</p>
<h2>FAMILY BUSINESSES CAN BE DYSFUNCTIONAL</h2>
<p>We all hope misunderstanding around the episode can be cleared up and misconduct left to the appropriate authorities to handle. </p>
<p>As someone who started his first business with his wife involved from day one, I empathise with the commonalities in our experiences and feel a profound sense of sadness seeing the media circus around their affairs. </p>
<p>Building a business isn’t easy. Discovering you want to do that with the love of your life can be a life-changing moment but it can mean a long tail of implications.</p>
<p>Think about it. Blurred personal and professional lines between husband and wife are sufficiently challenging to navigate but imagine walking that tightrope as a staff member. </p>
<p>Awkward doesn’t begin to describe it. When power dynamics were unclear, even in managing the simplest issues, our employees had to be extra mindful around my wife so they don’t land me, their founder, in hot soup.</p>
<p>Life bled into work in other ways. When things went south over an argument at home, it naturally showed in our tiny bootstrapped business.</p>
<p>There was a period our marriage was on the rocks - one of the lowest times in my life. I deeply regret letting that affect our employees.</p>
<p>My wife would avoid the office like the plague. I was physically at the workplace but my mind was troubled and distracted. People whispered. Morale was poor and it impacted our bottom lines.</p>
<p>If a bitter divorce was added to that mix, like in NOC’s case, I’m not sure the business would have survived.</p>
<h2>BUT SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BE ATTRACTIVE TO EMPLOYEES</h2>
<p>Many are wondering why small enterprises so often seem to fail at upholding ethical, legal and fiduciary responsibilities.</p>
<p>Besides, she said, a small company offered room for growth since it could not afford to have specialists, meaning plenty of opportunities for everyone to step up, roll up their sleeves and take on new challenges. No two days felt the same.</p>
<p>Proximity to business owners also meant welfare perks like spot days off or extra cash incentives could be rolled out easily.</p>
<p>This is something over 200 Silicon Valley start-up founders in the early 2000s intuitively understood - that cultivating strong family like- feelings can foster productivity and company loyalty, as studies have shown.</p>
<h2>AS FAMILY COMPANIES GROW, MANAGING THEM GETS COMPLICATED</h2>
<p>Small businesses sound ideal on paper, but the reality lies in what transpires after workers join and how they’re treated as the business grows and new pressures emerge.</p>
<p>NOC today has more than 30 people on payroll. It is a far cry from the day when Ryan and Sylvia had to do everything and enlist the help of close friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Operations are probably more complex and varied, and leadership of the firm, along with ensuring profitability and managing day-to-day operations, is a whole different ball game. </p>
<h2>BEING MORE HUMAN AS THE BUSINESS SCALES</h2>
<p>Corporate governance experts say a clear management structure with a whistleblowing policy and an independent board to exercise oversight can identify business transgressions and workplace abuse. But my experience has taught me otherwise. </p>
<p>When was the last time you heard of a board getting rid of a bad middle manager or identifying a harassment case at a small or medium-sized enterprise?</p>
<p>We want standards of human decency at work that transcend the threat of punishment and micro-managing organisational structures. That’s why such stories of bad behaviour in the workplace, if true, are abhorrent to us.</p>
<p>And we know problems can be tackled rapidly between people at the root rather than from 30,000 feet.</p>
<p>If such reporting is framed as a chance for fairness and improvement, workers in tight-knit firms might be able to overcome hesitation that speaking up will land someone in trouble.</p>
<p>These are steps in the interests of the organisation. An anxious team may deal with tensions by avoiding work or focusing on low-value tasks. </p>
<h2>A REAL SHAME IF JOB SEEKERS AVOID SMALL BUSINESSES</h2>
<p>It would be a shame if the only lesson derived from these episodes is to avoid small or couple-run businesses at all costs. </p>
<p>And the names of the Murdoch family, the Porshe-Piech grandsons and the Ambani brothers have made global business history.</p>
<p>Ultimately, every employee deserves a safe workplace - one that is transparent, consistent and communicative. All business owners have the responsibility to see to that.</p>
<p>Small businesses who operate like they’re family should bear in mind they could slide into becoming a dysfunctional one, and strive to avoid that as much as they can.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Does rise in food delivery roles suggest something's wrong with full-time employment? </h1>
<div> <p>Platform firms may be adding new workers to the Singapore economy - workers who would otherwise not have entered the workforce in the first place, says NUS Business School's Professor Sumit Agarwal.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sumit Agarwal </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Over the past few years, the food delivery and ride-hailing portions of the gig economy have exploded. </p>
<p>In a short period, Deliveroo, foodpanda and Uber got big enough to get listed on stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Lockdowns, a fear of taking public transport or heading to crowded supermarkets, as well as rules disallowing big groups from eating out together, mean a greater demand for doorstep delivery and private-hire services. </p>
<p>In 2020, Singapore’s proportion of own-account workers — self-employed workers who are not employers — among working residents was at a decade-high of 9.7 per cent. </p>
<h2>CHOICE OF THE GIG WORKERS</h2>
<p>Some may feel that the rise of such roles threatens the stability of the traditional economy. But it’s a misconception the gig economy robs the old world of workers. </p>
<p>The traditional economy workers have invested enormous resources like time and money in obtaining these skills and they would want to be compensated for them. </p>
<p>Although COVID-19 may have upended assumptions about work and life, driving and deliveries, dependent on effort, orders and changing conditions, seem hardly suited to workers in full-time roles who want more stability and structure in their jobs.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Commentary: Hawkers and food delivery riders deserve more appreciation </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Such workers also generally do not need much formal education and extensive work experience to perform their roles. </p>
<p>Among Singapore’s own-account workers whose gig work is their main job, 54 per cent had non-tertiary education, 19 per cent had diploma or professional qualification and 27 per cent had a degree. </p>
<p>Second, the gig economy, even in its entirety, is relatively tiny compared to the traditional economy, despite its fast growth. It can only absorb a tiny fraction of the workers even if they wanted to switch. </p>
<p>We know gig work offers people, who have familial responsibilities and can only work a few hours a day or certain blocks of time, a rare chance to earn income on-demand without being shackled to a full-time role with worktimes they cannot control.</p>
<p>More research studies on the effects of platform companies on employment and incomes will outline to what extent platform gigs can be a safety net and preserve work ethic.</p>
<p>The proportion of own-account workers who did it not because of their preference, at 16 per cent, also pales in comparison to the 84 per cent who chose to do it because of the flexibility and freedom. </p>
<p>The same MOM survey showed that while 52 per cent of own-account workers faced challenges at work in 2020, primarily because of the pandemic, only 12 per cent of this group sought employee work as a solution.</p>
<p>As the economy readies for the pick-up, delivery work and other gigs may provide a bridge between permanent jobs, as a Grab survey of driver partners show. More than 70 per cent said they planned to stop driving after two years.</p>
<p>“We hope most of them don’t stay. And when the economy recovers, they go on to do other things,” Grab Managing Director Yee Wee Tang said in an interview with TODAY last month.</p>
<p>About 70 per cent of Grab’s partners only had a highest education level of secondary school or lower, he said.</p>

<h2>BETTER PROTECTIONS FOR GIG WORKERS AS THEIR NUMBERS GROW</h2>
<p>Having achieved early success, deliveries and ride-hailing platform firms now have to address a nagging criticism — that little protection is offered for the gig workers who contributed to their success. </p>
<p>At the nascent stage of the gig economy, at least, these platforms benefited as they do not price in additional costs that full-time employment of such workers might require, like CPF contributions or healthcare benefits. </p>
<p>Yet, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about the need to protect lower-wage delivery workers during his National Day Rally speech this year. </p>
<p>My advice is for the committee to examine how these workers can be better protected, while being careful not to endanger the roles and incomes they make. Due consideration for the huge consumer benefits should also be given. </p>
<p>Many have benefitted from the convenience, time savings and the chance to avoid going out to get groceries in the middle of a raging pandemic. </p>
<p>People’s consumption habits have changed for good. They have tasted the convenience offered by gig platforms. They will want more. </p>
<p>I see a two-pronged approach. First, in health benefits, such platform firms should do more for their gig workers. After all, they would benefit if their workers were healthy and fulfil more transactions. </p>
<p>On the larger question of the social compact around gig work, a flurry of legislative developments light the path for how Singapore can move forward. </p>
<p>Many countries and cities have started to look more into protecting the gig workers with a range of protections offered, balancing the need to make gig work less harrowing against making it too rigid. </p>
<p>There are small ways in which conditions can be improved. New York City recently passed a series of bills to improve the pay and working conditions of the food delivery workers. </p>
<p>One bill specifically requires platforms to make arrangements with restaurants to have washrooms available to delivery workers.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are countries mandating platform companies treat such workers like full-time employees with paid leave and fixed hours. </p>
<p>Portugal is moving to pass laws to get ride-hailing drivers and delivery workers recognised as staff with formal contracts and benefits. But the question is also whether such moves force workers needing flexibility to drop gig work entirely. </p>
<h2>FIGURING OUT FUTURE OF GIG WORK</h2>
<p>Singapore’s new advisory committee is a sign of government will shape the future of work and how such gig work fits into this mould as platform firms grow. </p>
<p>Workers want autonomy over how they make money. As nations reopen borders and economies pick up, the gig economy will still have a place in a world of work that is evolving past the cookie-cutter 9-to-5 job.</p>
<p>This part of the gig industry will keep growing. Besides the common food and parcel delivery, some platforms are providing doorstep services such as haircuts and the repairing of electrical appliances. </p>
<p>The challenge is how to let it flourish, while protecting workers. </p>
<p>As to whether the traditional world of work can be improved, the answer is yes but that’s another commentary for another day.</p>

<h1> Commentary: As more managers resign, will we see a ‘Great Promotion Wave’? </h1>
<div> <p>There’s so much flux in organisations as supervisors also quit in larger numbers since the pandemic hit. Could this mean it is time to look at those who have been passed over for promotions? Mayank Parekh gives his take.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Mayank Parekh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Resignations are picking up pace since the pandemic begun. </p>
<p>Competition for talent is increasing and shows little sign of easing. Closed borders and market dynamics for many occupations especially in the infocomm and technology sector have shifted towards the jobseeker. </p>
<p>Indeed, a worldwide employment website found that job postings in Singapore in August were up by 55.7 per cent from pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.</p>
<p>As the economic recovery continues, skill shortages will be exacerbated across a much wider range of occupations. </p>
<h2>A CHANCE FOR WORKERS TO ASSUME MORE SENIOR ROLES</h2>
<p>In the short term, the mismatch between demand and supply in the labour market will likely mean higher staff turnover for businesses and more opportunities for workers to switch jobs.</p>
<p>Although a low resignation rate in a company relative to the industry average was an indicator of good employee engagement in pre-coronavirus times, they may be less the case today. </p>
<p>On the other hand, high resignation rates can both reflect and signal low staff morale. They are also costly to the firm because they need to devote resources to settle in new employees.</p>
<p>Staff turnover can be an opportunity – it can bring in new ideas and fresh perspectives. The pandemic has unleashed a huge demand for digital skills as all businesses had to shift online. </p>
<p>But the big tradeoff is losing staff who have valuable institutional memory and the downtime needed for training and settling people in. </p>
<p>What firms can do is look inward – in recognising and promoting internal existing talent, giving them the chance to step into a managerial role if a position opens up.</p>
<p>Retaining a “solid” ensemble is just as essential to business success as keeping individual “star” performers happy. </p>
<p>The broad middle of workers are the pillars of strength in your organisation. They plug away quietly but no less competently – except they don’t demand fanfare and recognition. They keep the engine of the company running. </p>
<p>In my experience, the “average worker” can end up feeling undervalued or unappreciated for their contributions. </p>
<h4> <div>Listen to HR experts explain what’s behind worker unhappiness despite greater attention on workplace well-being and what managers should do on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast: </div> </h4>
<h2>DOES THIS MEAN WE EMBRACE MEDIOCRITY?</h2>
<p>But how do you know if someone is ready to step up to the plate of a managerial position? </p>
<p>This means companies must expand the definition of performance beyond the usual metrics of meeting hard measure KPIs such as sales targets. </p>
<p>The question is, how to you quantify these intangibles? </p>
<p>Global companies like Google, Unilever, Microsoft use ONA tools to see how teams and networks within an organisation collaborate and behave, and how work gets done daily.</p>
<p>In an ordinary organisational chart, you may not be able to tell that a mid-level staff was critical in ensuring sales reports were sent out on time or that customer complaints were dealt without supervision but resolved quickly and amicably. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it could highlight how a senior person was peripheral to day-to-day operations or that one part of the company was isolated from another when it came to information flow.</p>
<p>Although currently used predominantly at global companies, the relatively inexpensive tools, digitisation of company-wide processes and growing demand for people analytics skills in HR, suggests that ONA is likely to be a near-term reality.</p>
<h2>EMPOWERING MID-LEVEL WORKERS</h2>
<p>A caveat is that not everyone will want a managerial role even if they are cut out for it. </p>
<p>From the ashes of this Great Resignation Wave, some may stand out and eventually become higher performers, but bosses should also keep in mind others just as competent who don’t want more responsibility at work and choose to remain under the radar.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why financial markets are reacting to Omicron variant with panic </h1>
<div> <p>A new wave of infections may push economic recovery further back, but uncertainty about when the pandemic might end hinders our ability to make decisions for the future, says a finance expert.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Arturo Bris </a> </div> </div>
<p>LAUSANNE: Until the Omicron variant hit the headlines, the signs were that 2021 was going to close with a stellar stock market performance.</p>
<p>Most markets have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, with the SP500 up about 25 per cent and the FTSE All Share index up by about 10 per cent.</p>
<p>There had certainly been some concern that share valuations were irrationally high. This concern was justified – especially if we take into account that most markets closed 2020 on a positive note, too.</p>
<p>Having experienced the worst pandemic in 100 years, and also a significant global recession, it seems nonsense that stock markets should have gone so high – yet there seemed no signs of anything that would stop them.</p>
<p>But then came the news of the Omicron variant and the fear that surrounds it, which led to a massive sell-off on Friday (Nov 26), and a partial rebound at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So what should we make of this? Are financial markets acknowledging that we have been in a bubble, with share prices misaligned with the real economy, or is this just a temporary panic before a continuation upwards?</p>
<h2>WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OMICRON SO FAR</h2>
<p>These are the facts: New coronavirus variant B.1.1.529 spread significantly in South Africa and Botswana and was identified as more contagious and less controllable than previously known variants.</p>
<p>Daily cases in South Africa are now nearing 3,000, which is still not much more than one-tenth of the peak reached in July. Only 24.4 per cent of the population is vaccinated.</p>
<p>Cases of the Omicron variant have now been detected in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Egypt, Belgium and Ireland.</p>
<p>With the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that the new variant was likely to spread further and “poses a very high global risk”, many countries have closed their borders to air traffic from southern Africa.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Stocks, oil slide as Omicron worries push investors to safe havens </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Simultaneously, the United States, UK, European Union, India and several other nations have implemented new restrictions on mobility and travel.</p>
<p>Despite the panic, Dr Angelique Coetzee – the doctor who first spotted the new variant and also chairs the South African Medical Association – has told the BBC that symptoms linked to Omicron have been extremely mild.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are analysing whether their vaccines provide safe enough protection against Omicron, though we are yet to see conclusive results in any direction.</p>
<p>So it could well be that, despite the faster spread of the infection, its ultimate health, social and economic impact proves negligible. We simply do not know at this point.</p>
<p>But detecting more uncertainty than before, financial markets have reacted with panic.</p>
<p>For example, the SP500 tumbled 2.3 per cent on Friday only to rise 1.1 per cent on Monday (Nov 29). Most markets gave up between 2 per cent and 4 per cent, which is a pretty substantial one-day fall.</p>
<h2>GREAT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT END OF PANDEMIC</h2>
<p>For example, companies are deferring important investments until the dust clears, like expanding current businesses or making acquisitions.</p>
<p>Similarly, staff increases may be put off to avoid the risk of downsizing if the pandemic worsens again.</p>
<p>It does not bode well if we compare monthly stock returns of the SP500 in 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>I remember how, back on New Year’s Eve 2020, I toasted 2021 – thinking that it could not be any worse than what we were leaving behind.</p>
<p>But it is becoming clear that uncertainty today is even greater than a year ago, when we did even not have the vaccines that we have today.</p>
<p>Until we know when we will get rid of this virus and how our economies will regain strength, it will be too early to talk about recovery.</p>
<p>So while investors and pension holders may see markets rising further into irrational territory in the weeks and months ahead, they will also be vulnerable to unpredictable lurches back down.</p>

<h1> Commentary: China's economy is faltering. The world just doesn't know it yet </h1>
<div> <p>As China's run of constant exponential economic growth hints at coming to an end, Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma explains why its effect on the global economy will be underwhelming.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ruchir Sharma </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK CITY: China’s surprisingly rapid slowdown is eliciting familiar warnings that, as China goes, so goes the global economy. Only China may not matter as much as it once did.</p>
<p>Not so long ago most economies were growing in close step with China. But in recent years those links weakened, then collapsed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Most dramatically, the correlation between gross domestic product growth in China and other emerging markets fell since 2015 from nearly perfect (over 0.9) to barely visible (under 0.2).</p>
<p>In the second quarter this year, China grew significantly slower than other emerging markets for the first time in three decades, which may be a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Beijing is locking down to contain the pandemic and cracking down on economically critical sectors and high corporate debt with an aggression unmatched by any other government.</p>
<p>This goes a long way to explain why China is slowing so fast now, when the rest of the world is not. But the link between growth in China and other economies started to loosen about five years ago, so this moment may reflect deeper forces in play.</p>
<h2>NEW COMMERCIAL COLD WAR</h2>
<p>In 2015 Beijing launched Made in China 2025, a campaign to become more self-sufficient by buying more supplies and developing more technology at home.</p>
<p>The US responded under Donald Trump by working to “decouple” from China. Since then President Joe Biden and many of Trump’s critics in Europe have taken a similar stand — and ramped up those efforts during the pandemic.</p>
<p>That has meant buying more supplies from China’s commercial rivals such as Mexico, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<p>China accounted for about 35 per cent of global GDP growth in the years before the pandemic, but that share plummeted in 2020 and is now about 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other global growth drivers are gaining momentum, each lifting a different set of countries in significant ways.</p>
<h2>DIGITAL REVOLUTION MASKS SLOWDOWN</h2>
<p>The digital revolution is raising demand for semiconductors and other high-tech products, boosting exports out of advanced emerging markets such as Taiwan and South Korea. Rising data flows are defying the slowdown in global trade and in China.</p>
<p>Efforts to contain global warming are causing “greenflation” in commodity prices by limiting new supply of raw materials and raising forecasts of demand for “green metals” such as aluminium and copper.</p>
<p>Rising prices are a big boost for exporters of green metals, which come mainly from emerging markets such as Peru and Chile.</p>
<h2>THE UNDERWAY GLOBAL DECOUPLING WILL ENDURE</h2>
<p>The global decoupling from China may endure. The digital revolution, the fight against climate change and the new cold war are likely to outlast the effects of the pandemic and could herald a new era of growth in the emerging world.</p>
<p>During the last golden age for emerging markets, after the turn of the millennium, many prospered mainly by supplying parts or raw materials to China — then the rising “factory to the world”. Now, they have more options.</p>
<p>To say China matters less is not to say it doesn’t matter. China is still the leading trade partner for more nations than any other and the main global buyer of commodities.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Gojek, Southeast Asia’s next potential superapp, makes a bold play in Singapore </h1>
<div> <p>The ride-hailing firm must carefully weigh its strategic options for staying, innovating and thriving in the highly competitive Singapore market, says NUS Professor Kenneth Huang.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kenneth G Huang </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Anticipation was high when superapp Grab listed on the NASDAQ last week. </p>
<p>After trail-blazing a path for other Southeast Asia tech platforms, all eyes are now on its arch nemesis, the region’s second largest tech behemoth, GoTo Group, formed by Indonesia’s Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia.</p>
<p>GoTo raised US$1.3 billion in November ahead of an initial public offering planned for in early 2022.</p>
<p>Gojek then decided to invest further in Singapore, announcing plans to introduce more services here, after hiving off Thailand operations to AirAsia. </p>
<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT AS GOJEK EXPANDS IN SINGAPORE</h2>
<p>Should Gojek remain in Singapore? Perhaps it wants to maintain a continued presence in the gateway to the world and where many MNCs have set up their headquarters.</p>
<p>The question becomes, how can the company ensure its sustainable competitive advantage and survival in the long term? What can it do differently for its app users?</p>
<p>This is an important question for Gojek as it figures out how to compete with dominant players like Grab and ComfortDelGro in this highly competitive, saturated market. </p>
<p>Given the intense competition, simply replicating the same set of services — taxi services and food delivery — is not enough. Gone are the days of price wars, heavily laced with incentives and discounts.</p>
<p>Instead, Gojek must take things to the next level to differentiate itself from its competitors, through technological innovation and cost leadership, and leverage the advantages offered by economies of scale and scope. </p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar merger between Gojek and Tokopedia to form the GoTo Group presents new and exciting opportunities as well as competitive advantages for Gojek. </p>
<p>Come January it’ll be three years since Gojek landed on Singapore shores. The city-state can serve as a useful testbed. </p>
<p>Currently the biggest privately held technology company in Southeast Asia, Gojek and Tokopedia in the GoTo Group currently plan to remain separate but provide better integration on payments, logistics and food deliveries. </p>
<h2>GOJEK COULD OFFER MOTORCYCLE SERVICES AND FASTER DELIVERIES</h2>
<p>And will Gojek’s Buy Now Pay Later schemes be made available to users?</p>
<h2>THE NEXT SUPERAPP IN SOUTHEAST ASIA</h2>
<p>The overall goal is to create a vibrant ecosystem with complementors adding to its product and service offerings and innovations and hence, add more value to the platform it created and controls. </p>
<p>In addition to the one-stop “app” for consumers, these savings could be passed on to consumers and pose significant competition to current players not only in the logistics space like Grab but also in the e-commerce space like Shopee and Lazada. </p>
<p>Singapore being home to many tech companies surely offers opportunities for collaboration that Gojek may only be starting to discover.</p>
<h2>WHY GOJEK MUST GO GREEN</h2>
<p>A word of caution for Gojek before this commentary ends: The firm should also rebrand itself as an industry leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts.</p>
<p>This vision would resonate well with the values of their consumers, especially a rapidly growing group of young customers who view a company’s ESG efforts as an increasingly important criteria in choosing their service and product offerings. </p>
<p>Gojek’s staying in Singapore, and more broadly in Southeast Asia, to pursue these strategic options will benefit consumers, platform workers, complementors, sellers and buyers using this platform. </p>
<p>For consumers, it provides an alternative to incumbent players such as Grab and ComfortDelGro, which helps keep pricing and quality of services competitive. </p>
<p>Platform workers and complementors of Gojek enjoy more opportunities and different types of work engagements as well as a boost to their bargaining power and work options.</p>
<p>For the sellers and buyers, an alternative platform implies greater variety and selection of products and services being offered. </p>
<p>It also means that they do not have to conform to one dominant set of rules in the market, which facilitates a more vibrant and healthier marketplace in the long term. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Some firms died, others thrived - COVID-19 forced radical changes on businesses </h1>
<div> <p>In 2022, which are the most future-ready companies? IMD Business School’s Howard Yu says it’s do or die and gives an insight into how the best firms will thrive.</p> </div>

<p>SWITZERLAND: COVID-19 is forcing corporations into radical transformation. </p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, it felt impossible to make predictions. Travel plans were roiled because of rising infection rates and new variants. Critical parts for manufacturing were suddenly in short supply. </p>
<p>It may seem like a fool’s errand to predict what’s going to happen across industries. But there are ways to prepare for the unexpected. </p>
<p>The winners of tomorrow will be the organisations that master new capabilities ahead of time. And as we head into 2022, the readiest will capitalise on new growth opportunities.</p>
<p>At IMD Business School’s Center for Future Readiness, we rank publicly listed companies based on their preparedness for the future and compare the top-ranking companies against the industry average. We call this the Future Readiness Indicator. </p>
<h2>WHICH COMPANIES AND SECTORS ARE STANDING OUT IN THIS PANDEMIC?</h2>
<p>The indicator offers a set of important lessons that company executives can apply in their attempts to chart a course through increasingly choppy waters. It can also help us see who’s standing out to win. </p>
<p>Automakers miscalculated demand, and with problems in the supply chain, carmakers are now halting their production lines.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Tesla drives over US$1 trillion as investors bet the EV future is now </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But not all of them are. Toyota stockpiled chips, so it avoided the worst of the disruption. It did this though a system called “Rescue” that stores supply chain information for around 6,800 parts. </p>
<p>Toyota communicates with thousands of suppliers, so it can see where the shortages and challenges are, and stockpile accordingly. This is the company reclaimed the title of the world’s largest automaker from Volkswagen. </p>
<p>“We were able to substitute alternative chips, and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks,” Musk said. “It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip; you also have to rewrite the software.”</p>
<p>Tesla won not because it was able to forecast, but because it had invested in new capabilities in electronics and software. When the semiconductor crisis hit, Tesla’s readiness became a source of resilience that fueled its future growth.</p>
<p>Many executives must now consider radical changes to their operating and business models. The pandemic is speeding up seismic shifts that might have taken decades to play out but are now happening in a matter of months. </p>
<p>Many companies are finding that consumer behavior has radically changed, with a move to digital platforms, or that their products and services have lost relevance. </p>
<p>In the financial industry, incumbents like Mastercard and Visa topped the Future Readiness ranking. They realised early on that they couldn’t outrun fintech challengers. </p>
<p>Tech giants are also creeping into their core market. So instead of fighting against them, Mastercard and Visa joined forces with them, becoming “frenemies”. </p>
<p>The payment companies thus became irresistible to fintech upstarts such as Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, which launched its cryptocurrency Visa debit card in the US. </p>
<p>So while one day the plastic credit card may disappear, Mastercard and Visa will continue to move money around the world. This is the sort of business that’s future-proofed. </p>
<h2>TAKING BUSINESS TO THE NEXT BOUND</h2>
<p>An even bigger part of being future-ready is the ability to draw on different business disciplines and practices from other sectors to create new knowledge about how a product is made, or a service is delivered. </p>
<p>But the most successful leaders broaden their horizons and move into markets in which they see opportunities for growth. They “leap” from their historic areas of expertise to new knowledge.</p>
<p>Carmakers are already moving away from their mechanical engineering heritage to increase their software capabilities as they phase out the internal combustion engine and build electric motors and electronic components. </p>
<p>But it takes much more than that to leap. Our research shows that the most future-ready companies align themselves with a single viewpoint about the future.</p>
<p>This allows them to make a targeted allocation of resources and scale up projects early, instead of making a millimeter of progress in a million directions. Only then will they see a financial return from their investments in innovation. </p>
<p>These upstarts all have an outsized emphasis on their digital roots. And they build an enormous online following. </p>
<p>To make this happen, and to do it profitably at scale, Nike has digitalised its entire supply chain. It has automated all tracking and coordination with external partners.</p>
<p>It also leverages advanced data analytics to gather insights around the clock, so it can make markdown and promotion decisions instantly and move inventory across a country when needed.</p>
<p>Doing so then helps locate and ship specific products to the individual stores that need them most.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nike’s own retail stores increasingly resemble an immersive theatre. It’s designed to look like a museum exhibit where every shoe is treated as an art object. But it’s in fact a luxury boutique where every piece is for you to buy. </p>
<p>Only there, or on Nike’s own suite of apps, customers could have access to limited release products. Doing all these is difficult. But that’s a prime example of a future-ready brand in sportwear. </p>
<p>Whether it’s Amazon or Google or Microsoft, they have all turned support functions into self-service providers. That is, businesses don’t ask for permission from gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Approval is made automatically. Checklists are made transparent. Tools are made available. Employees are empowered and bureaucracy reduced. </p>
<p>The annals of history are filled with examples of companies that failed to innovate. Often, they did not see the danger posed by upstart challengers or were unwilling to accept that their supremacy was under threat. </p>
<p>For many companies, this is the moment to leap. If there’s one positive to come out of the pandemic, it’s that the crisis has helped to cast aside institutional inertia. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Global food price hikes are getting out of hand </h1>
<div> <p>Food prices now are more costly than most of recent history, according to a British sustainability researcher, and the pandemic is just one reason why.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Alastair Smith </a> </div> </div>
<p>COVENTRY, England: Global food prices shot up nearly 33 per cent in September compared with the same period the year before.</p>
<p>That’s according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)‘s monthly Food Price Index, which also found that global prices have risen by more than 3 per cent since July, reaching levels not seen since 2011.</p>
<p>The Food Price Index is designed to capture the combined outcome of changes in a range of food commodities, including vegetable oils, cereals, meat and sugar, and compare them month to month.</p>
<p>It converts actual prices to an index, relative to average price levels between 2002 and 2004. This is the standard source for tracking food prices – nominal prices, as they’re known, which means they’re not adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>While nominal prices tell us the monetary cost of buying food in the market, prices adjusted for inflation (what economists call “real” prices) are much more relevant to food security – how easily people can access appropriate nutrition.</p>
<p>The prices of all goods and services tend to rise faster than average incomes (though not always).</p>
<h4> <div>It's in cookies, toothpaste and hand sanitiser. But it's also been blamed for deforestation. A palm oil producer talks to us on The Climate Conversations about how they’re trying to make it more sustainable:</div> </h4>
<p>Back in August, I analysed the FAO’s inflation-adjusted Food Price Index and found that real global food prices were actually higher than in 2011, when food riots contributed to the overthrow of governments in Libya and Egypt.</p>
<p>Based on real prices, it is currently harder to buy food on the international market than in almost every other year since UN record keeping began in 1961.</p>
<p>The only exceptions are 1974 and 1975. Those food price peaks occurred following the oil price spike of 1973, which drove rapid inflation in many parts of the global economy, including the production and distribution of food.</p>
<p>So what’s now pushing food prices to historic levels?</p>
<h2>FUEL PRICES AND COVID-19</h2>
<p>The drivers of average international food prices are always complicated. The prices of different commodities rise and fall based on universal factors, as well as those specific to each commodity and region.</p>
<p>For example, the oil price rise which started in April 2020 has affected the prices of all food commodities on the FAO index, by increasing the costs of producing and transporting food.</p>
<p>Labour shortages resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the availability of workers to grow, harvest, process and distribute food, another universal cause of commodity price rises.</p>
<p>The real average price of food has actually been increasing since the year 2000, reversing the previous trend of a steady decline from the start of the 1960s.</p>
