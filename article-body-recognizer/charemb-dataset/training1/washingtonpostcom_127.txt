<a>Neurocognitive Theory of Dreaming</a>.” From this point of view, dreaming happens under six brain-related conditions that most often occur during REM sleep, said Domhoff, who has a forthcoming book on the theory.
<div><div><p>Here are answers to some common questions about dreams.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Do dreams mean anything?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why do I have recurring dreams?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although you may notice that you’ve had the same dream before, Domhoff said, recurring dreams are typically “a very, very small percentage of our dream lives.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What can I do about nightmares?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Having coronavirus nightmares? Here’s what you can do about those bad dreams.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Over time, nightmares become a habit,” he said. “It’s something that your brain has learned to do. With this imagery, we trying to get it to learn a new habit and displace that unwanted habit.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Another strategy is to fall asleep focusing on what you want to dream about, Barrett said. “That has the further side benefit of making falling asleep a slightly pleasanter experience” and can distract you from your worries.</p></div>
<div><p>Why your weird dreams might help your brain function better in the real world</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>I’m trying to run or scream in my dream, but I can’t. Why?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>During REM sleep, the body’s voluntary skeletal muscles are paralyzed. “This is good and important, because otherwise we would be acting out all the motions we’re doing in our dreams,” Barrett said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to choose the best sleeping position, and why it matters</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Sometimes I can’t move after waking from a dream, or I see things. What’s happening?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It can be very reassuring to understand that it’s just temporary and it’s just a little bit of carry-over from the dreaming stage and it’ll pass,” Eiser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why do only some people remember their dreams?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>People who sleep for shorter amounts of time tend to remember fewer dreams, Barrett said, because they may spend less time in REM sleep and also because they are less likely to wake from a dream, because they are potentially sleep deprived.</p>

<div><p>At-home covid tests and omicron: What you need to know</p></div>
<b> </b>to add a throat swab has been gaining attention on social media recently, at the same time that concerns have been rising about the efficacy of at-home tests. The FDA
<a>announced in late December</a> that while rapid antigen tests do detect the omicron variant, some “may have reduced sensitivity,” citing an early finding from
<a>ongoing performance evaluations</a>. A
<a>anecdotal stories</a> of having coronavirus symptoms and testing negative when using a rapid test kit as instructed (only swabbing their noses). But when they swabbed their throats as well as their noses, they said, the
<div><div><p>Some prominent experts have also started recommending the additional throat swab.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>symptoms appear to be starting earlier in people infected with omicron, “there is a chance the virus isn’t yet growing in the nose when you first test,”
<a>tweeted</a> epidemiologist and testing expert
<a>Michael Mina</a>, a vocal advocate of rapid testing who recently left his academic and research positions at Harvard and is now chief science officer for the biotech software company eMed.
<div><div><p>“Virus may start further down,” Mina continued. “Throat swab + nasal may improve chances a swab picks up virus.”</p></div></div>
<a>Eric Feigl-Ding</a>, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed. “#Omicron is very different from all other variants,” he
<a>tweeted</a>. “We need to adapt to changing testing strategies.”
<div><div><p>Those research papers were released as preprint articles, meaning formal peer review of the work has not been completed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Feigl-Ding also said other countries, such as <a>Canada</a> and the <a>United Kingdom</a>, have authorized testing options that use throat swabs along with nasal swabs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the FDA, which issues emergency use authorizations for coronavirus tests, has strongly discouraged deviating from the specific instructions that accompany test kits.</p></div></div>
<p>“The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,” the federal agency said in an emailed statement to The Post on Wednesday.</p>
<a>recommends</a> that throat swabs should be collected by a trained health-care provider.)
<div><div><p>Other epidemiologists and testing experts echoed the FDA’s warning and said testing guidance should not change until there is more data.</p></div></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of work under the hood that has to be done for these companies to pivot to a new sampling method,” said <a>Albert Ko</a>, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<a> Yuka Manabe</a>, who runs the Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University, emphasized that it is “not the way the tests were designed to be used.”
<div><div><p>At this point in the pandemic, Manabe’s recommendation for testing is simple: “You should use at-home tests as the instructions for use tell you to use them,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an interesting topic, but requires careful investigation and any test differing from manufacturer claims need to be rigorously validated before implementation,” LeBlanc said.</p></div></div>
<a>Matthew J. Binnicker</a>, the director of clinical virology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “I don’t know what that false positive rate becomes with a throat swab included in the mix,” he said.
<a>noted</a> that while the strategy does “likely improve sensitivity,” it “may potentially cause a slightly greater number of false positives.” He recommended not eating or drinking 30 minutes before swabbing.

<div><div><p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Two of the 17 foreign missionaries who were kidnapped by a notorious street gang in Haiti last month have been released, a U.S. aid group said Sunday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Oct. 16 kidnappings of the missionaries and family members by the gang 400 Mawozo thrust the poverty-stricken Caribbean nation again into the center of an international crisis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The group included 16 Americans and a Canadian — six men, six women and five children. The adults ranged in age from 18 to 48, Christian Aid Ministries said. The children ranged from 8 months to 15.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The missionaries were seized while returning from a visit to an orphanage that receives support from Christian Aid Ministries, the organization said. The gang, 400 Mawozo, has <a>demanded $1 million</a> for the return of each victim.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Gédéon Jean, director of a Port-au-Prince think tank that tracks kidnapping, described the release as “a good step that indicates that the rest of the hostages could soon be free.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In general, 400 Mawozo hold the victims of group kidnappings for no longer than 15 days,” Jean said. “This is the first time that they kidnapped a group and they have kept them for more than a month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an indication that the negotiations are not easy,” Jean said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. and Canadian officials have said they are working closely with Haitian counterparts to secure the hostages’ freedom. The United States says it does not pay ransoms for kidnapped citizens.</p></div></div>
<p>State Department and FBI officials were on the ground in Haiti last month. The U.S. government has seen proof that at least some of the hostages were alive, <a>Reuters reported this month</a>, citing an unnamed senior Biden administration official.</p>
<p>“We welcome reports that two individuals held hostage in Haiti have been released,” a State Department spokesperson said, declining further comment. The Canadian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions.</p>
<div><div><p>Christian Aid Ministries did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The organization has repeatedly requested prayers for the hostages and for their abductors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“While we rejoice at this release, our hearts are with the fifteen people who are still being held,” it said Sunday. “Continue to lift up the remaining hostages before the Lord.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Haitians rich and poor, gang violence and kidnapping for ransom have become commonplace. The country is suffering <a>a surge in abductions</a> that analysts say is the worst in the country’s history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mass kidnappings have made 400 Mawozo notorious in Haiti, where groups such as Christian clergy were previously considered off-limits.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a video last month, alleged leader Wilson Joseph <a>threatened to kill the hostages</a> if his demands were not met. Joseph is wanted by police on charges including murder and kidnapping.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Danish health authorities on Sunday reported a “concerning” jump in cases of the omicron coronavirus variant that they said points to community spread in Denmark and probably elsewhere in Europe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The number of confirmed cases in the country rose from 18 on Friday to 183 on Sunday, reflecting both the speed at which the variant has spread<b> </b>and the sensitivity<b> </b>of Denmark’s virus surveillance system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before the Danish data was released Sunday, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported just 182 cases of omicron across all of the European Union, plus Norway and Iceland.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“It’s not like Denmark is a special home for omicron.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ECDC said Sunday that omicron had been reported in 17 countries in the E.U. and the European Economic Area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The center noted that “the majority of confirmed cases have a history of travel to countries in Africa.” But some of the new cases reported in Denmark had no apparent connection to southern Africa.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Danish media <a>reported</a> that some of the infections were traced back to a concert in late November and a Christmas lunch involving 150 guests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Britain also reported a sizable uptick in omicron cases: 86 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total number there to 246.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Return to Iran nuclear deal remains an elusive prospect </h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Claire Parker</div></div>Staff writer </span></div></span></div><div>December 6, 2021 at 12:01 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Nearly a year into President Biden’s term, a return to the Iran nuclear deal remains elusive — and a new cast of characters on Iran’s side of the table is driving a hard bargain. </b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Talks resumed in Vienna last week after a five-month hiatus following the election of hard-line <a>President Ebrahim Raisi</a> in June — only to <a>adjourn Friday with little to show</a>. Negotiators expect to begin anew this week.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Biden pledged on the campaign trail to revive the 2015 nuclear accord. But relief from the blitz of sanctions the Trump administration imposed hasn’t come as quickly as Iranians had hoped.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As negotiations resumed, White House press secretary Jen Psaki called a return to the deal “our best available option.” So far, however, the talks have been heavy on distrust.</p></div></div>
<a>once called the nuclear agreement “a sick child,”</a> said everything negotiated during the six rounds of talks between April and June was open for discussion.
<div><div><p>The ball was “in America’s court,” he <a>told Middle East Eye</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>warned</a> that unless Tehran changes course quickly, negotiations were headed for collapse.
<b>Meanwhile, Iran continues to make nuclear advances. </b>The country insists its nuclear program is peaceful, but it
<b> </b>uranium up to 60 percent purity — inching toward the weapons-grade level of 90 percent. Raisi’s government has refused to give International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors access to key sites.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration estimates that the Iranian program’s “breakout” time for producing enough fissile material for one bomb has shrunk to less than a month, <a>my colleague Karen DeYoung reported</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The IAEA reported last week that Iran had started the process of enriching uranium to up to 20 percent purity using more advanced centrifuges at its underground Fordow facility. The 2015 deal banned enrichment at the site.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Israel, for its part, is trying to scuttle the talks. </b>The country, which considers Iran its archenemy, is <a>lobbying the United States</a> to abandon discussions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a call with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett <a>accused Iran</a> of carrying out “nuclear blackmail” as a negotiation tactic.</p></div></div>
<a>called on major powers</a> to reinforce sanctions and present “a credible military threat” to deter Iranian nuclear advances. The hawkish rhetoric comes amid an
<a>escalating cyber war </a>between Israel and Iran.
<div><div><p>China could also pose a major challenge, as Tehran orients its foreign policy toward east Asia.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>But it has also bolstered its ties with Iran in recent years, becoming a
<a>leading importer of its oil</a> and entering into a
<a>major economic cooperation deal</a>. That relationship could continue to build even in the absence of a deal.
<div><p>For China, a nuclear-armed Iran may not present quite as ominous a prospect as it does for Israel or Western powers. And mounting tensions with the United States could disincentivize cooperation on sanctions in the absence of a deal.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If these talks break down, it will be very tough to get some of the other parties to agree to reimpose or continue with the sanctions — especially Beijing,” DiMaggio said.</p></div></div>
<b>If talks in Vienna lead nowhere, U.S. officials have </b>
<a><b>suggested they would consider other options</b></a>.
<a>Plan Bs</a> could include an increase in sanctions — including
<a>targeting oil sales to China</a> — a smaller-scale interim deal, covert operations to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program or military action.
<div><div><p>Bagheri has dismissed suggestions that Iran would consider an interim deal or a more far-reaching agreement to supplant the 2015 accord.</p></div></div>
<a>Three out of five Iranians believe the United States has already sanctioned Iran to the fullest degree possible</a>, according to a public-opinion poll conducted by the University of Maryland in August and September.
<div><div><p>U.S. concessions to Iran could embolden the Raisi government to demand more, while costing Biden politically. But DiMaggio said she sees a rollback of some nonnuclear sanctions as the best chance for reaching a deal.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the American public has little appetite for military engagement. And a conflict with Iran would distract from the Biden administration’s priority of competition with China.</p></div>

<p>The pandemic fueled new movements around vaccinations, lockdown measures and covid-19′s adverse economic effects. It mobilized the ranks of far-right movements and deepened what some experts describe as a growing libertarian streak.</p>
<a>recent trend</a>. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
<a>recorded</a> 72 anti-government protest movements this year through November — down slightly from the same period in 2020, but significantly higher than the pre-pandemic count in 2019.

<a>new generation of Tunisians defied coronavirus restrictions</a> in January to voice their anger at political leaders and the government’s failure to
<a> improve the economy</a>. Protests continued over the summer — and on July 25, President Kais Saied fired the prime minister, suspended parliament and
<a>seized broad powers</a>. Demonstrations for and against Saied’s measures continued throughout the fall. In December, Saied announced that elections and a constitutional referendum would be held next year.

<p>Ola Kamara was among D.C. United’s standouts last season, sharing the <a>MLS</a> scoring title and helping the club <a>contend for a playoff berth</a>. But he also turned 32 and entered the offseason with one year left on his contract.</p>
<div><div><p>So as players around the league prepare to report to training camps next week, United has told inquiring teams that it’s open to trading the Norwegian striker, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A United spokesman said the organization did not want to comment on personnel issues. Kamara said he did not have a comment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For both U.S. national soccer teams, it’s a massive year</p></div>
<a>MLS Players Association data</a>, Kamara earned $420,000 last season, above the league average but a modest figure for a proven scorer. However, United used
<a>targeted allocation money </a>to soften the budget impact, and Kamara actually made around $1.5 million.
