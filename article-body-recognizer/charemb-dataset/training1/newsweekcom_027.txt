<p>While we know how the against-all-odds story ends, with never-before-seen footage from inside the cave and authentic reenactments with the real cave rescue divers, we finally see how the impossible happened.</p>
<p>Newsweek: The Rescue is your first big undertaking since winning an Oscar for Free Solo. Why this film and why now?</p>
<p>You only had rights to the divers' stories, correct? So is that why you focused on the rescuer's perspectives?</p>
<p>So at the 11th hour, you get 87 more hours of footage to go through, right? Why was this so key to the story and the final film?</p>
<p>You're suddenly there in the cave with them and also see the sheer scale of the operation. You finally see why there were thousands of people required to support the 10 divers. You finally understand just how much work it was, how perilous it was.</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: It's one thing to talk about how people come together and affect a rescue. It's a different thing when you actually see it happening, and you understand the scale, the chaos, the desperation.</p>
<p>How did you film the reenactments for the rescue missions and how did you make it look so realistic?</p>
<p>It was so important for us to see it and be in the water with them. What you're seeing is as accurate as we could possibly make it.</p>
<p>It was incredible to watch, like when one of the divers got lost underwater when he couldn't find the safety line. This film began its development at the start of the pandemic. How did that impact filming it?</p>
<p>But watching The Rescue, you see the power of this unique talent to help people. Was this call to honor your peculiar passion what you were striving for?</p>
<p>How did you try to portray the Thai perspective while still focusing on the dive rescue team, who were foreigners?</p>
<p>Chin: We wanted to present the belief systems of the people of northern Thailand and this area—the story of the princess, their belief in monk Kruba Boonchum—to get audiences to hopefully think about how people have different beliefs.</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: And who is to say the prayers didn't actually save the children?</p>
<p>Chin: It's a minor detail but it represents a lot. We all have different belief systems and who's to say which one is the right one and the wrong one?</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: Talk about the crazy constraints around this film. After the successful rescue of the children, [the monk] Kruba Boonchumtook a three-year oath of silence and went into a cave for three years.</p>
<p>Chin: So we couldn't interview him.</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: I said, "I'll send a whiteboard in and he can just answer these questions," and they said no, no. But he [the monk] blessed a bunch of bracelets and sent them to us.</p>
<p>You're a married team, how does that affect working together? How did you meet?</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: We met at a conference, then we became friends. And then we fell in love while making Meru.</p>
<p>Chin: We had some time to fall in love.</p>
<p>Vasarhelyi: Yes, Meru took a lot of time. We had our first child during Meru then we had our second child during Free Solo.</p>
<p>THE RESCUE is exclusively in theatres starting October 8th.</p>

<p>A viral video has captured the awkward moment a bride was called by the groom's ex-girlfriend's name on her wedding day.</p>
<p>In the video shared by wedding videographer @jpvideography2141, the wedding photographer was midway through taking the shots when she accidentally called Missouri bride Katelyn Love, Taylor instead.</p>
<p>Just like that time Ross called Emily "Rachel" during his vows in Season 4 of Friends, the slip-up by the wedding photographer provided both a cringeworthy moment and comedic relief at the same time.</p>
<p>To the tune of TikTok's popular "Oh No" audio, which documents the moment something goes wrong, the photographer asked: "1,2,3, Corey and Taylor, look at each other."</p>
<p>The bride awkwardly glanced over to her groom, scrunching her nose up while smiling before the whole wedding party burst into laughter. "That's his ex," she informed the photographer.</p>
<p>Moments later, the photographer made the same mistake again. "Corey and Taylor, look at each other," she said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wedding party saw the humorous side again and let out a laugh. The bride once more corrected her in good humor. "The couple, just say the couple," she said.</p>
<p>As confirmed by Pattyson, the photographer had worked with a bride named Taylor just the week before, causing the confusion.</p>
<p>"It's definitely an easy mistake to make and the bride was totally forgiving. Her last wedding the bride's name was Taylor so I get it can happen. Just bad luck with the name being what it was," he said.</p>
<p>After gaining over 2 million views, the video split viewers on how they would react in that situation, with one user writing: "I wouldn't fire her on the spot, but I would've definitely asked for a nice discount."</p>
<p>"The photographer better have given them the photos for free," added another.</p>
<p>The man claimed in a <a>Reddit</a> post to have offered up his backyard for the ceremony, only to then be told the groom did not want him there after finding out about their past.</p>

<p>A stunning photograph of U.S. gymnast Simone Biles performing a perfect rotation has taken the world of social media and beyond by storm.</p>
<p>The already iconic image was captured by Irish photographer Bryan Keane. He is in Tokyo covering the <a>Olympics</a> for Inpho Photography, a sports photo agency in Ireland.</p>
<p>Assigned to the Far East to predominantly chronicle the Games from an Irish perspective, Keane revealed to Newsweek there was an element of chance to him photographing <a>Biles at her brilliant best.</a></p>
<p>While as many as 30 photographers were following <a>Biles and the rest of Team USA</a> during that day's floor exercise, Keane decided to focus his efforts on getting a memorable picture from their next rotation, on the vault.</p>
<p>"There was a shot there I had done with one of the Irish athletes that worked because of the black background that was behind them when they launched into the air.</p>
<p>"The contrast it creates when you put an athlete into that space just takes away everything else. Whereas if they are down a bit lower things make the photo a bit more cluttered. You obsess over things like that as a photographer."</p>
<p>While the rest of the photographers were over on the floor exercise, the Irish photographer positioned himself low down to maximize the impact of any pictures he got.</p>
<p>"There was no pressure on me to get a shot. It meant I could take bigger risks to try and get something great," he said.</p>
<p>"I was down there shooting, kind of looking up at them. The gymnasts get really good elevation coming off the vault so they were putting themselves exactly in the space where I wanted them.</p>
<p>"I couldn't actually see when they were coming into shot, they just kind of popped into frame. So I set up the camera on a fixed manual focus point and had it there and was just waiting and as soon as they came into shot I'd shoot."</p>
<p>The results were good—but Keane "wanted something more."</p>
<p>The solution was to combine multiple exposures with a higher shutter speed to create the effect captured in the picture of Biles.</p>
<p>After taking pictures with three-frame and five-frame multiple exposures, Keane decided to push the envelope a little further, coming up with his most memorable photograph in the process.</p>
<p>"I looked at it and thought it looked really nice and then went again and got another great shot of her. I went back to the press room and sent the pictures to one of the guys in the office and they were like 'woah that shot is something special.'"</p>
<a>Instagram</a> accounts, he continued on with his work photographing
<p>"I had been out covering the Rugby sevens and over at the track when at about 4:30 pm someone said 'you should check your phone. There's a bit of traction on that photograph you took.'" he recalled.</p>
<p>Even then, as the picture exploded on social media, the scale of the reaction only dawned on Keane when he spoke to a friend in Australia who told him she had seen it on the news.</p>
<p>"It just took off," he said. "The Olympic channel's Twitter account got hold of it and then Simone herself retweeted it...it was all a bit bizarre. I've never received so much attention for a picture before."</p>
<p>While Keane has taken many pictures he is proud of during his career to date, he firmly believes this might be his best yet—and possibly the best he will ever take.</p>
<p>"To get a picture of such an iconic athlete <a>at an Olympic Games</a>...I don't think I can surpass that. I don't think I will surpass that. There's my best work. That's it," he said.</p>
<p>"I'd like to think that I'm good enough to take more amazing photographs and I will take more great photographs. As a photographer you always want to be better than before and keep your standard of work really high. You are never satisfied."</p>
<p>What makes the photograph all the more incredible is that this is Keane's first time covering the Olympics. "To come to my first Olympic Games and get a picture like that on day two is just the stuff of dreams," the Irishman admitted.</p>
<p>He also had his own perspective on what makes the photo such a fantastic image.</p>
<p>"It captures an incredible athlete doing what she does so brilliantly and there's just this perfect rotation," Keane explained.</p>
<p>"The photograph just compliments what she can achieve, when you break it down. When you see something like that in the air it's a split-second that she's turning.</p>
<p>"Most of us can't see that and are blown away by what she does. When you see it broken down and how her rotation is just so perfect as well, you can see that every movement is just beautiful."</p>
<p>"Everybody wants to have an iconic image, maybe, for me, that will be my iconic image."</p>

<p>When you think of emerging talented photographers, you wouldn't typically conjure a 2-year-old to mind.</p>
<p>However, a recent TikTok video has shown that one young toddler knows his way around a Polaroid camera after just being given it, and was able to take snaps that many online believe to be album-cover worthy.</p>
<p>In the video, posted to the app by YoungBlackDad, a man can be seen handing his small son a light pink camera.</p>
<p>Text overlaying the video reads: "I decided to gift my son a polaroid camera. He's only 2 and determined to be the greatest photographer of all time."</p>
<p>We then see the little boy taking photographs on a step ladder before <a>shaking a Polaroid picture</a> to develop it.</p>
<p>The text then reads: "Here is how they turned out."</p>
<p>He also took some portrait, which are entirely in focus, as well as another with his father's face again double-exposed onto the white wall above.</p>
<p>Another snap, perhaps showing the camera operator's age, is off his dad's sock-covered feet on the beige carpet.</p>
<p>YoungBlackDad captioned the post, writing: "Please don't let this flop @polaroid #myson #ClearGenius #XfinityFanthem #babypicturechallenge #fy #foryoupage #fypage."</p>
<p>The adorable video, which was shared on July 23, has since been viewed a whopping 697,700 times and surpassed a whopping 179,400 likes.</p>
<p>Many people rushed to the comments section to share their thoughts at the toddler's photography ability, and collaboration with his father.</p>
<p>One TikTok user, Alan, wrote: "This is actually my favorite, the first one is perfect for an album cover keep up the good work as always."</p>
<p>Another person, Jana, joked: "The pictures look like you got kidnapped."</p>
<p>Brock added: "I don't know how the first one happened but [flame emoji] [flame emoji] [flame emoji]."</p>
<p>Hey, It's Esther! typed: "Okay but all of these are so good I will be booking him in the future."</p>
<p>Becky commented: "Bestie I'm bouta hire ur toddler to do a photoshoot for me cuz he really ate that."</p>
<p>Javan Hall gushed: "Bro they all look like album covers," alongside a string of laughing-face emojis.</p>
<p>Hummingbirdsflutter stated: "He understood the assignment! And he gave an A+++ work! Keep up this craft!"</p>
<p>Newsweek have contacted YoungBlackDad for comment.</p>
<p>Japanese camera and optical equipment manufacturer Nikon announced the winners of its 11th annual "Small World in Motion" competition, which highlights some of the best recent photography and video taken under the microscope.</p>
<p>The winning images and video clips provide a stunning glimpse into a microscopic world that is normally hidden from our gaze.</p>
<p>First prize in this year's competition was awarded to Fabian Weston from Pennant Hills, New South Wales, Australia, who captured fascinating footage of microorganisms living in the gut of a termite.</p>
<p>Weston captured the video using a research microscope from the 1970s. His aim was to visually illustrate the symbiotic relationship between termites and these particular microscopic organisms.</p>
<p>The organisms and their termite host were difficult to film because they are sensitive to light and oxygen. Even small changes in the environment can result in the termite and its symbiotic microorganisms perishing.</p>
<p>"The most challenging part of capturing this video was finding the right solution for the creatures themselves," Weston said in a statement. "I tried a lot of methods, even preparing my own saline solution."</p>
<p>"They're very sensitive to oxygen, so I had to remove as much gas from the solution as possible. It was very tricky, and I had to work fast. The video you're seeing is the result of months of trial and error, a lot of research and perseverance."</p>
<p>The microorganisms observed inside the termite gut are known as protists—a term referring to a diverse group of predominantly single-celled organisms that aren't considered to be plants, animals or fungus.</p>
<p>The organisms observed in the video have formed a unique relationship with the termites, digesting the plant-based cellulose that the insects eat and helping them to derive nutrition from it, while also cycling carbon back into the soil.</p>
<p>The other winners included third-placed Andrei Savitsky from Cherkassy, Ukraine, who captured footage of a water flea (Daphnia pulex) giving birth to tiny cubs.</p>
<a>Bloomberg</a> School of Public Health, who recorded an infected mosquito spewing out malaria parasites that had been highlighted with a fluorescent substance.
<div> News Judge <a>Georgia</a> <a>Photography</a></div>
<p>A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on part of Georgia's new election law, ruling that a ban on photographing a voted ballot is likely unconstitutional.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>It argued that the provisions in question criminalize normal election observation activities. Lawyers for the state had argued those parts of the law reinforce previous protections and are necessary for election integrity.</p>
<p>Boulee declined to block another photography provision that prohibits the photographing or recording of the face of a touchscreen voting machine while someone is voting or while a voter's selections are displayed.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Photographer Captures Quiet Beauty in One of the World's Most Populated Countries</h1><div> By Arian Movileanu, Zenger News <time>On 9/4/21 at 9:00 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<div> World Bangladesh <a>Travel</a> <a>Photography</a></div>
<p>Bangladesh is packed with people. The South Asian nation has the tenth-highest population density in the world, at roughly 3,750 people per square mile — three times that of India, its huge neighbor to the east.</p>
<a>hoars</a>," a network of lakes and related wetland ecosystems that fill up during the monsoon season with runoff water from rivers and canals, forming huge inland expanses of water where the few villages look like tiny islands.
<p>That's where you'll find <a>Tafsir Ahmed Khan</a> squinting through a viewfinder to capture stunning photos of nature.</p>
<p>"I follow many foreign photographers and saw them taking beautiful photos of their countries. However, I couldn't find many in my own country.," he said. "Then I figured, why not take some artistic photos here? That's where the adventure began."</p>
<p>He purchased a camera in 2016 and found himself focusing on the hoars, and on nights dominated by the heavens overhead.</p>
<p>His <a>Instagram</a> account also shows stunning images of urban settings: highrise buildings sitting adjacent to water and scenes of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<a>neutral density filter</a> for his long-exposure shots, which makes the water and clouds in his images appear "really smooth," an effect he likes. Sometimes he mounts a
<a>circular polarizer filter</a> on his lens to cut down on reflections.
<p>Kahn said high-priced, sophisticated gear isn't necessary to create memorable images: "I want to motivate people to put more emphasis on skill building, rather than buying."</p>
<p>But he is concerned that climate change is a worrisome threat to the nature scenes he captures on memory cards. "For instance, light pollution is affecting my <a>astrophotography</a> now, which was not that prominent five years ago," Kahn said.</p>
<p>This story was provided to Newsweek by <a>Zenger News</a>.</p>
<p>Wedding photos rank among the most prized possessions of many a married couple, to be pored over with friends and loved ones for years to come.</p>
<p>Yet one photographer got a surprising reaction online after detailing how she did the unthinkable and deleted a newlywed couple's photos from their big day.</p>
<p>In a post published on <a>Reddit</a>'s "Am I The A**hole" forum, the photographer explained that she took the decision after being denied a 20 minute break "to get something to eat and drink."</p>
<p>In the post, which has garnered 17,000 upvotes and 2,200 comments, the photographer writing under the username Icy-Reserve6995 explained that she had been working for six hours straight when she made the request.</p>
<p>She said they had only agreed to take photos as a favor to the bride and groom, who are—or at least were—friends of hers and had recruited her in a bid to save money.</p>
<p>"I'm not really a photographer, I'm a dog groomer," she explained. "I take lots of photos of <a>dogs</a> all day to put on my <a>Facebook</a> and <a>Instagram</a>, it's "my thing" if that makes sense."</p>
<p>She agreed to shoot the wedding for a flat $250 fee which they note "is nothing for a 10 hour event."</p>
<p>On the day, she was tasked with "driving around following the bride as she goes from appointment to appointment before the ceremony, taking photos along the way."</p>
<p>She also shot snaps throughout the ceremony, reception and during the speeches. At around 5 p.m. food was being served and, having been on their feet since 11 a.m., the photographer was looking forward to a well-earned break.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bride and groom had other ideas. "I was told I cannot stop to eat because I need to be a photographer; in fact, they didn't save me a spot at any table," she said.</p>
<p>Despite originally RSVPing as a guest, after agreeing to serve as photographer, she was dismayed to find her space at one of the tables had been given away. Instead, she was asked to mind the couple's young child while they enjoyed the meal.</p>
<p>At this point, they admit they were "getting tired" and also "regretting doing this for next to nothing" noting that the venue was "unbelievably hot."</p>
<p>"I told the groom I need to take off for 20min to get something to eat and drink," they said. "He tells me I need to either be a photographer, or leave without pay."</p>
<p>That proved to be the tipping point.</p>
<p>"With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if he was sure, and he said yes, so I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I'm not his photographer anymore."</p>
<p>The photographer says that they have not spoken to the couple since as they went on honeymoon straight after their wedding, but people have started to ask about the photos from the big day.</p>
<p>In spite of the severity of her response, the photographer found herself inundated with messages of support on Reddit, where users were quick to condemn the newlyweds' behavior.</p>
<p>JuryNo7670 noted that their photographer was treated like a "paid guest" at their wedding saying it "helped make it a better celebration and helped with making it more fun which only enhanced the pics."</p>
<p>HighPriestoftheBog said "it seems like common sense to also feed the photographer."</p>
<p>Despite garnering widespread support for her actions, the photographer did express some regret at deleting the pictures.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, I wasn't thinking straight because now I've nothing to show for my wasted time," Icy-Reserve6995 wrote in a follow-up post. "I just had to get out of there and make a point before I did."</p>
<p>The story is just the latest example of how, when it comes to wedding days where emotions run high, things can and often do go wrong, much to the delight of people on social media.</p>
<p>In another recent example, a bridesmaid took the decision to <a>quit her future sister-in-law's wedding after she made a disparaging remark</a> during a family lunch just a day before she was due to walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>Even more recently, an angry bride incurred the wrath of the internet after hitting out at her prospective guests for <a>refusing to pay $3,000 to attend their wedding in Thailand</a>.</p>

<p>The Harvest Moon, a full moon typically occurring around late September every year, takes place on September 20 in 2021 in the U.S.</p>
<p>It is one of 12 full moons (three for each of the four seasons) that occur in a tropical year, which is marked from one winter solstice (usually around December 20), to the next.</p>
<p>The Harvest Moon and other full moons in a tropical year are named after an activity appropriate for that time of year.</p>
<h2>What Is the Harvest Moon?</h2>
<h2>What Time Is the Harvest Moon?</h2>
<p>The Harvest Moon will take place at 7:55 p.m. ET on Monday, September 20, 2021.</p>
<p>According to NASA, the moon will appear full for around three days around the same time, from Sunday evening through Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The full moon will be on September 20 from Iceland, Liberia and Senegal westward across the Americas to the International Date Line.</p>
<p>The International Date Line is a demarcation line separating two successive calendar dates. It passes through the mid-region of the Pacific Ocean and roughly follows a 180 degrees longitude north-south line on the Earth.</p>
<p>The Harvest Moon will be on Tuesday, September 21, for the rest of Africa and Europe eastward across Asia and Australia to the International Date Line.</p>
<h2>Tips for Photographing the Moon</h2>
<p>Capturing an image of the moon is challenging because of its great distance from the camera and because night photography is difficult in itself.</p>
<a>says</a>: "The full moon is very popular and photogenic, but it's also the brightest and the most difficult to expose correctly."
<p>However, there are some tricks to maximize the quality of the photos when capturing the moon, even if only shooting it with your camera phone.</p>
<a>Carly Earl recommends</a> downloading an app and shooting the moon via the app instead of directly from the camera on your phone, as some apps allow users to capture images in low light settings by letting them increase the sensitivity rating.
<p>The quality of your image will depend on the type of equipment you use. To capture the best images, Earl says a professional camera with a telephoto or zoom lens (the longer the better) is required.</p>
<h3>...And a Tripod with a Delayed Shutter Time</h3>
<p>Earl also recommends placing the camera on a tripod and using a cable release or a two-second delay timer to release the shutter when shooting. Doing so will prevent the camera from shaking when hitting the shutter button.</p>
<p>It also allows the user to increase the size of the moon within the frame and retain all its details while keeping the image as sharp as possible.</p>
<h3>Shoot Around Sunset or Sunrise</h3>
<p>Ohio photographer Wunderlich adds the best time to shoot the moon is just after it rises or just before it sets, when it's low in the sky. This is important because when the moon is closer to the horizon, it will appear larger in your photos.</p>
<p>He explains: "As the full moon rises, the sun will be setting, and as the full moon sets, the sun will be rising. This can give you great lighting to accentuate foreground objects."</p>
<h3>Be Careful With Foregrounds</h3>
<p>Earl also suggests having another element in the image, such as capturing the moon as it goes past a scenic bridge or a mountain, to give viewers a better understanding of the size of the moon.</p>
<p>Nikon, the camera and photography equipment retailer, <a>notes</a> that capturing the moon against a foreground can be tricky due to its wide dynamic range, with a danger of either overexposing the moon and causing the foreground to appear too dark.</p>
<h3>Underexpose the Shot to Capture Detail</h3>
<p>The aperture refers to the opening of a camera lens' diaphragm through which light passes.</p>

<p>A New Mexico photographer who captured images of Haitian migrants evacuating a U.S migrant camp is addressing the controversy surrounding Border Patrol agents using whips on the immigrants while on horseback.</p>
<p>On Friday, Paul Ratje of New Mexico spoke to KTSM and told the outlet that the photos, which were taken on September 19, aren't what they appear to be.</p>
