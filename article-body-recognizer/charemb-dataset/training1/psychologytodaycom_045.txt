<h1> Why Do We Stare at Misophonia Trigger Sounds and Visuals? </h1>
<h2> Understanding why the brain does this can help people cope. </h2>
<li>There is a reason we stare at misophonia triggers. </li>
<li>This is our pre-attention at work, which occurs outside of our conscious awareness. </li>
<li>There are steps we can take to help redirect attention during misophonia reactivity. </li>
<a>nervous system</a> arousal, we must be alert to stimuli. Think how we rely on our sense of smell to alert us to the potential danger of something. For example, we smell something burning and we think “fire.”
<a>attention</a>. This is known as pre-attention. Pre-attention, then, is not something we control. Rather, it is an
<a>unconscious</a> process preserved by evolution that allows us to know when we are in danger (LeDoux, 2015).
<a>cognition</a> at times. Remember the mind will follow the body but the body will not always follow the mind, and this is particularly important in misophonia. Here are some simple tips:
<li>Don't try to "think" your way out of the problem. If you are at home, get up and move around. It doesn't matter what kind of movement you engage in, just sit and stare.</li>
<li>Children can jump up and down, dance, or even do pushups. Ask your child what they might find fun in order to engage them. </li>
<li>If you are not at home, you can transfer these activities for your child or for yourself. Stretching in one's seat at school or in the office often refocuses attention without others noticing.</li>
<li>Other activities that one can do seated include pressing the palms together to create pressure. Pressure to the muscles and joints brings in the parasympathetic system, which breaks fight/flight.</li>
<li>One can also tap their feet under their desk (either at school or in the office). Use as much pressure to do this as you feel is necessary and so as not to draw the attention of others. </li>

<h1> How One Mother Built a Residential Community for Her Son </h1>
<h2> ...And the lessons she learned along the way. </h2>
<li>A good residential community is inclusive and dynamic. </li>
<li>It offers a sense of connection and opportunities to grow.</li>
<li>When looking for a good residential community, people should keep their goals high but ensure that they are realistic and attainable.</li>
<a>autism</a>, the doctor advised her to “love, accept, and plan to institutionalize him.” Horrified by what she saw in the institutions, Denise leaned into her background in real estate and set out to build
<p>The following eight lessons are a combination of our interview and her own writing, designed to help people looking for a residential community or hoping to develop one of their own.</p>
<h3>1. A residential community connects with the broader community.</h3>
<li>Get out of the “silo mentality” of creating a residential community for a specific age group and disorder. The more diverse the living environment, the richer the experience. </li>
<li>Create space based on needs, interests, and strengths. That’s when you’ll see real change and growth.</li>
<ul><li>Building community support is essential. </li> <li>Connect with as many government housing and service agencies as possible. Get them talking to each other. </li> <li>Connect your residential community with the community-at-large.</li> </ul>
<h3>2. A residential community builds on strengths.</h3>
<ul><li>Know what’s already working in your community; then build on and expand on those assets.</li> </ul>
<h3>3. A residential community innovates. </h3>
<h3>4. A residential community encourages individual growth.</h3>
<ul><li>A residential community should offer the skills for a successful transition.</li> <li>We need new metrics that track the quality of life outcomes. Only then can we change public policy.</li> </ul>
<h3>5. The goals of a residential community should be realistic and attainable. </h3>
<ul><li>Be practical about your vision. </li> <li>Research early and thoroughly. </li> <li>One size does not fit all. Cast a net that could include everyone based on levels of ability, price points, design preference, etc. </li> </ul>
<h3>6. Don’t fall in love with your plan too soon.</h3>
<p>“We realized at one point that the cost of our building was greater than estimated. That’s when we pushed the pause button and took a six-month time-out to re-assess, saving us $3 million from the original project cost.”</p>

<p>The internet is now the primary residence of popular or “pop” psychology; concepts and theories about human experiences, supposedly based on psychology that find acceptance among the public.</p>
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>,
<sup>1</sup> one of the diagnostic criteria for autism is:
<a>the environment</a> (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
<p>While there is certainly a major overlap in <a>sensory processing</a> experiences of both <a>autistic</a> and highly sensitive individuals, specifically sensitivity to sensory information, this does not mean they are the same thing.</p>
<a>identity</a> of being a highly sensitive person and embrace autistic identity instead, due to stigma and misunderstanding surrounding autism. Therefore, creating a barrier to self-acceptance that limits mental health and wellbeing.
<p>We also hold concerns about highly sensitive people being misdiagnosed as autistic by professionals who are not trained in assessing temperament and high sensitivity, which may lead to poor self-understanding and mismatched supports.</p>
<sup>4</sup> Temperament is defined as biologically based individual differences in reactivity and
<sup>5</sup> Just as humans differ from one another on their level of
<a>introversion</a> and other temperament traits, people also vary in how sensitive they are. It is estimated that around 30 percent of the population is highly sensitive.
<sup>6</sup> High sensitivity presents equally in males and females and has been observed in over 100 species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, fish, and insects.

<a>sensory processing sensitivity</a> (SPS), though people are often more familiar with the popular psychology terms highly sensitive person (HSP)
<sup>16</sup> and highly sensitive child (HSC).
<sup>17</sup> While we talk about “high sensitivity” as a category, research shows SPS forms a continuum from low sensitivity to high sensitivity.
<p>Highly sensitive people, compared to those who are less sensitive, tend to have:</p>
<li>a greater response to stress,</li>
<li>a greater capacity for noticing subtleties in their environment,</li>
<li>deeper cognitive processing of physical, social, and emotional stimuli,</li>
<li>greater emotional reactivity to positive and negative information, and</li>
<li>a tendency to become more easily overstimulated.<sup>18</sup></li>
<a>nervous system</a>. Individuals across species vary in their sensitivity to the environment, with some individuals being more strongly affected by their environment and others being less affected.

<sup>19</sup> Variations in environmental sensitivity are understood to increase the group’s ability to adapt to the environment
<sup>20,21</sup> as highly sensitive individuals across species can detect opportunities and risks that can promote the safety and wellbeing of the larger group.
<sup>22,23</sup> initially defined within the medical model and thus framed as a form of pathology, autism is increasingly viewed as part of the naturally occurring neurodiversity of humankind.
<p>The DSM-5<sup>1</sup> defines autism spectrum disorder as:</p>
<ul><li>the presence of marked socio-communicative and socio-emotional divergence</li> </ul>
<p>along with some combination of:</p>
<ul><li>sensory processing differences</li> <li>capacity for hyper-focus</li> <li>intensity and/or specificity of interests</li> <li>preference for sameness and predictability</li> <li>repetitive or ritualistic behaviours </li> </ul>
<p>To be diagnosed within the medical model, these experiences must be present in some form starting in early <a>childhood</a> and significantly limit how the individual functions in current socio-cultural expectations.</p>
<a>pregnant</a>”; you either are autistic or you aren’t.
<h3>Differentiation of Autism and HSP</h3>
<p>Capacity for <a>Empathy</a></p>
<p>High empathy is also frequently included in lists of characteristics and anecdotes of the HSP, reflecting the underlying reactivity to the environment and subsequent ability to notice subtleties.</p>
<p>Both autism and high sensitivity are examples of neurodivergence. Sensitivity is a temperament trait that occurs along a continuum; high sensitivity reflects heightened reactivity to the environment and thus heightened experiences.</p>
<p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental divergence that is either present or not. Differences in brain structure and connectivity result in qualitatively different ways of experiencing oneself and the world, including heightened experiences.</p>
<sup/>High sensitivity is associated with a depth of processing, meaning relevant information may take longer to process and feel more intense.
<sup>27</sup> and hyperconnectivity across brain regions,
<sup>28</sup> meaning a greater volume of information from the environment is processed at any given time,
<sup>29</sup> whether directly relevant or not. This indicates a breadth—as well as a depth—of processing in autistic people.

<h1> The Simple Sustainable Beauty of a Disabled Community </h1>
<h2> Lessons from one woman's lifelong dedication to perfecting shared living. </h2>
<div> <h3>Key points</h3> <ul> <li>What does a utopian community for the disabled look like? </li> <li>Four walls do not make a person feel safe, secure, wanted, and cared for. </li> <li>It is the sense of community that does.</li> </ul> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Used with permission by Daniela Morse and Shared Living Collaborative</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>I couldn’t fit our entire interview here, so I focused on our conversation about community. Below are a few of her ideas on what makes a strong community. </p>
<p>1. A real community is sustainable. People, staff, funding come and go, but if you’ve built a community with a solid foundation, it will endure through the hardest of times.</p>
<a>anxiety</a> medication, but access to organic food, wellness, massage, or horseback riding is not paid for. It doesn't make any sense. If you and I are
<a>depressed</a> and we’re having a bad day, we would say to each other, "Suck it up, get over it, go to the gym, move on." If somebody with a disability says "I'm depressed," they are being put on
<a>antidepressants</a>. Medicalizing disability interferes with community building, and interferes with the disabled as being viewed as a productive member of society.
<p>5. A community’s staff should be empowered:</p>
<li>Turnover is disruptive and costly.</li>
<li>Staff should think: “We’re not here to very satisfy one person at a time, we're here to do the best we can to support people.”</li>
<li>Staff needs to be empowered and supported so that they feel like they are part of the community.</li>
<p>7. A community should be non-profit: Human services should be non-profit, period.</p>
<p>9. There is no one kind of community: I know some of the parents are saying all that's fine and dandy, but my child's angry, he's breaking things down, he's nonverbal.</p>
<a>diet</a>, sleep. We combine their needs with what can be offered, and try and create a holistic, creative approach that can fulfill everyone’s idea of a future.
<a>creativity</a>, can go a long way.
<p>Everywhere in health services, you have innovation, except in the disability community. It doesn't need to be like that. It really doesn't. </p>

<h1> Screen Time and Autism </h1>
<h2> A connection that we can no longer ignore. </h2>
<li>The rate of childhood autism has risen exponentially in the last 50 years.</li>
<li>Researchers are studying the correlation between screen time and autism.</li>
<li>A recent study demonstrates that the longer the child's screen time the more obvious the autism-like symptoms.</li>
<li>Excessive time watching screens affects young children's language, emotional, and physical development.</li>
<a>childhood</a>? With the prevalence of autism increasing yearly—the rate is now 1 in 44 children
<a>(latest CDC data)</a> up from 1 in 10,000 in 1970 and 1 in 150 in 2000—scientists are ramping up the search for possible causes in children's social environments.
<a>screen time</a> for 2 to 5-year-olds be limited to 1 hour per day, most young children are exposed to screens more than this. In one
<a>Autistic</a> Symptoms as Well as Developmental Quotients in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, lists its main findings as twofold:
<ol><li>The screen time of children with ASD was longer than that of typically developing children.</li> <li>The screen time was correlated with the autistic symptoms and Developmental Quotients (DQ's) of the children with ASD.</li> </ol>
<p>This study, along with the 41 other studies it cites, highlights a trend that we can no longer ignore: Increased exposure to tablets, smartphones, and TV in children under age 2 is correlated with symptoms of ASD as the child develops.</p>

<a>A large body of evidence</a> has suggested that some autistic individuals possess exceptional musical skills, e.g.,
<a>absolute pitch</a>—the ability to classify musical notes without a reference tone. One famous example is
<a>Derek Paravicini</a>, a musical savant with autism, who can play music by ear and communicate better with music than using words. As revealed by
<a>our recent systematic review and meta-analysis</a>, autistic individuals are also better able to recognise emotions such as
<a>happiness</a> from music than from human faces.
