<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paul Sonne</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Ashley Parker</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Isabelle Khurshudyan</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 5:09 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden made no commitments or concessions on possible NATO membership for Ukraine, which for years has been seeking to join the U.S.-led military alliance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What the right mechanism for that is, what the agenda for that is, and what comes of that — that is all to be worked out as we see how things proceed in the coming days,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is leverage for the West because if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” Sullivan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I believe that it absolutely would, senator,” said Nuland.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the eyes of the White House, the call didn’t put those fears to rest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We still do not believe that President Putin has made a decision,” Sullivan said. “What President Biden did today was lay out very clearly the consequences if he chooses to move.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden briefed the leaders of Britain, Germany, France and Italy after the call and is planning to speak with Zelensky on Thursday, the White House said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both publicly and privately, administration officials have been hesitant to telegraph just how far the United States is prepared to go, including the potential use of military force, if Russia moves ahead and invades Ukraine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though Ukraine’s accession to NATO has long appeared remote, Russia is concerned about the extent of Kyiv’s cooperation with the alliance, including on military assistance, analysts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amid the escalation, Russian officials have claimed that Moscow — not Kyiv — is under threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Herbst said the most likely downside to these negotiations is that “in our willingness to prevent the nasty outcome, we give Putin something of value — so what he learns is that intimidation works.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that even if Washington gave Moscow the guarantees it is seeking, “they probably wouldn’t be completely trusted by Russia.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Russian strategy appears to be using military force deployments and movements to make the U.S. take Russian security concerns seriously and engage in a productive dialogue,” Trenin said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Moscow regards Biden “as a sensible person who, all rhetoric aside, understands his responsibility when confronting a fellow nuclear superpower,” Trenin added.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By John Wagner</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Ashley Parker</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 8, 2021 at 5:20 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>President Biden on Wednesday ruled out putting U.S. combat troops in Ukraine for now, a day after he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video call that Russia would face severe economic sanctions if he mounts an invasion.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That is not on the table,” Biden said when asked if he was considering, as some lawmakers have suggested, stationing U.S. troops in or around Ukraine to protect against a potential Russian incursion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden’s comments to reporters as he left the White House for an event in Kansas City, Mo., marked his clearest articulation of what the United States is and is not willing to do to curb Russian aggression in the region.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden is scheduled to talk with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, the White House said. After that call, Biden will speak to the leaders of nine eastern European countries that are NATO members.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden threatens Putin with economic sanctions if he further invades Ukraine</p></div>
<p>“That obligation does not extend to . . . Ukraine,” Biden said pointedly. “The idea that the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not in the cards right now.”</p>
<div><div><p>Biden said last week that he would reject any demands by Putin on a prospective Ukraine membership in NATO. “I don’t accept anybody’s red lines,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>a multi-front offensive</a> into Ukraine involving as many as 175,000 troops as early as next year.
<div><div><p>Still, Russia experts say it can be hard to fathom Putin’s motives, and the show of force could be aimed at gaining diplomatic leverage more than an actual invasion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the deputy White House press secretary, said that although the United States is not planning unilateral military force to confront Russia, all options remain open.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The United States has placed troops in Ukraine for training, so the discussion has revolved around the question of combat troops.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, Biden characterized his video call with Putin as “very straightforward” and said he did “not mince words.”</p></div></div>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paul Sonne</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Ashley Parker</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 9, 2021 at 4:24 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p><b/>President Biden moved to solidify a unified position with Ukraine and U.S. allies on Europe’s eastern flank in a set of phone calls Thursday, part of an urgent effort to prevent and prepare for a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<b/>Biden also held a separate call Thursday with the “Bucharest Nine,” a group of NATO members on Europe’s eastern edge close to Russia, including the Baltics and Poland, that are particularly sensitive to aggressive moves by Moscow.
<p>During their call, Biden and Putin agreed that their teams would arrange talks on what the Kremlin calls sensitive European security issues, including Putin’s complaints about NATO activities in and around Ukraine, which is not a NATO member.</p>
<div><div><p>The Kremlin has denied any plans to invade, accusing Washington of fueling a war scare.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine seemed to epitomize the growing threat of global autocracy against which Biden hoped his summit would serve as a bulwark.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Putin may be testing U.S. with military buildup</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>“What’s happening now in the Donbas — you and I can see it — we know is very reminiscent of genocide,” Putin said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked about Putin’s genocide claim, White House press secretary Jen Psaki urged reporters to take Moscow’s efforts to message its own public “with a grain of salt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Russians are known for their rhetorical escalations, as they‘re also known for their ways of providing misinformation around the world and within eastern flank countries,” Psaki said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Information being spread in the media about Russia allegedly preparing an invasion of Ukraine is a lie,” Gerasimov said.</p></div></div>
<p>He said NATO countries were paying excessive attention to Russia’s troop movements on its own soil and described the domestic redeployment of units during combat training as “a routine practice for the armed forces of any state.”</p>
<div><div><p>In a statement after his call with Biden, Zelensky said he had thanked the U.S. president for “his consistent, firm and resolute support” for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential administration and one of Zelensky’s main advisers, speaking by video to a Ukrainian news talk show, described Thursday’s call as warm and direct.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Inflation pinch challenges Biden agenda, but president says worst will soon pass</h1></div>
<h2>Prices keep climbing and the president is working to convince critics that his agenda will help, not hurt.</h2>

<div><div><p>Rising prices throughout the economy threaten to swamp the White House’s legislative agenda during a critical moment for President Biden, as persistently high inflation spooks both voters and lawmakers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Senate Democrats had hoped they could pass the spending measure in the next two weeks, but they do not have the votes if Manchin remains noncommittal.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Five charts explaining why inflation is so high.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t know the answer to that,” the president told reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Friday, Biden blamed supply chain dysfunction, not government spending, for pushing prices higher. Still, he referred to the current inflationary surge as a “real bump in the road.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He also said that prices on some products in recent days have eased, a dynamic that White House officials believe wasn’t reflected in the new data. This line of reasoning, though, has proved to be a tough political sell.</p></div></div>
<a>quit their jobs </a>between August and October in part because they had better opportunities and pay elsewhere, a trend with no precedent. The economy has created more than
<a>6 million jobs</a> since Biden took office, something that has also never happened before. The stock market is up roughly
<a>25 percent</a> and economic growth is
<a>surging far faster</a> than most analysts predicted before this year. And the stock market continued to climb Friday even after the inflation figures were released because many investors believe the economy is set for more growth in 2022.
<div><div><p>On Friday, shortly after the big inflation report was released, <a>Klain took to Twitter again</a>, this time to say that gas prices are now below $3.10 a gallon in one-third of states.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In one California city, rising prices overshadow economy’s strength, spelling trouble for Democrats</p></div>
<div><p>Biden pushes FTC to investigate rising gas prices</p></div>
<div><p>The White House has said it is taking a range of actions designed to head off inflation, from coordinating a release of the gas reserves to looking at anti-competitive behavior in a range of industries pushing up consumers prices.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Still, some White House allies are urging the administration not to fixate on the media and instead emphasize that the president’s economic agenda is designed to address strains on family budgets.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden has underestimated problems facing the country, and Democrats fear that could spell trouble</p></div>
<div><div><p>Whatever the cause, there is growing evidence that voters are blaming Biden for high prices in a way that could spell political disaster for Democrats in 2022.</p></div></div>
<a>Washington Post-ABC poll</a>. Biden’s approval rating on the economy has fallen dramatically, the poll found, with 55 percent of the country now viewing his economic stewardship negatively, compared to just 39 percent who view it positively.
<div><div><p>Republicans say attempts to reframe the economy as a success for the country could backfire on Biden by making the White House appear out of touch.</p></div></div>
<a>first reported by CNN</a>, White House officials in recent days have briefed the television networks about the supply chain crisis in an attempt to improve economic coverage. Many liberal economists have echoed the administration’s frustrations.
<div><p>Biden sees gains in supply chain effort, but battle isn't over</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ashley Parker</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 2:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In a virtual, pretaped appearance — Biden was already ensconced in his Wilmington, Del., home when the show aired — the president joked about his <a>falling poll numbers</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When Fallon asked if he paid attention to his approval ratings, Biden quipped, “Well, not anymore.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added that he’ll started paying attention again when his numbers, which hover in the low 40s, move back up to the 60s.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The appearance marked Biden’s third time on the show. He spoke with Fallon in 2016 as vice president and in 2020 as a presidential candidate. And it was a relatively staid event, given the backdrop of the pandemic and inflation.</p></div>
<p>Biden explained that the reason he was late to the taping was that he had been delivering <a>a eulogy for Robert J. Dole</a>, the late Republican senator and presidential candidate, with whom he often disagreed but maintained a close friendship.</p>
<p>Biden also talked about the discomfort he and his wife, Jill, felt — “we come from middle-class backgrounds” — upon moving into the White House residence, which includes a full staff ready to attend to their every need.</p>
<div><p>“We’re not used to people waiting on us,” Biden said, adding that in the White House, “there’s somebody to, you know, make your breakfast, or someone to pack your clothes, or someone to carry your bag.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Biden said he has emphasized to the staff that they no longer need to come in to prepare breakfast for the Bidens. “We can make our own eggs or, you know, pour a bowl of cereal,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You make your own eggs?” Fallon asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Well, I don’t,” Biden conceded. “Jill does.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On a more substantive note, Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated and boosted against the <a>coronavirus</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden appealed, as he has in the past, to the public sense of duty. “It’s patriotic to get this done,” he said. “Not a joke.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden also celebrated the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill, saying it would “create millions of jobs” and “change the quality of life for an awful lot of people around the country.”</p></div></div>
<p>And he talked about his “Build Back Better” social spending bill, which Senate Democrats are eager to pass by year’s end, although as Biden lamented, he does not “have a single Republican vote right now to pass it.”</p>
<div><div><p>He added, “It’s going to be tough, but I think we can get it done. And if we don’t get it, we’ll keep adding until we get it done.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the challenges of the presidency, Biden said that having served as vice president for eight years, he knew better than most what the job entailed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No one should feel sorry for me,” Biden said. “It’s a greatest honor anybody can have in their whole life, in my view, to be president of the United States.”</p></div></div>

<p>“The biggest change between the Trump administration and the Biden administration is that the Biden administration actually acknowledged there is such a thing as far-right terrorism and hired people who know the issue,” Clarke said.</p>
<div><p>“If you look at the forensics of all the things that went wrong that day, I think it is right to focus on the information-sharing part, and that’s one of the most important strategies to prevent it from repeating.”</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Amy Gardner</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Emma Brown</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Devlin Barrett</div></span></div></span></div><div>November 19, 2021 at 3:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Investigators with the office of Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) believe a government official appears to have facilitated the attempted breach of the election network in Lake County, a spokesman for LaRose said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>An elections supervisor embraced conspiracy theories. Officials say she has become an insider threat.</p></div>
<p>Frank also took part in a discussion earlier this year with ­Hamercheck, the Lake County, Ohio, commissioner, according to an individual familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiries.</p>
<div><div><p>“Do I remember that call? No,” he said of the Hamercheck conversation. “Does it sound like me? Yes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ohio election officials said they first learned of the attempted Lake County breach after Lindell’s August symposium, where he promised to unveil evidence of widespread fraud across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Officials in all three states, as well as independent cyber experts interviewed by The Post, determined that the network data — known as packet captures, or PCAPs — contained no sensitive information from a protected network.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ohio state officials said the attempted breach in Lake County also yielded limited data, a possible sign that the person or people responsible may not have had technical expertise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are thrilled that our infrastructure stayed strong,” said Ross McDonald, director of the Lake County Board of Elections, who added that the county is awaiting the results of the state and federal investigations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After his office assessed the attempted breach, LaRose, who oversees election administration across Ohio’s 88 counties, referred the matter to federal, state and local investigators.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officials with the Lake County prosecuting attorney and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Local, state and federal authorities began investigating the alleged breach in Mesa shortly after Lindell’s symposium in August, when copies of hard drives from county voting machines were presented.</p></div></div>
<a>shared </a>in an interview with right-wing media personality Brannon Howse.
<div><div><p>Frank argues that the 2020 election was tainted by an elaborate conspiracy involving inflated voter rolls, fraudulent ballots and a “sixth-order polynomial” — claims that have been repeatedly <a>debunked</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the ‘shadow reality world’ promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen</p></div>
<div><div><p>Asked whether he knew if Hayes was involved in gathering data from Lake and Mesa counties, Frank said: “I should probably not say. That’s just me being, I think, prudent.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few moments later, Watkins said Hayes “did have permission to take the hard drive, but did not have permission to upload it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Watkins’s lawyer <a>told </a>the news outlet Vice that Hayes was Watkins’s source for the hard drives — but declined to discuss the matter in an interview with The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hayes could not be reached by phone and did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similarly, the Clark County data was captured by a computer called “cjh’s MacBook Pro (2),” according to Graham.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In both Lake and Mesa counties, the data were captured by the same type of gaming laptop, using the same software and same Windows operating system, metadata shows.</p></div></div>

<p>A commissioner in Lake County, Ohio, whose government office was used to plug a private laptop into the county network during the spring primary said Tuesday that he was not aware of an attempt to breach the local election board’s computers.</p>
<div><div><p>John Hamercheck (R), president of the Lake County Board of Commissioners, spoke publicly for the first time about the incident, which is under investigation by the FBI and state officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Tuesday, reading from a prepared statement at the board’s regular meeting, Hamercheck said there has been “much false or misleading information” about what occurred, but he did not elaborate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“To my knowledge,” Hamercheck said, “there was never an attempt to access or breach the Lake County Board of Elections computer network that day.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The commissioner said he has not been interviewed by any agencies investigating the incident. He pledged to share more information with the public “as soon as we are finished gathering and verifying the appropriate materials.”</p></div>
<div><p><span>Attempted breach of Ohio county election network draws FBI and state scrutiny</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>The Lake County incident bears similarities to events in Colorado earlier this year, when government officials helped an outsider gain access to the county voting system in an effort to find fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Investigators with the office of Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) believe a government official appears to have facilitated the attempted breach of the election network in Lake County, a spokesman for LaRose said last week.</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the board meeting Tuesday, a local resident, Lois Osborn, pressed Hamercheck about the incident and said she was “very disturbed” by news reports about it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some of you might say, to use basketball terminology, ‘No foul here,’ ” Osborn said. “Well, there was a foul here. There was a breach coming from John Hamercheck’s office.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She added, “In my mind, this was something very inappropriate for an elected official in Lake County.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Osborn asked the other two commissioners, Ron Young and John Plecnik, whether they would consider censuring Hamercheck for his role in the incident.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Young responded that it was premature to consider a censure while investigations are underway.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In Michigan, local GOP leaders have sought to reshape election canvassing boards by appointing members who expressed sympathy for former president Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 vote was rigged.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In two Pennsylvania communities, candidates who embraced election fraud allegations won races this month to become local voting judges and inspectors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And in Colorado, 2020 doubters are urging their followers on conservative social media platforms to apply for jobs in election offices.</p></div></div>
<div><p>If they succeed, Trump and his allies could pull down some of the guardrails that prevented him from overturning Biden’s win by creating openings to challenge the results next time, election officials and watchdog groups say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Supporters of the former president who are seeking offices that would give them oversight of elections say they just want to make the system secure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither DePerno nor Karamo responded to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier this year, the GOP-led Michigan Senate Oversight Committee issued a report that found no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud in Michigan’s 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These boards are typically made up of an even number of Republicans and Democrats, who in the past approached certification as a ministerial duty determined by the outcome of the popular vote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tension grips Michigan as Trump’s election attacks continue to reverberate</p></div>
<a>calls </a>directly from Trump, they later said in interviews.
<div><div><p>Both initially voted not to certify, then <a>reversed themselves</a> after receiving promises that the vote would be audited. They then tried unsuccessfully to rescind their votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This year, Palmer was replaced with Robert Boyd, a Republican who said in an interview that he probably would not have voted to certify the 2020 results.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hartmann said he regretted losing Palmer’s experience and expressed wariness about some of those being nominated to canvassing boards around the state.</p></div></div>
<a>at a legislative hearing</a> last year in Lansing.
<div><p>Kolanagireddy said in an interview that she withdrew her nomination because of the threatening environment. Brown did not respond to a request for comment. The Wayne County Republican Committee did not respond to email inquiries.</p></div>
<a>as the Detroit News first reported</a>. In Michigan’s third-largest county, Macomb, Republican officials appointed to the canvassing board a former Republican poll challenger, Nancy Tiseo,
<a>who tweeted</a> shortly after the 2020 election that Trump should suspend meetings of the electoral college and have “military tribunals” investigate claims about election fraud. Tiseo did not respond to a request for comment.
<a>contended with a wave of claims </a>by local residents that 2020 election was rigged.

<div><p>A spokesman for Kemp on Sunday accused the former senator of running to “soothe his own bruised ego,” and risking Republican control of Georgia after bungling his runoff campaign and putting Democrats in charge of the Senate.</p></div>
<p>Perdue was narrowly forced into a runoff in the 2020 election, which he went on to lose to Ossoff (D). Trump loomed over the contest, attacking the results of the election and using two pre-runoff rallies to air baseless claims about his defeat.</p>
<a>coronavirus</a>. He briefly considered a run for the state’s other Senate seat, which is up for election next year, but
<a>results</a>, released in August, found Kemp narrowly ahead of Perdue, with the former senator leaping ahead if Trump endorsed him.

<div><div><p>At last month’s meeting of the Republican Governors Association, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey brushed off a question about a “hypothetical” Georgia primary and whether the group would spend money to help Kemp.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The RGA is in the business, of course, of supporting our incumbents and ultimately electing Republican governors,” said Ducey, the RGA’s chairman. “That’s what would continue to be our focus.”</p></div>
