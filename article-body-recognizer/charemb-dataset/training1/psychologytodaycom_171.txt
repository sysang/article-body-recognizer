<p>Antipsychotics are usually in pill or liquid form. Some antipsychotics are in an injectable form that is given once or twice a month.</p>
<p>Symptoms of schizophrenia, such as feeling agitated and having hallucinations, usually go away within days. Symptoms like delusions usually go away within a few weeks. After about six weeks, many people will see significant improvement.</p>
<p>Side Effects of Medication</p>
<p>Psychotherapeutic Treatment</p>
<a>education</a> about the disorder, common symptoms or problems patients may experience, and the importance of staying on medications.
<p>Illness <a>Management</a> Skills</p>
<a>relapses</a>. Patients can also use coping skills to deal with persistent symptoms.
<p>Integrated Treatment for Co-Occurring Substance Use Disorder</p>
<p>Substance use disorder is the most common co-occurring disorder in people with schizophrenia. Many treatment programs, however, do not address the specific needs of people with schizophrenia. </p>
<p>Individual Psychotherapy</p>
<p><a>Cognitive Behavioral</a> Therapy</p>
<a>self-help</a> groups may also serve other important functions. Families working together can more effectively serve as advocates for research and more hospital and community treatment programs. Also, groups may be able to draw public attention to the
<a>discrimination</a> many people with mental illnesses face.

<h1> Major Depressive Disorder Can Include Psychotic Features </h1>
<h2> Part 2: Identifying and understanding major depression subtypes. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Psychosis? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to treat psychosis</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Psychotic features are present in approximately 20% of major depressive episodes. </li>
<li>These psychotic symptoms only occur while the person is depressed. </li>
<li>Common psychotic symptoms in depression include voices saying negative things or delusions of not being sure if they are alive or dead. </li>
<a>previous post</a>, readers were reacquainted with the basics of major depressive disorder (MDD). Today, we will start looking at the subtypes, beginning with major
<a>depression</a> with psychotic features. This means that, while depressed, the person experiences hallucinations/delusions.
<a>psychosis</a> means "abnormal condition of the soul (the essence of one's being)." This is most associated with schizophrenia, but psychotic symptoms occur across numerous disorders, as written about in The Many Faces of Psychosis.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Beatriz/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>PTSD</a>, and even some severe
<a>OCD</a> presentations can have delusional material. Psychosis is also present in
<ul><li>Voices saying demeaning things like, "You're no good and no one likes you!"</li> <li>Commands to hurt/kill themselves. </li> <li>Seeing demons or dark characters. </li> <li>Seeing/smelling rotting flesh on their body. </li> </ul>
<a>subconscious</a>'s way of trying to correct the depressed mood.
<p>Diagnostic protocol dictates that we not only note if psychotic features are present, but also if they are mood-congruent or incongruent.</p>
<h3>Assessing for hallucinations</h3>

<p>This is important because, if hallucinations (and/or delusions) are reported as occurring regularly regardless of mood, then it could be more indicative of a schizophrenia-spectrum condition called schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>In the end, there is no need to panic if someone says they hear voices. Many people do and have learned to manage them well, even sans medications. Exploring that further is part of our job as treatment providers.</p>
<p>A delusion is a fixed, false belief that is held with conviction. In other words, even if everyone else knows the belief is not true, the patient is convinced of it. Some examples of mood-congruent delusions include:</p>
<li>The patient is not sure if they are alive or dead. This is called a nihilistic delusion.</li>
<li>They feel they are such a bad person that they deserve <a>punishment</a> and people are plotting to destroy them; a sort of <a>paranoia</a>.</li>
<li>They come to believe they're an evil entity or are possessed.</li>

<h2> A beginner’s guide to Cotard’s Syndrome </h2>
<p> Posted October 17, 2014 </p>
<div><div><div><div><p>Jules Cotard</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>Recently, Hans Debruyne and colleagues wrote an excellent review of CS in a 2011 issue of Mind and Brain, and wrote what they believed is a “classical description” of CS:</p>
<a>anxious</a> state gradually augments and can result in nihilistic delusions where
<a>denial</a> of life or denial of body parts are the prominent features. The patient loses sense of reality. Despite the delusion of being dead, these patients show an increased tendency to automutilation or
<a>suicidal</a> behavior. Additional symptoms may include analgesia and mutism. The core symptoms always reflect a preoccupation with
<a>guilt</a>, despair, and death”.
<p>In the same 2011 review, the authors examined all the epidemiological studies and summarized the findings:</p>
<a>psychiatric</a> patients having Cotard’s syndrome. Using the same methodology they found also 0.11% (n=1) having Cotard’s syndrome in a sample of neurological patients with mental disturbances”.
<p>• The Psychotic Depression type includes individuals with melancholia and a few nihilistic delusions.</p>
<p>• The Cotard Type I includes individuals with no depression or other disease and comprises a “pure” CS whose nosology is closer to delusional disorders (rather than the affective disorders).</p>
<p>• The Cotard Type II includes individuals with anxiety, depression and auditory hallucinations and comprise a mixed group.</p>

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Psychopharmacology</h1> <p>Medication</p> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Psychopharmacology is the study of substances that influence mental states. Such agents induce changes in mood, sensation, thinking, or behavior, and may be derived from plants or other natural sources or chemically synthesized in a laboratory. </p>
<a>psychosis</a>. It also includes agents that relieve acute and
<a>chronic pain</a>, and others that curb
<a>insomnia</a> and facilitate sleep.
<p>While some psychoactive agents play an important role in reducing the suffering of those with illness, others, such as “smart drugs,” are of increasing interest for enhancing mental capabilities in healthy people. </p>
<h2> The Major Types of Psychoactive Drugs </h2>
<a>antidepressants</a> and antipsychotics, or by their chemical makeup. Examples of the latter include opioids, often prescribed for pain relief, and benzodiazepines, often given to relieve panic and other
<div> <h3> What are anxiolytics? </h3> </div>
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions, and drugs that relieve anxiety in its many forms, from social
<div> <h3> What do stimulants do? </h3> </div>
<a>attention</a> and mental focus in people with
<a>ADHD</a>. Caffeine is also a central
<a>nervous system</a> stimulant and may be
<a>the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world</a>, consumed in beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola drinks.
<div> <h3> What do antidepressants do? </h3> </div>
<a>Depression</a> is a complex disorder, affecting many systems of the body and brain, and there is considerable debate on whether antidepressants work and for whom. They can take at least four weeks to have an effect, restoring
<a>motivation</a>, and otherwise re-energizing sufferers. There is evidence that effective antidepressants stimulate the
<a>growth of nerve cells in the brain</a>, creating new pathways of cognitive and behavioral flexibility.
<div> <h3> What are “smart drugs?” </h3> </div>
<a>nootropics</a> often used by students to boost academic performance,

<h2> The Role of Drug Treatment in Mental Disorders </h2>
<a>psychosis</a>, many mental health disturbances respond to treatment with drugs. Agents with sedating effects are widely used to combat
<a>insomnia</a> and help people fall asleep or maintain sleep, a major contributor to overall physical and mental health.
<div> <h3> How effective is medication? </h3> </div>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, medication is the only way of controlling symptoms, and treatment must be continued indefinitely to
<div> <h3> Is medication more effective than psychotherapy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is there so much controversy about drug treatment for mental health conditions? </h3> </div>
<a>The controversy</a> may largely reflect the lingering stigma attached to mental health problems and related fears that brain-based medications will alter fundamental attributes of personality; they don’t.
<h2> How Psychoactive Agents Work </h2>
<div> <h3> How do antipsychotic agents reduce hallucinations and delusions? </h3> </div>
<a>dopamine</a> is thought to be responsible for the
<div> <h3> Why are stimulants used to curb hyperactivity? </h3> </div>
<a>dopamine </a>and norepinephrine to make them more available. The increased neurotransmitter, in turn, bolsters communication with brain areas responsible for such
<a>executive functions</a> as the regulation of attention.
<div> <h3> What are common side effects of psychoactive drugs? </h3> </div>
<div> More people have experienced increased anxiety recently, and found relief with a pharmaceutical intervention. There may be a significant side effect, though. </div>

<div> <div> <p>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) occurs when a severe jolt or blow to the head leads to brain damage. It can also result when an object, such as a bullet or shrapnel, pierces the brain.</p> </div> </div>

<h2> What Is Traumatic Brain Injury? </h2>
<div> <h3> How common are TBIs? </h3> </div>
<a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a> The number of TBIs increased by 53 percent between 2006 and 2014. In 2019, there were 61,000 TBI-related deaths.
<div> <h3> What are the signs of a concussion? </h3> </div>
<p>Concussions are often overlooked or misdiagnosed, but early recognition is key to recovery. <a>According to the CDC,</a> signs of a concussion include: </p>
<p>• Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>• Sensitivity to light and sound</p>
<p>• Problems with attention, concentration, memory, and brain fog</p>
<p>• Atypical <a>anxiety</a>, irritability, or sadness</p>
<p>• Atypical sleep patterns or difficulty falling asleep</p>
<div> <h3> How is a TBI diagnosed? </h3> </div>
<a>cognition</a>, and memory. They may take a blood test to identify proteins that are often elevated after a head injury. Diagnosis can be difficult because it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish between
<a>TBI and other conditions such as post-traumatic stress.</a>
<div> <h3> What is Post-Concussion Syndrome? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does a head injury change the brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some commonly overlooked causes of concussion and TBI? </h3> </div>
<a>Domestic abuse</a>, falling on the stairs or around the house, falling outside such as slipping on ice, and injuries sustained during natural disasters
<a>can also lead to concussions.</a>

<h2> How a Head Injury Can Change Behavior </h2>
<div> <h3> Can TBI lead to mental illness? </h3> </div>

<a>Anger management strategies</a> can help address these challenges and repair relationships after a TBI.
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between a concussion and CTE? </h3> </div>
<h2> Treatment, Recovery, and Coping Skills </h2>
<p>It's important to seek medical attention for any head injury, even if there are no immediately apparent symptoms. (Brain swelling may take hours or longer to manifest.)</p>
<div> <h3> What are best practices for treating TBI? </h3> </div>
<p>Medical professionals can adhere to guidance that can increase the chances of a successful recovery. This includes: </p>
<p>1. Neuroprotection through restorative interventions: stabilizing the brain immediately after the injury through measures such as rest at home or managing blood pressure, sedation, and ventilation at the hospital. </p>
<p>2. Understanding the natural history of the recovery process for each individual: tracking and personalizing the recovery process rather than treating patients indiscriminately.</p>
<p>3. Implementing the appropriate therapeutic modality throughout injury and recovery: introducing interventions such as medication and rehabilitative therapies.</p>
<p>5. Implement an appropriate rehabilitation process: rehabilitation may include working to restore previous functions, compensating when function can’t be restored, or adapting the person’s environment.</p>
<div> <h3> What prevents people from seeking treatment for a TBI? </h3> </div>
<a>TBI can recover properly</a>.
<div> <h3> What are the emotional consequences of a TBI? </h3> </div>
<a>identity</a>, ranging from confusion and dizziness to the inability to walk or control bowel movements. The
