<div><h1>The battle to prevent another Jan. 6 features a new weapon: The algorithm</h1></div>
<h2>A year after the attack on the Capitol, data scientists say artificial intelligence can help forecast insurrection — with some big concerns</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>For many Americans who witnessed the attack on the Capitol last Jan. 6, the idea of mobs of people storming a bedrock of democracy was unthinkable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the data scientists who watched it unfold, the reaction was a little different: We’ve been thinking about this for a long time.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>that predicts the likelihood of coups and electoral violence for dozens of countries each month.
<div><p>Election misinformation soared to 10,000 posts per day in Facebook groups before Jan. 6</p></div>
<div><p>Another group, the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location Event Data Project, or ACLED, also monitors and predicts crises around the world, employing a mixed-method approach that relies on both machine-learning and software-equipped humans.</p></div>
<div><p>Biden White House concludes Jan. 6 preparations hurt by lack of high-level intelligence sharing</p></div>
<div><div><p>“For the 2024 election God knows we absolutely need to be doing this,” said Sheldon Himelfarb, chief executive of PeaceTech. “You can draw a line between data and violence in elections.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many of the models, for instance, find income inequality not to be correlated highly with insurrection; drastic changes in the economy or climate are more predictive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And paradoxically social-media conflict is an unreliable indicator of real-world unrest. (One theory is that when violence is about to take place, many people are either too busy or too scared to unleash screeds online.)</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bellish and other skeptics also point to a troubling consequence: Prediction tools could be used to justify crackdowns on peaceful protests, with AI used as a fig leaf. “It’s a real and scary concern,” Powell said.</p></div>
<div><p>Opinion: Polling on Jan. 6 shows the vast majority of Americans aren’t crazy</p></div>
<b> </b> He imagines a very slow transition to these models.
<div><div><p>“I don’t think we’ll have this in wide use by January 6, 2025,” he added. “We should, because the technology is there. But it’s an adoption issue.”</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Law enforcement agencies failed to heed mounting warnings about violence on Jan. 6</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security — two agencies central to domestic terrorism — have shown fewer signs of adopting these models.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>As U.S. pushes a shift toward electric cars, where should the chargers go?</h1></div>
<h2>The Biden administration sees the plug-in network as critical groundwork for cutting carbon emissions.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael Laris</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Depeswar Doley has come up with a quip for the confused, and sometimes irked, drivers who stop by his longtime gas station while trying to buy gas.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Compared with a new bridge or long-needed transit connection, the infrastructure enabling electric cars receives little attention, but the Biden administration sees the plug-in network as critical groundwork for cutting carbon emissions.</p></div>
<div><p>White House details push to make electric vehicle chargers ‘ubiquitous’</p></div>
<div><div><p>“You cannot separate transportation from energy when it comes to the electric-vehicle future of this country,” Buttigieg said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The administration’s goal is 500,000 new chargers, with an emphasis on disadvantaged and rural areas, as well as efforts to improve local air quality and promote equity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In the early days, you will see gas stations with both types of fueling operations,” Granholm said, adding that more stations like Doley’s will convert to electric-only as the U.S. fleet goes electric.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Doley makes more money fixing cars than charging them, and he has told his mechanics they should prepare for a future when electric vehicles, which are cheaper to maintain, are ubiquitous. But it will be a while, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Fossil fuels are not going to disappear that fast,” Doley said. “I have a feeling another 20, 25 years, they’re still going to be around.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden calls for half of new cars to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030</p></div>
<div><p>“Some places it’s already profitable to put in chargers. Some places it’s not. But we need to make sure that we have a full network, and that’s where policy can make all the difference,” Buttigieg said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>To boost those numbers, the administration backed $12,500 incentives for electric-car buyers as part of a climate and social policy bill, although that far-reaching budget legislation has stalled.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In Maryland, where Vice President Harris traveled in December to push electrification efforts, transportation officials said they expect to receive about $63 million from the infrastructure bill for charging and other fueling initiatives.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Virginia expects to receive about $100 million to “address a key concern of drivers about EVs — availability of places to charge vehicles,” according to a statement from the office of Gov. Ralph Northam (D).</p></div></div>
<div><p>Infrastructure deal pares back highway removal plan but cracks open door to greener transportation system</p></div>
<div><div><p>As federal and state officials shape charging plans, outside experts say a key goal should be guaranteeing federally subsidized chargers are placed where they will bring the broadest social benefit.</p></div></div>
<a>metrics </a>such as income and air quality, not just the density of chargers along busy highways.
<div><div><p>Done the wrong way, “subsidies can just accelerate the way things were going to go,” Schewel said, which would mean putting too much focus on busy locations used by early adopters.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Twitter has a confusing new policy on what images you can post. Here’s what you need to know. </h1></div>
<h2>People aren’t allowed to post photos without consent — except sometimes, they are</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tatum Hunter</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 1, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>

<div><div><p>Speculation ran wild. Is it okay to share images of crowds at sporting events, people asked in replies to the announcement? What about videos of abusive behavior? And what exactly falls within the public interest?</p></div></div>
<a>stepped down</a> this week after years of decreasing involvement in the company’s day-to-day operations, according to insiders.
<a>New CEO Parag Agrawal</a> will lead the company as it
<a>tests new products</a> and policies.
<div><p>In a surprise tweet, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he’s stepping down</p></div>
<b> </b>expansion of Twitter’s private information policy — which prohibits posting private information such as phone numbers and addresses without permission — made some people angry. But mostly it just made everyone confused.
<p>“This policy is not very clear. We don’t know what is okay and what isn’t okay,” Sterling said. “This is clearly a test run that they’re doing, but it’s not a test run that they really thought out.”</p>
<div><div><p>Here’s what we know about the policy so far.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No. In this case, consent will be implied unless that person or someone authorized to act on their behalf reports the photo or video, according to Twitter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>When does Twitter say it will leave up photos and videos without the subject’s consent?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will Twitter take down videos of police officers on duty?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I share images of abuse or harassment without the alleged perpetrator’s consent?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kennedy said abuse and harassment are considered newsworthy, so images of alleged abusers or harassers would not be taken down.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I share screenshots of private conversations?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, unless they contain private information such as phone numbers, physical addresses or email addresses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I share images of protesters?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Is sharing someone’s contact information without their consent always against the rules?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>No. If that information is available publicly online, Twitter no longer considers it private information. Physical addresses, biometric information, financial information and identification documents are exceptions to this, the company says.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What happens to people who violate the policy?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do I report a photo or video I don’t want to be shared?</div></h3></div></div>

<div><div><p>If you’ve already started your holiday shopping, there’s a pretty good chance there are at least a few gadgets on your list. And at least a few of them are probably for you.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A report published by the Consumer Technology Association last month predicted that Americans would spend $142.5 billion on tech this holiday season, mostly as gifts for themselves. (Loved ones like spouses were a close second.)</p></div>

<p>Welcome to the last Technology 202 of 2021! It’s hard to believe I’m nearing 80 editions since joining you in August. Thanks so much to all of you who have read and subscribed. We wish you the happiest of holiday seasons. </p>
<div><div><p>Below, we give you our year-in-review and preview looming battles. First, I wanted to highlight some of our favorite newsletter editions from the past few months:</p></div></div>
<li>On Aug. 17, we broke down how the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan posed a unique challenge for social media companies.</li>
<li>On Oct. 21, we analyzed the major disparities in which tech companies get hauled in to testify on Capitol Hill.</li>
<li>On Oct. 26, we showed in our own Facebook Papers investigation what the company knew about the risks of microtargeting.</li>
<li>On Nov. 9, we dove into why Parler and Gettr are finding a budding fan base among Brazil's far-right.</li>
<li>On Nov. 18, we highlighted why senators mispronouncing nominees' names is becoming more glaring as the government diversifies.</li>
<div><div><p>There's much more to come in 2022. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Big Tech critics mustered their forces in 2021</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are the six key moments that shaped digital policymaking in 2021 — and how they set the stage for more high-stakes skirmishes on the horizon:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Jan. 6 posed an unprecedented test for social media</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden’s FTC, DOJ picks foreshadow tougher tech enforcement</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet while Biden went big with his picks in 2021, their plans to rein in industry giants are likely just beginning. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Lawmakers’ antitrust push gained steam but has a long way to go</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Moving forward, it remains an open question if Congress will be able to cohere around legislation, despite bipartisan agreement on the need to rein in Big Tech,” Weissman said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Congress made a huge investment in broadband, but big hurdles remain</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>After months of negotiations, President Biden in November signed into law a major infrastructure package that set aside billions to build out the nation’s digital infrastructure and boost Internet access nationwide. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as my colleague Cat Zakrzewski reported, outdated federal maps showing who actually needs more funding stand in the way of turning those ambitions into improved connectivity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Europe paved the way for its massive new tech proposals</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Europe has cemented its leading role driving the tech policy agenda,” said Givens.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Whistleblower’s disclosures prompt ire, but so far not much else</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Weissman said her disclosures “showed not only the severity of harms inflicted by Facebook, but the corporation’s awareness of those harms and intentional decisions not to mitigate them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet with little legislative or regulatory action to show for it so far, like much of the activity that began or gained momentum in 2021, we may just be seeing the tip of the iceberg.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>A Utah company says it revolutionized truth-telling technology. Experts are highly skeptical.</h1></div>
<h2>Is the ocular product EyeDetect a leap ahead of the polygraph? Or just the same dubiousness in a more high-tech box? </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 15, 2021|Updated November 15, 2021 at 5:41 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The judge agreed, and five of the 12 jurors wound up voting not to convict. A mistrial was declared.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Its critics, however, say the EyeDetect is just the polygraph in more algorithmic clothing. The machine is fundamentally unable to deliver on its claims, they argue, because human truth-telling is too subtle for any data set.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And they worry that relying on it can lead to tragic outcomes, like punishing the innocent or providing a cloak for the guilty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>EyeDetect raises a question that draws all the way back to the Garden of Eden: Are humans so wired to tell the truth we’ll give ourselves away when we don’t?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And to a more 21st-century query: Can modern technology come up with the tools to detect those tells?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An EyeDetect test has a subject placed in front of a monitor with a digital camera and, as with the polygraph, lobbed generically true-false queries like “have you ever hurt anybody” to establish a baseline.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But experts say such logic may not have much basis in science.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like most renowned experts, he has not reviewed EyeDetect’s research specifically. But, he says, “I don’t know of any evidence that eye movements are linked to deception.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When it comes to the polygraph, experts have a long history of declaring failure.</p></div></div>
<a>denied </a>federal criminal defendants had a constitutional right to them.
<p>“It’s the imprimatur that’s the issue. We tend to believe that where there’s science involved it’s reliable,” said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, who has studied the issue.</p>
<div><div><p>She said she was concerned that people wouldn’t get clearances for jobs or would otherwise be held accountable for things they did not do because of false positives. She noted it also could help the guilty get away.</p></div></div>
<a>functional MRI</a>, which posited that blood flow to the brain could hold the key to truth detection, enjoyed a period of buzz. But the device largely
<a>did not meet scientific standards, </a>and cost and intensiveness further inhibited broad adoption.
<a>P300 guilty-knowledge test</a> championed by the longtime Northwestern University professor
<a>Peter Rosenfeld,</a> who asserted that the future of truth detection lay in brain waves, gained some enthusiasm from the scientific community. It was the subject of
<a>more than a dozen outside journal articles</a>, many encouraging, and has won the tentative support of
<a>Henry Greely,</a> a Stanford Law School professor who is one of the leading experts on technology and the law. Among other advantages, it involves an EEG, which is fairly cheap and easy to use.
<a>died</a> last winter without the method catching on. The work is continued by his lab, which has done much of the research on the P300, and can count respected legal minds like
<a>John Meixner,</a> an assistant U.S. attorney in Michigan, as past researchers and proteges of Rosenfeld’s.
<div><p>On a recent afternoon, Mickelsen sat in his office in the technology corridor of Lehi, Utah, and, over Zoom, coolly screen-shared a series of graphs and charts to make the case why EyeDetect is different from failed past technologies.</p></div>
<b> </b>The rate at which the machine will then correctly predict a person’s truth-telling status — Converus researchers already know the right answer for each subject —
<b> </b>is between 83 percent and 87 percent, according to the test results, the company says.
<div><div><p>EyeDetect has won its supporters in the field. Law-enforcement customers laud the system as smoother than a traditional polygraph.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stanford’s Greely says EyeDetect doesn’t dislodge his broader skepticism about truth-telling tech, either.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I see no reason to believe that this works well or, really, at all,” he said in an email. “Show me large, well-designed impartial studies and I’ll be interested.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He also noted a lack of published research by people not affiliated with Kircher or his lab.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kircher says the Defense Department is currently conducting a study of ocular technologies that he hopes will conclude by the summer. A Pentagon spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said studies showed juries do not overly rely on these technologies, but instead include them as one factor among many.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, the odds of this moving from realms like hiring to mainstream courtrooms are slim. Plato said the eye is the window to the soul. He was silent on whether it was a ticket out of jail.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>All this money pouring into infrastructure should be a boon for high-speed rail, right? Not so fast.</h1></div>
<h2>With many projects underway, the transit innovation’s time could come. It just will be a bumpy road to get there.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 18, 2021|Updated November 19, 2021 at 11:26 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>On the surface, the federal government’s newfound commitment to infrastructure would seem like a boost for that grand elusive transit innovation of our time: high-speed rail.</p></div></div>
<a>benighted Los Angeles-San Francisco high-speed line</a>, or the
<a>stalled Texas bullet, </a>or even the in-progress One Florida dream of a
<a>Miami-Orlando-Tampa route.</a>
<div><div><p>It won’t.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This package is not the silver bullet for the bullet,” said Colleen Callahan, deputy director of UCLA’s <a>Luskin Center for Innovation.</a> “We won’t see much of it go to high-speed rail.”</p></div></div>
<a>slightly</a> brisker Northeast Acela route. But given how many
<a>problems on its traditional lines need addressing</a> — and that owning the tracks is what allows you to jet down them in the first place — no one is banking on it.
<div><div><p>The move is a blow to those with plans to overhaul American mobility. But with a slew of projects underway around the country, that doesn’t mean it won’t ultimately happen — it just will be a very long battle.</p></div></div>
<p>“High-speed rail is a chance to write a new history for America,” Andy Kunz, leader of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, a D.C. trade group, said in an interview Wednesday, his enthusiasm undulled by the lack of fresh dollars.</p>
<i>autonomous</i> trains capable of hitting 200 mph. And in Europe, Spain has tricked out its high-speed rail with
<a>the latest in automated signaling</a> so that train cars can communicate with each other as easily as
<b> </b>two retirees at a diner.
<p>Japan, which built the first bullet trains in the 1960s, is <a>now experimenting</a> with “Maglev” (magnetic levitation), a controversial but still intriguing tech in which trains top 350 mph with their wheels four inches in the air.</p>

<div><div><p>In June, a version of the infrastructure bill actually had <a>an HSR clause</a> — $25 billion that could have jump-started a whole bunch of projects. But it didn’t survive the congressional back-and-forth.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Still, there are reasons to believe HSR momentum is building. Supporters say the underlying logic of high-speed rail is not only sound but getting stronger in the age of climate activism.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“High-speed rail promotes sustainable development with walkable downtown and urban communities that young people all over want,” Moulton said in an interview. “Single-occupancy vehicles promote the opposite.”</p></div>

<a>told</a> a crowd at a Scranton, Pa., trolley museum that HSR “will take literally millions of automobiles off the road, saving tens of millions of barrels of oil … This is not hyperbole. This is a fact.” There’s a $10 billion
<a>clause</a> for HSR in the current House version of the Build Back Better Act; if the clause makes it through and the bill passes, it would provide a huge boost to many projects.

<p>While the public may have been surprised by what happened on Jan. 6, the makings of the insurrection had been spotted at every level, from one side of the country to the other. The red flags were everywhere.</p>
<li>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</li>
<li>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</li>
<li>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</li>
<li>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</li>

<p>Intelligence officials certainly never envisioned a mass attack against the government incited by the sitting president.</p>
<p>When that failed, he turned his focus to Jan. 6, historically a pro forma ritual by Congress.</p>
<p>His words triggered rapid action by angry supporters who made plans to go to the nation’s capital, fusing together in a dangerous call-and-response.</p>
<p>Come to Washington, Trump tweeted to his supporters on the Saturday before Christmas, issuing a clarion call for them to gather and protest on Jan. 6: “Be there, will be wild!”</p>
<div><div><p>His supporters immediately responded on the pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win under a thread titled “TRUMP TWEET. DADDY SAYS BE IN DC ON JAN. 6TH.”</p><div>2</div></div></div>
<p>Trump primed his base to view Pence as either a would-be hero or villain, depending on the path the vice president took.</p>
<p>“I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” he declared at a rally in Georgia two days before the joint session, adding: “If he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him as much.”</p>
<p>Trump’s supporters not only knew where the president wanted them to gather on Jan. 6. They knew whom to target.</p>
<p>Again and again, as the pivotal day approached, top law enforcement officials fielded warnings of what was to come, but failed to respond in kind.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power, new accounts reveal.</p>
<p>DHS said in a statement that it is participating in ongoing investigations about the security failings and “leveraging lessons learned to enhance its ability to prevent future acts of violence.”</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Defense Department “continues to cooperate with the Congress as they examine the events of that day.”</p>
<b> </b>bureau’s work leading up to Jan. 6 as proactive and aggressive. In interviews and statements, they insisted much of the alarming online chatter
<b> </b>agents saw was largely “aspirational” and therefore protected First Amendment free speech — not the detailed evidence of planning needed to launch an investigation or foresee a mass attack on the Capitol.
<p>In a statement, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich disputed The Post’s investigation as “fake news” and falsely cast people who entered the Capitol that day as “agitators not associated with President Trump.”</p>
<h3><div>102 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The violent events of Jan. 6 had been months in the making.</p>
<p>Trump’s first allusion to the notion that Congress could determine the winner of the presidential race came more than a month before voters went to the polls, on Sept. 26, at a rally outside Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p>While the line didn’t register in Harrisburg, congressional Democrats in Washington took note.</p>
<p>Trump’s remark in Pennsylvania confirmed Democratic suspicions. The next day, Pelosi sent a letter to her caucus revealing that a backup plan was already underway.</p>
<p>“The Constitution says that a candidate must receive a majority of the state delegations to win,” Pelosi wrote. “We must achieve that majority of delegations or keep the Republicans from doing so.”</p>
<p>Three days after the Harrisburg rally, Trump made a more menacing declaration at the first presidential debate.</p>
<p>Biden pressed Trump to specifically condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for street brawls with liberal protesters. When Wallace sought an answer, Trump said, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.”</p>
<p>On Parler, the social media network popular with conservatives and hate groups, the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, responded almost immediately:</p>

<p>As Trump made misleading and false claims warning about voter fraud, Hodgkins grew concerned. He had never heard of tactics like “vote harvesting” or seen so much voting by mail.</p>
<p>“Previous elections we didn’t have that kind of thing go on,” he said.</p>
