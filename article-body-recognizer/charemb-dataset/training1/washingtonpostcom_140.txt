<p>After pulling countless trailers of grain across the country during the pandemic, Mike Nichols’s truck was, at last, sitting still.</p>
<p>Parked at the shop, it needed a routine part — a length of aluminum tubing — just as the trucking industry was gripped by a parts shortage.</p>
<p>“Even the supply chain is affected by the supply chain,” said Nichols, 54, as he waited at his home in central Wisconsin. “It’s a week without revenue, so that hurts. But you need breaks, too, now and then.”</p>
<p>When truck traffic dipped in 2020, he had kept rolling, crisscrossing the country with 25-ton loads of grain. Corn from Iowa. Rice from Arkansas. Malted barley from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Yet now, trucks are crowding the interstates, heavy with the goods fueling a pandemic consumer binge.</p>
<p>Nichols has logged about 2.5 million miles without an accident since he began driving in the 1980s. More than ever, though, he feels the stress of crowded roads ­— a big rig to the left of him, to the right, behind him.</p>
<div><div><p>Nichols carries grain on his long hauls through the Midwest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nichols checks the map during a stop in Iowa.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An attendant walks to Nichols's truck while he waits to have his tank washed in Cedar Rapids.</p></div></div>
<p>On the biggest lot, he soon got stuck in a futile cul-de-sac of trucks. He had to back out. “They were in there like cordwood,” he said.</p>
<p>The second lot was smaller and also crowded with more vehicles than spaces. With his ELD ticking toward a break violation, he didn’t bother to check the third lot.</p>
<p>“You work all day, putting in 14 hours, and then you have to worry about where you are going to park your bed,” he said. “It’s almost like being homeless.”</p>
<p>His rig, recently purchased for $195,000, is set up with a microwave, fridge and bed. Its mud flaps read “Don’t tread on me.” His late wife’s name is painted across the back.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Since it was first detected in southern Africa late last year, the highly contagious coronavirus variant has sparked restrictions on business activity in several countries.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, confounding, overheating economy of 2021</p></div>
<div><p>“The mood in the market is that it’s not going to be that big a deal economically,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. “The hope is it’ll be over in a month.”</p></div>
<div><p>More than 1,700 flights canceled Wednesday as airlines' problems persist.</p></div>
<div><p>Tracking U.S. covid-19 data</p></div>
<div><div><p>With omicron threatening, the hotel limited attendance to 15 to 20 percent of capacity and sent non-guests home at 11 p.m., said Adam Zembruski, program director for Hospiamo, an adviser to the Horton’s owners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, four out of the hotel’s roughly 25 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and managers are eyeing additional restrictions if needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an everyday conversation. We could close the bars. We talked about that just last night,” he said earlier this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the virus poses an acute problem for businesses that deal with the public, manufacturers also are crafting new strategies to keep their machines turning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Business is good at J.V. Manufacturing, a die and component maker in Natrona Heights, Pa. As orders flooded in over the past year, the company added about 40 new employees, taking its payroll to 137 workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the company is considering an increased push for robotics and digitization to make production less vulnerable to missing workers, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I definitely think it’s here to stay,” she said of the virus. “It’s just about finding a way to balance it, finding what risks are worth taking and what risks aren’t worth taking.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There aren’t more people to come to help right now,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a Made-in-the-USA supply chain crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>Elsewhere, executives worry about a possible resurgence of global <a>supply chain bottlenecks</a> triggered by harsh coronavirus clampdowns in China, where the government maintains a “zero-covid” policy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The greatest risk to the U.S. economy is how non-U.S. governments choose to respond to it,” said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist for Manulife Investment Management.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company purchased scores of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, and spread its workers across two shifts in a bid to avoid infections. Later, it added air-quality monitors and filtration devices to meet a shifting threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, Habco went months before seeing its first worker test positive and had only a handful idled before omicron appeared. In the past few weeks, more employees tested positive as the variant ran wild in Connecticut.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re doing everything we can to protect our employees,” he said. “My concern is more what I can’t control.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Habco’s production depends upon a number of local parts suppliers. If just one or two of their workers are taken ill, it might paralyze their production of critical components, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Habco gave employees plenty of time to deal with family responsibilities. But as the virus appears to be evolving into a less lethal form, Montanari wonders how long that stance can be sustained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve got a business to run,” he said. “I’ve got customers who need product and they don’t care about my employees’ child-care problems.”</p></div></div>

<header><div><div><div>INVISIBLE</div></div></div><h1>This tree has stood here for 500 years. Will it be sold for $17,500?</h1></header>
<div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Juliet Eilperin</div></div></span></div></span></div><div><span><div><span><div><div>Photos and video by Salwan Georges</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 30, 2021</div></div>
<p>This mammoth tree plays an outsize role in the Tongass National Forest, which holds the equivalent of 9.9 billion tons of CO2 — nearly twice what the United States emits from burning fossil fuels each year.</p>
<p>Walking around its 15-foot-wide base, Marina Anderson, the Organized Village of Kasaan’s tribal administrator, pointed out a plethora of plants her ancestors, the Haida and Tlingit peoples, have used over the centuries.</p>
<p>The spruce’s fortunes as ever, are bound in the politics of timber and climate change thousands of miles away in Washington D.C. Its blue death mark might as well be a question mark: Is this tree worth more to us alive? Or dead?</p>
<p>Anderson knows what her answer is.</p>
<h3><b>A seed takes root</b></h3>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 282 parts per million.</p>
<p>When the United States bought Alaska from Russia on Oct. 18, 1867 — over the objections of the Tlingit — it had more to do with asserting U.S. influence in the Pacific than commandeering the riches of its forests.</p>
<p>Soon enough, officials such as J.W. White, a captain in the U.S. Revenue-Marine Service, began to eye Alaska’s trees, writing in 1876, “When the forests of Oregon and Washington are gone, Alaska will be our permanent supply.”</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 315 parts per million.</p>
<i>Antitrichia curtipendula</i> to the light-green lichens belonging to the genus Usnea, known more commonly as old man’s beard and witches’ hair, respectively.
<p>To harvest big trees more easily, however, the government had to build roads across Prince of Wales. In the mid-1960s it constructed one about 200 yards away from the old spruce, paving it with shot rock from a quarry.</p>
<p>For companies seeking to supply the growing market for paper and for rayon, made from cellulose, these large trees were ideal.</p>
<p>And Alaska Native corporations, the companies established in 1971 after receiving a small portion of their original homelands, also chopped down old growth. Within three decades, just a fraction still stood.</p>
<h3><b>A land for loggers</b></h3>
<p>Michael Kampnich, who grew up in dairy country in Upstate New York, found work as “a feller” in 1980 on Prince of Wales.</p>
<p> Scenes from the Tongass National Forest in July: Downtown Juneau, Alaska's capital; the shoreline of Prince of Wales Island; and visitors to Nugget Falls at the Mendenhall Glacier, near Juneau. </p>
<p>But others kept coming, especially as logging became more difficult in the Pacific Northwest. Keith Landers had worked in Oregon for two decades, taking the leftover timber for shingles, but the old growth was running out.</p>
<p>“It has to be old timber,” he explained. “I mean, we can cut second growth, but the people on the other end are not going to like it. It’s just not going to last.”</p>
<p>Landers was undeterred. He heard about a small mill for sale near Thorne Bay, and in 1994 decided it was time to move.</p>
<p>Public officials made it clear that they wanted loggers like Landers to reap the island’s bounty. A few years after his arrival, they paved the road running past the massive spruce to make it even easier to transport the giant logs.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what Ted Stevens is worried about,” the president remarked.</p>
<p>Barack Obama’s administration tried to forge a compromise, to shift over time to logging “young-growth” trees that were half-a-century old. But once Donald Trump was elected, it was clear the plan would be scrapped.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 405 parts per million. And the spruce on Prince of Wales faced the prospect of the ax once more.</p>
<h3><b>Reclaiming the forest</b></h3>
<p>By the time Jimmy Anderson died in 2014, attitudes about logging had begun to change. Marina emerged as the one who would uphold her family’s Haida and Tlingit traditions, reviving a way of life.</p>
<b> </b>to teach a group of Native teenagers how to spot plants ripe for picking.
<p>“It’s so hot,” she groused, twisting her long auburn hair into a bun and placing a broad-brimmed cedar hat atop her head.</p>
<p> Marina Anderson, a member of the Haida and Tlingit nations, teaches members of the Alaska Youth Stewards about foraging traditions like harvesting rice from the roots of chocolate lilies. </p>
<p>Walking through the forest, Anderson stopped to marvel at the power of old growth, the ancient trees above her, the rich and spongy ground beneath her feet.</p>
<p>The notion of cutting them down for high-end houses infuriates her.</p>
<p>“We have to stop,” she said. “There is not enough left for everybody, and we’re not going to let any go.”</p>
<b> </b>knowledge that draws on the resources of the forest, rivers and sea to withstand the disorienting present. The past, almost invisible now, provides a path forward.
<p>Her friend and colleague, wood carver Michael Chilton, hovered so closely to watch as his father carved wood that it amounted to an implicit ultimatum: “It was either teach me, or I’ll get myself cut.”</p>
<p>Chilton, now 30, began carving at the age of nine. His dad, now 56, had done the same, pestering his uncles as a kid in Juneau to teach him even the basics of the craft.</p>
<p>A tattoo on her rib cage captures one of her father’s favorite sayings: “Being Haida is not about the things that you do. Being Haida is about the way you do things.”</p>
<p> Wildlife and nature are a major driver of the economy in the Tongass, from tourism at the Mendenhall Glacier to whale watching off Juneau and fish processing in the city, as Martin Shelton unloads Taku River salmon for Yakobi Fisheries. </p>
<p>This is the sort of small-scale employment that Meredith Trainor, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, sees as sustaining the shift away from logging.</p>
<p>“The answer is that it’s many things that get stitched together,” Trainor said. “And that makes us safer.”</p>
<p>“Some of what they were saying, I saw it happening,” he said. “The conservationists were right.”</p>
<p>Kampnich knows that on Prince of Wales, many people are wary of stopping logging altogether. But he thinks there is room for small operators like Landers to stay in business.</p>
<h3><b>‘You want to hold on to that carbon’</b></h3>
<p>“Viking is a big supporter of the city of Craig,” he reminded them. “We provide them with heat for their middle school, and elementary and swimming pool. The reason we can do that is because we’ve got a high-value log.”</p>
<p>“You don’t force business into doing something different because it’s socially unacceptable,” Dahlstrom argued.</p>
<p> Viking Lumber Co. is the only major sawmill operating on Prince of Wales, near the town of Klawock. It focuses on harvesting old-growth trees. </p>
<p>But when Joe Biden won the presidency in November, it was clear the roadless rule would be back. And Forest Service officials on the ground, for their part, are exploring what the agency can do to support the economy beyond holding timber sales.</p>
<p>“They just see the timber,” she said. “They don’t see all the other projects.”</p>
<p> Scenes of logging operations in the Tongass National Forest, in July. Debris remains after clear-cutting on Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority land, while a truck carries timber from old-growth trees on a road through the forest. </p>
<p>“In a climate emergency, you want to hold onto that carbon, you don’t want to put it into the atmosphere,” DellaSala said. “You want to absorb it, but you want to hold onto it as well.”</p>
<p>The magnitude of the moment stunned her. Alaska’s ancient trees would be spared. And she rejoiced.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 412.5 parts per million and rising.</p>
<p>Several miles away, the battered crown of the spruce towered over the landscape. The blue death mark remained, but under the new policy, the timber sale that signaled its demise was canceled.</p>
<p>The venerable<b> </b>tree was safe. For now.</p>

<div><h1>For the first time in over 30 years, the EPA adds to its list of hazardous air pollutants</h1></div>
<h2>The move will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to curb the use of 1-bromopropane, a powerful dry-cleaning solvent linked to cancer</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dino Grandoni</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:22 p.m. EST|Updated today at 8:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It took over three decades, but the federal government finally expanded its list of chemicals too dangerous for Americans to breathe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By one.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that it took so long to add a single compound to a list Congress established in 1990 underscores the bureaucratic inertia that impedes any effort to protect Americans from harmful chemicals that businesses use every year.</p></div>
<p>“Putting it on the list was supposed to be easy,” said Adam M. Finkel, who used to direct the health standards programs at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and warned of the dangers of 1-bromopropane 20 years ago.</p>
<div><div><p>“I hate the term no-brainer, but this is a no-brainer,” he added. “It’s a toxic air pollutant, so it belongs on the list of toxic air pollutants.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here are Biden's new environmental policies</p></div>
<a>mercury</a> and lead — if it is “reasonably” anticipated to harm humans or the environment.
<div><div><p>The agency was supposed to make a decision within 18 months. But the delays spanned three presidencies.</p></div></div>
<p>Earthjustice senior attorney Tosh Sagar, whose group sued the EPA over the chemical, said its regulators “have trouble consistently following the law that Congress laid out in terms of protecting people” no matter who is president.</p>
<p>Obama administration officials didn’t draft a proposal approving the request until his last month in office, in 2017. The Trump administration <a>granted</a> the petition in 2020 but indefinitely delayed adding it to the hazardous list.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s taken them this long to act,” said Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Executive Director Faye Graul, whose members manufacture alternative chemicals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main lobbying arm in Washington, said they remain leery because the EPA has not yet said how it will curb the pollutant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The EPA is planning to propose a “regulatory infrastructure” for adding the chemical to the hazardous pollutant list this year, EPA spokesman Nick Conger said. It aims to finalize that rule by early 2023, he added.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>More than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021</h1></div>
<h2>As climate-fueled extreme weather intensified last year, more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. The impacts of fires and severe storms also spread.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Sarah Kaplan</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Andrew Ba Tran</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:05 p.m. EST|Updated today at 9:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes</a> in the suburbs of Denver. In between,
<b> </b>Americans suffered blistering heat waves, merciless droughts and monstrous hurricanes. People collapsed in farm fields and drowned in basement apartments; entire communities were obliterated by surging seas and encroaching flames.
<a>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, even before officials calculate the final toll of wildfires, drought and heat waves in the West.
<p>While the Federal Emergency Management Agency identified fewer climate-related disasters in individual counties last year, it declared eight of these emergencies statewide — the most since 1998 — encompassing 135 million people overall.</p>
<div><div><p>There is little doubt that the future will be worse. <a>Steadily rising temperatures</a> heighten the risk of wildfires, turbocharge rain storms, exacerbate flooding and intensify drought.</p></div></div>
<a>surged to near-record highs last year</a>. The Build Back Better bill, which contains the
<a> biggest clean energy investment in U.S. history</a>, stalled in Congress. The United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, produced pledges that put
<a>global average temperatures on track</a> to rise about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a degree of warming that would transform once unthinkable disasters into near-annual occurrences.
<p>2022 begins with two crucial questions still unanswered: Will the United States invest in ways to make extreme weather less destructive? And will the country lead the world in curbing warming before it becomes impossible for humanity to adapt?</p>
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>These questions loom over Louisville, Colo., Mayor Ashley Stolzmann, who lost much of her town to wildfire on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I lay awake the first night, not able to sleep from the fire, when I was evacuated from my house,” she said, “the first thing I thought of is: I need everyone to reduce their carbon emissions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado residents still reeling from mass shooting now contend with Marshall Fire disaster</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To lose whole neighborhoods is just so very sad and devastating and unexpected,” Stolzmann said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fires like that are not supposed to happen in densely populated suburbs. They’re not supposed to ignite in December, long after the first snows of the winter have usually fallen.</p></div></div>
<a>lasts more than a month longer</a> than it did four decades ago.
<div><p>“More people are living in more flammable landscapes,” said Chelsea Nagy, a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Earth Lab. “More people are going to be interfacing with disaster.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Post’s analysis of federal data shows that about 15 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced a declared fire disaster this year, a number that has been steadily increasing since 2018.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is a testament to the way climate change “has loaded the weather dice against us,” climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe said.</p></div></div>
<a>sickened fish and emptied wells</a>. In California, the Dixie Fire
<a>burned an area larger</a> than New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas combined. More than 90 percent of the United States west of the Rockies was in drought last year.
<div><p>The Post also analyzed heat wave data from roughly 7,500 NOAA temperature monitors across the nation, finding that 80 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced at least one day of abnormally high temperatures last year.</p></div>
<a>fluctuations in the polar vortex</a>, allowing tongues of cold air to lash out into lower latitudes. Other studies indicate that
<a>warmer winter temperatures</a> provided fuel for the late-season thunderstorms that gave rise to December’s twisters.
<div><div><p>“It’s such an outlier, we don’t have anything to compare it to. How do you put statistics on that?” Wehner said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet people can change even faster than the climate, Wehner said, giving the United States a chance to adapt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to build safety nets, a sense of belonging, a sense of shared space to deal with this,” she said. “It’s not only technical solutions.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, there are limits on people’s capacity to adapt, Wehner said, since disasters will become exponentially worse for every incremental increase in temperature.</p></div></div>

<div><p> Schoonschip was developed by a group of enthusiasts with a shared dream: to build a sustainable, close-knit community on the water. </p></div>
<p>Schoonschip, home to about 150 residents that includes some 40 kids, is made up of 46 households located on 30 arks. Half are floating semidetached homes, shared by two families. One has three generations of the same family.</p>
<div><p> De Blok, her partner Michiel Snijder and their twin daughters Ava (left in middle photo) and Tessel (right in middle photo) in their home at Schoonschip. </p></div>
<p>De Blok, who has no engineering, architecture or hydrological training, says that she never intended to spearhead a movement in floating urban development.</p>
<p>“Before I visited that boat, I wasn’t really conscious that I didn’t like the way I was living,” she says.</p>
<p>When she asked friends if they had interest in building a floating community, she was unprepared for the deluge of responses. She cut off the list at 120 people, disappointing dozens.</p>
<p>“The area was a disaster, really depressing. Just some companies, no streetlights,” De Blok recalls.</p>
<p>But when she got a look at the city’s plans to develop tens of thousands of housing units and cultural centers in the area, she thought, “We could be pioneers here.”</p>
<p>“When it’s dark and all the lights in the houses are on, it feels like a set from a film,” De Blok says.</p>
<p>The program is being monitored in collaboration with 15 European companies, universities and institutions, organized by the European Commission, which supports renewable energy experiments in the hopes of scaling them up across the continent.</p>
<div><p> Eelke Kingma, a resident and renewable tech expert, designed the smart grid system that allows him and his neighbors to collect, store and sell their own energy. </p></div>
<h3>Requests from all over the world</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, the floating-house movement has been gaining momentum in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Dutch government is amending home-owning laws to redefine floating homes as “immovable homes” rather than “boats,” to simplify the process of obtaining permits.</p>
<p>And as they expand, the initiators of Schoonschip and other floating neighborhoods, office buildings and event spaces across the Netherlands are increasingly being consulted for projects across the world.</p>
<p>“We want to upgrade cities near the water,” he says. “Now we’re at a tipping point where it’s actually happening. We’re getting requests from all over the world.”</p>
<p>In Schoonschip, De Blok says that she hopes everyone will have the opportunity to live on water one day.</p>
<p>“It does something to you, being aware that under your house everything is moving,” she says. “There’s some magic to it.”</p>

<h1>The record-breaking tornadoes that swept the United States, by the numbers</h1>
<h2>Tornadoes ripped through parts of the South and Midwest, leaving behind loss and destruction on a scale difficult to fathom. Here are the key numbers to know.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Washington Post Staff</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 13, 2021|Updated December 17, 2021 at 12:14 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>As rescue teams and volunteers combed through debris across nine states this weekend looking for survivors, the unprecedented scale of devastation left behind by the storm began to come into focus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In hardest-hit Kentucky, where multiple tornadoes touched down Friday night and into Saturday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said Monday that 74 deaths had been confirmed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Thousands of homes are damaged if not entirely destroyed,” Beshear said, “and it may be weeks before we have final counts on both deaths and levels of destruction.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both the human and economic costs of this 200-mile-long extreme weather event are still being tabulated. Here is a look at the devastation, by the numbers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>9</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>States impacted by the outbreak of tornadoes</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>How the rare and deadly December tornado outbreak unfolded</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tornadoes were also reported in Indiana, Alabama and Mississippi.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>88</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Deaths confirmed as of Monday</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reports of deaths from the storm have ranged widely. After initially estimating that as many as 100 people were likely killed in Kentucky, Beshear said Monday that state officials had confirmed 74 deaths.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With more than 100 Kentuckians unaccounted for as of Monday morning, Beshear said he expected the death toll would rise in the coming days and weeks as emergency workers continue to comb through the rubble.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Undoubtedly, there will be more,” he said. “We believe it will certainly be above 70, maybe even 80.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Authorities in other states are still trying to determine the total dead. At least six deaths have been reported in Illinois, two in Missouri, two in Arkansas and four in Tennessee.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Kentucky officials struggle to count the dead after tornado disaster</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The deadliest tornado event in December in modern U.S. history</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before this year, the highest number of tornado-related fatalities during the month of December was 49 deaths in 1953.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why the December tornado outbreak was something totally different</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>11</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>At 88 deaths, this storm ranks as the 11th deadliest tornado event in modern U.S. history</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The event, which has 88 confirmed deaths as of Monday, so far ranks as the 11th deadliest tornado day in modern U.S. history. If the death toll surpasses 100, the outbreak will become a top 10 deadly tornado day since 1950.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Until Friday, only a dozen days since 1950 have experienced more than 60 tornado-related deaths. Nine tornadoes have caused more than 100 fatalities in a single day.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Deadliest tornado in U.S. history hit the Midwest nearly a century ago</p></div>
<div><div><p>Friday’s event is almost certainly the deadliest since a tornado killed more than 150 in Joplin, Mo., on May 22, 2011.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>165.7</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The length in miles of the longest tornado track</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>The deadly path of how the tornadoes ripped through several states</p></div>
<a>1925 Tri-state Tornado</a> is generally accepted as producing the longest track on record at 219 miles, but it is unclear whether the same twister was on the ground for this entire path.
<div><div><h4><div>The life span of the storm in hours</div></h4></div></div>
<a>one analysis</a>. A typical supercell lasts about
<a>two hours</a>. A long-lived supercell may last for four hours or more.
<div><div><h3><div>128</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The speed of rotation in miles per hour</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>70 to 80</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Degrees marking record warm temperatures in the zone ravaged by tornadoes</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The warmth was supplied, in part, by record warm December waters in the Gulf of Mexico.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A warming world could add more fuel to tornadoes, scientists say</p></div>
<div><p>The exceptionally warm conditions fast-forwarded the atmosphere to conditions more typical of April, fueling the severity of the outbreak and raising questions about the possible role of human-caused climate change in the disaster.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>2</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The number of factory collapses responsible for fatalities from the tornadoes</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>59</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Tornadoes confirmed by the National Weather Service from Friday night to Saturday morning</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The unusually powerful storm slammed into parts of the Midwest and Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday, with the National Weather Service <a>confirming 59 tornadoes</a> in 9 states.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Weather Service also received <a>411 reports of severe winds</a> and 25 reports of large hail.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>149</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Tornado warnings issued over the course of 12 hours</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The disaster spurred the most tornado warnings on record from noon to midnight for December. The event also ranks third for the most tornado warnings in winter, trailing major outbreaks in January 1999 and February 2008.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eight of the issued warnings on Dec. 10 were tornado emergencies. Another 145 were severe thunderstorm warnings in areas where storms were not tornadic but still intense.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>30,000 feet</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The altitude that debris hurled by the storm reached in the air</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>The strongest of the tornadoes caved in roofs, crumbled walls and pulled up trees. All that debris had to go somewhere and, by some estimates, may have traveled more than 30,000 feet, or more than five and a half miles, into the air.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>750,000</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>From Arkansas to New York, the total number of customers without power in the aftermath Saturday</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the zone affected by tornadoes, more than 100,000 homes and buildings were without power Saturday evening, with the majority of the outages concentrated in hard-hit areas of western Kentucky.</p></div></div>
<a>transmission structures</a>, according to the Tennessee Valley Authority. This is the most debilitating hit on the power grid in the region since the “
<a>Super Outbreak</a>” of 2011.
<div><div><p>Work to assess how many homes and businesses have been completely destroyed, or are not safe to enter, is underway. At least 18 Kentucky counties have reported damage, Beshear said Monday.</p></div></div>
