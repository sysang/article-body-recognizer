<div>The White House is expected to announce support of the measure in a move to keep as many children in school as possible while preventing COVID-19 infection.</div>
<div> News CDC <a>Coronavirus</a> <a>Omicron</a></div>
<p>Dr. Eric Topol, the founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said that it was "reckless to proceed like this."</p>
<p>"Using a rapid test or some type of test to validate that the person isn't infectious is vital," he said, adding that there's "no evidence, no data to support this."</p>
<p>Still, the loosened recommendations have left some wary, especially amid the Omicron variant's rapid spread.</p>
<p>The CDC is "driven by the science, but they also have to be cognizant of the fact of, you know, what are they going to tell the public that they'll do," Mansky said. "That would undermine CDC if they had guidance that everybody was ignoring."</p>
<p>Qamara Edwards, director of business and events for Sojourn Philly, which owns four restaurants in Philadelphia, said about 15 percent of its employees are out sick with COVID-19, and staffing is tight.</p>
<p>The CDC changes are "great for businesses, they do allow people to return to work sooner than they've expected," Edwards said, though she understands why workers might be resistant and worried about their safety.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, King Holder, who runs the StretchLab Beverly fitness business, likewise said Omicron has caused "caused ample" to his company, and he welcomed the more relaxed guidelines.</p>
<p>"The possibility of five days compared to 10-14 days is huge for our business and allows us to stay afloat," he said.</p>
<p>Marshall Hatch, senior pastor of New Mount Pilgrim Church on Chicago's West Side, said he is bracing for some confusion in his congregation. The church has been a strong advocate for testing, vaccinations and booster shots.</p>
<p>Hatch said the CDC's latest guidance is confusing and "a little incongruous."</p>
<p>"Either we're in a surge that we need to take very seriously or are we winding down the pandemic and that's why we're shortening the isolation and quarantine times," he said Tuesday. "They might want to give us a little more information to go with."</p>
<p>Hatch said some members of the largely Black congregation, particularly senior citizens, are skeptical of information from the government.</p>
<p>The CDC move follows global efforts to adjust isolation rules, with policies differing from country to country.</p>
<p>England last week trimmed its self-isolation period for vaccinated people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to seven days in many cases, provided two negative lateral flow tests are taken a day apart.</p>
<p>The French government said Monday that it will soon relax its isolation rules, although by exactly how much isn't yet clear.</p>
<p>Health Minister Olivier Veran said the rule changes will be aimed at warding off "paralysis" of public and private services. By some estimates, France could be registering more than 250,000 new infections per day by January.</p>
<p>The U.S. airline industry applauded the CDC move.</p>
<p>"The decision is the right one based upon science," said the lobbying group Airlines for America.</p>
<p>But the head of a flight attendants union criticized the change, saying it could lead businesses to pressure sick employees to come back before they are well.</p>
<p>If that happens, "we will make clear it is an unsafe work environment, which will cause a much greater disruption than any 'staffing shortages,'" warned Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>Despite having a relatively high vaccination rate of 85 percent, Washington D.C. currently has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections across the country.</p>
<p>An analysis last updated on Monday by NPR using data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau shows that D.C. is averaging 169 cases per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>New York is experiencing the second-highest rate with 164 cases per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The D.C. region has seen a massive surge in infections over the last week, reporting an average of 1,192 new daily cases in the last seven days and a 555 percent increase over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Omicron's takeover as the most dominant strain in the U.S. comes at a time when vaccine efficacy has dropped and resulted in waning immunity even in Americans who have gotten their shots.</p>
<p>This means that while residents of the D.C. area may be less likely to suffer severe illness, hospitalization or death due to its 85 percent vaccination rate, the virus is still spreading rampantly among its population.</p>
<p>According to the city's government, more than 85 percent of residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine and nearly 67 percent have been fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>The nation's capital is also reported an estimated 2 percent of breakthrough cases.</p>
<p>The analysis cited D.C.'s relatively young population for its latest spike in cases.</p>
<p>Demographically, the city skews younger than the rest of the country with roughly 50 percent of D.C. residents being aged 20 to 49.</p>
<p>Patrons will be allowed to indicate that they've received only one of two doses when the order goes into effect but those requirements will change to a completed vaccine series beginning February 15.</p>

<p>A 2018 study may lend credence to what happens during the biological and irreversible death of the brain organ.</p>
<p>Jens Dreier, the study's lead author and a professor at the Center for Stroke Research Berlin, told Newsweek that brain death, which differs from dying in the wake of circulatory arrest, occurs during continued circulatory function.</p>
<p>Spreading depolarizations are associated with a tremendous influx of water into the neurons, he said, which causes them to swell. It can be destructive unless neurons have the energy to recover.</p>
<p>The current standard for recording spreading depolarizations is subdural electrodes implanted by the neurosurgeon, he added, clarifying that there are no systematic studies in do-not-resuscitate (DNR) patients.</p>
<p>"This leads to a significant worsening of patient outcome," he said. "Patients are usually in the ICU at this point and often in a coma."</p>
<p>Neuromonitoring of spreading depolarizations is increasingly performed in dedicated centers in North America, Europe and Japan, Dreier said. But, as the 2018 study shows, medical options remain limited and patients cannot always be saved.</p>
<p>Spreading depolarizations were discovered in animals by the Brazilian scientist Aristides Leão in 1944. Three years later, he found in the rabbit cortex that cerebral circulatory arrest leads to spreading depolarization.</p>
<p>"This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2 to 5 minutes after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury," the study stated.</p>
<p>The methodology employed by researchers involved performing recordings with either electrode strips or electrode arrays in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in the activation of a "Do Not Resuscitate–Comfort Care" order.</p>
