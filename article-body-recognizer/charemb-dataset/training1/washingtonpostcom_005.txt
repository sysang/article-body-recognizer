<div><div><p><i>Carolyn Hax is away. The following first appeared Oct. 7, 2007.</i></p></div></div>
<p><i>Her questions are: When did you first have sex? Younger than you are now. Did you ever smoke pot? Every day in high school under the big tree in front of the school. Have you ever had a one-night stand? More than I care to remember.</i></p>
<div><div><p><i>I know she has discussed having sex with her boyfriend, so this is a very important time to be as helpful as I can, but unfortunately my discomfort with my past doesn’t allow me to be as open as I want to be. HELP.</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Someday, you and your daughter might, and probably will, have a great conversation about those subtleties, and how you became who you are, and what that can mean for her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But apparently not now. Not until your hesitation gives way to a desire to be more forthcoming. That will be your best indication that the time has come to say more.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><i>Carolyn Hax is away. The following first appeared Sept. 23, 2007.</i></p></div></div>
<i> My mother-in-law is insisting she should be in the delivery room when my son is born. I don’t want extra people in the room, anyone other than my husband and my own mother. (I will be trying to do this drug-free.)</i>
<div><div><p><i>My husband feels as if he is between a rock and a hard place, since his mother and I are both adamant. But I think I get to choose, since I will be the one in labor.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>But I feel it is important to set some boundaries and not be manipulated. Do you think I am being unfair?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Va.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Va.: </b>I think I am chromosomally incapable of sympathizing with anyone who would bully her way into the delivery room of a woman who has said to her face that she isn’t wanted there.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Therefore, by extension, there’s no sympathy here for your husband, either, who is not between a rock and a hard place but between a sane and a stupid place. A bed and a couch place. A forehead and a hand place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he isn’t writing to me, so all I can do is encourage you to hold that boundary and to pass along my suggestion to your husband. Maybe with a bit more diplomacy.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 25, 2021|Updated December 25, 2021 at 12:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>BALTIMORE — NASA’s revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope is hurtling away from Earth and toward deep space on a long-awaited, high-risk mission that, if successful, will look deeper into the cosmic past than any telescope before.</p>
<div><div><p>The Webb blasted off Christmas morning from the European Space Agency’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on South America’s northeast coast, and early reports from NASA suggest the mission is going swimmingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though relieved by the successful launch, NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy acknowledged what everyone involved with the Webb knows: “We have some scary days ahead.”</p></div></div>
<a>long-delayed</a> successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. Officials had challenging discussions about launching on a holiday, and amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant of the
<a>coronavirus</a>, but decided to go on the first possible day. After two technical problems and one weather delay, that turned out to be Dec. 25.
<div><div><p>Melroy put a positive spin on it: “It’s not bad that it’s happening on Christmas Day, which should be a day of hope and inspiration.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early reports indicated that everything was “nominal” — precisely the space-jargon term that the thousands of people who have worked on the mission were hoping to hear on launch day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was a perfect ride to orbit,” announced Rob Navias, NASA’s launch commentator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There it is. There is your critical call. James Webb not only has legs, it has power,” Navias said. “Quite a Christmas present for the world’s astronomers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a news conference in Kourou after the successful launch, NASA science chief Thomas Zurbuchen highlighted that image of the telescope receding into space: “For me that picture will be burned into my mind forever.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More drama is coming, though.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The secondary mirror has to deploy, otherwise there’s nothing,” Hammel said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Melroy echoed that: “When we see things with a new lens, we gain new knowledge and new perspectives that can change fundamentally how we see the universe and how we see ourselves.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The journey to L2 will take about 29 days. Along the way, the Webb will undergo course corrections and critically important deployments of its hardware, including a sun shield the size of a tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After the sun shield opens up, NASA will send a command from Earth to unfold 18 gold-plated, hexagonal mirrors, which together will function as a 21-foot light bucket, nearly three times the diameter of the Hubble’s mirror.</p></div>
<div><div><p>This is a novel design, driven by ambitious scientific objectives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>NASA and its partners must overcome 344 potential single-point failures, according to an independent review board. That list began with launch, although the Ariane 5 has an excellent track record.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zurbuchen, who was in French Guiana for the launch, said last month that the agency has tested the telescope and its instruments thoroughly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve gone through every systematic analysis that we can think of,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is designed to see the oldest stars in the universe and scrutinize the formation of the earliest galaxies. It will also study the atmospheres of exoplanets that orbit stars in our galaxy.</p></div></div>
<a>Europa </a>and Saturn’s moon
<a>Enceladus</a>, both of which have geysers believed to signal the presence of subsurface oceans.
<div><div><p>“If we can put our beam there and detect organics in this plume material, that may give us clues to the habitability of subsurface oceans,” Hammel said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So a lot of work is still ahead — but Saturday was a giant leap for a telescope that at times looked like it might never get off the ground.</p></div></div>
<h1>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launches, will open a new window on the cosmos — if everything goes just right</h1>
<h2>The successor to the Hubble must evade 344 potential ‘single point failures’ to achieve its ambitious mission</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Updated Dec. 25 at 1:28 p.m.Originally published Dec. 22, 2021</div></div></div>
<div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope will ascend to orbit in the payload section of an Ariane 5 rocket and unfold to its full size once it reaches orbit.</p></div>
<div><p>The centerpiece of the telescope is a 21-foot-diameter mirror assembly, nearly three times the size of the mirror aboard the Hubble Space Telescope it’s meant to replace.</p></div>
<div><p>Hubble was designed to be delivered to orbit, fully assembled, in the cargo bay of a space shuttle. The assembled Webb telescope would be far too large to be carried by any existing launcher and so must reach space folded.</p></div>
<div><p>The Webb telescope’s sensitive instruments must be kept super-cold to function. The telescope is therefore equipped with a large sun shield.</p></div>
<div><p>Made of silicon and insulating Kapton foil, it shades the telescope not just from the sun’s heat but from the reflected warmth of the Earth and the moon as well.</p></div>
<div><p>The light from distant galaxies will collect in the Webb’s main mirror and then focus on the secondary mirror. The concentrated light will then stream to the telescope’s instrument module to be interpreted.</p></div>
<div><p>The processed images will then stream to Earth via the telescope’s Earth-pointed antenna.</p></div>
<p>NASA actually has an answer to that question: This mission is vulnerable to, and therefore must avoid, 344 potential “single-point failures,” according to an independent review board.</p>
<p>“If I’m not nervous, I’m not realistic,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, head of science at NASA. “This is a complex mission. There is no way of making this simple.”</p>
<p>If something causes a further delay, there will be launch windows every morning, lasting 30 minutes, until Jan. 6, when the moon will cruise into the picture and create a gravitational disruption for a week.</p>
<p>Beyond the shimmying and twirling, the observatory is not fixable. There is nothing that can be yanked out and replaced with something new.</p>
<p>The only exception is fuel. The observatory uses fuel to maneuver and to point at interesting targets. It has enough fuel to operate for roughly 10 years. In theory, it could be refueled with a robotic spacecraft, which would extend the mission.</p>
<p>There is no spaceship that can send astronauts to such a distant place and bring them safely home. To dream up such a mission would be prohibitively costly and risky. It would make more sense to build and launch a new telescope.</p>
<h3>‘As good as it gets’</h3>
<p>But telescopes traditionally have been named after scientists like Hubble. NASA is developing another space telescope named for the pioneering astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, the first female executive at NASA and first chief of astronomy.</p>
<p>But after a review by the agency’s history office, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency found no evidence warranting a name change for the telescope.</p>
<h3>Weddings, funerals and a telescope</h3>
<p>“Arguably, it’s one of the most complex missions NASA’s ever done,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the most protracted. Menzel has been working on the Webb for 24 years. There’s a whole community of people who have put in that kind of generational labor on this telescope.</p>
<p>“We’ve watched our kids grow up, we’ve gone to weddings, we’ve gone to funerals. After 24 years, it would not be incorrect to say we’re an extended family,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>How does a NASA engineer, or scientist, or administrator, or even some astronomer on the far side of the world who is invested in this mission get through the gut-churning anxieties of launch and deployment? By trusting the process.</p>
<p>Everyone has been asking Mather, the senior project scientist, if he’s worried in advance of the launch, according to a NASA blog devoted to the Webb.</p>
<p>But deploying the Webb and making it operational is perhaps a greater challenge.</p>
<p>“We have two months of terror, not seven minutes,” said Grunsfeld,<b> </b>the former NASA science administrator.</p>
<p>Hammel, the astronomer, compares this moment to being in an orchestra in the seconds before a performance.</p>

<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>The death was <a>announced by Caltech</a>, the university in Pasadena, Calif., where Dr. Grubbs was a faculty member for more than 40 years. He had a heart attack after undergoing treatment for lymphoma.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dr. Grubbs built on the work of two other chemists with whom he shared the Nobel: Yves Chauvin of France and Richard R. Schrock of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The $1.3 million prize was split among the three.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 1992, Dr. Grubbs improved the process by demonstrating that another metal, ruthenium, was a more stable catalyst and was easily adapted for use in air, water or alcohol. The catalyst was named for him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was the one who really took what I did and turned it into something truly practical,” Schrock said in 2005, when the Nobel was announced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The discoveries in metathesis allowed for the development of new organic compounds, built through carbon-carbon bonds. The compounds have had wide-ranging uses in medicine, engineering and construction materials.</p></div></div>

<p>Edward O. Wilson, a Harvard naturalist whose mapping of social behavior in ants led him to study social behavior in all organisms and who became one of the greatest naturalists of his generation, died Dec. 26 in Burlington, Mass. He was 92.</p>
<div><div><p>The E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation <a>announced his death</a> but did not provide a cause.</p></div></div>
<p>“Ed Wilson is a magic name to many of us working in the natural world for two reasons,” David Attenborough, naturalist and BBC broadcaster, said in a 2008 PBS “Nova” episode, “Lord of the Ants,” about Dr. Wilson.</p>
<a>“Sociobiology,”</a> which described the role that genetics plays in the social behavior of organisms. The first 25 chapters built his unifying theory of behavior in the animal world, a monumental achievement in itself.
<div><div><p>He later noted in <a>“Naturalist,”</a> his 1994 autobiography, that his was “an exceptionally strong hereditarian position for the 1970s.”</p></div></div>
<a>“On Human Nature,”</a> which won the 1979 Pulitzer for general nonfiction.
<a>“Pheidole in the New World.”</a>
<div><div><h3><div>A boyhood in the woods</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>At 13, after he and his family returned to the vacant lots and dark swamps of the Deep South, he discovered the first known colony of imported fire ants in the United States, <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>, near his home in Mobile, Ala.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Pheromones, he later wrote, were “not just a guidepost, but the entire message.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the competition, which Dr. Wilson said later turned to friendship, accelerated his ambition to discover the common biotic thread in complex societies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The implications of this theory of island biogeography and other studies rippled outward to other fields of inquiry, and Dr. Wilson began making connections among a wide range of species.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By describing the altruistic behavior of sterile ants who work without the payoff of procreation, for example, he theorized their colonies as superorganisms, in which the welfare of the colony is paramount.</p></div></div>
<a>“The Creation.”</a>
<a>National Medal of Science</a> in 1976 for “his pioneering work on the organization of insect societies and the evolution of social behavior among insects and other animals.”
<div><div><p>Dr. Wilson’s wife of 65 years, Irene Kelly Wilson, died in August. Survivors include their daughter, Catherine, according to his foundation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From the grand to the tiny, Dr. Wilson retained his enthusiasm for natural science.</p></div></div>
