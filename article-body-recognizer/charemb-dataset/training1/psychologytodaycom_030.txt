<li>Emotional neglect from childhood teaches people to ignore, minimize, or even be ashamed of their feelings as adults.</li>

<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Lightfield Studios/Adobe Stock Images</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In the life of an adult, emotional neglect from <a>childhood</a> can feel like a cloud hanging over you, coloring your world gray.</p>
<p>But in a child's life, when emotional neglect is actively happening, it can feel like an ordinary, everyday experience.</p>
<p>I know this because I have talked with scores of people who grew up in emotionally neglectful households. I have listened as they describe what they struggle with today, and I have also heard them describe their childhoods.</p>
<h3>What Is Childhood Emotional Neglect?</h3>
<a>trauma</a>. Instead, it’s something that fails to happen for the child, like emotional awareness, emotional validation, and emotional discussion.
<p>How can you know that your parents are supposed to:</p>
<ol><li>Notice that you are feeling something.</li> <li>Make an effort to identify what you are feeling.</li> <li>Show interest and concern about your feelings.</li> <li>Talk with you about your feelings.</li> </ol>
<h3>The Effects of Childhood Emotional Neglect</h3>
<p>Adults who have learned in childhood to block, ignore or minimize their feelings encounter some particular challenges through their adulthoods, all of which can be addressed and changed.</p>
<p>As a psychologist who specializes in childhood emotional neglect, here are a few of the ones I have noticed and helped many clients overcome.</p>
<li>Deep discomfort or awkwardness with the expression of feelings from others or self which may apply to positive or negative feelings or both.</li>
<li>A chronic sense of emptiness or emotional numbness that comes and goes.</li>
<li>A secret belief that they are somehow inexplicably flawed.</li>
<li>A sense of being different from other people in some unnamable way.</li>
<li>A tendency toward <a>guilt</a> and <a>shame</a>.</li>
<li>Lack of understanding of feelings and how they work.</li>
<p>Even if seeing these traits is uncomfortable, there are answers. They can all be changed and there are some very important reasons to do so.</p>
<h3>Why You Need Your Emotions</h3>
<a>fear</a>), and when to protect yourself (hurt or
<p>In the last ten years, the field of <a>neuroscience</a> has exploded with studies identifying the value and power of our emotions, and how we handle them, in shaping our <a>happiness</a>, wellness, and overall life choices.</p>
<p>For example, a 2019 study by Barlow et al. found that anger is linked to increased inflammation in the body, which is known to be associated with many chronic health problems like arthritis, heart disease, and even cancer.</p>

<h3>Three Things You Can Do Now</h3>
<li>Rest assured, you have the power to change this. In fact, many emotionally neglected people have already taken the steps to become more emotionally aware, connected, and enriched.</li>
<li>You can begin by learning more about how childhood emotional neglect happens, how it affects you in adulthood, and how to heal its effects by following this blog or visiting my website for information and helpful resources.</li>
<a>attention</a> to what you are feeling. Once you are regularly paying more attention, you are well-positioned to start learning the emotion skills you’ll need to manage and use them.
<p>The more you learn about childhood emotional neglect, the better armed you are to start reversing it. When you understand what’s wrong you can become curious about your feelings instead of minimizing, avoiding, or rejecting them.</p>
<p>The process of overcoming emotional neglect boils down to giving yourself what your parents could not: emotional attention, validation, and care.</p>

<h1> When and How to Apologize: An Attachment Theory Perspective </h1>
<h2> The ins and outs of what makes an apology work. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Importance of Forgiveness </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>attachment</a> style can have a powerful effect both on your motives and on how you react when you are apologized to.
<p>Attachment styles are highly relevant here because apologizing is a primary strategy that people use to reengage and maintain attachments and connections after there has been a rupture in a relationship.</p>
<a>forgiveness</a>, and reconciliation.
<a>People with secure attachment styles</a> are strong in
<a>empathic</a> attunement, self-awareness, and
<a>emotion regulation</a>—all essential skills needed in negotiating a relationship repair and reconciliation. Thus, securely attached people should be relatively effective in delivering apologies.
<p>Schumann and Orehek (2019) propose that an effective apology communicates concern, a desire to maintain the relationship, and to restore the relationship to how it was before the transgression.</p>
<p>Schumann (2014) suggests that effective apologies are likely to contain the following eight elements (<a>available online here</a>):</p>
<li>Accepting responsibility.</li>
<li>Attempting to repair the damage.</li>
<li>Offering an explanation that does not deflect responsibility.</li>
<li>Promising to behave better in the future.</li>
<li>Acknowledging the harm that was done.</li>
<li>Asking for forgiveness.</li>

<p>Schumann’s (2014) defensive strategies include:</p>
<ol><li>Attempting to justify one’s behavior.</li> <li>Blaming the victim.</li> <li>Making excuses.</li> <li>Minimizing negative effects.</li> <li>Attempting to deny involvement in the offense.</li> </ol>
<a>fearful attachment styles</a> generally want closeness but are too afraid of being hurt to get close enough to other people to get it. They are likely to have been wounded emotionally by those people they depended on most in
<p>In the meantime, keep in mind some common themes:</p>
<li>Do not apologize when doing so could harm the person you are apologizing to or other people. Think it through carefully.</li>
<li>Do not apologize for one thing and bring up your partner's separate transgressions in the next sentence</li>
<li>Do consider your motives for apologizing and recognize the extent to which you are doing this for you or the other person.</li>
<li>Above all, remember that you also are a person who deserves your respect, kind words, and support. Be kind to yourself and honor your own well-being.</li>

<h1> Overcome Anxious Attachment by Becoming Dismissing </h1>
<h2> One way to go from being anxious to secure is through learning to be dismissing. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It is common for me to hear someone with a preoccupied <a>attachment</a> style painfully recount an experience of interpersonal conflict, being rejected or shunned, or ruminating over what other people think of them.</p>
<p>My reply is often: What would a dismissing person do?</p>
<a>coaching</a>) in an assessment of their attachment styles. I also educate them on attachment theory and how people with other styles perceive the world, think, feel, and behave in relationships.
<p>But the thought of having a dismissing reaction can be calming to the preoccupied mind.</p>
<a>apologize</a>, but that just makes things worse, and the person seems even angrier at you.
<p>You go home worried about the repercussions. What if this person stays mad at you forever and tells everyone what a schmuck you are? Your reputation at work will suffer.</p>
<p>At this point, the real dismissing readers are <a>laughing</a>.</p>
<p>The dismissing person would say:</p>
<li>Oh well, then maybe the other person won’t like me.</li>
<li>What I did wasn’t really that bad.</li>
<li>The other person will get over it.</li>
<li>It’s only a job.</li>
<li>It really doesn’t matter.</li>
<li>I already apologized, so it is over. There is nothing else to be done.</li>
<p>The dismissing person would combine this thinking with some dismissing emotion-regulation tools: </p>
<ul><li>Suppress any additional unwanted thoughts.</li> <li>Deny things are really that bad.</li> <li>Detach and ignore their body and any physical discomfort or anxiety sensations.</li> </ul>
<p>Then the dismissing person might:</p>
<ul><li>Distract themselves and get busy on a new project or hobby.</li> <li>Go out and do something fun.</li> <li>Forget about it and go to sleep.</li> </ul>
<p>And no, I am not glamorizing everything about the dismissing style. What I listed here were the adaptive parts that, if used as tools when called for in specific anxiety-provoking situations, could be quite effective.</p>
<p>But when used sparingly, it is nice to know that you have this tool in your toolbox.</p>
<p>So, for those of you with anxious/preoccupied styles, put on your dismissing cloak when you need it.</p>
<p>There is an added bonus: People with dismissing styles do not typically like it when someone who was anxious/preoccupied starts disengaging, doing their own thing, and acting like they don’t care. It makes them anxious.</p>

<a>Attachment</a> theory may hold some of the answers. At its core, attachment theory is a theory of
<p>So, what do we do about this?</p>
<p>1. Do not cheat. If you are really feeling a strong pull to do so, then, by general social standards, there is likely to be a significant problem in your primary relationship that needs to be addressed. You should either address it directly or. . .</p>
<p>2. Leave your primary relationship. If you are going to cheat, then you must take responsibility for potentially facing the consequences. If you know that you will not be able to handle the consequences, refer to number 1 above.</p>
<p>4. Realize that sex does not make everything better. You may have minutes of pleasure, euphoria, comfort, and release in exchange for years of pain.</p>
<a>cheating on</a> you. Also, remember that your emotional system is hypervigilant for signs of danger in the relationship, and you are likely to be a bit paranoid. This will leave you feeling
<a>jealous</a> and insecure. Feeling jealous and insecure may make it more likely that you will be the one to cheat.
<p>7. Slow down your process. Maybe you can tolerate a little <a>loneliness</a> or a little too much closeness from your partner. And if you cannot tolerate it or still feel a need to act out, then consider seeking the help of a couples counselor.</p>
<p>In summary: If you cheated and plan on continuing, then you should probably leave your relationship. If it was a one-time thing that you view as a mistake, consider bearing the weight of your guilt and staying in the relationship.</p>
<p>* There are less-common instances where the preoccupied person may find the experience liberating.</p>

<p>The message here seems to be, “I am going to be angry and punish you until you start behaving more warmly and loving toward me!” Works every time… right?</p>
<p>Stop trying and give up!</p>
<p>And, no; I do not mean give up on your relationship.</p>
<p>What I mean is that you will gain control by giving up control.</p>
<p>It is what psychologists refer to as a dialectic… a seemingly incompatible contradiction of ideas that actually works.</p>
<p>Ironically, the best chance that the anxious person has of getting their partner to get closer and be more loving is, after being very clear about the kind of relationship they want, to stop asking for love and closeness.</p>
<p>No, I am not suggesting that anxiously attached people live their lives in a state of <a>chronic pain</a> and deprivation. But I am saying,</p>
<p>Before deciding to leave your partner, first try an extended period of leaving him or her alone.</p>
<p>You might be surprised that you find yourself receiving more warmth and love that way.</p>

<p>Over time, Mike realized that this behavior wasn’t really getting him what he wanted either. He loved his wife and didn’t like feeling that she was angry and mad at him all the time.</p>
<p>Allowing change without forcing it is not that hard, but you do need to be conscious and intentional about it.</p>
<p>While you are controlling your body and remaining present, or while you are releasing your partner to their own needs and space, you must practice remembering, and being, your best self.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you felt self-assured, calm and confident? It may have been right before you got into this last <a>romantic relationship</a>. Try to be that person and realize that you can feel that way with or without your spouse.</p>
<p>P.S. These same concepts can be used in your difficult relationships at work too. Now, go practice!</p>
