<h1>2021 was the year of electrified trucks</h1>
<h2>Battery-powered trucks are the next big thing</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>2021 was the year of electrified trucks</a></h4> <p>Electrified trucks were the big thing in 2021 and the power shift is set to continue next year, Fox News Autos Editor Gary Gastelu reports.</p></div></div>
<p>From the <a>Tesla Model S Plaid</a> to the <a>Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> and <a>Lucid Air</a>, electric cars were all the talk of 2021, but electrified trucks were the really big thing.</p>
<p>Several automakers launched hybrid, plug-in <a>hybrid</a> and fully electric models to improve the efficiency and performance of their largest vehicles.</p>
<a>Maverick Hybrid</a>, a compact pickup that gets 37 mpg and starts at $21,490, making it the lowest-priced Ford, pickup and hybrid vehicle on sale today.
<a>Wrangler 392</a> arrived with 475 hp and 475 lb-ft and an old-school 14 mpg fuel economy rating to go with it.
<div> <div><p> The Jeep Wrangler 4xe became the best-selling plug-in hybrid in the U.S. (Jeep)</p></div></div>
<p>But it was American startup Rivian that was first to market with an all-electric truck. Its R1T midsize pickup packs a four-motor, all-wheel-drive system with over 800 hp and the ability to tackle the toughest terrain.</p>
<p>Close behind was the monstrous GMC Hummer EV that resurrected the classic brand name on an electric pickup with 1,000 horsepower and a four-wheel steering system that lets it drive diagonally for added maneuverability.</p>
<p>And there’s much more to come in 2022, when Ford rolls out the F-150 Lighting that’s set to become the first all-electric version of America’s best-selling vehicle when it goes on sale in the spring.</p>

<h1>Here's why a SpaceX astronaut bought a Ford instead of a Tesla</h1>
<h2>Geoscientist said it was a practical purchase</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Fox News Autos test drive: 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E</a></h4> <p>The 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E is the automaker's first purpose-built electric car and a very different kind of pony. Fox News Autos Editor Gary Gastelu reports.</p></div></div>
<p>Sian Proctor made history in September she became the first <a>Back female pilot of a spacecraft during a SpaceX</a> mission, but she won't be flying around on Earth in one of Elon Musk's Teslas.</p>
<div> <div><p> Sian Proctor was ferried to the launch pad in a Tesla Model X. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>She explained the choice wasn't meant as a slight at the owner of SpaceX, but mostly due to practical concerns.</p>
<p>She added that the lower base price and $7,500 tax credit the Mustang Mach-E qualifies for, along with its availability, sealed the deal.</p>
<div> <div><p> Sian Proctor was a candidate to become a NASA astronaut in 2009. (Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for TIME Studios and Known)</p></div></div>
<p>"The overall feel and ergonomics is important and I loved my test drive but availability, tax credit, and overall final price where the three biggest factors," Proctor tweeted.</p>
<p>"You can only order a new Tesla. There aren’t any in stock."</p>
<p>Due to its massive sales over the past decade, Tesla has exhausted its allotment of federal tax credits, while Ford has yet to reach the 200,000-vehicle limit that triggers the phase-out of the incentive.</p>
<p>The T<a>esla Model Y currently starts at $60,190</a> while the base Ford Mustang Mach-E is $37,495 after the credit is deducted.</p>
<p>Proctor also made it clear that Ford did not give her the car as a promotional stunt.</p>
<p>"I fully purchased it. I’m flattered that everyone thinks someone, Tesla or Ford, would give me a car. Of course I’d totally take it if they did!"</p>
<p>Musk has not yet commented on Proctor's car, but Ford CEO Jim Farley did congratulate her, posting, "Congrats on your new ride, @DrSianProctor! The Space White was a great choice."</p>

<h1>Restaurant server reveals small tip and bizarre note left by customer in viral TikTok</h1>
<h2>A server at an Applebees in Staten Island apparently received a small tip and a note explaining why</h2>
<p>People take tipping very seriously.</p>
<p>A video revealing the <a>small tip that a waiter</a> received went viral on TikTok and is sparking a debate. According to the footage, the diner who left the <a>tip on the $70 meal</a> wrote a note explaining why they couldn’t leave more money.</p>
<p>A TikTok user named KingJ24__ posted the video, which shows that the diner left a $6.55 tip on a bill of $73.45, which is about an 8% tip. The incident apparently took place at an Applebee's in Staten Island.</p>
<p>It’s customary to tip between 18-20%.</p>
<p>According to the receipt, an 18% tip would have been $12.14, and 20% would have been $13.49.</p>
<p><a>MCDONALD'S WORKER REVEALS 6,400-ITEM ORDER SEEN IN VIRAL TIKTOK WAS PREPARED FOR GEORGIA PRISON</a></p>
<div> <div><p> According to the recent, the incident occurred at an Applebee's in Staten Island. (iStock)</p></div></div>
<p>According to the footage, the customer left a note on the receipt writing, You was[sic] great, holidays are just rough right now." This is followed by a frowning face.</p>
<p>"You can afford $73 and some change to feed yourself but not enough to tip? Don’t eat out if you can’t afford the service," wrote another user who took the server’s side.</p>
<div> <div><p> The video sparked a debate about tipping and whether the waiter was right to complain or not. (iStock)</p></div></div>
<p>Other users, however, complained about the concept of tipping in general. One commenter replied, "Ban tipping. Make businesses pay their employees. Why do customers have to pay both the business and the employee?"</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the original video belongs to the TikTok user who uploaded it. The name on the receipt reads, "Dana."</p>
<p>At most restaurants, servers are paid primarily through tips, and often have to share those tips with other workers (bus people, bartenders and possibly kitchen staff).</p>
<p>Applebees did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.</p>

<h2>Natalie Carter went from weighing 282 pounds to 164 pounds in just 11 months</h2>
<p>A woman was inspired to <a>lose 118 pounds</a> this year after she took a picture wearing holiday-themed pajamas last Christmas.</p>
<p><a>WOMAN LOSES 150 POUNDS AFTER REGAINING 188 POUNDS SHE LOST 10 YEARS AGO</a></p>
<p>"Last Christmas was the nail in the coffin for me," she said. "I tried desperately to enjoy my time with my family, but I was dying inside."</p>

<div> <div><p> Carter said that when she saw the photo (pictured), she was "absolutely mortified," so earlier this year she started walking every day and joined The 1:1 Diet program. (SWNS) </p></div></div>
<p>"Christmas is a time to make memories, but I didn’t want to remember feeling so low," she added. "I just knew I couldn’t have another Christmas feeling like that. I was entering the year I’d turn 40, and I’d had enough."</p>

<p>According to SWNS, Carter stopped grazing on junk food and started following a meal plan with The 1:1 Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan. </p>
<p>"It was really hard," Carter said. "But I wrote down all the reasons why I was unhappy with my weight, and whenever I had a craving for my favorite foods like pizza or chocolate, I would read the list back to myself."</p>
<div> <div><p> When she started her weight loss journey, Carter weighed about 282 pounds. (SWNS) </p></div></div>

<p>"I felt on top of the world," Carter said. "For the first time in a long time, I was in control of food and food was not in control of me. I was losing physical weight, but I was also losing mental fog."</p>
<p>Eleven months after she started, Carter lost about 118 pounds, going from 282 pounds to 164 pounds.</p>
<p>"I feel so much better physically and mentally," Carter said, adding: "It’s literally changed my life."</p>

<p>"It’s become my passion," she said. "I want to help others get themselves out of the dark place that I was in and give them the confidence to feel amazing."</p>
<p>After she lost 118 pounds, Carter said she was excited to celebrate the holidays this year. </p>
<p>"Looking back at last year, I can’t believe how much has changed," Carter said. </p>
<p>She added: "I definitely won’t be shying away from the camera this year, and I can’t wait to have happy memories to look back on."</p>

<h1>Rooftop Revelations: Pastors discuss how nihilism is destroying a generation</h1>
<h2>Pastor Gil Monrose says of failed inner-city education, 'You’re setting up young people to fail'</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a>Chicago</a>. He was not alone; a fellow
<a>pastor</a> named Gil Monrose had flown in from Brooklyn to spend the night on the same roof as a show of support.
<p>No stranger to violence, Monrose heads The GodSquad, a faith-based organization in <a>Brooklyn</a> that relies on clergy to lessen tensions within the community and to act as a liaison between its people and the police.</p>
<p><a><u>ELI STEELE: WORKING AMERICAN FIGHTS PANDEMIC, SUPPLY CHAIN AND INFLATION TO KEEP BUSINESS ALIVE</u></a></p>
<p>"If you have schools that are failing, if you have schools training up young men to read at a third grade level … that’s a problem. It’s a failure, you’re setting up young people for failure," Monrose said.</p>
<p>Many of these men have lost their way "because they’re not seeing within themselves that they can be something," Monrose continued. "We are raising a generation who themselves don’t believe they should be alive, and that's a problem."</p>
<p>"That’s a problem," he said. "I mean, anytime you start having young men who think ‘I’m not gonna live past 21, so what difference does it make?’ that's something that we need to deal with as a culture."</p>
<p>If a person believes that society is against them and their own life is meaningless, then what value does another life hold?</p>
<p>Brooks asked Monrose to discuss what he has called "fake culture" and the role it plays in escalating violence.</p>
<p>"That’s fake culture," said Monrose. The belief "you can kill someone for something that you did not work for or something that is not yours, and that you’ll get away, it’s a false reality."</p>
<p>"Young people need to understand that what you see on social media, that’s not real life," Monrose said. "If you’re gonna have a lifestyle that is gonna cause you to die, then that lifestyle is not worth dying for."</p>

<h1>At least 16 cities see record homicides in 2021</h1>
<h2>Several cities reached new records last year only to surpass those marks in 2021</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Biden needs to get tough now on crime: Gianno Caldwell</a></h4> <p>Fox News political analyst speaks out on Democratic policies behind the nationwide crime wave on ‘Your World.’</p></div></div>
<p>It's a trend police departments have noted from East Coast to West, even as other violent crimes such as aggravated assault and non-violent crimes such as burglary decline in the same areas.</p>
<p>"It's definitely worse this year, for us at least," Rochester Police Department Public Information Officer Carlos Alvarado told Fox News Digital of the upstate New York city's homicide numbers for 2021.</p>

<p>Rochester had seen a record 80 homicide deaths in 2021 as of Tuesday. The city's previous record was 69 in 1991, Alvarado said, adding that the number will "easily" be higher than 80 before the new year.</p>
<p><a>12 MAJOR DEM-CONTROLLED CITIES BREAK HOMICIDE RECORDS FOLLOWING HISTORICALLY BLOODY 2020</a></p>

<p>Homicides in 2021: At least 150.</p>
<p>Previous record: 145 in 2020.</p>

<h1>The 10 worst fact checks of 2021, and why they matter</h1>
<h2>When the arbiters of truth fell short</h2>
<p>2021 marked another year of brazenly slanted media coverage, and the "<a>fact-checking</a>" industry, who've long cast themselves as impartial arbiters of truth, was no exception.</p>
<p>Critics say fact checks have become "fetishized" in the mainstream press as more declarative of the truth than a traditional news report, with eye-catching ratings like PolitiFact's "Pants On Fire" or the Washington Post's "Four Pinocchios." </p>
<p><a><u>MEDIA HIT FOR ‘SOPHOMORIC AND RIDICULOUS' TAKE ON BIDEN'S TRAVEL BAN AFTER CALLING TRUMP'S RESTRICTIONS RACIST</u></a></p>
<p>Without further ado, here's a roundup of the worst fact checks and related blunders of 2021.</p>
<p>Fact-checkers ‘suddenly’ flip on the Wuhan lab-leak theory</p>
<a><u>reported</u></a> in February 2020 that
<a><u>Sen. Tom Cotton</u></a>, R-Ark., had "repeated a
<a><u>fringe theory</u></a> suggesting that the ongoing spread of a coronavirus is connected to research in the disease-ravaged epicenter of Wuhan, China."
<p><a>MEDIA FACT CHECKERS CITED WUHAN LAB-LINKED SCIENTIST TO DISCREDIT THEORY</a></p>
<a>emerged </a>revealing that Daszak's group had funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab through government grants, although Daszak had earlier claimed he had no conflicts of interest while strongly denying the lab-leak theory.
<p>Cruz, referencing the Washington Post's "Pinocchio" scale for defining the severity of falsehoods, gave the Post four clown emojis for its "fact-checking" mishap.</p>
<p>The fact-check has been updated, with the note, "in recent months <a><u>new evidence</u></a> has tipped the lab leak theory onto firmer ground." A new Post fact-check declared the theory was "suddenly" credible.</p>
<p><a>Fox News Digital previously reported</a> some reporters acknowledged their initial dismissal of the theory was due to some Republicans like Cotton and Donald Trump espousing it. </p>
<p>Daniel Funke authored the fact check to address the outrage among the families of the fallen, who alleged they witnessed Biden check his watch multiple times as caskets of their loved ones were rolled onto the tarmac at Dover Air Force Base.</p>
<p><a>USA TODAY FACT CHECKER SLAMMED FOR ‘PLAYING THE VICTIM’ AFTER FALSE REPORTING ON BIDEN'S WATCH BLUNDER</a></p>
<p>Critics blasted USA Today for suggesting that the Gold Star families had lied. The next day, USA Today issued a correction. </p>
<div> <div><p> (Twitter)</p></div></div>
<p>Kamala Harris and the not-so-empty stockpile</p>
<a><u>Axios</u></a> drew criticism in February after it deleted a tweet fact-checking
<a><u>Vice President Kamala Harris</u></a>, who repeated the debunked claim that the Biden administration was "starting from scratch" with its
<a><u>coronavirus</u></a> vaccine rollout.
<p>Harris insisted in an interview with <a><u>Axios co-founder Mike Allen</u></a><u> </u>that the Trump administration had left Biden "no stockpile … of vaccines" or a "national strategy for vaccinations."</p>
<p>"In many ways, we're starting from scratch on something that's been raging for almost an entire year," Harris said at the time.</p>
<p>Axios shared that exchange but included a comment by White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, disputing the claim.</p>
<p>AXIOS DELETES TWEET FACT CHECKING KAMALA HARRIS</p>
<p>"We certainly are not starting from scratch because there is activity going on in the distribution," Fauci said in an earlier press briefing. </p>
<p>That Axios tweet, however, was later deleted, leading to questions among eagle-eyed Twitter users. Axios did reshare the clip of Harris' exchange with Allen, but removed Fauci's comments that contradict the vice president's claim.</p>
<p>CNN blames conservatives for questioning false ivermectin story</p>
<a><u>Daniel Dale</u></a> was slammed as
<a>"very obviously a rank partisan"</a> for taking the "conservatives pounded" approach after multiple mainstream outlets were fooled by a false story that some Oklahoma hospitals were overwhelmed with patients having overdosed on the drug
<p><a>DANIEL DALE SLAMMED FOR REACTION TO FALSE IVERMECTIN STORY</a></p>
<p>The collapse of the Lafayette Square narrative</p>
<a><u>media narrative</u></a> with CNN fact-checker approval went belly-up again in June when an Inspector General report found former President Donald Trump did not have
<a><u>Lafayette Square forcefully cleared</u></a> of protesters, so he could pose in front of a church last year.
<p><a>COLLAPSED LAFAYETTE NARRATIVE IS JUST ANOTHER FACT CHECK GONE WRONG</a></p>
<p>CNN's Jim Acosta, now the network's "domestic correspondent" <a>after leaving</a> the White House beat when Biden took office, <a>suggested</a> the Inspector General report was tainted by pro-Trump political bias.</p>
<p>HuffPost called ‘stupid liars’ after accusing Cruz of lying about court-packing</p>
<p>The Huffington Post was savaged in April as "stupid liars" for claiming Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had lied about Republicans never engaging in so-called "court-packing" when they controlled the White House and Congress.</p>
<p><a>HUFFPOST SLAMMED AS ‘PROPAGANDA,’ ‘STUPID LIARS’ FOR CLAIMING REPUBLICANS ‘ENGAGED IN COURT PACKING’</a></p>
<p>After Cruz's office and critics erupted, HuffPost deleted its original tweet but reposted the same video.</p>
<p>Joe and Kamala's change of heart</p>
<p><a>PolitiFact</a> was accused of shielding <a>President Biden</a> and <a>Vice President Harris</a> from criticism over their past rhetoric expressing distrust in the <a>coronavirus</a> <a>vaccine</a> during the <a>Trump</a> administration. </p>
<p><a>POLITIFACT DECLARES CLAIM BIDEN, HARRIS DISTRUSTED VACCINE ‘FALSE’ DESPITE PAST RHETORIC </a></p>
<p>Biden repeatedly indicated only if there was enough "transparency" would he take the vaccine and that the "American people should not have confidence" in the vaccine developed by the Trump administration if his concerns weren't addressed. </p>
<p>"We rate the video False," PolitiFact declared. </p>
<p>Jacob Blake's pocket knife</p>
<a><u>USA Today fact-check</u></a> declaring the notion he brandished a knife before the shooting "false."
<p><a>MEDIA PUSHED FALSE JACOB BLAKE NARRATIVE THAT HE WAS UNARMED</a></p>
<div> <div><p> The Justice Department said it will not charge Kenosha police Officer Rusten Sheskey in the shooting of Jacob Blake. (AP)</p></div></div>
<p>A ‘hit job' on Sen. Tim Scott </p>

<a><u> the Republican Party’s response</u></a> to Biden's speech to a joint session of
<p><a>NPR GIVES KESSLER 8 MINUTES TO DEFEND PIECE ON SEN. TIM SCOTT'S ANCESTORS</a></p>
<a>claimed </a>his critics "twisted" the article to make it sound more sinister.
<p>Kyle Rittenhouse's gun charge</p>
<p><a><u>PolitiFact</u></a> was roasted in November for a poorly aged "fact-check" claiming <a><u>Kyle Rittenhouse</u></a>'s firearm possession was illegal. </p>
<p>Judge Bruce Schroeder tossed the sixth charge against the 18-year-old for having a dangerous weapon as a minor after prosecutors conceded Rittenhouse’s rifle was not short-barreled as the law has a carve-out for such weapons. </p>

<p>"Is that true? State laws suggest not," PolitiFact's <a><u>Daniel Funke</u></a>, now with USA Today, wrote at the time.</p>
<p>Critics railed against PolitiFact for publishing false information in the wake of the shootings. </p>
<p>"This fact check was always wrong, but now that the weapons charge has been dropped it's officially PANTS ON FIRE," Mark Hemingway <a><u>reacted</u></a>. </p>

<h1>2021's biggest and wildest weather moments</h1>
<h2>Biggest weather stories of 2021</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Ida floodwaters burst through New Jersey basement</a></h4> <p>A Cranford mother and her son are briefly trapped after their basement wall is suddenly breached by flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida</p></div></div>
<p>This year was a chaotic and deadly one for weather, with major storms and <a>flooding</a> impacting states from coast to coast, while a new wildfire record was set in California. </p>
<p>Here are five of the biggest <a>weather</a> stories of 2021: </p>
<p>1. Hurricane Ida wreaks havoc on the U.S. </p>
<p>Stunning images and stories emerged in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana on Aug. 29 as a Category 4 storm before its remnants drenched the Northeast, killing dozens across its path. </p>
<a>images showed caskets near damaged homes</a> after they were washed away from cemeteries by floodwaters. In one part of the state, a video posted on social media captured a group of men
<a>rescuing a cow</a> that became stranded in a tree.
<div> <div><p> A displaced casket that floated from a cemetery during flooding from Hurricane Ida sits among displaced marsh grass and ruin in Ironton, La., on Sept. 27. (AP)</p></div></div>
<p>Farther north, another video showed the moment floodwaters caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida burst through the basement wall of a New Jersey home. </p>
<p>In images captured by a Cranford family's security camera, the family's teenage son can be seen walking moments before the floodwaters trapped him and his mother inside their basement. </p>
<p><a>HURRICANE IDA DEATH TOLL RISES TO AT LEAST 66 NATIONWIDE AS RECOVERY EFFORTS CONTINUE</a></p>
<p>Others living in basement apartments were killed in the New York City area as a result of the storm. </p>
<p>The New York Police Department posted footage online of an officer <a>trying to get into a flooded basement in the Queens borough</a>. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately when specialized units arrived, they found three people died from drowning," the department said. </p>
<p>2. Dixie Fire becomes largest single wildfire in California history </p>
<p>California's Dixie Fire broke records this year by becoming the largest single wildfire in state history. </p>
<p>The sprawling blaze, which burned 963,309 acres in Northern California, started on July 13 and was finally contained on Oct. 25, according to <a>Cal Fire</a>. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 buildings were destroyed as crews fought to contain the flames, the Associated Press also reported. </p>

<p>DIXIE FIRE BECOMES LARGEST SINGLE WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY</p>
<p>Many consider Dixie the <a>biggest single-source fire in state history</a> because 2020's massive 1,032,648-acre August Complex was a "complex fire," made up of lightning-sparked blazes. </p>
<p>3. Winter storm shuts off power for millions in Texas </p>
<p>A mid-February winter storm knocked out power for more than 4 million people in Texas, leaving residents struggling to find warmth amid frigid temperatures. </p>
<p>The blast of wintry weather was blamed for at least 100 deaths, according to the <a>Associated Press.</a> </p>

<p>The weather also <a>jeopardized drinking water systems</a>. About 13 million Texans — or nearly half the state's approximately 29 million residents – were <a>placed under an advisory</a> to boil drinking water, according to reports. </p>
<p>In November, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott <a>promised residents in the Lone Star state</a> that the "lights will stay on" this winter. </p>

<p>Asked by Fox 7 for his thoughts and confidence about the power grid, Abbott said he is "very confident" as he "signed almost a dozen laws that make the power grid more effective." </p>
<p>Severe weather tears through nation’s midsection </p>
<p>A December weekend of tornadoes and other severe weather in five states left at least 88 people dead, including 74 in Kentucky, where a tornado destroyed a candle factory in the hard-hit city of Mayfield. </p>
<p>Michael Dossett, the director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management, described the statewide damage as "a massive event, the largest and most devastating in Kentucky’s history." </p>
<p>KENTUCKY'S MISSING TORNADO VICTIMS HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR, GOVERNOR SAYS</p>

<p>And in Missouri, a <a>heartbreaking photo emerged</a> of a 9-year-old girl taking shelter with her two siblings in a home’s bathroom, fifteen minutes before a tornado destroyed the property and killed her, her aunt said. </p>
<p>Heat records broken during a sweltering summer </p>
<a>hottest on record in North America.</a> The average temperature across the contiguous U.S. was 4 degrees above average at 72.6 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

<p>HEAT WAVE CONTINUES ACROSS US</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, Seattle and Portland experienced <a>multiple days of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees</a>, including 109 degrees in Spokane, the <a>highest temperature ever recorded there</a>. </p>

<h1>Biden's most memorable clashes with reporters in 2021</h1>
<h2>Not all the questions Biden gets are about ice cream</h2>
<h4><a>Biden snaps at reporter over question about Putin: 'You're in the wrong business'</a></h4>
<p>President Biden doesn't take kindly to a question at the end of his press conference in Geneva about the results of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p><a>President Biden's ascent</a> to the Oval Office meant the White House-media relationship notably improved over the prior administration, but Biden still had several testy moments with the press corps during his first year in office.</p>
<p>In January, shortly after taking office, Biden was irked at The Associated Press' Zeke Miller when he asked if pushing for 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days was too low a goal.</p>

<p>In June, Biden lashed out at CNN's Kaitlan Collins after she suggested he was confident Russian President Vladimir Putin may change his malign behavior after their summit in Geneva.</p>

<p>Biden, who was walking away from his press conference, whirled around at Collins and said, "I'm not confident he'll change his behavior. What in the hell, what do you do all the time?"</p>
<p>He added Collins was in the "wrong business" if she couldn't understand why their meeting was productive before walking away. Biden later apologized for his outburst, saying he'd been a "wise guy."</p>

<a><u>Denis McDonough's announcement</u></a> that front-line VA workers would be required to get a coronavirus vaccine.
<p>This was the same president who joked about running over a journalist who asked about Israel in May, as he took questions while test-driving a Ford F-150 Lightning.</p>

<p>"In May you made it seem like the vaccine was the ticket to losing the mask forever," Doocy said to Biden, who had already left the podium.</p>

<p>Questions around Afghanistan created another memorable moment in July, when Biden interrupted reporters attempting to ask him about the troop drawdown, declaring that he didn't want to answer any more on the topic because it was a "holiday weekend."</p>
<p>After receiving questions on the nation's security issues and the withdrawal timeline, Biden said he wanted to talk about "happy things" ahead of the 4th of July.</p>

<p>Biden repeatedly refused to take questions that month on Afghanistan, at one point blowing off a reporter at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington when she broached the subject.</p>
<a>declared</a> his opposition to the massive social policy bill.
<p>"I'm not supposed to be having this press conference," Biden finally offered.</p>
<p>As Biden has learned, he's not going to be asked about <a>ice cream</a> every day. </p>
